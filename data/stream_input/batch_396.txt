B0001IN07Q|4.0|This second release by Warner Bros/Reprise Records &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;, featuring Michael Buble is a definite winner ~ the CD (audio) is good, but not like the previous release ~ but it's the DVD that saves the day!<br />Only through the format of video (DVD) and live does Mr. Buble really shine ~ his stage presence is awesome ~ Buble's power over the audience is simply mystifying ~ he is a cross between James Dean and Elvis Presley in appearance, but has the style and ability of Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin ~ he is completely at ease with an audience and comes across very sincere with his on camera interviews.<br />Although some of the tunes were on his first album &quot;Michael Buble&quot;, the arrangements are completely different, a more zestful performance ~ after performing &quot;CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE&quot;(new song/studio), &quot;COME FLY WITH ME&quot;, &quot;FEVER&quot;, &quot;FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE&quot;,&quot;HOW DO YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART&quot;, &quot;KISSING A FOOL&quot;, &quot;MACK THE KNIFE&quot;(new song/live), &quot;MOONDANCE&quot;, &quot;MY FUNNY VALENTINE(new song/live), &quot;NICE 'N EASY&quot;(new song/studio), &quot;SWAY&quot;, &quot;THAT'S ALL&quot;, &quot;THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT&quot;, &quot;YOU'LL NEVER KNOW&quot;(new song/live),  it's like second nature for this young man ~ his natural ability to vocalize and be a crowd pleaser is pure magic.<br />The camera work between color to black and white while editing various concerts is amazing ~ entertainment at its finest hour - although a collectible collection, the echo background on &quot;MACK THE KNIFE&quot;(audio/CD) is a little too much ~ other than that the two stand outs on the CD is &quot;NICE 'N EASY&quot; and &quot;CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE&quot;, shows why Buble has the the stuff stars are made of, he's the hottest property in the genre of &quot;Standards&quot; today...gotta love it!<br />Total: CD &amp; DVD ~ Warner Brothers 48683 ~ (3/30/2004)
B00004Z4WR|2.0|A waste of great talent is probably the most honest thing I can say about this flick.<br />Jolie is Academy Award material and she hardly does anything in this movie.  Gage is a master, this movie was a waste of what he's capable of doing, but I guess he's a good draw.  I actually saw this at the theater when it came out and a second time recently.  There are cool cars and some cool chase scenes, so it's not that it isn't entertaining, it's just that I was expecting a lot more.
B00009V7P8|5.0|As you wade through the depths of Damien's sorrow and scorn you find yourself in a wonderful place, where you can be cut by love lost and still stand to love again. Damien writes his lyrics with pure emotion and his words strike us all in a way that stings but he echoes a comforting message that life goes on and though we may hurt we always have time to mend our wounds. O is one of the best albums I have heard in some time and the story it tells is personal but universal and the composition is a beautiful mix of instrumental and vocal harmony that will haunt you. We need in our lives to have more people that can write music with such soul.  Sometimes when life has broken us we need an Eskimo friend to get us back on our feet. I hope you give this one a chance.
B00008EYA5|2.0|This movie had promise, at least I thought from the preview, but I was pretty much disappointed.  It lacked originality beyond what the preview offered, a guy offering some millions of dollars to anyone that could get him out of prison.<br />I will give it a bit of praise in the action/adventure part, it certainly wasn't boring, and in fact, I've actually watched it twice, however, because of all the problems I just can't bring myself to call it average, so I'll stay with the two star review.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you've never heard someone say &quot;OMG&quot; (oh my god) before, this is probably the best opportunity you will have to hear it first!  Wow.  Wicked is the BEST.  Both leads, Chenoweth and Menzel have pure, widely ranged voices and such talent.  Stephen Schwartz got very lucky! Kiristin Chenoweth's (Glinda the Good) pure and charming voice is unbelivable.  Her solo song &quot;Popular&quot; and her part in &quot;Thank Goodness&quot; are two of her best.  Idina Menzel (the Wicked Witch of the West) is definitely the highlight.  She has a strong, and clear voice which really sells her.  Menzel, (in my opinion) has better songs that Chenoweth.  Some such as &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; &quot;As Long As You're Mine&quot; and &quot;No Good Deed&quot; are incredible.  However, there is one way to beat Chenoweth and Menzel's seperate songs.  Chenoweth and Menzel's duets!!  &quot;Loathing&quot; &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and &quot;For Good&quot; and simply mind-blowing.  These 8 listed songs (and &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot; and &quot;One Short Day&quot;) are the better ones on this CD, but to pick a favorite, I must say &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is simply the best.<BR>I listen to this cd in every bit of my spare time, and you will too.  If you've seen the show or not, it's still a must have.  You definitely won't be disappointed.<BR>    It's simply, magic.
B000089CJI|5.0|Remember back when there were actually a few bands that wrote creative pop music that could tell an interesting story in a subtle, nuanced way without clubbing you over the head like you were an idiot? Then remember over time how everything became more and more bland, obvious and insipid? Well Postal Service is trying to bring back pop that means something. Crafting literate, catchy songs with witty lyrics and melodic hooks is their specialty.<br />The most obvious hit and main single is &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;; the melody and vocals seem to soar and lift you which is appropriate given the title - it's quite an achievement to actually make the feel of a song match the lyrical content. I know everyone gets tired of comparisons, but this really reminds me of some of the excellent work of the late 80's, early 90's act The Lightning Seeds (similar to the songs &quot;Pure&quot;, &quot;The Nearly Man&quot; and &quot;Joy&quot;). Other great tunes are &quot;Clark Gable&quot;, the leadoff track &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; and &quot;Nothing Better&quot;. One more that I have to call out is &quot;This Place Is a Prison&quot;, a brilliant minimal song featuring stark, honest lyrics matched with sparse atmosphere. I always appreciate when a band can strip a song down this much and create something interesting.<br />There are a couple of duds. Mainly the contrived &quot;Sleeping In&quot; which feels forced and pretentious - strange because otherwise those adjectives don't fit the band at all. Still don't let these fleeting bland moments ruin an overall wonderful experience.<br />There is a good chance that 'Give Up' will win over those who may not normally listen to electronic music.

0385336810|5.0|I'm sure there's at least one thing about you no one else knows, am I right? Everybody keeps secrets and most of them are way too embarrasing to talk about. But imagine there's one person in the world who gets to know every little thing about you, and worse still, this someone is you boss! Well, that's what Emma, the main character in the book goes through and as much as I sympathize with her, let me tell, it's hilarious! Shopie Kinsella does it again and will make you laugh out loud. Just don't read it in public or everyone will get to know you snort while laughing and no one wants little secrets like this out there, right?
B000001E18|1.0|Easily the worst piece of work U2 have ever done. Even if you're a big fan of this group, I wouldn't recommend this cd. This just proves that big stars like U2 can make horrible records. I regret buying this album. Sad to say.
0060589272|4.0|Paulo Coelho's title refers to what his protagonist Maria discovers about the sexual act:  it takes only eleven minutes on average to complete and yet people are obsessed with it.  The novel begins in Brazil, where young Maria suffers her first unrequited loves and determines that she will never bare her heart again.  When an accidental meeting on a Rio beach offers Maria an Swiss adventure, she leaves her Brazilian life behind.  Once in Geneva, she becomes a prostitute by night and a consumer of books and facts by day.  What Maria learns as she explores both the darkest and the most mundane recesses of desire seems to confirm what she has believed all along, that eleven minutes of pleasure is hardly worth the effort.  However, when she meets two extraordinarily different gentlemen who take her to unexpected places within herself, the truth of these eleven minutes is challenged.<br />The novel begins like a fairy tale - &quot;Once upon a time, there was a prostitute named Maria&quot; - and this opening sentence unfortunately sets a cold, impersonal tone that takes Coelho several chapters to overcome.  Although the language retains this removed simplicity throughout, Maria's predicament gradually engages the reader as Maria takes a more active and personal role in the story.  Maria, it is clear, is not an &quot;average&quot; prostitute - if there can be such a person - and her unique perspective forms the soul of ELEVEN MINUTES.  Her ambition and curiosity distinguish her from not only her colleagues but from everyone else in Geneva.<br />At times the intellectual discussions of desire and love can get tedious, as Coelho is at his best in the midst of scenes and description, but overall this novel is a lively &quot;fairy tale&quot; with a prostitute as its unlikely heroine.  As Coelho notes in his Afterword, the thematic thrust of the novel came to him well before the protagonist and her story, and it shows.  Readers who want a strong story and intimate characterization should look elsewhere, since Maria's adventures and discoveries are carefully folded into the novel's concept. Others, though, will find Coelho's newest novel an intriguing exploration of not only those important eleven minutes but also everything that leads up to them.ation should look elsewhere, since Maria's adventures and discoveries are carefully folded into the novel's concept.

B0001IN07Q|3.0|With only 8 tracks on the CD, I feel a little cheated. To make matters worse, most of the tracks are from his first disc. The DVD is much better, however I could have done without the banter during and after the live performances. The ladies should love this one as Mr. Buble often peers deeply into the camera. He seems to be as much about himself as he is about his music, unlike Norah Jones or Diana Krall who are all about the music. If you are a Buble fanatic, you must rush out and buy this. If you are a casual fan, you can wait for the next studio release.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I have been waiting years for this album to be remastered and re-released.  It's still an album ahead of it's time (at least Lindsey Buckingham's songs).  A hint of what was to come peeked out on 'The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac'.  The sound quality is great - and I am glad the original album still holds up (the original cd version doesn't).  I've been listening to this music since the original 1979 release date and I am sure I can hear things now that I never could before (some backing vocals on &quot;Honey Hi&quot;).  Buckingham's music really stands out sonically (&quot;I Know I'm Not Wrong&quot;, &quot;Ledge&quot;).  But Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie have their moments.<br />The second disk of outtakes, demos and unreleased is nice - but not essential.  You get a glimpse into what Buckingham can do production and arrangement-wise.  The bass and drum lines on &quot;One More Time (Over &amp; Over) are great and stand out here vs the originally released version.  It's nice to see how editing a piece of music not only doesn't compromise the song, but enhances it (&quot;Sara&quot;).  At first I thought I wanted to hear &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; in its entirety and original arrangement.  I was wrong.  Buckingham did an incredible job w/Nicks' song.  It's also nice to hear the cover of the Beach Boys' &quot;Farmer's Daughter&quot;.  Almost completely identical to the version on &quot;Fleetwood Mac Live&quot;, but still good.<br />It's also nice to see the original album art included w/the cd.  It definitely loses something from lp to cd - but whatta gonna do?<br />My original review gave the music 5 stars and the sound quality 3.5.  I'm happy to say this is now a solid 5!
0812550706|5.0|My 9th grade English teacher for an upcoming book report first introduced me to this book. It was by far the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I think that it may be classified as a Science Fiction book, but to me the book includes a lot of other aspects of storytelling. It had drama, it had comedy, and everything in between. Orson Scott Card could not have delivered the story any better, expressing that it's extremely difficult to work under extreme conditions.<BR>The story takes place in the future, where aliens (referred to as Bugger's in the book) have invaded earth twice now, and is planning a third visit to wipe out the human race completely. Now I know when first hearing this it seems as if the book would have this sort of Star Wars kind of feel to it, but there is more to it than meets the eye. The story follows a young boy named Ender, who is actually a genius (and a very humble one at that.) He as well as many other `child geniuses' is drafted into the military to train to become commanders. Their training unsurprisingly represents `games' in which teams of children battle to be first in the standings. The future of the human race lies in their hands, but it may be too much for Ender to handle.
B00009RAJI|5.0|When &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot; was released, my friend Rebecca said, &quot;Isn't that 'Rumours'?&quot;  It was funny...and not altogether untrue.  I like much of their other music, but all but two songs of &quot;Rumours&quot; appear on the 'best of' collection.<br />Quality went into the making of the music and the original album release, but not the original compact disk version.  Originally this album was rushed out for cd release w/out any regard to sound quality.  Almost 20 yrs later the sound has finally been upgraded w/the release of this remaster.<br />As pop/rock music goes, there is little that matches, let alone surpasses &quot;Rumours'.  It is almost perfect in its conception through execution.  Three songwriters w/varying styles that blend together in almost every song.  And one great production team. It's still a classic disk - and almost 30 years old!!<br />The harmonies are great (&quot;The Chain&quot; and the completely underrated &quot;I Don't Want to Know&quot;) and the simplicity of &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; really add to the hits of the disk.  Musically they hit all their marks (except for the fact that I constantly skip over &quot;Don't Stop&quot;).<br />Disk two of outtakes, demos and unreleased stuff is an ok addition - but nothing I'll be going back to time and again, if ever.  Nicks, for supposedly being a 'prolific' songwriter, is still using material to this day she wrote/demo'd 30 yrs ago (&quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;).<br />Hindsight is 20/20 - and the versions of the songs they didn't use (&quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;) shows how on the mark they were w/the choices the band did make.  (Though the demo version of the same song shows what a force an acoustic show could have been.).  The stripped down versions of &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; show how much additional work went into making them classics.  Also, it shows what a good producer Jimmy Iovine turned out to be - making Nicks' almost unlistenable demo of &quot;Think About It&quot; tolerable on 'Bella Donna'.<br />The five star rating I'm giving is for disk one.aking Nicks' almost unlistenable demo of &quot;Think About It&quot; tolerable on 'Bella Donna'. <br />The five star rating I'm giving is for disk one.

B00000634J|4.0|This is an excellent collection of John Lennon solo works, although not much different than the previously issued &quot;John Lennon Collection.&quot;<br />On this set, we get the primal scream therapy of &quot;Mother&quot; which spawned a future's worth of &quot;angry at the parents&quot; songs, but this one is deep from the gut. There's also the classic &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; and the posthumously released &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot; and &quot;Borrowed Time.&quot;<br />This collection showcases Lennon's songwriting gifts, many with deceptively simple arrangements, but deeper messages. &quot;Imagine&quot; is a beautiful meditation of ideas that dares to challenge our belief systems. &quot;Instant Karma&quot; features some great drumming and shows Lennon having some fun. The previously mentioned &quot;Mother&quot; has a steady drum/bass rhythm punctuated by simple piano chords and makes excellent use of instrumental silence to focus on the vocals.<br />&quot;Jealous Guy&quot; has a lush arrangement, with beautiful piano lines complimented by &quot;strings&quot; and one of my favorite basslines of John's solo work. The vocal sounds thin, but Lennon pulls it off by singing with emotion.<br />Throughout this collection, we get the dual nature of John Lennon, with the ethereal &quot;Imagine,&quot; &quot;Mind Games&quot; and &quot;#9 Dream&quot; balanced with rockers like &quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Night&quot; and &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; and peace anthems &quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot; His cover of &quot;Stand By Me&quot; pays homage to the songs he loved in his youth.<br />Fast forward to the Double Fantasy cuts, and we get the powerhouse quartet of &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over,&quot; &quot;Woman,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Boy,&quot; and &quot;Watching the Wheels.&quot; For some reason, &quot;Losing You&quot; was left out here. After a layoff of five years, to come back with such a demonstration of growth was incredible.

0375713751|5.0|Incredibly funny, clever.  Filled with sarcastic humor that might seem too sharp for some but was thrilling to me.  Thank you Ms. Pearson for some of the most enchanting moments I have had reading a book in years.  Recommend to working moms, those who are on the verge of becoming a working mom and those on a the other side from working moms.
B000002UCN|3.0|I gave this disk three stars not for the content, but for the packaging and presentation. There are truly some first rate tracks here, with \\"Something,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" But, while these were penned by George, they are Beatle tracks. (...) Over half the tracks were on Beatles albums, so it kind of diminishes the \\"Best of...\\" aspect. Again, don't get me wrong, I love the jangle and harmony of \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and the social jibes at English economics on \\"Taxman.\\"<br />George's post-Beatles output steps up on tracks 8-13. \\"My Sweet Lord\\" may have that Phil Spector over-produced sheen, but it's lush and spiritual and has stood the test of time, plagiarism litigation notwithstanding.<br />\\"Give Me Love\\" is a simpler arrangement, featuring George's smooth slide guitar, a little nod to Bob Dylan with the piano melody, and lyrics sung from the heart.<br />\\"Bangla Desh\\" stands as George's movement into social activism.<br />\\"What is Life\\" from \\"All Things Must Pass\\" has a catchy Motown like rhythm and melody and cool fuzz guitar, along with more lush harmonies.<br />It's a nice collection and an economical introduction to the music of George Harrison, but there are better examples of his solo work, such as the best of set \\"Dark Horse Years.\\" Perhaps someday a more comprehensive career retrospective will be released.
B000068FWC|1.0|I have over 2000 CDs in my collection, and I'm always thrilled to discover remastered versions of CDs that I dearly love. I've generally found remastered versions to at least offer a slight improvement to the sound, but this release is different. It is the first remaster I've purchased to make the sound worse - much worse. The sound is harsh, brittle, and very compressed. Fortunately I also have a Mobile Fidelity copy, but I was hoping for an improvement over that with all of the major advances in mastering technology that have occurred over the last several years. If you have a typical audio system, and are just interested in casual listening, it won't be a problem - just turn down the treble. But if you have spent a considerable amount of money on your system, and you seek out improved versions of CDs you already own, this isn't your bus.
B0001AP12G|3.0|This was a highly anticipated album, but when I listenend to it for the first time, I wasn't impressed. The best songs on the album is &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, All Falls Down&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;. There are other cuts on the album that are fairly good too, but not as good as the 3 I just mentioned.<br />I will say that I do like Kanye's style which is very original. His style as a producer is very original and impressive, I will say. <br />Listening to his album it seems immature or maybe its just on the light-hearted side. It doesn't sound like it's for over 18 and up, just about 18 to maybe 25.
B000002N25|4.0|I didn't like \\"Golden Heart\\" much when I first heard it. I'm accustomed to Knopfler's clean and sharp stratocaster guitar work, but there's too little of that on this CD.  Instead, he had a \\"muddy\\" distorted sound on most tracks. You might never know you were listening to one of the world's best guitar players.  Moreover, the other instruments seem often jumbled and intrusive, especially on \\"Cannibals,\\" a touching song with an irresistible zydeco beat -- but the drums are too loud.     Over time, I got used to the CD and now it rates among my favorites. The good songs -- and they're very good -- on this CD are the folksy, non-rockers. Perhaps the best is \\"Done with Bonaparte,\\" a history lesson by accordion and whistles; Je Suis Desole is a tender tale of lovers parting; the title track is good; and \\"A Night in Summer Long Ago\\" is a craggy love song with a 14th century sound. There's a wonderful guitar solo to close \\"Je Suis Desole.\\"  The uptempo rock songs on the CD don't measure up to Knopfler's best work with Dire Straits.     The verdict: A bit of shock for this Dire Straits fan because Knopfler's guitar didn't sound much like Knopfler, but the quality of the song eventually overcame my skepticism. It took a while to grow on me.        Smallchief
B0001IN0DA|1.0|I don't know what others think, but in my opinion the WWE has been going downhill for many years. I mean the amount of build up for the matches at Wrestlemania XX was slowly diminished as the matches began. c'mon, lesnar and goldberg was pathetic and kane and undertaker was a joke. Barely any of the matches lived up to expectations.  How in the hell is Eddy Guerrero still champion. There is no way that eddy guerrero or benoit can carry the company like austin or hogan did in the past.  Wrestlemania was once an event where legends like Bret Hart, Hogan, Macho Man performed in classics that are remembered to this day. Unless you truly enjoyed the event, it would be better to just rent the dvd.  Hopefully vince will one day release the previous wrestlemanias on dvd.
0385504209|5.0|I never would have picked this book to read, but after seeing the clear split of those who hated the book and those that loved it and why, I bought it. That it has stirred such controversy is interesting, particularly since the ideas the author presents have been around for a very long time. Some readers appear to be deeply offended by the storyline.  All the better I say, makes you think doesn't it?  Whether you choose to believe or even consider the validity of the storyline, if you enjoy a thought provoking book the DaVinci Code is a must read!
B00005NGAL|2.0|Bah! Humbug. Did not enjoy this it all. Far too much dancing. Songs mutiliated by singer's interpretations. The music was interfered with too much as well. Why could they not leave well enough alone? A waste of money buying this DVD - well for me anyway. Deuteronomy's voice had no gravitas - too light a singer for this role. What happened to Growltiger? The only one I enjoyed was, of course, Elaine Paige, and even then sometimes...  Maybe I am overly critical, being used to the original cast. Yeah Brian Blessed.<br />Just my opinion after all.

B000066NW0|2.0|This CD is rather dumb as I word it. The songs are very boring, you'd probably spend most of your time skipping through the tracks trying to find at least a good song. None of the other songs sound like complicated. The other songs all sound like country/pop like a more edgy version of Shania Twain of some sort. The lyrics are very childish something that everybody could write themselves. The songs aren't something you could actually bang your head to (if you want to that is). To sum this up just think of Faith Hill with a horrible voice with the southern sounding theme. It sounds just like what Avril said after she denied that she called it punk, she called it New Country &lt;~~ and that's exactly what it is.
078322933X|5.0|Maybe it's derivative, but FEAR packs a punch due to the expert direction of James Foley and the dead-on performances of Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen.  Nice girl Reese (beautiful and a marvelously talented actress) goes along with pal Alyssa Milano to a club where she catches the eye of hunky David McCall (Wahlberg, in a chilling and good performance).  Of course, once she finds herself falling for him, she sees a violent and darker side as he attacks her best friend and pushes her in the face.  David, being the charming psychopath he is, manages to patch things up, and then things really start firing up.  Petersen's father is a devoted, family man, who truly loves his daughter.  When he realizes Wahlberg is not the Prince Charming he appears to be, he warns him to stay away from his daughter.  But Wahlberg won't take no for an answer, so he rallies up his drug-dealing friends and attacks the home of Reese and her family.  A tense, nerve wracking ending with powerful performances.<br />A guilty, but enjoyable, pleasure, showing that Wahlberg has more than a buff body to credit his success.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|I give this a 1 because 0 isn't an option. I liked their first single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&quot; better the first time I heard it, when it was called &quot;Lust for Life.&quot; The rest of the album pretty much falls into that crappy new (though strangely unoriginal) style being populated by the Strokes, White Stripes, Rooney, etc. Boy I can't wait til three years from now when the people who buy these albums are gonna be thinking &quot;Wow, I had horrible taste back then.&quot; Please pass on this album. It has no value other than you could use the disc to make an art project like in that AOL commercial and use the case as a coaster. I recommend this for any of the artists listed above.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|A film about two ugly Americans who find themselves &quot;stuck&quot; in a foreign land. Instead of exploring and enjoying the city and its surroundings, they stay cooped up in their hotel rooms, counting the hours till they day they will be released from this hell. Why? Because nobody speaks English there and they can't understand anything and they have no-one to talk to. So what can they do? They phone home and whine. And then they whine even more because the people at home got tired of listening to their whining and hung up on them.<br />So then what? So they sit in the lounge of the hotel and drink and mope. And mope, mope and mope. And then they spot each other. HEY! A white face! Woohoo! Oh, what relief! He'll understand English! Of course, he's White!<br />Groovy. So now they have someone to commiserate with. Oh, what joy it is to finally find someone who understands just how horrible it is to be stuck in this miserable hell for one whole week, where everything is Japanese. So they hatch their &quot;escape plan&quot;. Escape what? All this -ugh!- un-American-ness!<br />So they &quot;escape&quot; out of their hotel prison. She decides to visit a friend. Oh, she has a friend there? And she only visits him as a last resort? What a lovely friend she makes! The two pass through a video arcade and she stares at the people there and the &quot;strange&quot; things they do. They sit spellbound in front of gambling machines. Weird! Some dance to the games, some play guitar. Weird! They then go karaoke-ing with a bunch of locals. They are all drunk and sing out of tune. Sigh... So what is a nice white girl to do but to take the mic herself and show these stupid Japanese people just what good singing really means!<br />There is always much to do and see in a foreign land. But all these two could see was how things did NOT work the way they're used to and people did NOT speak English the way they're used to. And they don't like that, oh no. How un-American this place is!If only Japan would be just like America! Then perhaps they could actually enjoy their time there!<br />The whole 1.5 hours is all about watching two very bored and miserable people. If Ms. Coppola was trying to convey boredom and misery, then well done. But can it be called entertainment? If you're bored on a Saturday night and are looking for an antidote, you'd do good to look elsewhere.<br />The film makes fun of the weird things that the Japanese do, like idolizing Hollywood movie stars (how weird!), their strange habits and social customs like always being polite and ever-smiling (ugh!), their asinine tv game shows (how could they do such stupid things on national tv?), their penchant for old reruns (what poor taste!), their inability to pronounce &quot;r&quot; (how un-American!), and their inability to speak English fluently (how totally un-American!), among other things.<br />If I were Japanese, I would have been deeply insulted. If I were American, I would have been so ashamed.

B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I'd give the album 5 stars, but, does it really take 2 years to put out a second album?  Come on...  Anyway, the album is pretty consistent the whole way through, but has a completely different sound from the raw first album.  First, the Strokes have gone 80's with this album showing their &quot;Cars&quot; influence.  It's interesting to see the way they mold their style with others.  Can't really complain about any of the tracks because they're all fairly well done.  &quot;Meet Me In The Bathroom&quot; sounds 10 times better in the studio than a bootlegged live version from the early days.  It's also neat to hear Julian answer criticism with the line, &quot;I don't want to change the world,&quot; from &quot;Under Control.&quot;  That's what it sounds like to me anyway.  Other hight point tunes include &quot;The End Has No End,&quot; which has an awesome breakdown and &quot;The Way It Is,&quot; that has a unique solo that seems like it should've been played on a sitar.  All in all, a great effort that took extemely too long to occur.  I just hope the next album doesn't take 5 years!

0425170349|1.0|My main question is where the heck is this guy's editor? Besides the unrealistic plot, mindless one-dimensional characters, and tired cliches, the most irritating aspects of this book are the errors and constant repetition that a little proofreading (or even a spellchecker) might have caught. <br />Thank goodness I got this from a library instead of a store; when I pay for a book I like it to be completed, not a rough draft. A competant editor could have cut almost half the material out and possibly brought the story up from painfully bad to merely mediocre...but a competent author wouldn't have spent 900 pages writing this drivel in the first place.<br />I also found a lot of the stereotypes to be ridiculous. Vegans and enviromentalists (oh my bad, &quot;tree-huggers&quot;) are all either idiots or fanatics who want to wipe out the human race. Riiiight. And my rating isn't politically motivated; I consider myself to be pretty conservative, but Clancy just looks foaming-at-the-mouth insane with his constant tirades. (and using your characters as a mouthpiece for your views is bad form in any case.)     <br />Also, as many reviewers have already pointed out, summer in the U.S. is WINTER in Australia. You'd think if he was using it for a major plot point (insofar as Rainbow Six can be said to have a plot) he'd do a little basic research first.
B00009XITP|1.0|This movie was terrible. I felt like the plot was very dry and the acting was absolutly pitiful. Amanda Bynes is cute but she was overly annoying and her character was just irritating and it was hard to emotionally connect with her. The little Cinderella-like plot twists were just boring and have been done over and over again. I also thought that the \\"wicked stepmother to be and stepsister to be\\" should have gotten more of a public humiliation because they were so rude and It made me so mad that Amanda Bynes didn't tell anyone that her stepmother locked her in a room during the party. That was just stupid and any normal human being would have been freaking out about it. Also, What is happening to Kelly Preston? She is NOT a bad actress, but she always seems to get stuck in these TERRIBLE roles! She needs a new agent!<br /><br />Overall I felt like I was watching a made for tv movie on the lifetime network. This was just awful. Not worth renting and certainly not worth buying! If you are bored and it comes on tv sometime then maybe check it out but you will probably be bored out of your mind and feel the same way I do in the end...
0804102988|5.0|The Romans conquered England but couldn't conquer the Scots!<br />Sarum is the Roman name given to the English town of Salisbury.  This book is a historical novel, told much in the same way as Michener's The Source.  The characters are fictional, the history true. The story begins with how Britain became populated at the dawn of prehistory, how it became an island.  The story ends in the twentieth century with the 404 ft spire, (tallest in Britain), of Salisbury Cathedral lying in near ruin.  In between those events, is the story of stonehenge which is proximal to the modern town.  This book is a great primer of British history, especially for someone like me who has an interest in european history but has never been schooled in it.  I read this book nearly two decades ago, but it has somehow been filed away in my subconscious all those years.  Possibly, given the popularity of the book when it was published in 1987, Prince Charles raised the millions of pounds sterling to repair Salisbury Cathedral.  The author was born and raised there, christened in the cathedral.<br />The emperor Hadrian ordered a wall to be built in 122-123 A.D. to keep the barbarians, those wild, unruly Scots out!  Hadrian's wall roughly approximates the present border of Scotland and England.  Jesus's apostle, St. Andrew, has at least some of his bones in Scotland today.  St. Rule was in charge of these relics in Patras, Greece where St. Andrew was crucified on a diagonal cross.  (Where St. Andrew's is located today roughly approximates where St. Rule landed in Scotland).  He had disobeyed an order of Constantine to bring them to Constantinople because he had been warned in a dream by an angel to bring them to the farthest reaches of the known world, which in 300-340 A.D. was Scotland.  The modern Scottish flag has been around as early as 1200 A.D.; it depicts the white diagonal cross, St. Andrew's cross, on a blue background which represents the color of the sky the day St. Andrew died.  That's not in this book, but it's my favorite Scottish, true, story!  One that you need to know too!t's not in this book, but it's my favorite Scottish, true, story!  One that you need to know too!
B0000TLA9G|3.0|It would be hard to believe that Universal/Geffen's attempt to release this collection was be the cause for a lawsuit from Slash and Axl Rose (for once on the same side of the lawsuit), but it should be of little surprise for those of you who know the self-destructive history of this band. Turmoil has been a constant since this band got together and their infighting, addictions, and egos destroyed what was once one of the most powerful forces in rock history.<br /><br />Listening to the vast majority of the songs on this collection, I was reminded how many great songs they put out in such a short period. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine,&quot; &quot;Patience,&quot; &quot;Paradise City,&quot; &quot;Don't Cry,&quot; and the magnificent &quot;November Rain&quot; are enough reason to buy this release. I've also always liked their cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" and got a kick of their version of the classic \\"Since I Don't Have You.\\"<br />There are many singles and great songs that charted which are not included in this collection. I would have liked to see &quot;Nightrain,&quot; &quot;Estranged,&quot; &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; &quot;Mr. Brownstone,&quot; and &quot;Used to Love Her, among others, but in all fairness to Geffen the CD clocks at almost 80 minutes and it does reflect the band's \\"greatest hits.\\" Notwithstanding I've never been a fan of their version of \\"Live And Let Die\\" and think that their take on the Rolling Stones' &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is downright embarrassing.<br /><br />This collection delivers what it promises but it left me feeling like I wanted a collection of their best and not necessarily their greatest hits as the final product is just OK and earns 3 stars. While the packaging is weak and there are no liner notes to speak of, Geffen/Universal should be commended for their continued efforts to live up to their promise of keeping new releases at affordable prices. The week that this CD came out it sold for as little as $7.99, and most retailers are currently selling it for as low as $9.99 and no higher than $12.99sold for as little as $7.99, and most retailers are currently selling it for as low as $9.99 and no higher than $12.99
B00005JLXE|4.0|i give daredevil three and stars, but the bonus disc and extras earn it four stars. the movie isn't bad and the extras make it even better. the way daredevil went from vigilante to hero in the movie is a plus. why would a mask just instantly make somebody super moral? it was great that the movie dealt with that and had the hero evolve instead of just putting on the mask and being an upstanding do gooder. not a bad movie.
6305428050|4.0|This is an 80's classic!  I have always loved this movie...and I was pretty shocked when I found out that Anthony Rapp...aka Mark in RENT is in it!  That was soo cool, especially since I liked his character alot.  If you've never seen this movie, you should check it out, but if you're going to buy it, unless it's to add to your DVD collection, I'd stick with VHS.
0385504209|5.0|This is a great fiction book, for those who see it as just that, fiction. It takes you on a quest for the Holy Grail, which , in the book, turns out to be the quest for the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, though symbology in DaVinci's work, among others. If you follow it as a work of fiction, you will be amazed by the possibilities. If you take it as &quot;truth&quot; then you might feel betrayed by what you thought you knew. I recommend you do not try to change history through this book. I'm sure a lot of historians will agree. This book will keep you going until the last minute; couldn't put it down! I definitely recommend it.
B0001611DI|2.0|The fans of this movie led me to believe this movie is the cat's meow but what i saw left me unhappy. The movie is very slow paced there is no real tension of the zombies because they are so slow you can out run them. And the acting is really bad is it intentional or not?  The movie just dragged, later on they introduce the biker gang and it felt almost comical to see these guys attack the zombies. The zombies are not at all scary when you can slap them and throw pies in their faces the zombies are patethic monsters the gore is pretty good with a few scenes that stand out but nothing i havent seen done better elsewhere. I saw the new remake of this flick and i prefer it 100 times better over this flaming turd of a movie if slumbering dead people terrify you go ahead look at it i prefer my zombies running at me! This movie looks like it was made by film students with a decent budget.  Bottom line this movie is good if your a fan of Romero's work, and if you want to see where todays zombie movie get their inspiration from. but nothing more. Critics give him to much credit for this movie, zombies as consumers, oh ok i get it...lame.  Tom savini did some great gore effects but the make up effects on this were lame. I'm going to sell my copy of this movie and wait for a really good nail biter... the dawn of the dead remake. The original movie probably scared your parents, but it wont scare a jaded young audience.
B00009RAJI|5.0|Now that these masterpieces have been restored to at least a semblance of their original glory, it is time for a LONG overdue, respectful remastering of that  OTHER Fleetwood Mac's MASTERWORK, &quot;Then Play On,&quot; which, despite the multitudinous pleasures of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours,&quot; is STILL my favourite!!
B00009W0U4|1.0|This movie SUCKS. I think that when a movie synopsis says explicit sex, that they should probably specify whether the sex is gay or straight. Watching badly filmed gay sex for an hour or more is really not my cup of tea. But that's not the worst of it. I want to know what the cameraman was on, cause if he didn't walk into a few walls during the filming of this movie (and I use the term loosely) then he must have been doing better than things would have seemed. The entire first half of the movie is like being bounced around in a hamster ball. You can't tell which way is up. I don't know whose bright idea it was to start at the end and work backwards, but the concept fell way short of clever. I was expecting something like \\"Swordfish\\". You know, how they show the big explosion and then tell you what leads up to it. NO, this film literally started at the end and progressed backwards. What was the point anyway. It just seemed like someones poor attempt at originality. Using a story line without any artistic redemption what so ever. So if you're thinking of buying it, BACK OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!
0743442539|4.0|What is to be said about John Le Carré's THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD?  It's shockingly entertaining, it's genuinely unpredictable, and it doesn't offer up a cheap get-out-of-jail-free ending.  The characters are cursory without being shallow, the plot moves with amazing speed, and the action keeps bouncing along.  In short, this is pretty much the perfect spy novel.  As engrossing as it is realistic, and as absorbing as it is intriguing.<br />SPY is a book based almost entirely around its plot, and while I usually give a storyline summary in my reviews, I don't think I'll be doing that this time.  You see, the novel relies so much upon its double-crosses and back-stabbings that even the parts in the beginning (which are usually fair game for reviewers to spoil) can be puzzling and fun to follow.  Every part of the story is interesting.  Where other novels would still be setting up the premise, SPY has already started playing the game.<br />Apart from the deviously clever plot, there is one additional thing I want to single out for praise -- the relationship that takes place between two of the main characters.  On paper, it's a fairly standard idea: an older male spy paired with a younger, idealistic, innocent woman.  But in execution it's a very nicely unstated bit of romance.  It felt real, in part because Le Carré didn't beat us over the head with the details, merely sketched in the broader strokes and let the reader's imagination do the rest.<br />SPY isn't a story where the characters trade artificially witty banter in between their death-defying action sequences.  The protagonist spends most of the book tired, battered and confused.  It can be a mystery at times guessing whether he really knows what's going on, whether he is the chess-player or the pawn.  When one of the book's villains tries to engage him in a verbal battle over whose society and philosophy is the superior, he can only grumble and offer insults in reply.  It's this sort of likable realism that makes the book the success that it is.  At the time he wrote this, Le Carré had already joined and left Her Majesty's Secret Service, so I can't help but wonder if the plot, which seems intricate and elaborate in a fictional context, was actually a straightforward retelling of a standard spy-game.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I have no idea why these people below me have wasted their breath to hate on Duran Duran. There are ways to be tactful and discuss an album, even if you DON'T like it. Saying that it sucks, but with nothing to back it up isn't helping anyone!!! :(<br />Back to DD. This album is amazing. Truly. The fans know it-Who can deny 'Notorious' for example? Great keyboarding, and a great hook, this song is one of the best Duran Duran songs ever in my opinion.<br />OTHER GREAT TRACKS (all of the songs are stellar, but I don't want to go on and on!!!)<br />-AMERICAN SCIENCE-this song is great. The song starts out with some horns blaring, and a slow creeping shuffling sound. My favorite part of the song is more towards the center where a great guitar riff takes place. This song is one of the best on the album.<br />-SKIN TRADE-a DD classic in my opinion. Skin Trade is very different than other DD material IMO. Skin Trade is laid back sounding-lots of brass and horns.<br />-A MATTER OF FEELING-slower, sensitive sounding, very nice, I don't listen to this one as much as other more uptempos, so I don't have alot to say, but it is good!<br />-HOLD ME-good midtempo song. I usually skip this one to get to..<br />-VERTIGO (DO THE DEMOLITION)-Sexy, midtempo song, one of my favorite DD songs of all time!<br />-MEET EL PRESIDENTE-one of the best DD songs out there! Lots of bongo drums, and horn sections. I love the 12\\" version of MEP better than the album version, but both are very good. MEP has alot of percussion by way of bongo and hand drums, and lots of trumpets and also some female backup singers! GREATTTTT!<br />Honestly,this record is amazing. I would not give it away for any price, that is for sure. DD has been making great music for a very long time, and with this album, they went in a decidedly funkier direction with awesome results!!!-james
B0000CAQ27|3.0|Many of these reviews mention how this album is not as good as Mizunderstood and they're right.  I agree, I still listen to that CD all the time,  more than I do Try This.  Pink still deserve a lot of credit though because she's not pumping out the same stuff over and over and over and... you get the point.  I do like this album on it's own though, don't get me wrong, but the most important thing is that Pink is good enough that she can afford to experiment.  <BR>From what I've seen so far, I'm sure I'll be along for every album.  She doesn't have  the strongest voice in the industry, but that can said of so many artists today who don't have half as much talent as she does.  She is talented, she is creative and she keeps growing and THAT'S what makes an artist.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I, not too much of a Josh Groban fan, had a listen of this CD.  It wasn't bad at all, but I still hold the belief he is a bit over rated.  His voice doesn't sound so great on his songs in English, where his voice sounds great in Italian.  He is most definitely not as good as the Australian baritone, Anthony Warlow.  His voice just isn't as powerful or as mature.  I would reccommend Anthony Warlow if you liked this album.
0786880708|5.0|I was introduced to this book while learning Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder. I have found this book to be extremely practical, friendly and understandable for those who may have difficulty reading this genre of book.

I am using these practical 'tips' in my clinical practice and find that my clients seem to enjoy learning new mindfulness techniques.
0743454529|5.0|Thirteen year old Anna Fitzgerald knows why she was born in vitro with a near perfect genetic match so that her body can serve as spare parts to keep her older sister Kate alive ever since her sibling was diagnosed with leukemia.  As Kate suffered numerous relapses, Anna's platelets, bone marrow, and umbilical cord stem cells have been used to keep the older sister alive.<br />Their parents Sara and Brian demand that Anna donate a kidney to Kate. As her older brother Jesse turns to arson over his frustrations with his family's motto of Kate only, Anna has grown tired of being a harvest.  She hires attorney Campbell Alexander to represent her in court in an attempt to get a judgment stopping her parents from using her body anymore.  Sara, who is obsessed with keeping her beloved Kate alive at all costs, feels betrayed by her youngest child while her husband understands the immense pressure on his youngest daughter.  Anna wants to help Kate because she loves her sister, but knows that it must be her decision not a mom who sees her as a biological feeder mechanism.<br />MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a reflective deep look at a family in crisis due to a long term health problem of one of the members.  The story line is at its best when Jodi Picoult inspires readers to ponder intense philosophical questions on right and wrong that would turn Ayn Rand's head spinning in moral dilemmas.  Though the melodramatic ending is too neat a wrap-up even with a twist, readers who appreciate a novel that provides a profundity that few tales possess will want to peruse this thought provoking drama.<br />Harriet Klausner
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I'd been talking to my friends last Friday about how Clapton is such a good guitarist but flat refuses to play anymore. His recent songs like Tears In Heaven et al. really doesn't do it for me. &quot;This is why they call him Slow Hand,&quot; I said. &quot;He's just plain boring since Cream.&quot; Well for everyone else out there who gave up on the man, I have news: He's baaaaaack! This wonderful album is like a breath of fresh air. It's a damn good listen from the first song to the last. I have been enjoying Robert Johnson for a few years now and Clapton does all of these tunes proud. He's obviously enjoying making this music, like he'd enjoy a fine meal. The band backs him with solid playing and musical cohesion. And the atmosphere...The whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a small house on the banks of the Mississippi with bullfrogs croaking and wooden floors creaking. If you don't like this album, you probably don't care for the blues. But if you do, then you're in for a real treat. Run to the music store as if there were a Hellhound On Your Trail!
B00001OH7P|5.0|In the early 1970s, the time was right for something magnificent. David Bowie released his masterpiece &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.&quot; This is probably the best concept album ever made, with the fictional Ziggy coming to earth to bring the gospel of rock n' roll.  Ziggy gains fame and lives the perils of a rockstar only to burnout in the end. The album statrs with the calm but haunting &quot;Five Years&quot; and is followed by such classics like &quot;Starman&quot; and &quot;Moonage Daydream.&quot;  Bowie got lost in the persona of Ziggy, having a difficult time telling the difference between the character and himself.  This is truly one of the greatest albums ever and stands the test of time. It should be listened to as a whole as it tells a story of Ziggy and the Spiders from Mars. I like the similiarities that album has with A Clockwork Orange. Kubrick's film adaption of Burgess's classic book was a big inspiration for the album. Listen and enjoy.
B000099T2L|1.0|Beyonce.... Get back with your group and stay there.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|The only artist that tops Sarah McLachlan is, unfortunately, Sarah McLachlan. Like the other reviewers said, although this CD is quite good, her others are far far better. However, &quot;Fallen&quot; is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard, and the CD is worth buying just for that one track. The rest of it, eh. Which is why Fumbling and Surfacing are much better CDs overall.<BR>Still, S.M. remains one of my favorite artists, and I'm sure I'll listen to the CD on repeat for days on end.

0345457684|5.0|Terrific hard SF.  A very well written, well laid-out story.  Certainly a lot of fun.  With so much drivel being churned out (even William Gibson is, now, a little disappointing) this is a great little gem. Enjoy!
6305181810|4.0|The story line of John Grisham's Rainmaker comes to screen life through the creative genius of Coppola, and unlike some of his films which are far from where I live, such as The Godfather (although very truistic), this film is one I can relate to and which could touch the life of many of us.<br />Matt Damon's character, Rudy Baylor, is believable and represents the heart of many young men and women who start their law practice with high ideals, moral values and integrity.  His quiet wisdom holds up well when pitted with the arrogance of a Leo Drummond-type lawyer, a man whose moral and ethical values were leeched from him long ago.    <br />Although there is light foul language, it is refreshing to see a film where one does not have to wince constantly from the onslaught of gutter language and unclothed people!<br />Danny Glover walked the high moral ground in this film as well and gave a stunning performance as always.<br />I was delighted to see the incomparable Teresa Wright as Miss Birdie, (catch her in \\"Mrs Miniver\\" starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon from the B&W WWII movie years, what a treasure!)  She played the part to perfection, \\"cut, cut, cut.\\"<br />Claire Danes, an excellent actress for one so young, played the part of an abused young woman to a \\"T\\" with the low-key type  personality so prevalent in one who has been cowed into submission way too many times.  With an abusive childhood himself, Rudy had to save her.  (Loved Danes in Les Miserables and Little Women!)<br />Mary Kay Place always shines, but her portrayal of a mom whose son is dying needlessly touches my mother's heart.<br />Funny Danny Devito, funny...<br />I give the Rainmaker high marks! If you like real life movies, watch this or you could be Great Benefit's next victim.<br />(Interesting that in the video tape version, there is no mention of Danny Glover in any of the credits!)
B00008AWOG|5.0|This album is a must for any true metal fan. It is a brilliant piece of work from start to finish. Its a mixture of heavy guitar riffs, progressive aspects and great lyrics infused into a beautiful story. The cd starts out with a stong force with the moor and soon slows down with the beautiful song benighted and quickly picks up with moonlapse vertigo. Face of Melinda and Serentity painted death are also great tracks, you wont regret buying this album or any opeth albums for that matter. Another great cd from a great band.
B000066NW0|2.0|This was such a disappointing album. The only song I liked was the hit &quot;Complicated.&quot; The rest of it sounded like everything else you hear. Just generic and boring. My husband and I listened all the way through and as soon as it was done we both laughed and said - sell it!
B00000DGUG|5.0|16,000,000:3,000,000<br />The latter is the sales of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. The former, Jagged Little Pill. It's sad when America prefers loud angry music lashing out every which way over an album that is TRUE ART. Alanis got a lot of influence from her visit to India. I think the trip did her good. It was obvious that the record company would give Alanis free reign to do as she pleased, but I am happy that they let her have this artistic freedom. This album is her best, as well as one of the best albums, period...<br />FRONT ROW: My favorite song on this album, as well as a fan favorite. Such intricate lyrics could only work when Alanis sings them.<br />BABA: One might wonder what Alanis' label boss Madonna thought of this song, in which Alanis criticizes the West's fascination with Eastern mysticism. A good rock song.<br />THANK U: We've all heard this. No amount of overplay could make me hate this song. No Alanis, thank U for making a classic song. <br />ARE YOU STILL MAD: Alanis steps back and realizes she may have not been the perfect girlfriend. This song employs the repetitive vocals that will appear on several songs here. A good song.<br />SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER: Her voice quivers with fear on this excellent song. Emotional and physical abuse are covered on this disturbing track.<br />THAT I WOULD BE GOOD: You'll want to hug Alanis after hearing this song, in which she convinces a guy that she's good no matter what. By the end, you realize she's convincing herself of this too. Simple yet great.<br />THE COUCH: Wow. This song is like therapy with Alanis. No chorus, hook, or bridge, yet it's nearly perfect. <br />CAN'T NOT: Another strong song. The repetition is used here, but to the song's advantage. Worth a listen or a million. <br />UR: A light track, in which the famous harmonica makes an appearance. Kind of like 'Ironic,' which was a superior song, but still great.<br />I WAS HOPING: Don't get to comfortable with the last song, because this isa VERY dark song. I DO crack up when she complains about a condescending waiter. \\"There were days when I could have said 'Hey dude I could buy this place so kiss it.'\\"<br />ONE: Another introspective and reconciliatory song, but the music is dark and gloomy. <br />WOULD NOT COME: I giggled at the lyrics \\"I'd have an orgasm but it would not come.\\" I'm immature. In fact, this is a VERY good song. The 'it' in reference is, in my opinion, respect.<br />UNSENT: 5 letters. Unsent. To 5 boyfriends. An amazing song.<br />SO PURE: Some call this a guilty pleasure. I say it's great. After all the gloom, this is a nice release from that. A dance track.<br />JOINING YOU: The most disturbing track on the album. Also one of the best. As she tries to convince a friend not to commit suicide, you sense something personal behind it. <br />HEART OF THE HOUSE: A loving tribute to her mother. Her voice changes a lot here, but you can just sense the love she feels.<br />YOUR CONGRATULATIONS: All she wants is to please whoever she's singing to! Another song that makes you want to hug her afterwards.<br />My favorites are...well, I don't want to list them ALL. I anxiously await the release of So-Called Chaos, and I love all her albums, but the intricacy, personal issues, and pure magic on this album will never be topped. This is her best. It deserved to sell 30 million instead of 3 million.
B000000Y27|5.0|All jazz fans, especially jazz guitar fans, should have this album in their collection. This recording highlights Montgomery's sweet tone and lyrical phrasing, and after one listen it is easy to see how his playing influenced legions of guitarists. He is one of the giants of jazz, and he may be the greatest jazz guitarist of all time. If nothing else he is certainly in the jazz guitar pantheon that includes Joe Pass, Kenny Burrell and Charlie Christian -- and this is his finest album.

B000003N7K|5.0|I love &quot;A love supreme&quot;, but I can understand how some people find that one and even perhaps &quot;My Favourite Things&quot; kinda hard to get and artsy-fartsy. This one here, on the other hand, serves it straight and smooth. Standards, great playing, great vocals. That's that.
0812550706|4.0|Although a bit predictable at times, this was a very enjoyable read. I don't read too many Sci-Fi novels, but this one had been on my read list for some time. Ender is a great character and I'm anxious to read more in Card's Ender series. This book is appropriate for all ages (minor language stuff is all). It is easy to read and comprehend.
055357342X|5.0|What most readers want to know is simply &quot;Is this book worth my time?&quot;  At over 1100 pages (paperback), it does seem daunting and leaves one wondering how much the author can delve into these characters and plotlines without falling into the asinine, pointless, verbosity that has afflicted Robert Jordan (just because it's 1000 pages does NOT make it engaging!).  The answer to that question is an emphatic YES!  The pace is quick; small things happen rapidly, while the overall story rolls ahead like a tidal wave.  Reading this book is like watching a living chess board.  The reader feels the character's conflicts, sympathizes and empathizes.  This novel is great!  I'm left wanting more!
B000002LND|5.0|This album came out almost 15 years ago and contains some songs over 20 years old--- but even the dullest tunes here outshine 99.99% of what's on the radio today.  (And luckily most of these tunes are still on the radio.)  These 73 minutes of annoyingly catchy pop music are worth listening again to even though all the tunes are already lodged in your brain: these seem like simple little cheesy pop tunes, but they are very richly detailed.  <br />You could argue that some of the songs that were left out of this CD are preferable to some of the ones which are included.  (There are songs I would love to swap for &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot;, and I wish they did a better job of re-mastering &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot; both of which sound pretty tinny in the mixes used here, though these mixes do admittedly accurately reflect the sound of pop music in the early 1980s.)<br />But this is a good one-CD collection.  And one of these days, she will get around to issuing a boxed set--- I predict it will come out before Christmas 2005, just in time for her 25th anniversary.
6304806426|5.0|I like this movie a lot, but if you are someone who does not have much patience, maybe it's not for you.
0316286850|4.0|With this book, you get introduced to makeup and how it works. Then, you get information on what to use it with and how to apply it, featuring illustrated guides and photo shoot examples. Kevin basically lets you know just about everything that can be done with the complexion, eyebrows, eyes, eyelashes, cheeks and lips.<br />Some of the instruction is advanced - for example, it explains how to cover your eyebrows completely, and draw new ones on. But most of it is for regular lighting and normal life. There are more tricks and ideas in here than any magazine you've ever read. Kevin was one of Hollywood's best and I'm glad he revealed his secrets and techniques for others to use, before he died.<br />I'm not giving this book 5 stars, because there's something important that a reader can't gain by reading the book -- skills with practice. The information is only good for people who get good at using it.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This film lost me when Diane's character, after sleeping with the sleazy old man who was her daughter's boyfriend, collapses into the bed and gasps, \\"I love sex!\\" It lost me even more when she decidss it's not sex she loves, it's Jack. I just don't understand how that transformation happened.<br /> It was bad enough with the turtleneck sweaters that she wears summer and winter, and which she begs Jack to rip from her ( the turtleneck is a symbol of her frigidity, from which jack frees her - get it?). <br />It just did not ring true that a mature woman like Erica would fall for a man like Jack. His (convicingly played) character had zero attraction; neither physical nor mental nor spiritual. It was sheer neediness that drove her into bed with him. A mature woman understands this; the next morning she gives herself a shake and a dust off, feels rather ashamed when she sees his stubble and smells his morning breath, and swears never again.  <br /> <BR>Does anybody older than 17 wail like that after a one-week aquaintance and a one-night-stand? The cliche that older women who happen to be solo are so hungry for sex that they fall in love with the first best beast that comes their way is so tired it is embarassing.<br />As for Keanu - he was good, and convincing. A far better match for her. The age was not an issue here; they actually had something in common. Not his youth, not his body,  but his mind. That's what we older women are really after: more depth. I mean, what would she and Jack have to talk about?<br />The age difference does not matter one bit. What matters is shallowness. Jack chasing after young women was shallow and needy. Erica sleeping with Jack was shallow and needy. The daughter lusting after a man older than her father was shallow and needy. The doctor's interest in Erica was neither shallow not needy - couldn't she feel that, and respond in kind? I'd have gone for him like a shot. <br />After their break up Jack goes around trying to find \\"closure\\"with all the women he's used and abused. I didn't believe it. And that is supposed to make him ripe for Diana. I didn't believe that either. So yes, though I enjoyed the beginning and had some good laughs, The film lost me. Not that the acting wasn't good; it was. It was the story that didn't work.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|SImply put no other rap album in the history of rap has ever debuted the way Illmatic did back in 1994. Still and always be the best rap album, make that the best album period.
B0000027DJ|4.0|Alice cooper is one of the very best artists all the times.This album is very good but dont like older albums becouse this album is a more pop-metal, like bon jovi.I like pop-metal but I love heavy like the older albums.The opening song &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; is very good song.The second &quot;Love's a Loded Gun&quot; is the best in this album and the seventh &quot;feed my Frankensein&quot; also.All this album is a good and hit and if you like pop-metal you have to buy this album now but if you dont you can the hear and after that buy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only negative thing I can say about this DVD set is that by the time you finish watching all of the episodes, you will be hungry for more. I am just mind-boggled on why Fox would ever cancel a show this great. How could you do that Fox...how? Someone needs to bring this show back quick!!!<br />This series has great interesting characters, a nice plot, and great character development. You simply must see this show and join me in giving fox a big &quot;boo!&quot;
B0000CFW87|5.0|I became an instant fan of Josh Groban with his debut on my favorite TV show, Ally McBeal.  With the release of his self-titled first CD, I was ecstatic and blown away.  Now with Closer, his follow-up, Josh Groban has basically become a household name, and he deserves it all.<br />Closer is Groban's second CD and slowly moves his towards the pop arena.  His first CD was a mix of pop and opera with a mix of English, Italian, and Spanish.  This CD is mostly sung in English and still showcaes Groban's beautifully gorgeous tenor voice.  As with his first CD, all the songs on Closer is worth listening to over and over.  There is not one to be missed.  <br />If you haven't heard of Josh Groban, I suggest you pick up this CD and give him a try.  You won't be disappoitned.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is simply an amazing cd. Kanye has a wild sense of humour, as well as a deep, spiritual side, which comes off on tunes like 'Jesus Walks' and the mind blowing 'Never let me down', which features Jay Z.<br />'Spaceship is a tender lilting number of escaping from the cares of life, especially on the job. We've all been there.<br />'Slow jamz', 'All fall down' (with a sample from Lauryn Hill's 'Mystery of Iniquity')  and Through the wire' (which samples Chaka Khan's 'Through the fire' and recorded while his jaw was wired after a car crash) feature Kanye's signature style of helium influenced sped up vocals, set to a great groove, and great soul samples.<br />Other standouts from this dazzling debut are 'Two words', 'The new workout plan' with it's disco outro (and hilarious tips on how to get in shape and snag a man, complete with testimonies of satisfied females) and the 12 minute plus tale of Kanye's journey to a record deal ('Last call'), set to a gentle groove, interspersed with sax, delicate keyboard tinklings, and a killer hook.<br />Awesome! This has really raised the bar for best album of the year.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I love this movie and it's available here in australia on dvd!<br />Fay Wray has the best scream and the hairy ape can still tug on the old heartstrings!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Now, I may be a bit biased because I've always been a big Daft Punk fan and just recently, an anime fan.  I bought Discovery the day it came out, and thought it was overall a solid album.  I only recently saw Interstella 5555, but I must say, if you own Discovery you should watch Interstella 5555.  It really pulls the whole album together, and the visuals are stunningly synchronized with the music (like every other Daft Punk video).  Despite the lack of dialogue, the plot awakens a wide range of emotions and what better way to accomplish that than through music!  Granted, in the end the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still an awesome buy.  Seeing an animated Daft Punk at an awards ceremony is priceless.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes, LOTR has become the greatest movie trilogy. Star Wars is a must own on dvd. I know some of Lucas's changes and methods are very frustrating but this is the best he is going to give us. To have these films in brilliant widescreen with booming surround sound is going to be great. The extra's will be very interesting as well. <br />Star Wars is a brilliant beginning to the trilogy. <br />Empire Strikes back is the best of the series, a great story, fantastic acting, full of emotion and great battle scenes.<br />Return of the Jedi, whilst still being wonderfully entertaining is the weekest of the series.<br />Buy, and let your surround sound take you to a galaxy far, far away!!
0553208845|5.0|This is an account of Buddhism by the famous German writer Hesse.  Siddhartha was Brahmin's son.  He practiced meditation with his friend, Govinda.  He sought permission from his father to become an ascetic.  One of Siddhartha's goals was to conquer the self.  Siddhartha and his friend Govinda went in search of Gotama's abode.  They saw the Buddha.  He seemed to be smiling inwardly.  Govinda elected to follow Gotama.  After Siddhartha's encounter with the Buddha he ceased to be his father's son.  Govinda became a monk.  Siddhartha was alone.<br />Siddhartha found he was separated from people because he had been an ascetic.  For a long time he lived the life of the world without belonging to it.  With the exception of a woman, Kamala, he had no close friends.  Gradually Siddhartha acquired the characteristics of ordinary people.  He talked about Gotama.  Finally the vice of acquisitiveness caught him.  He experienced terrible and expressive anxiety during games of dice.  He became hard and mean in business.  He became nauseated with himself.  He came to understand that passion was related to death.<br />Siddhartha left the garden and town and never returned.  Siddhartha wished for oblivion.  He sank back murmuring Om on his lips.  He met Govinda, the friend of his youth, who was dressed in a yellow gown.  Govinda was on a pilgrimage.  Siddhartha said he was making a pilgrimage, too, notwithstanding his worldly appearance.  (The wheel of appearances moves quickly.)  In his youth he had learned fasting, waiting, and thinking.  Too much knowledge, too many holy verses had hindered Siddhartha in the struggle with the self.  He felt that he had been full of arrogance.<br />He resolved to go to the ferryman who had taken him to the town.  He gave the man his clothes and wanted to remain there as his assistant.  The ferryman invited him to his hut.  A lesson to be learned from the river is that there is no such thing as time.  For many years there were two ferrymen.  Kamala and her son, little Siddhartha, were making a pilgrimage to the dying Gotama.  Kamala collapsed at the ferry.  Seeing her son, Siddhartha realized it was his son.  Kamal died.  She had found peace.<br />The boy was eleven and spoiled.  Siddhartha had blind love for his son.  The boy ran away.  The wound of his son's departure lasted a long time.  He thought yearningly and bitterly about his son.  Vasudeva, the ferryman, listened to his troubles.  Govinda, although a monk, was still restless in his heart.  He ran into Siddhartha in his role as a ferryman who told him he was seeking too much.  Siddhartha had found out that knowledge could be communicated but not wisdom.  Govinda kissed Siddhartha's mask, his smiling face.Kamala and her son, little Siddhartha, were making a pilgrimage to the dying Gotama.  Kamala collapsed at the ferry.

B00011RPB0|5.0|OK, this is my second try.  I think this is a lovely and delicate film that not everyone will love, but that only adolescents and boors could loathe with the kind of venom displayed in some of these reviews.  This is not a terribly romantic film, nor is it particularly a comedy.  It is bittersweet, the acting is superb, and the contrast between the human loneliness of the main characters and the congested, technocentric nightmare that is modern Tokyo works very well.  The best advice I got about it was to watch it with as few expectations as possible.  I did, and I loved it.  It was kept showing at an auditorium here in Spokane long after the first run was over, and long after it was available on DVD and VHS, and people continued to pay $6 and $7 to see it.  All of my friends and colleagues that have seen it have loved it.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|We, my husband and myself, have never been so disappointed in a film.  The good news was that the store, which we purchased it from, did an exchange for another DVD.  We do realize that expectations can be a set up for disappointment, but sadly this film was just plain empty other than a few intermittent moments of humor.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|'In The Zone' is Britney's fourth and most artistically daring album yet. This album takes off from where 'I'm a Slave 4 u' started. A wonderful pop/dance album that has allowed Britney to express herself finally. Britney penned 7 of the albums tracks. This album is worth a listen. <br />Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna)<BR>The first single of 'In the Zone' which went to number 1 on the world sales chart for 2 weeks. It may seem like nothing special after first listen but it grows on you quickly. Madonna doesn't bring much to the song, her and Britney's vocals are on the same wave length. This song may not be an album highlight but it was a good choice as a first single as it really does represent the style of songs the rest of the album has to offer- club/dance<BR>'I'm up against the speaker trying to take on the music...'<BR>3/5<br />(I got that) Boom Boom (featuring the Yin Yang Twins)<BR>Britney's first attempt to go Hip-hop on this album. The song contains the sort of cheesey one liners you would expect from Britney, and really show cases her attitude and love for fun. The beat in the back is infectious and it will have you boppin' along in no time. Although the Ying Yang Twins hideous hooting can put you off, they make up for it with their stellar rap towards the end.<BR>'Boom, boom, boom boy you look so sexy'<BR>3.5/5<br />Showdown<BR>The song about the wonders of make-up sex. It is cryptic enough to get by the young ones without polluting their minds like most of the more sexually orientated tracks on this album. This song is extremely catchy, it has the same sort of feel to it as Jewel's 'Stand'. A trancey track that Britney slithers through nicely.<BR>'I don't really want to be a tease, but would you undo my zipper please'<BR>4/5<br />Breathe On Me<BR>A fan favourite. Very Kylie Minogue sounding. A slow and sexy dance track about...well breathing on someone. <BR>'just put you lips together and blow'<BR>3.5/5<br />Early Mornin'<BR>A song Britney andMoby put together, this song is extremely under- rated. It would do excellently in a club. It has Mobys trademark sound and Britney's trade mark attitude. A song about having a hangover after a long night partying. It is infectious after a few listens, give this song a chance it will surprise you.<BR>'I was shaking my a$$ in the streets and moaning just woke up and it's early mornin'<BR>5/5<br />Toxic<BR>We all know and love this track. Britney's biggest hit since Opps!..I did it again and equally as brilliant. This track topped the charts in the Uk, the U.S and Australia just to name a few. This song is a classic- enough said<BR>'Your toxic I'm slippin' under'<BR>5/5<br />Outrageous<BR>Possibly Britney's response to the media who are always claiming everything she does is 'outrageous'. Written and produced by R. Kelly, this Micheal jackson style track gives the goods.<BR>'I'm about to bring the heat, knocking down this industry.'<BR>4/5<br />Touch of My Hand<BR>Yes this is about (...), but again its meaning will escape the kiddies. This track has a oriental feel to it and although a song with this subject matter could easily have become a sleaze-fest Britney pulls it off with an amount of class. Like alot of the previous tracks it shares the same whispery vocals. This song is good, but i woudn't call it brilliant.<BR>'I'm not ashamed of the things that i dream...'<BR>3/5<br />The Hook Up<BR>The song that gave Britney the need to put on a Jamican accent to complement the Jamican beat is one of the grooviest club tracks on this album. This song is basically about going to a club and dancing with a guy, nothing new in terms of content. However the lyrics are almost impossible to learn, she whizzes through the words so dam quickly. If you like a challenge, you'll like this.<BR>'Baby i can't believe everything your body makes me wanna do...'<BR>4/5<br />Shadow<BR>The first and best traditional ballad on this album. This song is about a relationship that is purely sexualand Britney feels she wants more. A beautiful track and for the first time is accompanied by some beautiful vocals from Miss. Spears.<BR>'It's only your shadow, never yourself'<BR>5/5<br />Brave New Girl<BR>Have fun with this one. It takes on Madonna's 'Material Girl' instrumental and mixes it with a rap from Britney. This inspirational number is the closest you get on this album to Britney's 'Baby...One More Time' days.<BR>'She's gonna step outside, uncover her eyes...'<BR>3/5<br />Everytime<BR>This ballad is set to be the third single. Britney did a great job with the piano score. The lyrics are 'haunting'. This is a song about heartbreak that everyone can relate to. Supposively her apology to Justin so if your nosey you'll love it and if you like good ballads you'll love it even more.<BR>'Everytime I try to fly I fall, without my wings I feel so small...'<BR>5/5<br />Me Against the Music Remix<BR>Better than the original<BR>4/5
B000002H2H|1.0|PLEASE, 'ride the lighting' is not that good at all!!! look at metallica now?! don't get me wrong, i like metallica, but i sure don't love them! and before you are quick to judge my taste in music? i will let you know that i am a true metalhead through and through. i listen to metal and only metal since 1988. but, 'ride the lighting' pretty much blows, (about as bad as ST. ANGER!) this album does have some o.k. songs, but still not worthy of a great metal album! only mediocre! but on the flip side i worship, MASTER OF PUPPETS &amp; AND JUSTICE FOR ALL..., now they are superb metal albums!!! those are the only metallica c.d.'s i will ever own! if you really want to know what real bad ass metal is, then check out bands such as: SLAYER, TESTAMENT, SEPULTURA, and the almighty PANTERA!!!!!! i did not mean to offend hardcore metallica fans, but this is only my say so over the matter? and please check out what i have to say about, 'kill em'all'. could they gotten any worse with that album? oh, wait a minute they did: ST. ANGER, LOAD, RELOAD, BLACK ALBUM, S&amp;M, GARAGE INC., and you get the point?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|When I was growing up the favorite films of my generation were movies like \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", \\"2001, A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Death in Venice\\". Today I see audiences who find even \\"Lost in Translation\\" too slow and uneventful for them. <br />It's depressing to think that the schlockiest of the film-makers are right and all today's audiences can handle is the awful umitigated [nonsense] that they have been throwing at us for years. Feed people slops for long enough and all they'll want is slops. <br />The negative reviews here make the world safe for the likes of Roland Emmerich. What a horrifying thought. <br />I live in a culture that's not my own, and where people make fun of the differences all the time, from both sides of the divide. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is dead on in its analysis of a short term encounter. It amazes me that people can't see anything happening here. Decisions are made. People grow. It's a beautiful film from a brilliant script. Those who can't see it had better enjoy their slops
0385504209|1.0|everybody keeps talking about this dumb book<br />but what about this charge of racism?<br />why are y'all ignoring this Q?
B00005JN02|5.0|Okay, the other reviews elegantly give you the German context, and perhaps also the greater meaning of East Germany sliding into unlamented memory - the foul and highly visible exhausts from the wretched Osti Trabant cars should do that all by itself.<br />The characters come alive, and the plot makes you care about them as people, not just card board cut-outs signifying some abstraction or another.<br />If you have not seen a really fine, memorable movie in 'way too long, perhaps you will brave the subtitles and give ol' Lenin a try?  Me, I am tempted to go watch it again in the theater, or maybe try for the DVD from offshore.
0743216458|5.0|This unfortunate Capt. Herbert Sobel, the original commander of Easy Company, was a strict martinet in the early days of their training, when all the guys were green.  He whipped them into shape and instilled discipline, creating an efficient unit that went forward into parachute training then combat.  (Sobel had been so harsh with the men, they were in better physical condition than the instructors at jump school.)  As training developed, Sobel stressed night operations to the point some of the men joked they could function better in the dark than in daylight.<br />It's too bad the battalion leadership didn't become aware that Sobel was a problem until after his noncommissioned officers nearly mutinied.  Sobel turned out to be incompetent at field problems, in addition to continuing his chicken ways (which are appropriate for initial training, but not for further development).  If someone had recognized that Sobel was superb at molding totally untrained men into soldiers, and would have best served the Army solely in that capacity, the man could have been utilized throughout the war for basic paratroop training.  As it was, he went forward with Easy Company and his incompetence propagated relegation to humiliating supply-officer duties.<br />And just when you think this guy's life couldn't have gotten any more pitiful (having to salute, for instance, superior officers who had once been subordinate in rank to him), you reach the &quot;Where They Are Now&quot; chapter -- and you really feel sorry for this fellow.  It was appropriate that Ambrose recognized Sobel's contribution to the excellence of Easy Company, but (good grief!) the sad man's ultimate outcome in life was just pitiful.<br />If Sobel's career had been confined to basic training, he would have been considered a great soldier by everyone whom he trained.  As it was, he was terrific to a point, and then everything disintegrated.  An extremely interesting, gripping story -- Enjoy.
0743455967|5.0|This book stuck with me, more than any of the author's horror stories have.  A brief autobiography, followed by his personal experiences as both a struggling and accomplished author, make this a highly entertaining and thought-provoking read.  <br />Anyone interested in practicing &quot;the craft&quot; should start with this wonderful instruction manual on writing.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I don't need to buy this album I saw the video that is enough. Everytime I turn on one of the music stations she is on.  I would never waste my money on this crap music.  Anybody can teach someone to dance like that.  I also saw her also on SNL a couple of years ago and she sounded terrible.  It is bad when your background singers sound better than you.  She could not fake that because it is live.  I will be glad when she finally plays out, like most pop artist do.  Maybe she will do porn or something.
B00005JMX4|5.0|I have seen this movie twice already, once at a rather unadvertised sneak preview and again at an advertised sneak preview.  It is terrific!  The best teen comdey to come along since American Pie.  It isn't a gross-out comedy like a Farrelly Bros. movie or even the American Pie movies.  It has a surprisingly believable storyline, just get past the central concept of an ex-pornstar living next door and you can imagine these two falling for each other.  The movie has a lot of heart, and is funny in all the right places, with no cheap jokes.  It doesn't play down to the audience and in fact has a very smart twist ending.  The best movie to come this year so far, other than Eternal Sunshine, which is a vastly different type of movie.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Hard to believe, but this hard-edged musical fantasy not only won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2002, it is also arguably the best piece of filmaking to come out of a Hollywood studio this decade.  Back in the bad old 1970s, when Broadway musical director and sometimes filmaker Bob Fosse first produced the stage version of &quot;Chicago,&quot; stories thiss brutally honest (some would say cynical) dominated the movie industry.  Only because most Hollywood films have become so dumbed down and mediocre in recent years does &quot;Chicago&quot; seem like a bracing breath of fresh air.<br />The movie's highlights includes tremendous performances from ts three stars (who would have thought Rene Zellweger and Richard Gere could sing and dance so well?).  The songs are memorable, as is the witty between song dialog.  As a bonus, the DVD contains plenty of extras, including a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and interviews with the Director and stars.<br />Overall, a very worthy film presented in a very worthwhile DVD package.
B000007OY0|5.0|This movie makes me want to cry with happiness. I feel so happy to be alive after watching it. It is an uplifting experience not to be missed. The best film I've ever seen.
B000002GEV|5.0|This is one of the classic &quot;must have&quot; albums in anyone's collection. I have yet to slip the CD in my player and not listen to the entire disc. I'm 45 years old and never tire of listening to it, 30 years later.<br />I'm not going to get into the pop/not pop discussion, don't really care what you call it--I just simply call it GREAT! It's flawless, emotional music.<br />Any band that has any catalog at all have one album they can call their masterpiece, this is Supertramp's tour de force.<br />If all you've heard is &quot;School&quot; &amp; &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, you're in for a treat listening to the others. And it still stands up today...
0316666343|4.0|This is a very enjoyable story although its subject matter is sad.  I like the way the author ties everything together, a very nice job writing.  The parallel stories work well together and the sad emotions are touched on be not dwelled upon.  You recognize the sadness is there but its presentation does not detract from telling the story.  Well worth reading.
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is amazing!  I love that this band is so different than what's out there these days.  It's so rare to get a good, hard rock band with a female singer.  Evanescence definitely establish themselves apart from the rest of today's bands.<br />I listened to this at least 4 times in just two days, which is very rare for me.   I don't think I've done that since I was a teenager (I'm 36!).  I just don't get sick of this CD and it can only be played at a high volume.  Maybe that's why I like it - it reminds me of when I was in my early 20's and listened to ALL my music that loud.
B00005AQE8|5.0|No doubt that this is the best Gangsta Rap-album ever. And no doubt that this is one of the best (maybe thee best) hiphop-albums of all time.<br />If you are a fan of 50 CENT, Ja RULE, C-Murder, LIL ZANE etc and u do NOT own this you need to buy it QUICK becouse if it wasn't for this album none of them would sound like they do, IN FACT at many times they are stealing Tupac's art and that's a shame.<br />People seem to think that CALIFORNIA LOVE is Tupac's best song but that's far from it, In fact I could mention 100 songs from TUPAC that is better. (but I won't)<br />The best songs are: &quot;WHEN WE RIDE&quot;,&quot;SHORTY WANNA B A THUG&quot;, &quot;CAN'T C ME&quot;, &quot;ALL EYEZ ON ME&quot; hey, it's not many songs on the album who aren't great so BUY IT.<br />Rate it: 5/5
0688163173|2.0|I loved Dennis Lehane's other work.<br />That said, this book left me feeling like I'd wasted my time. Stories that trick the reader all the way through don't do anything for me.  Just my opinion.  If you really want to read something powerful, try his &quot;Gone, Baby, Gone&quot;.  It's ending is honest and deeply affecting.  By the end of Shutter Island, I was just irritated.
0345357116|5.0|I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this book should be the next book read by the fan who has already read the Hobbit and LOTR...not the Silmarillion. The history dealt with in this book is a little more &quot;recent&quot;, in that much is concentrated on the 2nd and 3rd age, and with stuff about the Wizards, the Palantiri, the Nazgul, the slaying of Isildur, and Gondor and Rohan, it's more relevant to the LOTR fan than most of the stuff in the Silmarillion. This is a must read for anyone who has gotten through the Silmarillion, however, with its &quot;alternate perspectives&quot; for the journies of Turin and Tuor and the account of Aldarion and Erenedis, along with a physical description of Numenor and an account of its kings. For the devoted Tolkien reader, this book can also be used as an &quot;atlas&quot; to assist them in determining which History of Middle Earth Volumes will be most interesting to them (I like 5, 9, 10, and 12). Top notch overall.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Just imagine - if that's possible - that you've never heard of Madonna before. How would you rate this CD? I honestly believe that it would be received as a quite superb pop album, perhaps the best of the year. Forget the words if you want to, and just enjoy the music and the singing. In terms of sheer pop music and forgetting all about &quot;significance&quot; this is probably one of the best albums since the days of Fleetwood Mac and Abba. The latter's &quot;Arrival&quot; has always been my model of a NEW album in which virtually every track could be released as a single. American Life runs it pretty close!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Plain and simple: listen to Josh Groban and be happy.  Josh Groban has an enjoyably flawless baritone voice that can be enjoyed by all who are fortunate enough to hear it.  The music is powerful and the voice beautiful.  The only album in which I can honestly say that I couldn't pick a favorite among such beautiful songs because each is equally as enjoyable and likeable as the next.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|I popped Honey into my DVD player expecting a good hiphop dance movie- something similar to Save the Last Dance (although now after having seen both movies, these films cannot be fairly compared).<br />What I got was a great storyline, a very talented supporting cast, great dancing- and a little something more. Alba brings a sensitivity and a depth to the character Honey, a sense that she's chasing after her life's dream, she just doesn't know what it is. <br />While most dance movies focus on the main character and their obsession with dancing, this movie split that view two ways- into dancing, of course, but also into Honey's relationships and her passions outside of the hiphop club realm- which includes teaching a dance class at the Center her mom runs, a safe place for kids in the hood who want to get off the streets. <br />The movie has an excellent message and is very well acted. The supporting cast- including a lot of kids (!)- is awesome, and Alba makes Honey a deep character that we grow to love and support.<br />While the writers could have done more with the story and certain characters (such as Mekhi Phifer's), it was still very entertaining and suprisingly real and heartfelt.<br />The star-studded hiphop cameos are great to watch, as are the numerous special features on the DVD, including the full-length music videos of the songs and videos shot in the film, a hiphop dance class, and great deleted scenes, blooper reals, and behind the scenes stuff.<br />Great DVD, worth the money, you'll definitely be entertained.
078324228X|4.0|VICELLOUS REON SHANNON became one of my fav actors after seing him in the greatest drama-series ever called &quot;DANGEROUS MINDS&quot; (based on the movie) he played CORNELIUS and he was amazing at it.<BR>He shows in this movie that he still knows how to act (he later got a role in the tv-show 24 as the president's son) and he does it darn well if u ask me.<br />Denzel is also great (as usual) in the movie, sometimes when your watching the movie again you feel that the court-room scenes are a little stretched out, but the first time u see it it's great and exciting.<br />Not as good as &quot;REMEMBER THE TITANS&quot; but pretty close and it is much better than &quot;MALCOLM X&quot;
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Look at the reviews on this page. Almost 25 reviews, almost all 5 star. Wonder why? This is one of the greatest movies ever made, simply because of the plot. The amateur filming (shaky camera, etc) only adds to the rawness of this movie. Buy it right now, you wont find a movie that will make you think this much. 5/5
0451197879|5.0|This, my 12th King novel, definitly ranks up there in the top 5.<br />If anyone dares say that Stephen King cannot write serious literature, then he has not read &quot;Roadwork.&quot;<br />While not horror in the vein of Pet Semetary or Salem's Lot, Roadwork focuses on the unthreading of an average middle-class man, who becomes victim to progression. A man who has to relocate his work and home to another side of town because of a highway project, begins acting strange, and slowly loses his grip, and becomes &quot;unplanted.&quot;<br />The character development is so rich that it is scary. Those who are strict adhereers to the horror genre may not get much out of this, but those who enjoy fiction in general, and who have an appreciation for the subtle details which make for a complete literary experience, will want to indulge in this poignant world of anti-progression.
B000000OU0|5.0|The Eagles are one of those timeless bands whose music can appeal to anybody.  Hell Freezes over is the finest example of the Eagles.  All the songs on this CD are spectacular and deserve special mention, but the remake of Hotel California is the most brilliant.  It is far better thant the original, and that is saying a lot.  If you weren't an Eagles fan before, the new Hotel California will win you over.  I enjoy listening to this CD when I'm traveling for a while on the highway, it relaxes and soothes you.  If you like James Taylor or Fleetwood Mac you MUST listen to this CD.  Hell Freezes Over is a great CD for anybody.  In a world of horrible music such as Eminem, Britney Spears, and American Idol, it is nice to see that the classics still live on.  Just like cars used to be built to last so was music.  The Eagles are still listened to today (Farewell One tour ticket sales indicate the massive extent of this).  Like new cars which are flashier and more high tech, but not built to last, so is new music.  Computerized beats and effects are used in place of beautiful acoustic chords.  New music is designed to be catchy but has no lasting appeal (spice girls anyone?  or how about new kids on the block?).  The Eagles are a band you will listen to over and over again because the songs do not get old.  If you want to see what American Music truely is then you owe it to yourself to buy this CD.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A &quot;Concert for George&quot; was extremely well-produced and entertaining.  It was great music, performed by leading artists like Eric Claton, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, and many more.  It is a wonderful collaboration, with different singers sometimes taking turns singing verses of the same song.<BR>They sing the songs just like George, and there is the added bonus of the best guitarists alive.  Ravi Shankar discusses George's strong spiritual beliefs with great affection and tenderness.  This is a womderful celebrattion of his life and music.<BR>I am watching it over and over again.
B000094A6A|5.0|This is an awesome movie, everything about it is awesome.<BR>PS: I feel sorry for the people who go on the net to complain and be angery about movies and I see that the reason they do it is because they are extremely unhappy with themselves. see ya later
630514415X|2.0|This movie probably could've been at least a little good if SPIKE LEE hadn't casted the NBA-player RAY ALLEN, he joins Dennis Rodman, Shaquille O'Neal &amp; Rick Fox (who also is in the movie) in the list of BASKETBALL-PLAYERS who makes movies but can't act.<br />Denzel does good work in the film YES but it takes more to make a good movie than one or two people in it who knows how to act (Hill Harper is the second one).<br />Not a very moving story mainly becouse RAY ALLEN's and MILLA JOVOVIC's horrible acting.<br />If you thought that rappers were bad actors, they are nothing against b-ball players.<br />Any SPIKE LEE-movie is better than this one so skip it.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Ok let me start off by saying this film could have been ok but they tried to give the skull bashing hulk of the comics a bunch of human feelings that make the story very slow moving and at times yes VERY BORING even the action sequences suffer from bad direction.  This Movie is almost as bad as crouching tiger hidden dragon which is my all time least favorite movie I dont know what anyone saw in that movie in the theater some people were so bored they started laughing at every bad sequence.
0385504209|1.0|This book was way over-rated.  And anyone who reads books knows that this series is a rip off of an Umberto Eco novel, Foucault's Pendulum!  Needless to say, it sadly does not come close to the real thing!
B000003JBM|4.0|The fusion of Hip Hop and Jazz had been in effect for a few years before this release, but Guru is still accredited as being one of it's inventors since his '89 debut with Premier as Gangstarr in,&quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;. Along with early pioneers in the fusion such as A Tribe Called Quest, Organized Konfusion, and Digable Planets, they paved the way for a new evolution in Hip Hop and the resurgence of Jazz in the music of African American youths.<br />This is not the best fusion album, but it is a great one. With Guru's jazz ready smooth voice and prolific lyrics alongside greats such as Donald Byrd this is a must have album. Guest also include France's up an coming Hip Hop face, MC Solaar. This album, though one of his jazziest efforts, led way for the pinnacle of Gang Starr's career with &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; in 1998.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Filmmaker David Lean has directed some of the best epics of all time. He set the standards so high that most filmmakers find it almost impossible to live up to Lean's sheer epic, cinema craftsmanship. Lawrence of Arabia was his best. <br />This is a chapter in the life of Captain T. E. Lawrence, a troubled man who wasn't as comfortable with his own eccentricities but certainly made up for them by becoming a charismatic leader of armies that changed nations and the world.  He was an adventurer and a historian who just happened to be in the right place at the right time to be useful to: the British army who were trying to drive the Ottoman Empire from Arabia, and the warring Arab tribes for their uprising in the desert lands. <br />David Lean shows off his and his many co-filmmakers talents with cinematic panache. Lawrence won many Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Photography. It was Peter O'Tool's first film and a great beginning for the career of Omar Sharif who went on to star in David Lean's next film: Dr Zhivago. <br />Lawrence of Arabia is well placed on many people's \\"Best Picture of All Time\\" list, including my own. See it on a big screen and be absorbed in the experience, because on the small screen it looses some of it's magic.
B000002513|4.0|Altough still going for his best, this second album by Bruce was a huge improvement over his first one.<br />The seven songs are strong, and it becomes obvious that Max Weinberg is a better drummer than Vincent Lopez, who was fired after this album.<br />A very enjoyable album.
0312954468|5.0|This great book was first recommended to me by a friend, and has since become my favorite novel. River God is an exciting tale of action, and romance that will keep you entertained with every turn of the book's pages. As for those &quot;historical inaccuracies&quot; mentioned by some reviewers, they should be reminded of the many movies set in New York City for example, which feature a mayor that historically never held office,and situations that historically, never took place. But then, isn't that the nature of fiction folks? It is after all, a NOVEL of ancient Egypt, right? My advice is to ignore each and every one of them, and enjoy this wonderful story!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Everything you'd expect, and less, from Clapton. Less, in this case, being a high compliment. You will read many things about the musicianship and respect for the originals from other reviewers, so I won't go there. But I must thank Eric Clapton for not including the Johnson tunes he has done so well in past recordings (Walkin' Blues, Crossroad Blues, Malted Milk Blues) in favor of little-recorded gems (They're Red Hot, Me and the Devil Blues, When You've Got A Good Friend). Clapton is not retreading old ground here; he's expanding the view into the magnificent and scary musical vision of Robert Johnson. Clapton's homage is not reverence, it's loving admiration. If you loved From The Cradle, this is a definite for you.<br />Now, if he will do the right thing and donate the money somewhere that continues to honor Johnson's legacy...
B0000019HU|5.0|Chilling Lyrics. For the first week I owned it, I couldn't listen to Good Morning, Captain in the dark. I like to keep my reviews short and simple, so I can tell you, with all honesty to but this album, even if you get creeped easily. You can stand it. It'll haunt you to sleep...
B0000DD7LB|1.0|How can it be that this untalented singer keep fooling people for so many years? She can't even sing live properly, relying to playbacks most of the time. And she proved tobe a smart girl with that &quot;spontaneous&quot; kiss Madonna gave her...<br />BRitney is a marketing phenomenon made by clever businessmen who did not imagine that their &quot;project&quot; would sell so well.<br />This new album is useless like all her other albums. Go on, buy it and make her richier and richier without even knowing how to sing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the funniest drama I've ever seen. I've chuckled, even guffawed, at Wash's (Alan Tudyk) silliness, Zoe's (Gina Torres) deadpan gibes, and Jayne's-- Well, you'll just have to experience *Mr.* Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) for yourself. I also relished the convention-twisting surprises, such as the many spoilers I'm thoughtfully omitting right now.<br />Firefly, however, is more than levity. Liberty and loyalty are central to the main characters, who struggle (and sometimes smuggle) to survive. They do so on the 26th century frontier aboard their transport spaceship Serenity. Some are there to be free of the Alliance, which forced every colonized planet to join. Some are fugitives from that government's darker side. Some are just along for the ride. Or are they?<br />Would you like to see clever characterization and humor from superior writing, acting, and directing? Of course you would. In fact, you'll want to see these richly textured episodes again and again, so you should purchase your own set of Firefly DVDs. I did, and I don't even watch free reruns of other TV shows. Then in 2005 you can go see the greenlighted film version from Universal Pictures: Serenity.
B00013F38K|5.0|***************<BR>It's simple.<br />If you're that much of a technofile and the aspect ratio bothers you beyond belief, DON'T BUY IT!<br />Likewise, if you feel the show is a prime example of racism in Hollywood, DON'T BUY IT!<br />And...repeated postings of the same inflamatory rhetoric serves NO purpose but to weaken your case.  It's time to choose another soapbox.<br />Since these two opinions consist of approximately 2% of the interested viewing public, the remaining 98% of us can rejoice!  Despite the near fanatical rantings of a small group of naysayers, the show was - and still is - nothing short of brilliant.  Wonderful characters, impeccably cast, magnificently scored -- they hit the bullseye with this series on every detail.<br />And...I'm so elated the series is available on DVD I could really give a rat's behind about the cropping.  Although it would've been nice to get it in Dolby 5.1 - but seriously?  A VERY minor detail.<br />Bring on Seasons 2 &amp; 3!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Last October, I saw the Chili Peppers in concert, and it was amazing. In my opinion, they are better live then they are on cd. When I found this dvd at stores for sale, I immediatly bought it.<BR>When I popped it in my dvd player, I was impressed. They are even better live then i remembered! I loved every song on this dvd, and was happy to see John Frusciante's solo song &quot;Maybe.&quot; <BR>This band is the best band EVER, and the dvd is proof.
B00000ING2|5.0|I am a new Cohen brother fanatic! I have owned &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; since it's relesed and have now recently ventured into the &quot;Cohen state of mind&quot;. These are movies that captivate and are eye and mind candy. The only Cohen movie so far that left me confused was &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. Still, an interesting movie. You need to watch that one more than that once.<BR>   &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; is fantastic! The film flows like a delicious latte'. This is a very unique manner of filmaking, If you are into movies that are a thrill ride. Gotta see this one!<BR>     I also recommend highly &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; and &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; If you like deep movies with lot's of twists, go with a Cohen Brothers film!
0385504209|3.0|I really liked the start of the book with a lot of historical detail and intrigue about real organizations.  As the book goes on, however, it gets more and more trite and predictable.  The characters are not very well developed and you don't really care about them.  It turns out more like a soap opera than a really good book.  It is very readable, however.
0920668364|4.0|My sister gave this book to me recently and I loved it. Yes, it makes me teary eyed. To those \\"well-adjusted\\" folks who think it's about incest and are wondering where the daddy is, etc., I can only imagine what kind of spin you put on The Cat in the Hat? Are you people concerned that the Cat or Thing One or Thing Two are perverts? LIGHTEN UP.<br />This book is about unconditional love. It's symbolic of a mother's love for her child - no matter how old your child gets, they are always your baby. Get it? If people are taking this so seriously, I can only assume that they didn't like Green Eggs and Ham either for fear of a child eating moldy food.<br />This is a lovely book for the non-paranoid.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|OK, so im English and so are muse, but im not biased. This album has everything any self respecting rock fan should have. Its true they occasionaly sound like radiohead, but they do it better.<BR>This is how rock should be heard, songs like hysteria and thoughts of a dieing atheist should go down in history.<BR>...
B000002UAF|5.0|This is a great CD. Get the movie as well. Its a winning combo! I wonder though, do you think they might put out a new soundtrack in honor of the release of AHDN on DVD? I wonder...they sould put some of the tracks off the british version of AHDN LP. I have it at home and its got some great instrumentals of &quot;That Boy&quot; and others. I think that would be really cool. Until then, though, get this! Your Beatles collection is incomplete without it!
B00000294R|5.0|IN my opinion, Big L, Tupac, and Rakim are the greatest lyricists of all time.  Big L is definetely the least popular and well-known of the recognized hip-hop greats, and it is probably because of his lyrics.  Big L was the original gay-bashing, violent, and utterly amazing MC.  rappers like Big L helped pave the way for superstars with similar styles like Eminem(although Big L's work is far superior).  I was devastated in February 1999, when BIG L as murdered.  We have lost both 2pac and Big L to stupid violence, the two greatest rappers of all time, and all these awful MC's are still here.  If you are just getting into rap, then buy all of BIG L, 2pac, Rakim and Notorious B.I.G.'s cd's because they are the smartest and most gifted Mc's to grace the rap game with their presence.  RIP big L
0930289528|5.0|Michael commented on listening to Tori Amos' cover of &quot;Real Men.&quot;  I suggest listening to the original by Joe Jackson which can be found on Night and Day.  I can't comment on the book yet as I have not read it, but I am a huge JJ fan.
B00005NC66|4.0|All right - Breathless is an important film and I can see why.  This is the film that gave birth to the French New Wave.  Before this, films look like they were shot in a studio.  This film made the gritty look of seventies filmmaking - and indeed, today's independent filmmaking - possible.  This film has a guerrilla feel to it, which makes it seem very modern.  Goddard films on actual locations with handheld cameras.  The most obvious innovation is the deliberate use of \\"jump cuts\\", which goes against the traditional theory of \\"invisible edits.\\"  The story itself (by Francois Truffaut) is innovative - it foreshadows Quentin Tarantino with its non-moralistic account of a cold-blooded, Bogart-worshipping killer (wonderfully played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his crazy/beautiful American girlfriend.<br />That having been said, the style of this film is really what is important.  Looked at today, when its innovations have been absorbed into mainstream film, TV, and commercials, some of the flaws are more apparent.  Especially towards the end of the film, when the story gets wackier and the style gets over-the-top, it became hard to restrain my Mystery Science Theater comments.  That is the problem with being the first in anything - you go too far and you date yourself.  Although Goddard started the Nouvelle Vague, I think that Truffaut - as evidenced by his script here - is the more important artist.  This is the film that paves the way for better films like The 400 Blows.  However, Breathless is still a good film and a must for any serious student of cinema.  Although there are few extras on this DVD, the film looks great.  For all its flaws, Breathless still has an air of authenticity that few films today can dream of.
006092988X|5.0|It's not every book that will grab you from the opening paragraph and draw you into the characters lives the way this one does. 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was a fascinating novel describing the life and times of a young girl growing up in the early nineteen hundreds, but the experiences are not dated - they are repeated with every generation of young women, and the writer does a wonderful job depicting the inner turmoil. I loved the way the author described things, I loved how it was a book about life that I could relate to, but the thing I loved the most was that when I finished it, I wanted more.<BR>'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' was an amazing story that follows Francie Nolan throughout her early life in Brooklyn. It touches on the many trials and tribulations a child growing up in the slums of Brooklyn had to face in the early nineteen hundreds. The entire novel was split into five books and each represented a different point in time. The novel didn't have a single conflict, but instead it had problems overlapping problems throughout the story to show the reality of growth and development. The main goal in the novel though, was the maturation of a single child from their own perspective. It simply cuts right to the heart of life. The so-called solutions to the problems most of the time turn into larger problems and seldom solve anything in the novel, but that goes to show how honest and true this novel really is. <BR>The main character is Francie, a shy timid girl the reader can see changing and blossoming through the course of the novel, but the cast for this play has many actors. It takes many people to influence one's life. Francie's mother Katie Rommely-Nolan, played a huge role in this story, as she should because a mother's role is important to life. Francie's father Johnny Nolan also played a huge part in her life. He was an alcoholic singing waiter who was never around very much but influenced Francie's idea of life, death, and the value of everything. I noticed throughout the book that Francie compared everything to her father which showed his unbelievable importance even without a constant physical presence. Neely Nolan was crucial to this story; he was not only Francie's brother but also her best and only friend. Francie was also very influenced by her Aunt Evy who was a stern woman in many ways but you could tell that she enjoyed life, her Aunt Sissy who in the beginning of the story is a wild, crazy type and then settles as the story continues. Both of these women have husbands and children, but they don't play as much of an important role in Francie's life as the aunts themselves. There's also Francie's grandmother Mary Rommely, who indirectly plays a very important role in Francie's life because she taught Katie the grounds for raising her children. Other vital characters include Francie's bosses, teachers, schoolmates, significant others and random people she met on everyday travels throughout the city.<BR>This novel taught me that things are not always what they seem and that hardly anything goes exactly according to plan, and that you shouldn't take anything for granted. It mainly taught me however, to live life to it's fullest everyday so that I may get everything that I can out of it.<BR>If you have lived and you can read, you'll enjoy this novel. If you can't read, get it as a book-on-tape collection and you will love it too. Everyone could take this novel to heart because it's a novel about each one of us in the world, one that no matter whether you're a bum that lives in a cardboard box in the alleyway, or the king of England you can empathize with the author's growing pains, and that's the most important part. How can anyone deny reading a story about themselves? Some people are partial to science fiction, some people love editorials, all people would love this book.
B00004LN16|5.0|The title of this sturdy release couldn't be more fitting. AC/DC is unquestionably one of the most influential and enduring hard rock bands of all time, and each of their many albums have shown why...however, the critics have a different view. According to them, AC/DC reached their peak at \\"Back in Black\\" and since then have released nothing but carbon copy, generic sleaze rock. One can read the All Music Guide reviews and see this. But it's actually a catch-22 situation; had AC/DC progressed their sound into uncharted territory they would have been labelled overblown and far-fetched...yet if they refused to vary their formula, they will be called repetitive. There's obviously no pleasing critics, so why take them seriously? In fact, the entire idea of critics is one of the things rock and roll was rebelling against in the first place.<br />Lesser bands would have called it quits after realizing they couldn't match previous praises, but AC/DC soldier on with \\"Stiff Upper Lip,\\" released in 2000. To notice the expansion in sound one must have the ears of a die-hard fan, but this influential group have always managed to slither into the grooves of the times while keeping their formula. Ten years from now, the flaming title track will be seen as one of AC/DC's greatest anthems, right up there with 'For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)' or 'Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.' The guitar lines here are at their most addictive, notably on 'Can't Stand Still,' while other rockers further define AC/DC: 'Safe in New York City,' 'Can't Stop Rock and Roll,' and 'Damned,' the latter two seemingly reflecting AC/DC's battles against the PMRC.<br />AC/DC are not trying to immitate earlier releases, nor are they holding back any punches. \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" displays an aging band standing their ground and allowing no time or space for the observations of critics.
0385336810|5.0|This is the funniest book I have ever read. I stayed up all night reading it, laughing out loud till about 3 am. Emma is such a funny character and the story is so light hearted, easy to read, and engaging. Every time you turn the page, you get excited and anxious to read what hilarious situation Emma will find herself in next. <br />Plot: Emma, a young working girl in London, currently works in the Marketing Dept of the London version of Pepsi Co. On a plane ride home, she tells all her secrets to the stranger next to her, since she is afraid the plane will crash. She tells this guy everything, and it really makes you wonder about your own secrets. She tells him how she pours orange juice, instead of water in one of her co-workers plants, she tells him that she tells every1 shes a size 6 when really she's a 10, she tells him shes never been in love, (...) etc. It's really very, very funny. (...) Their love story is very cute and fun to read.<br />Overall, excellent book to read when you're stressed out or looking for a good laugh. You can read it again and again, and it won't fail to make you laugh. Kinsella is truly a gifted author. I personally thought that this latest venture, was even better and funnier then her Shopoholic series--which I didn't think would be possible. Total chick lit, sometimes hard to believe, yet totally engaging and laugh out loud funny. I recommend this to every woman out there.
B00012QM8G|3.0|I don't have to get up and flip over my laserdisc copy of Schindler's List- the player switches sides automatically.  There's NO excuse for having a DVD which requires you to have to get up and flip it over, when there are two layers on one side available, even for a long movie such as this.  It's not that I'm lazy, but techonologically there's no excuse.  <br />The movie is absolutely fantasic (5 stars) but the dual sided &quot;flipper&quot; DVD and the shoddy packaging get 1 star, for an average of 3 stars.  The DVD was very dusty as packaged inside the shrinkwrap (like the DVD's sat around at the factory a long time before they were eventually packaged).  The packaging looked to be a rush job, even though this movie should have been released on DVD already.  Universal apparently is trying to maximize profits because they know this film will sell anyway even with shoddy packaging.
0156027321|5.0|This is such an engaging and riveting book.  It was a spiritual book without being overzealous about any particular religion/denomination although he does focus on Hinduism, Muslim and Catholicism.  I cannot adequately convey the wonders of the story which has moments that are hard to take in its graphic descriptions of survival.  I just know that I am extremely fortunate to have read it and ecstatic that Martel chose to write it.
1401201911|5.0|Red Son, for those not in the know, is the Elseworlds tale showcasing how the world would have been different should Kal El have landed in Russia during the beginning of the Cold War. What occurs during the three issues is the rise of the Superman, and the fall of the world under his boot. Oh, it's not a tyrannical rule; Superman has made the world a Socialist community, with only a dilapidated America under President Luthor standing up against the alien's involvement.<br />It's a heady case that Mark Millar brings, but the work stands as one of the best and definite works for Superman. You may ask, `definitive for Superman? How? It's not a real story!\\" (...)! Millar defines his world using the very paradigm of who and what the Superman character stands for. Oh, our guy is most certainly there. It's just that we get to see how Superman would react given a different lot in life. He is still the highly noble, self-sacrificing hero that we all know and love. There isn't a person on this planet that doesn't know that familiar `S'-shield, and each one can pick up on the familiarity with the character as he and his cast are presented here. After all, it's the classic story of invulnerable alien versus his greatest nemesis-a brilliant mortal flesh and blood human. Ah....but Lex gets it done. In a brilliant way, Lex gets it done.<br />Art wise, Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett share the art chores throughout the telling. Johnson begins the story for the first part, and is joined and later finished by Plunkett. Johnson's work heralds the Superman Fleischer cartoons from the 1940's, where our hero is a broad shouldered man of action, simple in wants and benign in deeds. His work directly expresses the innocence of the years, and it's slow decay as time marches on. Plunkett finishes the tale up, and his style shows a harsher, aged time for the world and Superman. The decay of freedom is complete, and our hero bears that weight in full force. You can clearly perceive the gloomthat hangs over all, which is...until....<br />You read it for yourself. What, you think I was going to tell you? Ha! And ruin it? You're out of your gourd! <br />Superman: Red Son more than stands out this year as the story that none should miss. It succeeds on all levels as a defining work that grabs your attention and leaves you overwhelmed come story's end. There is nothing more that I can say that the book doesn't say for itself.
B00006CJOY|5.0|I've seen many bad or regular reviews on this record, however many of them by anglosaxon people or people who have never seen Manu Chao live. This is the real thing!!! Manu's recitals are just like this !! The studio versions are sure incredible pieces of work, but I already had a different idea about Manu through live records of Mano Negra. Seeing him perform live is an amazing display of vibrating and contagious energy, and I really thank this record for reminding me this. <BR>If you wanted a non-repetitive-just-like-the-record Manu, then you never understood him. Check back on his old records, listen carefully to the samples and rythms and beats, try to understand that really not much changes from song to song, or disc to disc for that matter. Manu is great in studio and great live, two different greats however. It's just the repetitive stuff that jumps from the discs to stage and unifies his art production.<BR>The flow of this disc is quite good, I can tell though just from hearing it that the songs don't belong to the same recital because 2 to 3 straight hours with Manu live are something to remember. This is a good point made by others, but it's not enough to keep this cd from becoming a classic. <BR>Seize the opportunity if you think you'll never be able to see Manu perform ! Believe me, all the hey hey heys really rock your body when you're dancing like crazy with 5 thousand people. This really works for us latin people !!!
B00015HVI8|5.0|I have learned to expect TV shows to become less fresh, maybe boring, after five or six years.  Not this one.<br />One of my favorite parts of this series are the off-world episodes where SG-1 meets usually primitive cultures outside the main storyline.  These remain as strong as ever in season 6.  As do the Earthbased villian episodes, and while our buddy Apophis has been [very likely] dead for a while, the Goa'ulds that filled his power vacuum are not any nicer... (a good thing)<br />We thought we lost Daniel.  We didn't.  Instead of losing an influential character, we gained another great one (Quinn).  And though this season may not have the serious-while-sidesplittingly-whimsical episode like Wormhole X-Treme! or Window of Opportunity, wow, aside from possibly a slight decline in humor this series is as strong as ever in season 6.
0452282152|5.0|I can say that Chevalier has succeeded in creating a new personal favorite. She took a time in history not often investigated through fiction (but obviously worthy of it) and created a writing masterpiece. The description she makes of the paintings has inspired me to become a small-scale art enthusiast. She doesn't use large amounts of dialogue. She resides to the personal thoughts a single girl. It is refreshing to also have a book where the lead character is a teenager. Although it is with completely different circumstances I felt a better connection being a girl of sixteen as well. At the end you give a &quot;Wow that was great!&quot; sigh. It makes you re-examine parts of the world around you and take a new appreciation for all small details, thoughts, and creative behaviors. It is nothing short of wonderful.
B000009EAD|2.0|I like the songs...a few to many slow songs....and the singer just blows! He sounds alright sometimes and really funy other times! Can't stand the voice, I just can't stand the voice!

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I see this band/album as a toned down version of Tool designed to meet the needs of the masses who cannot become accustom to weirder, more original music. This album is undoubtedly good, nice vocals and rythms (guitar work is basic), in all reality this is probably the best album out in the past year that is in the popular category. But understand, in the popular category, not in every category. There are far far better albums (better than both APC and Tool) out there done by lesser-known bands, Porcupine Tree, The Mars Volta and Opeth come to mind.<br />So my final suggestion, if your a person who is afraid of changing styles and stepping out and enjoying a very weird/different style and sound, but want more of the same stuff you enjoyed in the past. Then this album is perfect for you.
B00009TB5G|2.0|WARNING - I've read and re-read Tolkien's works so what I write below is accurate.  What follows then is for those true fans who want to know what's what, not some simple \\"it was great\\" review.   It is obvious that previous readers of the original review below, that if someone doesn't like what you are saying, even if it is true, that you are not being \\"helpful\\".  Just a warning then, before reading on - if you liked the movies, by all means, go and buy it, but if you are a true fan of Tolkien, just like the title of this review indicates, you will agree with what I have written below after having seen the movie(s).    The Lord of the Rings trilogy consists of 3 very pretty movies, much like Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) was a pretty face.  Unfortunately, the Tolkien fan deserves more than this.  For the rest of the world, this was an acceptable popcorn chompfest with much more action to see the fan through to the end of this overblown epic.     For the true fan of fantasy and Tolkien, Peter Jackson has done the unforgivable in creating this movie.  I realize that most books are far too complicated and deep for a mere 2 hour movie to portray in full, and I understand that some scenes can be edited for pacing or when they are deemed unnecessary to the flow of the movie.  I really do undersand it.  But Peter Jackson didn't do this; rather, he changed the very nature of the story in subtle and significant ways to suit the audience rather than remain faithful to the story.  This is fine for the average fan, but the true fantasy fans are left in the dust for yet another Hollywood-ified bastardization of a classic.    This story is the heart and soul of the fantasy genre.  Sure, there have been fantasy books and stories long before The Lord of the Rings, but none before had reached the epic proportions of this classic, the cornerstone of fantasy.  Peter Jackson is a hack who, while he did an excellent job in logistics for handling this massive undertaking, his understanding of the actual story was shown to be weak, at best.     There is not enough space here to show where he emasculated the story - read the novels (trust me, it gets better after the first 2/3 of the Fellowship!) or listen to the 9 disk audio set for the full story - but let me point just a few.  He glorified what was originally an afterthought of a love story around Aragorn for the mere purpose of selling tickets to women.  This is much like George Lucas changing the Wookie planet into the cute Ewoks so the girls would have something to enjoy.  This is no surprise.  He also changed the very important role of Saruman in the story, making him a simple pawn of Sauron, rather than an erstwhile foe who sought the ring to challenge Sauron so that he could dominate the world under his own feet instead.  What was up with the avalanches in the Fellowship?  It was the Wargs that chased them into Moria.  And while I mention Wargs, they are supposed to be DIRE WOLVES.  I have no idea what those creatures were he pawned off on us.  On a technical note, in the Return of the King, the battle scene was great Hollywood, but no tactician would have ever tried to defend a city like that (gates that open IN????), nor would cavalry go stupidly into the rush of a slower foe, knowing they had the speed to outflank.  Great Hollywood, foolish stupidity - these were supposed to be the BEST cavalry in the WORLD - they would surely know how to flank.  And Boromir?  Could they have possibly made him any more of sleazebag in the movie, rather than the hero who simply sought to do right by his people?  It's a shame that Peter Jackson did not apparently read the Lord of the Rings, for it shows.
006441034X|5.0|I loved this book. It was one of those when you're reading it, you want to be in it. A lucky find at a booksale (50c, can't beat the price), it's the story of Sophie, the eldest of three daughters and thus, she assumes, born to screw up. Everyone knows the eldest is the one to make mistakes so the youngest can win the prince and prize. She is cursed by a witch to become an old woman (from 18 to 75 in the blink of an eye), and makes her way to the moving castle of the disreputable wizard Howl. Sophie is a wonderful character, I thought she was funny and intelligent and aware of her shortcomings, which was nice. I really didn't want to finish this book, I wanted to be with the characters more and see what happens. All ends well, as might be suspected, and you will have a guaranteed good time reading it.

B000059Z8J|2.0|It boggles my mind how anyone could bring the classic character to the big screen and not bring Superman's most dastardly nemesis with him.  I'm speaking of course about Lex Luthor.  There are some who believe that Gene Hackman's character (who is never mentioned by name in the movie, believe it or not) is supposed to be Luthor, but we really have no way of knowing.  Boo to Warner Bros and all involved, except the actors.
B000003S09|5.0|What can I say about In the Court of the Crimson King: An Observaion by King Crimson?  Well, there's probably only one thing I can say.  If you do not have this album, buy it.  When I first heard it, I sat there in awe for forty-five minutes, trying to comprehend the genius.  My favorite band is Yes, and I'm very partial to Rush, Genesis, Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd. (Just to name a few).  However, this album ranks right up there with Close to the Edge, Selling England by the Pound, and Dark Side of the Moon.  This is the only album by King Crimson that I own, but I'm not sure that the band could produce anything better, (but, hey, could you blame them?) so I'm reluctant to purchase anymore of their works.  I mean, holy cow, what a way to put yourself on the prog rock scene.  I personally think the album is incredible and if you like Yes, Genesis or any other of those classic prog rock bands, this is an essential addition to your collection.
B00005JKCH|1.0|Worthless big-screen updating of the classic character suffers from lousy plotting and boring execution.  This waste of time has all the depth of a comic book, and succeeds only in trashing a famous character's legacy and blowing a lot of stuff up.  The ending is particularly ludicrous.  Count me as one who will not be in line for the sequel to this stinker.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|one of the best/craziest endings i have come across<BR>this movie is great- you just have to appreciate it
B00005ASHM|1.0|I love the Beach Boys as much as anyone.  Let me say that again.  I love the BEACH Boys as much as anyone.  By that I mean I love the Beach Boys who actually live up to their name, singing about the beach, girls, surfing, cars, and Rhonda.  <br />This is not the Beach Boys.  It can't be.  Why?  No beach songs!  I thought it was some kind of joke.  All &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes, backed by elevator music.  There's barely any Mike Love on the album at all.<br />Way overrated.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nasty Nas is officially back. Not only did he re-release his best cd ever, he re-recorded them on the disc # 2. ALso he has 2 new songs on disc 2 and they are both hot. My favorite track is &quot;On the Real&quot;Nas tears it up. I cant wait until the summer for Street's Disciple to come out. Everyone better watch out, Nas is back.
B000002KIE|2.0|I still remember vividly that cold winter's day in 1977 when I ventured down to Bigby's Books and Records with the fifteen dollars I had earned from lawnmowing.  I purchased a Bread album and \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\". I can recall the look on the cashier's face - bewilderment, maybe with a little amusement mixed in.  As I listened to both albums on my parents' hifi (when they were gone to bowl), both affected me very deeply.  Bread made me feel warmth and nostalgia, the Sex Pistols anger.  I treasured them both for many years until I lost them in a move.  Recently, I updated my collection and repurchased both albums on CD, symbolically on the same day, just as before.  <br />What did I realize?  I realized that \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" has, in a great bit of sad irony, become the museum piece its creators never wanted it to become.  Its anger is cartoonish, its hamfisted musicianship quaint, rather than threatening.  Amazingly, Bread, surely the type of group the Pistols were bent on destroying, sounded just as beautiful as it did 27 years ago.  The Pistols' punk may be en vogue these days, but what is more punk: singing with a snarl and crummy guitar, or showing the whole world the beauty that can be contained in a song?  I know what my answer is.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Judging by previous reviews, I think March 14th, 2004 was doomed to fall short of the hype. Vince McMahon made it clear that his focus was for Wrestlemania XX to represent the start of a new era and to elevate new superstars in contrast to bringing back old names and rehashing old themes. Many fans hated this idea, and when the idea was achieved, fans still hated it. Denouncing Wrestlemania XX merely for the absence of Bret and Hogan is a bit unfair. But I'd still say that Wrestlemania XX could have been a much better show. <br />Instead of where was Hogan and Bret, how about, where was Matt Hardy? Where was Paul London? Where was Lance Storm? They had to have felt at least a little offended for being left off the show for the embarrassing display of bikini wrestling. What a joke that was. Another part that got me a bit peeved was the Cruiserweight Championship. Along with the Paul London comment earlier, I think Vince has no clue how much his cruiserweights are truly appreciated. A disorganized 10 minute match with 10 different wrestlers is a pathetic attempt to try and fit (almost) your entire cruiserweight division into the show. A big disappointment with a lot left to be desired.<br />On the flip side, there were plenty of those Wrestlemania moments that will be remembered forever. How can anyone forget the Brock Lesnar and Goldberg encounter? Yes, the match was god awful and the enthusiasm from both wrestlers was extremely pedestrian, but MSG crowd made this match. The chants they came up with were ingenious and really shows the intelligence the average WWE fan possesses. We appreciated wrestlers with dedication to the business and leave their heart out in the ring, not those with large muscles who just work to receive their paycheck. They let Lesnar and Goldberg how they felt and it was exciting to behold. I hope Vince got the message.<br />The other Wrestlemania moment to me was the main event Triple Threat Match and the events that followed it. The match itself was a masterpiece and it really put those critics to rest who said that a triple threat match was doomed to fail. All 3 wrestlers fought their hearts out. The Benoit chants throughout the match brought a huge smile to my face and I give big props to the MSG crowd for cheering the most underappreciated wrestler in the business. The ending was true suspense. The crowd pop when Benoit reversed the Pedigree into the Crossface was unbelievable. I'll never forget Benoit's genuine tears as touched the title for the first time. Eddie Guerrero's appearance at the end to congratulate Benoit was a great touch to the greatest ending to any wrestling pay-per-view ever. Just Benoit and Guerrero hugging each other and raising each other's title-holding hands as the show fades to black. That is what Wrestlemania should be all about.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is the cutest one I have seen yet from Disney. They usually outdo themselves with each new movie, but this one will not be outdone for a long time. <br />Nemo is a little clownfish who lives in the shadow of his overprotective father, whose antics get Nemo into big trouble. Nemo's mother was shown in the very beginning of the movie, but tragically is eaten by a barracuda. Because of this, Nemo's father, Marlin, is overprotective, and therefore is afraid of the ocean. In the end, the viewer has seen Nemo's father search the entire Atlantic ocean for him, hence the name &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. On his way, he meets many other beings such as sharks and jellyfish, and 'befriends' a very forgetful fish.  The father overcomes his fear of the ocean, and life returns to normalcy when Nemo returns home from Sydney, Australia, after living in a fish tank in a dentist's office for about three days.<br />It's a very heart-warming movie, and even though I'm not a little kid, I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it about 3 times in the first week of owning it! A wonderful job by Disney!

0807126063|4.0|I began reading this book during a drunk driving assembly. I will admit it now - I have no idea what was said during that assembly. I *do* know that &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is an entirely absorbing, hilarious novel that entertains from the very beginning. And by &quot;very beginning,&quot; I mean the Foreward:<br />&quot;&quot;There was no getting out of it; only one hope remained - that I could read a few pages and that they would be bad enough for me, in good conscience, to read no farther. Usually I can do just that. Indeed the first paragraph often suffices. My only fear was that this one might not be bad enough, or might be just good enough, so that I would have to keep reading&quot; (vii-viii). <br />The characters are addictive and quirky - even the ones you don't like. I actually didn't care for pompous, arrogant Ignatius, but I did enjoy him - it's impossible to read his rants and strange ideas without cracking up. And I became very fond of many of the other characters - and are there a lot of them. Several different plots weave through &quot;Confederacy,&quot; each with its own cast, loosely tied together until the end. <br />Patrolman Mancuso and the police department...Dorian Green and his friends...Mr. Levy, Mrs. Levy, and the exercise board (&quot;Leave the board out of this!!!&quot;)...the &quot;Night of Joy&quot; bar...and, of course, Jones. My favorite, beloved Jones. &quot;Negro,&quot; &quot;vagrant,&quot; trying to get people into the &quot;Night of Joy&quot; for a show (&quot;Hey! All you people draggin along here. Stop and come stick your a** on a Night of Joy stool...Night of Joy got genuine color peoples workin below the minimal wage. Whoa!&quot;) Jones is, ironically, possibly the only entirely sane character in this book. &quot;Whoa!&quot;<br />Basically, I love this book. It's hilarious, I finished it last week and believe me - if you're hoping for it to be a nice, sane read, I kindly suggest you find a lute string and stab yourself with it. It'll save you a little suffering. <br />Because this book is insane in a way that only Kurt Vonnegut can compare to. <br />And I love every page of it.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I hate you people for writing those five star reviews of Britney's In The Zone. Britney has absolutely no talent. She's nothing but a bum, and a no good one at that. I hate this lucky bum singer so much, that I just want to strangle her. I'm here to prove that this lucky bum artist, and that's what she was, lucky! does not have the skills of an artist. The bum's running. The bum is scared and doesn't want to face me! So I say to you, Britney Spears, that I want the whole world to know that I am more than able to meet you anywhere, any place, any time. This album is the example of Britney's death, which will undoubtedly come. I listen to artists like Cher, Dido, Celine Dion, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Shania Twain, Nelly Furtado, Barbara Streisand, and Beyonce. I don't listen to self-absorbed music like this. I will continue to respect artists that earn my respect. You call yourselves BritneySpears fans? You are a fake. Britney is a fake, and you're a disgrace to our Pop. I will not be nice about this bum. Period!<br />IN THE ZONE IS GARBAGE
B0000039PW|5.0|each and every track on this disc is a classic and the best one of all is his biggest hit, Juicy. Further more are great hits like one more chance, every day stuggle and big poppa. If you don't purchase this cd, you are not a true hip hop fan, this is one of the most valuble and greatest cd in the world right next to ressurection by another legend, 2pac.<br />R.I.P.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I wanted this CD so badly because I just was mesmorized by her voice and loved the music to &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;.  However, after listening to it once, I pretty much decided that it was like hearing the same song over and over and over again, to the point that I now hate this CD.  I've listened to it probably about 4 times, and am anxiously awaiting to give it away.  My coworkers won't let me play it because they insist that it sounds like my CD player is broken and playing the same song over and over and it puts them to sleep.  Sorry Nora, you have a beautiful voice and I love the style, but can't you do a little more?  So very dissappointed.
6305428271|5.0|This movies is so good that everybody should at least watch it once or twice.
B000068OSK|3.0|Yikes. White Stripes is proof that the drummer can make or break a band. On this album the drum track works against the guitar's momentum--causing the listener to constantly trip over themselves as they listen. It's a shame considering the very talented guitar playing.
0385512104|5.0|Fantastically well-written.  The language is very direct and even sparse but it sings when read aloud.  Very original.  Utterly engrossing.  Hard to describe why this book is so darn appealing, but it is.  It is also true literature.  It is a novel of human relationships.  This is why they say that if you want to understand human beings, you will get more out a novel than a self-help book.  The hero of this book is a 15 year-old autistic boy, whom I am completely taken with.  &quot;Out of the mouths of babes.&quot;  Bravo!
0793518326|1.0|This book is probably fine if you're not a professional musician and don't expect it to read as an orchestral score would. Since it's presented that way though it's very disappointing. Working on \\"Fool on the Hill\\" I found so many errors and inappropriate repeats it was faster and more accurate (wouldn't take much!) to transcribe the tune myself than it was to correct the mistakes in the book. Really, it's too bad since it's such wonderful and imaginative music. It deserves to be documented accurately and respectfully (and larger too please!) Better luck next time.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Machine Head is by far the best metal out and has been for a while now. Buy all there cd two or three time if you have too,just buy them.
B00005JM02|5.0|If you liked all of Pixar's previous movies (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc)then you'll love Finding Nemo.  This movie has everything from adventure and drama to comedy.  All the characters are well thought out; the story is extremely well written; the graphics are astonishing, and the DVD has so many extra features you'll be entertained for hours.  If you don't have a fish tank try their virtual aquarium and see what it would be like to have one. Or, look at all the beautiful original artwork for the film.  Don't forget to play the intro before the movie!  <BR>This movie is tons of fun for kids and adults alike.  If you have a buding artist in your home this DVD is perfect for them.  This is definitely a must have!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Here's another album, like Blink 182's self titled album, that will disappoint older &quot;fans.&quot;  Fans expecting Twelve 2-3 minute songs with 2 chords.  Well, this album is a very good album.  Sure, if you want the same old music you'll be upset.  But the band has changed.  How did they sellout?  If you make music you want to make, how's that selling out?  Selling out is bands that CATER to their stupid fans by making the same album over &amp; over again to sell records.
B00008G9JM|4.0|As a Tull fan since my schooldays (first getting into Thick As A Brick when I was around 13), I can never decide which is my favourite album of theirs. It's usually the one I'm listening to at the time (with the exception of the bland disposable syntho-pap of Under Wraps).  The same rule holds good for A Passion Play ....... but only just.  Whilst superficially similar to TAAB, and even half-reprising a couple of the themes of that masterpiece, APP is certainly not an easy album to get into.<br />I recently bought the enhanced CD, as my old vinyl copy had become so scratchy as to be almost unplayable.   The clarity of sound, the bonus video of the Hare Who Lost his Spectacles and the sumptuous packaging, containing some quite illuminating notes penned recently by Ian Anderson, were absolutely first class. <br />On my long drive into work each day, I've been playing the CD several times (yes, even the Hare bit!). Last night I woke up with the music so stuck in my head that I couldn't sleep for hours. Yes! A quarter of a century on, I had got into APP all over again!  Never mind the somewhat pretentious concept and the downright morbid motif, just listen to the virtuoso performance as themes merge and intertwine in magical fashion. Heavy, almost Black Sabbath-like guitar assaults you from the left, swirling flute and sax from the right, atmospheric keyboard sounds and pounding, mesmeric drums punctuate everything, whilst Ian Anderson's vocals have rarely conveyed such passion.<br />For a pleasant chill-out session I would certainly plump for almost any other Tull album (notably Songs From the Wood, TAAB or Heavy Horses), but for a profoundly moving and ultimately highly satisfying musical appreciation, there is little to compare with A Passion Play.   <br />I couldn't quite bring myself to award the maximum 5 stars, simply because the intensity of this piece precludes too frequent listening, and the whimsical humour of \\"Hare\\" grates after a while (the CD does not permit the listener to skip that track). However this much-maligned album remains an essential purchase for anyone interested in this most cerebral of classic Brit rockers.
B000000NN1|2.0|Having heard segments of Heaven &amp; Hell on the acclaimed &quot;Cosmos&quot; by Carl Sagan.. thought I would love the whole CD...<br />Truthfully I was not impressed, most of this Vangelis composition consists of harsh, discordant janglinging sounds, the vocals at the beginning DO sound Hell-like and slightly offkey!<br />Yes, there are quite hauntingly beautiful portions, but too few...  I cannot speak for everyone, but I expected more... this music just too &quot;noise&quot; sounding .
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am mad at myself for pay per viewing this movie for $3.95!!!!Nice concept, no plot. If you have trouble sleeping, then just watch the movie. You will be asleep in no time!!!
B0001ADAVK|3.0|A female version of Dead Poet Society. The best thing about this movie is it has Julia Roberts and Julia Stiles- two extremely talented actresses. The movie itself is awfully predictable. The only part that really impacted me is when Julia Stiles's character CHOOSES to give up career for family and then points out to Julia Roberts's character that she did exactly what she advocates- makes a choice, even though it is not the choice Julia Roberts advocates. I did also think the other females personalities were well played in the movie; it just needed to be less predictable!
B00018D44U|1.0|Quite possibly the dullest album I have ever heard.  This record is bland taken to previously unreachable extremes; it's music for people who don't really want to listen to music at all - just a soft-focus background hum. Avoid.
B00008AY3L|3.0|As a great fan of Ben I feel very frustrated to say that this album is, in my opinion, his worst. It is for a simple reason: it follows trends and people's tastes. And this is the worst thing that can happen to such a magnificent musician as Ben Harper actually is, for Ben's strenght has always been his nonconformist way of expressing his emotions and fears through music and &quot;Diamond on the Inside&quot; lacks of this eccentricity. Some might say the contrary, that this one seems the most vitalistic and original of his records. Well, it is, in some ways; but if they listen carefuly, they will find that all those powerful messages of love and hate, all those wonderful doubts vivid in &quot;Welcome to the Cruel World&quot; and &quot;Fight For Your Mind&quot; have gone, diluted and repeated in a kind way for the masses. <BR>In spite of this, and in spite of its confusion of genre and styles, I gave it 3 stars - I was about to give it 2 - because I think this album is objectively one of the best album produced in these last two years.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This was really boring.  The premise of a film is to tell a story or entertain the viewer.  This did niether.  I felt as though I was lost the entire movie--ending with an unfufilled feeling of wasting two hours of my life I will never get back.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Saw this on a plane and other than being half an hour too long I thought it was sweet, clever and funny.  Everyone is great, except Keanu who, as usual, comes off as phony as Tom Cruise (who was also completely unconvincing as a doctor).  Fortunately, the movie doesn't hang on Keanu.<br />What wonderful middle aged ladies!  But, in real life, where are single women like Diane Keaton or Frances McDormand or Helen Mirren or Diane Lane????
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Back in 2000 I was highly anticipating this cd to come out. I was expecting too much, because of past cds such as &quot;VirtualXI&quot; and &quot;X-Factor&quot;. It defnitely surpassed my expectations! This cd may not be as great as their other classics, but it is still awesome! There are a lot of great songs like &quot;The Wickerman&quot;, &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Mercenary&quot;, and &quot;The thin line between Love and hate&quot;. My favorite song on the cd is &quot;The Nomad&quot;. I believe it is a clssic and it will take you on a 9:06 rollercoaster ride. BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Bodge is BAck!! So if you like blues get this new one from Bodge (Eric Clapton's nickname, as his fans know).  Bodge is the best so get this.<br />Long live Bodge!!!

B00005LIXT|5.0|The best use of 5.1/DTS sound that I have heard.  The first to<BR>use 5 speakers the way they should be used.  BB and EC perform<BR>beyond any reasonable expectation.  I have 25 these DVD concerts and this one was a gift by someone who did not know there is no video with this DVD.  Just AUDIO - But it is great!
0140386335|5.0|While the first movie was one of my treasured childhood memories, I remember the joy at finding the original book when I was in 5th grade.  At that time, I came away with beautifully vivid images in my mind of the characters, the scenery, the events, and the sheer fantasy of it all.  It immediately jumped to the top of my list of favorite books.  As the years went by, however, I reread the book and was astounded at the amount of depth and insight.  This book is more than just fantasy - it has a real sense of genuine compassion and empathy that was lost in its translation to film.  What is most remarkable about this book is that its power is so subtle, you don't realize it working.  You allow yourself to be swept up in Bastien's struggles, and then by the end, when you have finally put it down, you realize you've come away with something - you may not even sure what it is, but it's there.<br />It was written during the German Expressionist period and fits quite well in the themes of existentialism, connection, and loss - but it never lectures, it never bores, and it never loses its childlike sense of wonder and innocence.  <br />For those looking for a good escapist fantasy tale, this book will steal you away and capture your imagination for a night.  For those looking for a story subtley imbued with insight, compassion, and depth, this book will touch you deeply.  After all these years, this book is still my favorite, and speaking personally - one of the most profoundly life affecting.
B00006JDVV|4.0|See it for yourself. I think this movie is an aquired taste. Also the review titled,&quot;Big Dissapointment!&quot; was copied and pasted. It was originally written by Roger Ebert. Good job &quot;A viewer&quot; from the Bay Area!
B000062Y98|5.0|A Night at the Opera is my FAVORITE B.G album, and accordingly one of my 5 favourite albums of all time. It did take me the longest time to appreciate, but when it finally sank in I realized the greatness of what these Germans have created. As another reviewer put it, this is `THE Epic Heavy Metal Album'.    Unfortunately, -EVERY OTHER REVIEWER- will tell you the same thing about the production being loadd with noise and overpowering choir-type singing. But what they REALLY mean is that B.G altered their sound and it now takes a few extra spins to appreciate the new style. And every reviewer who praises the C.D agrees. (Feel free to check yourself)  I also read an interview with guitarist Andre Olbrich himself who also stressed the need for many listens. The guitarist HIMSELF is warning you of their new style.     So, if YOU are a Blind Guardian fan, I urge you NOT to give up on this album.   Don't be persuaded by those reviewers who didn't give it a chance. Everyone who sticks with it falls in love with it.   I ASSURE you it has everything you love from Nightfall in Middle-Earth and Imaginations from the Other Side, only with a striding, more progressive sound that is sure to charm and amaze you.     It is also worth mentioning that the song `And Then There Was Silence' is without any doubt the greatest epic B.G has ever made. The chorus is so grand and infectious you wouldn't believe me if I told you so.     So, the bottom line is that if you are Blind Guardian fan, you owe it to yourself and the band to buy this. Don't be afraid. Have the courage to trust the masters who brought you `Nightfall' and `Imaginations', because this is definitely their best yet.     Every song is a highlight.
B00005RIKI|5.0|My dad bought me 'Second Helping' for christmas one year, and I coundn't get enough. I had to buy this one and all of the other Skynyrd albums too. 'Freebird' is southern rock at its greatest, 'tuesday's gone' is a great ballad, 'gimme three steps' is really good , and 'simple man' may be some what slower, but is still hard drivin' rock n' roll. The way they blend in the mandolin on 'Missisipi Kid' is great, and 'I ain't the one', and 'poison whiskey' are good rockin' songs too. here's all the songs rated.<br />1. I ain't the one (4 stars)<BR>2. Tuesday's Gone (5 out of 5 stars)<BR>3. Gimme Three Steps (4.5 stars)<BR>4. Simple Man (5 out of 5 stars)<BR>5. Things goin' on (4.5 stars)<BR>6. Mississippi Kid (4 stars)<BR>7. Poison Whiskey (4.5 stars)<BR>8. Freebird (10 out of 5 stars)<br />The demo Mr. Banker has some awesome slide guitar, and 'Down south jukin' is good too.<BR> If you're a skynyrd fan this cd is a definite must have.
0440180295|5.0|I picked up this book about a month ago because I had never read it in high school and I was aware that it was a classic. Now I know why. After reading it in a matter of days, I walked away very pleased and eager to read more books by Vonnegut. Although it is not my all-time favorite novel (that label belongs to John Steinbeck's ingenious &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;), &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is without a doubt the craziest and most abstract novel I've ever read.<br />The story is about Billy Pilgrim who is &quot;unstuck in time&quot; and can travel to his past or future. There is no order in the story whatsoever, in fact it is quite chaotic... which is why it is such a fun read. It does have anti-war elements in it, but I wouldnt say that it is the overriding theme of the novel (although the part of the book where Billy watches a war movie backwards points out the absurdity of war). What Billy learns from the Tralfamadorians (the alien civilization that abducts Billy) is just as important of a theme.<br />Well after I finished this novel, I ordered &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;. I'm halfway through it right now and it is just as impressive. I suggest you pick up one of these two books immediately.

0802136834|5.0|It's thorough. It's accurate. It's all the glamour and betrayl of English court life in a single book. Weir hasn't just raised the bar, she's obliterated it. Everything you could possibly want to know about Henry VIII's wives is in here---the clothes they wore, the gossip surrounding them, and what Ambassador So-and-So thought of their manners. Best of all, it's not the slightest bit boring. If every history book was written this way, the world would be a much better place. Do not hesitate: buy it now.
B0001VWP8I|3.0|As with her previous CD's, Anastacia's latest sports impressive vocals but, often, less than stellar songs. With a strong and soulful singing style (yes much like Taylor Dayne) Anastacia can elevate plain songs and make them more interesting.  A true credit to her talent and charisma.  But once again she fails to write or receive A-list songs that match her A-list voice.  With the exception of Left Outside Alone and Heavy On My Heart, I found myself wondering and wishing she had written with more standout and experimental producers.  More often than not Anastacia's music sounds as if it is ten to fifteen years old-a dated sound (by album three) that I am now wondering if she is responsible for encouraging.  Still, if you are a fan of power vocals and a truly engaging vocal style this CD is worth buying.
B0000039PW|4.0|Ready to Die is definitely a hip-hop classic, but Biggie is definitely not the greatest MC of all time. He might be in the top 20. Rakim is the best lyricist ever in my opinion, but Wu-Tang and A Tribe Called Quest are pretty close. I could go down the list of MCs more lyrically proficient and more accomplished than Biggie, but I will get back to the topic of my review. Biggie would have been much better off with a producer other than Puff who is the most unoriginal producer ever. I feel Biggie's influence was felt more than his actual music. He did a lot to bring attention back to NYC artists.
0880389052|4.0|This is a great book about Drizzt's upbringing as a drow and his struggles against his culture.  A lot of light is shown on the mysterious world of Menzoberanzon and the rest of the underdark, as well as the drow ways and society.<br />With lots of action and great story telling, this book is hella fun to read.  The intrigue and secret (but not so secret) plotting and betrayals that are so common in Drizzt's homeland help the reader to better understand the ways of the drow and the reasons for the corruption of most drow people.  The fights between Drizzt and Zak were sweet and the last part of the book, in which Drizzt killed Masoj and Alton and defied his matron mother Malice, was awesome.  Exciting stuff.
0783231202|4.0|The word \\"powerful\\" has become a cliche when describing movies, which is unfortunate. However this film contains material that really moved me to strong emotion- something rare in today's bland entertainment market. Amistad does not simplify slavery as the above reviewer stated- rather it shows the audience the reality of slavery, and that we as a nation were guilty of supporting a terrible injustice. America embraced slavery for many years after most of our European friends had abolished it- a fact clearly demonstrated in this film by the presence of a british naval officer tasked with finding and destroying a carribean slave base.<br />This movie does revolve around the courtroom, but does so in a way that is both entertaining and educational. It shows how even the best courts can be warped or crippled by political influence and red tape. The characters are simple yet believable. In particular the roles of Cinque and John Q. Adams are played masterfully.<br />The speech given by Adams at the conclusion is a word-for-word transcript of his actual speech given to the Supreme Court. This speech is one of the more bold and patriotic speeches given in American history, and gives me goose bumps every time I read/see it. Amistad is an exceptional movie that forces the viewer to look back on our past with an unflinching eye and embrace both our courage and our shame as a nation.

1567184855|5.0|It took many years after leaving the monastery for me firmly to decide that the Catholic Church was just another corporation driven by power and money. I threw out the baby with the bath water.<br />Many years later I read Dr. Raymond Moody's &quot;Life After Life&quot; which introduced me to a spiritual world I might be able to understand and rationalize rather than just believe. Dr. Moody interviewed over 100 people who were declared clinically (brain and heart) dead, and later revived. He tells their stories. Dr. Newton's &quot;Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives&quot; picked up where &quot;Life After Life&quot; left off, and takes a giant leap toward understanding the life of the immortal soul.<br />I'd like to live my life looking toward that &quot;last judgment&quot; I learned about in school. Dr. Moody tells how a &quot;being of light&quot; asks a non-verbal question which none of his subjects is able to reproduce precisely in words. This early discovery of Dr. Moody was published in 1975. Dr. Newton's 1994 &quot;Journey of Souls&quot; explains the process more thoroughly. Dr. Newton hypnotizes people, and helps them explore their past lives and their spiritual existence between lives while under hypnosis. The non-verbal question is far more complex than &quot;What have you learned?&quot;, &quot;How have you loved and been loved?&quot;, or &quot;Was it worth it?&quot; -- the approximations interpreted by Moody's subjects.<br />Dr. Newton, through summaries and transcripts of his hypnotherapy sessions, helps us learn about spirit guides, (guardian angels), our welcoming into the spiritual world after death (judgment), and the maturation of the souls (karma/nirvana/the beatific vision).<br />I've looked for this kind of guidance for years in the monastery, in Europe, in Asia, in the Middle East, in scriptures, books, fellowships, churches, temples and synagogues.

0385504209|4.0|This is a great book that is worth reading. The whole concept regarding DaVinci is very intriguing and you do not run cross many dull moments in the story. The whole ordeal makes you wonder and think about what may have happened. Some people have a problem regarding some of the facts presented but readers must keep in mind that this book is fiction, not meant to be taken as fact.<br />Its a great novel full of action and suspense. I have not read any other works by Dan Brown, but may start now.
B000002J23|4.0|Some bands have their moments of drama, and this (very appropriately so captured in the album's title) was largely it for 70s prog super-outfit Yes. Loosing frontman Jon Anderson (though just for this one album) and keyboard god, Rick Wakeman, Yes founder Chris Squire turned to two longtime Yes followers to fill in for them: Trevor Horn (who'd stick with the band as producer of their two following albums and later become a legendary producer of many, Seal and Pet Shop Boys among them) and keyboard player Geoff Downes (who'd later go on to become a part of ASIA, alongside Yes companion Steve Howe, ELP's Carl Palmer, and ex-King Crimson and ex-UK, John Wetton).<br />'Drama' is definitely not Yes' best musical effort, but as a transition point for the band it's considerably better than many other musical corners around. Indeed, it walks a fine line that slightly flirts with a more commercial sound than traditional Yes, while not selling out, not at least the way the first Asia album did: in many points in the album, actually, it feels as if this is closer to how ASIA could have sounded had it not become such a commercial act as it did.<br />Favorite songs? I've always loved the opening and closing tracks, as well as the introspective \\"Into The Lens\\", but the truth is that the whole album holds up very well and can be looked as also a bridge (dramatic or not), strategically sitting at the turn of the decade (not of the century, that's for sure), between the more classic Yes of the seventies and the newer and more commercial Yes that the world would get to know with 1983's super-hit \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\"
B000002UVZ|5.0|\\"Life's Rich Pageant,\\" besides being my favorite of the early album titles has my favorite songs of the jangle pop era of R.E.M. I pride myself in how much I adore Michael Stipe, Mike Mills, Peter Buck, and the sadly gone Bill Berry. This definitely exhibits why with feel good super accessible tracks like \\"Superman\\" and \\"I Believe.\\" \\"Begin The Begin\\" and \\"These Days\\" have an edgier feel that seize me and make me sing along ardently. The combination of slightly dark songs with light jangly songs creates this bed of R.E.M. impressiveness that begs to be cozied up with. It is versatile in a way, but very true to their roots (way before their phenomenal intense experimentation), and epitomizes them to this day. This was my key to appreciating the early days even though many will first reccomend \\"Murmur\\" or perhaps \\"Reckoning.\\" Those feel slightly more constricted and produce less of an enthusiastic listen (when compared with \\"Pageant\\" only, as these are all really exceptional albums in my eyes). I would have to pick \\"Fall On Me\\" as the number one classic R.E.M. song from this album, despite being in love with each of the songs. Mike Mills's backup vocals are always so beautiful, and this is in my opinion, the best example of that. I highly recommend each one of R.E.M.'s CD's, without exception, but \\"Out Of Time\\" got me into R.E.M. \\"Automatic For The People\\" made me realize that they are beyond brilliant musicians, and \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" has made me understand that their early works need to be heard by anyone who loves this otherworldly band.<BR>-Ari<BR>[...]
B00003CXAY|5.0|The only shortcoming of the masterpiece epic &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; on DVD is technical: the tape-to-DVD transfer is quite noisy: it's evident in some shots and colors where the shimmering &quot;noise&quot; detracts slightly from the visuals.  Nevertheless this is a groundbreaking film, and seeing it 21 years after its cinematic release, yah it blows me (and anyone else who sees it)away.   <br />So hey GR howzaboot a complete remastering, on par with the excellent soundtrack remaster?  This film deserves nothing less.  One of the top 5 films of all time.
B000000OMB|5.0|I first heard of Asia while driving home from a night class in the spring semester 1982, but the snow we were fighting made it seem anything like spring.  There were four of us in the car that night when WEBN played &quot;Heat Of The Moment&quot;.  Rob actively disliked the song.  Mark guessed King Crimson, Bob guessed Yes, and I thought ELP.  Turned out we were all partly right.  I bought the album almost immediately, only to have my sister ruin it by dropping the stylus while trying to go back to listen to her favorite song for the hundredth time in a row.  Asia may have seemed contrived to some, overdone to others, but I've always thought of it as a perfect snapshot of the spring and summer of 1982.  From my way of thinking, music is at it's best when twenty+ years later it still gives you that brief taste of life as it was the first time you heard it.  This album is like that for me.  The albums that followed were decent, but this one never failed to play all the way through.  I can point to a favorite song, or rather some favorites, but I can't say that there's anything on it that I regard as inferior to the others.  That doesn't happen often, so when it does occur, I make sure to add it to my road library immediately.

B00006879E|5.0|I liked this CD.  It's nothing ground breaking, but it's a nice change to hear music like this on the radio.  It's different for todays standards of &quot;popular&quot; music.  <br />The best songs have to be the ones that are on the radio as well, which are &quot;Harder to Breath&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;, but the rest of the cd is still listenable.  The only song that I skip is the song that was recorded live, just because I don't enjoy live recordings that much.  I'd rather be at the concert...<br />Overall, I don't have any huge complaints.  It's interesting music for what is on the radio today, and I'm just glad they play their own instruments.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Uh oh, where do i begin? First of all from the very outset; this movie CHARMED THE SOCKS OFF OF ME!  I do not know ANY of the actors/actresses in this movie but as far as I am concerned was \\"BRILLIANT\\" or \\"AWESOME\\" as they say in the USA. I see this movie as one of the great \\"people\\" movies that I have ever seen. I am not a movie critic and I have no critique about this movie. It has all the elements I would expect from a people movie, such as LOVE, FEAR, ALONE, LOVED, UNCERTAINTY, (trace elements of) JEALOUSY/ JEALOSY. There are elements of HAPPINESS, SADNESS, FRIENDSHIP also. IF. you are into action, adventure, gun fights, explosions, violence, or gore, then this is *NOT* the movie for you. The ONLY gripe I have about this movie is feeling compelled to write this review, as it helps to sell more products via Amazon .com... NOT because I have a way with words, cos I don't.I really just needed to write something (if not a million words if I could) about it. If you are man or woman enough to watch it without a slight tear in your eye then you were never born with a heart.END OF! Oh BTW. I have NEVER been an emotional person.EVER. until now...until this bloody brilliant movie. Hand on heart, stick a needle in my eye.<br />stercus_accidit@ntlworld.com<br />Andy<BR> -X-
B0001HAHXW|4.0|This is great, one of the best tribute album I have ever heard. Eric Clapton really does blues legend Robert Johnson justice with this album of covers.<br />Robert Johnson is good and all but Clapton whipes the floor with him on this album, he makes all the songs his own. His version of 'Live In Vain' is the best version I have ever heard, and yes even better then the original. 'Traveling River Side Blues' is the only song he doesnt make his own and that is because Led Zeppelin already did the best version of the song.<br />This is great because all the songs were basicaly left the same and were done the way Robert Johnson did them and that was the way they were intended to be. But the songs that Eric Clapton recorded a little bit differntly are killer as well they are still great blues songs but with a sligh modern twist.
0736657134|3.0|I have never read one of the series with Patrick O'Brian.  I usually love sea tails.  I got the audio version of this.  This was an enjoyable telling of life at sea and the action and adventure of the Napoleonic Wars.  <br />I enjoyed leering all the nautical terms.  I especially liked the tour the Doctor got explaining all the different sails.  The commander seems more like a solider of fortune than a British servicing officer of the line.  He had many quirks like the dealing with women and the problems with his wig.<br />I'll have to admit the funniest part of this book was the story of the seaman who buggered the goat when I got to that part I was laughing out loud.<br />The sea battles in the story seemed pretty graphic and the injuries real.  The characters were interesting.<br />The one thing I didn't like about the book was the ending.  I thought it was pretty disappointing and unexpected and the book ended pretty quickly as well. <br />I think next time I will have to get the book and not the audio version because I don't think I savored it enough.
6305784116|1.0|Perhaps the weakest animated Disney film in history with a storyline to match The Aristocats is sure to put you to sleep.  Disney rips off from its earlier film, not just from a story point of view but the musical score is uplifted from previous Disney films.  Altogether The Aristocats feels like microwaved Disney!
B00005JMSE|5.0|Though I am a comics reader, I have never paid much attention to Mike Mignola's \\"Hellboy.\\"  All the same, I became intrigued through the high praise that the series has drawn from fandom in general.  It was without any other preconceptions that I saw an advance screening of the movie just last night, courtesy of Big Planet Comics of Bethesda, MD.  I can only say that I was blown away.<br />The visuals are AWESOME, the makeup worthy of an award or two, and the characters instantly likeable.  Best of all, this is not your comic-to-film project that smacks of commercialism and opportunities for merchandising.  Not only does the project have a lot of heart, but you can tell that writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's entire crew put their best into the picture.  Though all of the cast deserves huge kudos in some measure, Ron Perlman as Hellboy is the definitive lead man for the role.  He fits into the character so easily that it's like the Hellboy part was written for him - and Ron must've had a blast playing him, too.  Throw into the mix Mignola's signature creature design, CGI Cthulhu-like monsters, demon-worshipping Nazis, more action and suspense than your usual Summer blockbuster, and all you can do is walk out of the movie theater being hardly able to wait for a sequel or two.  I hope they give the eventual DVD release a 2-disc set treatment, with lots of interviews and \\"making-of\\" featurettes.  Having watched \\"Hellboy,\\"  I can see what the talk has been about and am planning on checking out the other graphic novels in the series.  Believe me, you don't have to be a comics fan to thoroughly enjoy \\"Hellboy\\" - and if you are a Mike Mignola fan, I just bet that this is probably your dream come true.
B00005UW9T|3.0|Anastasia almost succeeded at being a great piece of animated entertainment along side such films as Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.  What went wrong?  The entire concept!  With all his evil powers and schemeing Rasputin can't kill Anastasia.  How is this so?  If he can send evil demons to dismantle a train surely he can drop a piano on our heroine.  I guess villians aren't as smart as they use to be.  The songs work well except for the possible exceptions of the intro.  A guy singing in his underwear?  Whats up with that?  Did Rasputin really need singing bugs to back him up? No. Other than that I did enjoy the film. But I have to add this as a final note.  Did it have to be based on the life of Anastasia?  Couldn't it be reworked under a different name?  Oh well, I'll just wait for Selena: The animated film. Can't wait to see the evil yolanda singing and dancing!

B00004R99F|3.0|A Goofy Movie started out with a huge comical bang and strong storyline concerning father and son.  The entire cast of toons and the music made it great fun.  But just as Goofy snaps at his son on the edge of a road the writers feel the need to let Goofy's car roll off into the river.  Thus killing the emotional compact that could have built up here.  A Goofy movie fares as an average film due to this.  And did we need to see Goofy and Max singing on top of a car floating in the river?  This was the only lame musical number in the movie.  A Goofy Movie had the potential to be a great film but sadly they tripped at the finish line.

B0000640VM|1.0|Back in the late eighties I recall seeing the trailer for Oliver and Company and I got caught up in the hype.  Unfortunatly, I didn't have the money to see the film and it was never released to video after it's debut.  So when the film had it's re-issue you bet I was quick to see it.  I expected an exciting story, great eighties music, and stunning animation.  Instead I got cartoon music, overly cute acting, and a poor story.  Disney had stapled this film as appealing to the teenage crowd.  How?  This is most defintely a kid movie.  The music was not contempory to its time and the human characters lacked a lot to be desired. Here is what I expected (and in detail!).  Great eighties music, a strong gangster villian (preferably Italian), and a guy down on his luck who you could relate to instead of a bumbling bum.  But sigh...they had to throw in a cute girl and singing birds. Sigh...
B00005JM02|4.0|Another winner for the former Disney partner.  The CG just keeps getting better.  Rich coloring, oustanding character movements amusing dialog in the screenplay, what a wonderful family friendly movie.  The is an above average 4 star movie that is worth purchasing, and we did.  Strongly recommended.
0064407667|5.0|This is a gripping novel about three children who's parents die and thet have to go and stay with a distant relative.This is a bad move because the only thing this horrid man cares about is the fortune the baudelaires recieve.He goes to desparate measuress such as trying to marry one of them, just to recieve this money.This sort of story line carries on in different ways in the whole series!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The film is not perfect, obviously.  But the backlash against it has been unfair to say the least.  Aside from the acting of young Jake Lloyd, the film is hugely entertaining, gorgeous to look at, and is just as mythical and deep as the original trilogy.  Don't just jump on the bandwagon and mindlessly criticize it like many people have done (especially critics).  Give it an honest assessment, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00004TDTO|5.0|The Film:<BR>Jaws, as most of us know is the story of a lonely shark looking for love ... or it is the story of a vicious eating machine with a penchant for the dramatic.  Hailed as an all time classic by most, this is the film that put Spielberg on the map.  The emotion from the characters jumps out and grabs you.  You can feel the fear and the sorrow in everyone.  Not much can be written about it here that has not already been seen elsewhere.  I would qualify this as a horror movie.  The dramatic tension and the build up creates a real presence of fear and horror, that today's special effects driven splatter fests cannot even dream of achieving<BR>About the DVD:<BR>While this is only a one disc edition, they still had room to include a making of featurette, deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers and a trivia game and a screen saver.  A fine assortment of toys that would round out any film, but accent this one perfectly. <br />T
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Ok, since I saw the movie, I've been searching for this song every time I was on the computer. It's the song that plays when Jack Black is going to the Battle of Bands when the kids come and get him. It plays in the school bus too when they are going to the battle of bands. In the part of the song we hear, there is a lot of bass and drums and the guitar comes in only when they enter the backstage. It is so good! Please write the answer in another review so I can finally hear the song. Thank you
B0000TLA9G|2.0|This CD isn't a greatest hits, where the band is concerned. It's a greatest hits that their label, Geffen, thought was appropriate. <br />Sorry, listening to those songs again makes me wonder what a REAL greatest hits would actually sound like, and feel like.<br />This is an attempt at Geffen to make some money on a dead band.<br />Well, perhaps it's not all dead... Maybe one day Axl will get off of his lazy ass and release Chinese Democracy and show us all once again what Guns N' Roses was, and should be.
6303257801|5.0|I have to admit, when colorization first came out I was shocked and offended.  I couldn't imagine anyone messing with the classics, including King Kong (one of my all-time favorites).  But when I finally broke down and got this colorized version it has become one of my favorites as well.  <br />Admittedly, colorization destroys some of the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of a classic horror film.  The positive side, however, is how much easier it is to distinguish background and small objects, particularly in the jungle scenes, compared to the black &amp; white version on a small television screen.<br />When Ted Turner first bought these film rights and began colorizing them, he threatened to pull the black &amp; white versions from distribution.  That would be criminal.  But having both available, I now realize, is a plus.
B00006CXXU|5.0|To whoever said that Christina is a bum and must die, you suck bigtime!!!! She's so very talented and her lyrics and voice are the best thing in the whole world! This is such a great album and you say Norah Jones, celine Dion are better than her??? GoD!! You must listen to Ms.Jones only if you are suffering from a severe case of Insomnia! Her album is so boring. I do not understand why Norah Jones fans come and rate Britney and Christina's albums. You're wasting your time. This is a great Cd!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I love many artistic \\"Indy\\" films. I love many subtle multi- layered films. I love many unique \\"outside the box\\" films. I love many emotionally \\"dark\\" films with \\"reality\\" endings. I am artist myself who usually \\"gets it\\" when it comes to films. <br />So now that you can't stereotype me as one of those guys with a short attention span or \\"left brain\\" rigidity, allow me the privilege of body slamming this over rated, self pretentious \\"movie\\" to the turf. <br />The problem with this movie is that it tries SO HARD to take you on an artistic, postmodern journey of two people lost in Japan and lost in their own emotional reductionism, that it actually fools some people into thinking that it works. When in reality it is more like that ugly piece of modern art that wins first place in an art show because some judges are beyond the reach of earth's gravity. As a result everyone else loves to throw dirt on it.<br />There are already plenty of other reviews explaining the many flaws of this film. So rather than bore you with redundancy, here is my unique contribution to the ever growing dirt stain on this film. <br /> If I took 1000 monkeys with 1000 pens and gave them 1000 years, they still would not be able to write a script as vacuous and \\"Lost\\" as this disconnected piece of soulless, postmodern Pablum. The \\"great\\" acting is SO subtle and minimalist, at times I thought I was watching the zombies in \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". I often like non-descript \\"mystery\\" endings, but in this stinker, such an ending is the final dagger that puts this torturous thing out of its' self-absorbed misery. The fact that some of my friends never made it through to the end, speaks volumes toward the great propensity of this \\"film\\" to waist your time. That this movie was nominated for even ONE academy award is proof positive that the smog in LA is causing serious brain damage.  <br />There are only two things \\"good\\" about this movie.  The travelogue scenes of Japan and the title of the movie which translates, \\"WARNING! Get lost and rent a good National Geographic special on Japan instead.\\"
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this CD a lot. I bought it in december and I still listen to it everyday - without getting bored! There are a couple of tracks that get boring after a while (Early Morning and Outrageous) but the rest of them are a exciting as ever. This is a great album put out by Britney and I higly recommend it to all pop/rnb fans. <BR>Quick rating - <BR>MATM - 4/5 - disapppointing at first. Catches on later.<BR>Boom boom - 4/5 - Southern hip hop beats on this one.

0060922583|5.0|The Holographic Universe is at times truly spellbinding, offering a number of revolutionary ideas explained in a straightforward manner that a non-scientist can understand and apply to daily life.  The central premise -- that the universe is a common creation of humans projecting our ideas and mental images -- is not as startling as it first seems once Talbot explains the basis for his theory.  And the really intriguing thing is that the concept draws nearly as heavily from spiritual traditions as it does from scientific principles.<br />For years I have struggled to bring together my intuitive spiritual convictions with my analytical turn of mind and basic common sense.  This book goes a long way toward helping me integrate those various approaches to knowledge, without forcing me to discount or deny one or another frame of reference.  I highly recommend this and other books by Michael Talbot to anyone who is curious, and open-minded, about the nature of reality.
B00000JLWW|2.0|Titanic is a great story made into a poor movie because of nudity and pervasive profanity.  The tragic story of the sinking of the Titanic is told in this movie through the memory of an elderly lady named Rose who, when she was seventeen, was a passenger on Titanic.  Rose was a first class passenger who met Jack, an artist and a steerage class passenger.  Rose and Jack fell in love.  Up to that point in the movie, my biggest complaint was profanity, including repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain.  However, then Rose asks Jack to draw her picture while she wears nothing more than a 52 carat diamond broach.  It is this drawing that is found in modern times on the sunken Titanic and is seen as a clue to treasure hunters who are looking for the 52 carat diamond.  The reason I give the movie only two stars is that this drawing and the search for the diamond is nothing more than a device used to show Kate Winslet, the actress who plays Rose, in the nude.  I do not understand why the producers and director of Titanic didn't understand that they hurt their movie by employing this silly device as an excuse to show Kate's naked body to eager teenage boys.  The love story was a good way to personalize the tragedy of the Titanic and the special effects were really spectacular.  Hollywood should learn when they trash an otherwise good movie with nudity and profanity that their work suffers.  This movie could have been great, instead it is just another movie which caters to prurient interests.
B00005JM02|5.0|Visually this is the best and the story is real heart felt. My personal animated favorites are still Little Mermaid and Alladin but this is right up there.  Lot's of fun extras on the dvd for kids. Voices are done great and I liked this better than Toy Story 1/2.
0151008116|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I esp. liked how the author would insert small comments about his observations of the man from whom the story came from.

1577311523|5.0|This can be a profound, life-changing book for some people. I am saddened but not surprised by the negative reviews here. Some people are not ready to hear Eckhart's message, or it is not written in a way that speaks to them. It is somewhat paradoxical, really, because one reason they cannot hear it is that they are run by their minds, which is what the book aims to address. In short, Tolle makes eastern spirituality accessible to westerners.<br /><br />When I first encountered Tolle, I must admit the book changed me in significant ways. Now, looking over it after years have passed, I find myself thinking, \\"Duh.\\" But that is really a kudo to him - I \\"got it\\" and no longer need the teacher. Indeed, I have referenced this book a couple of times in my own: [[ASIN:1439204748 The Beat Handbook: 100 Days of Kerouactions]].<br /><br />When I recommend this book to friends - and I have done so frequently - I offer to buy the book from them if they are not glad they bought it. So far, I haven't had to buy a copy. Enough said (except that the audio version is a must-have as well).
B000022TSW|5.0|I have been watching this show religiously for the last 4 seasons or so, so many of the storylines and characters now are different from the ones in this movie.  For a TV show that relies so heavily on topical humor, one would think this movie would become outdated, but you can never get sick of it. For a while, I was gunning for a second movie, but how do you follow up with a sequel to this?  Best chance would probably be to make another movie with a plot completely independent of &quot;Bigger, Longer, Uncut.&quot; Whether at home on comedy central, at a party, or on a date, this movie never fails to crack up the entire room. <br />It's vulgar, offensive, immature, and hilarious. It's also completely evident how brilliant creaters Matt Stone and Trey Parker are. Much of the movie is biting social commentary of censorship, political correctness, and war while many of the most memorable scenes rely on parodies of everything from Disney to rap videos. <br />The musical numbers also add to the colorful visual extravaganza.  The &quot;La Resistance Medley&quot; (paying tongue-in-cheek homage to Les Miserables)is one of the most impressive and well-executed pieces I've ever seen or heard-- incorporating 4 of the musical themes througout the movie into one fun and memorable song. At any rate, while not for young children, I recommend everybody see it at least once in their life.  It's so incredibly funny, you'll find yourself watching it over and over.
0767805712|5.0|I really liked this movie!<BR>The plot is quite interesting even if it is quite classical (in a world of injustice, the good deserving guy takes the place of the genetically perfect and realises his dreams by working hard). Set in the world of Gattaca, the plot keeps you interested thourough the movie (you can only guess who the murderer is), there even is a slight touch of humor. The characters are realistic and interesting and quite endearing. The end is quite good, not too much the happy-ending type.<BR>I was concerned that this would be one of those sci-fi stories where the special effects are the only important thing, so I was enchanted to find out that there were no battles between human and machines, for example.<BR>I found the whole idea of this world of genetical perfection quite captivating and it made me reflect about the future. The world that is portraied isn't really one that you would want to live in, the &quot;invalid&quot; being denied a normal life and the &quot;valid&quot; not being very happy either. It shows that some kind of discrimination will always exist.<BR>The cast is outstanding, Ethan Hawk and Uma Thurman are both good actors, but Jude Law was the one that attracted my attention by his great performance. I really think he was wonferful. His character really added something to the film as you discover the &quot;human&quot; under the image of perfection. <BR>Supported by a perfect cast, this movie really makes you reflect and you won't forget it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was one of the few who watched this when it was on Fox, and I almost cried when it was canceled.  My husband got me the DVD for Christmas and I have to say, it was the best gift he has ever picked out!<br />You believe the characters, you can't wait to see what happens next.  I wish there were more than 14 episodes!  Can't wait for the movie to come out. Everyone we have shown this to has run out and gotten a copy for themselves.<br />Best series ever!!!!!!!!
B00000K31V|2.0|This movie made me feel sick! <BR>Whatever world the characters are in there are always bodyparts laying around, being cut, destroyed or disected (and I don't mention the mutant amphibians that finish in a repulsive chinese dish and that get eaten!). There is no sense in the story, it's just about killing people without understanding why. The characers try to explain it, but you get so confused with all this non-sense! Forget reflecting, just turn off the TV. The best part of this movie is the end which could be described as quite good (when they're back to reality).<BR>I liked the cast, especialy Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, who played quite well (I really hope they didn't choose to play in this movie or I'd be concerned)<BR>I really regret the movie being so bad, I could have enjoyed it if there had been less meaningless violence and less disgusting body parts.
0792164903|3.0|I rented this movie a few days ago, not expecting wonders, only a good job from Depp who never fails to deliver, and perhaps some interesting environments created by Burton. What I got was absolute confusion. All of the characters that looked and acted similar where always in a scene together, and then later the viewer was supposed to be clear on every intricate plot detail. <br />And what was with all of the side plots that were basically insignificant to the overall story? Crane's mother... how does that fit in? <br />The twist at the end shocked me. Not because it was so brilliant or well thought out, but because the character was not developed AT ALL. I barely knew who they were, then all of a sudden they are the star of the show. Whaaa? Did I fall asleep for an hour? No, but I did wake up to a beautifully haunting but very confusing story.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Like the commercial says &quot;It's been a while coming&quot; but you knew it was going to happen. I am both happy an dissappointed in Guns N Roses having a greatest hits album.<BR> <br />I'm not saying they don't deserve one...hell they're my favorite band ...but often a greatest hits album signals the end of a band's career. Not always ...but often. Axl is apparently refusing to release the forever forthcoming album of new GNR material Chinese Democracy beacuse he doesn't want two GNR albums out in the same year. Hell Axl you released two at the same time with the Use Your Illusions albums. <BR>  <BR>But anyway ...the album is balanced out fairly equally. Three cuts from Appetite For Destruction (&quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot; and ofcourse &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot;). Their acoustic hit &quot;Patience&quot; from Lies (there was only four new tunes on the album after all ...and needless to say &quot;One In A Million&quot; wasn't going to be included). Three tracks from Use Your Illusion 1 (&quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry (original)&quot; and &quot;Live And Let Die&quot;). Four tracks from Use Your Illusion 2 (&quot;Knockin On Heaven's Door&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;). Two tracks from The Spaghetti Incident ? (&quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot;, &quot;Ain't It Fun&quot;) and a soundtrack contribution (a cover of The Rolling Stones' &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; from Interview With A Vampire). <BR>  <BR>I'll admit I'm a little dissappointed in this as a greatest hits. For one &quot;Yesterdays&quot; is included from Use Your Illusion 2 but not &quot;Estranged&quot;? The Spaghetti Incident?  album wasn't exactly a smash ....plus it was all cover songs. &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot; wasn't a hit. &quot;Ain't It Fun&quot; while a kick ass song wasn't even a single. GNR's rendition of &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; did very little for the band. Many fans didn't even know about it. <BR>  <BR>But hey for those of you who think &quot;they have a couple good tunes&quot; I'm sure you'll be happy enough. And for younger and newer fans this may be a good introduction to the band for you. But for us hardcore gunners it falls a few roses short of a bouquet.  <br />KF
B000007363|4.0|Im a huge radiohead fan, so for me the two bonus tracks are very nice to have, especially when trying to build a b-sides collection, but for the average consumer the 2 extra tracks probably arent worth the extra money. The album itself is excellent, a huge transition form their less than stellar Pablo Honey. While it is still akin to that album, much of their greatness shines through in &quot;Just&quot;, &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;. Overall, great cd, but maybe not worth the extra dough.
B00005OC0G|3.0|It seems when all is said and done, Anne-Sophie Mutter's career will be divided into two periods. The first period, beginning with her discovery by Karajan, will find her as a brilliant soloist and musician as represented by the many recordings she made in this first half of her life. However, the second period will show Mutter as a narcissistic technician interested in self-aggrandizing performance that have little musical precedence or interpretive basis. This performance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto certainly belongs in the latter category.    Mutter's completely unmusical handling of the first movement is quite frankly rather disgusting. Of all the pieces to smear with mannered retards, scratchy tone, and vulgar phrasing, why the Beethoven Violin Concerto? Is Mutter so out-of-tune as a musician as to miss the basic constant rhythmic pulse that begins the concerto - the five strokes of the timpani, the heartbeat of the work - that pervades the whole movement? Is she unfamiliar with historical performances practices, the difference between high-classicism and high-romanticism (if that is even what you can call her playing), and basic violin pedagogy? This is a shocking gratuitous performance that represents exactly how not to play this concerto. Tempos fluctuate throughout the entirety of the first movement with no contextual or musical basis, peppered with bizarre dynamic fluctuations, single-handedly destroying Beethoven's clear rhythmic and vocal intentions. Mutter refuses to yield to the orchestra in the various passages where the violin accompanies, attacking her instrument with vehement resistance. And she does all this with the most unflattering sound, coaxing from her instrument some truly bizarre sounds. And all this done over the course of an excruciating 27 minutes.    The second and third movements fare somewhat better, if only by comparison, but Mutter continues to apply her own brand of interpretive graffiti over the entire Largretto, plagued by intonation problems and rather coarse-toned playing. The energetic Rondo is probably the best part of the concerto (perhaps in no small part because the end is near) due mainly to Masur's stronger framework, which forces the capricious Mutter to work within some structure. All in all, this is a pretty vile release from an artist who seems so bored with her repertoire that she must mutilate it in order to keep herself intellectually and musically satisfied. That the listener will find the same satisfaction is hard to believe.    It is a shame, really, that this performance was so bad, for it was taken from Kurt Masur's last subscription concert with the New York Philharmonic. All the more troubling considering the second half of the program, a performance of Beethoven's \\"Eroica,\\" was phenomenal. Masur showed uncharacteristic fervor in his conducting and the Philharmonic responded in tow with a performance that hung fire. Not only was the energy palpable, but the mutual respect both orchestra and music director shared for each other was moving. Why that performance was not captured, yielding to this arrogantly unmusical account of the Violin Concerto will remain a mystery only Deutsche Grammophon can answer.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|The first half of this release is a nice sampling of the Beatles' best years of 1962-65. The second half offers a bright spot or two with Get Back and The Long and Winding Road, but is otherwise forgettable.  Nevertheless, for the price, this is a good alternative to some of the other greatest hits offerings, even if you only play the first 14 songs.  3 stars.
0380789019|5.0|Wow. When I first heard of Neverwhere, I didn't expect it to be so well written. Gaiman has done more than written a modernized version of Alice in Wonderland, he has created an entire world that is both fascinating and horrifying at the same time, both amusing and deadly at the same time. His wonderful tie-ins with the real Underground (&quot;Mind the Gap!&quot; and &quot;The Earl's Court&quot;) make the book even greater. The ending was not quite what I expected, but it leaves the reader with a sense of closure anyway.<br />A definitely good read.
0671027344|5.0|I've read this book about three times and each and every time I read it, It always gives me the same feeling but in a different impact. This book is such a good book. It changed my views and opinions on things. Defiantly a good book to read.

6305428522|5.0|Directed by Robert Redford and nominated for several Academy Awards, this 1994 film tells the true story of the quiz show \\"21\\" in the 1950s and how the contestants were given the answers ahead of time and coached for the show.  As a child at the time I remember the hoopla and how whole families would watch this show together, holding their collective breaths during the competitions for big money.  It was a time of innocence and the viewing community was deceived.  And never again have the networks won that kind of public trust.<br /><br />Paul Attansio adapted the screenplay from the book written by Richard N. Goodwin who was the government investigator at the time.  In the film this role is played by Rob Morrow who is determined to uncover the deception.  All the other actors are excellent too - most notably John Turturro who is cast as a Jewish man from Queens who is allowed to win for seven weeks before being replaced by Charles Van Doran, a professor at Columbia who came from a long line of scholars.  Paul Scofield also shines in the role of Van Doran's father, who stands by his son even though the family is disgraced by the publicity.<br /><br />It's not just the quiz show phenomenon that comes alive in this film.  It is the nature of the times as well as the anti-Semitic undercurrent and cultural conflict that was endemic.  Usually, when I see a film about the fifties, it looks like someone's imagination of what those times were like.  But this film was different.  I really felt I was right back there, many years before computers or even color television, sitting wide-eyed in front of that black and white set and admiring the contestants for being so smart.  Times have changed.  Now, we know we're being manipulated.  And there is no outrage.<br /><br />I was unprepared to love this film so much.  There is tension throughout and consistently wonderful acting.  The dialog was authentic and the actors all played their roles with subtlety.  They became the characters in the film and I wound up caring about all of them.  \\"Quiz Show\\" is a simply wonderful film and I give it one of my highest recommendations.  Don't miss it.aracters in the film and I wound up caring about all of them.  \\"Quiz Show\\" is a simply wonderful film and I give it one of my highest recommendations.  Don't miss it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said about these films?!  These films are fantastic for people of any ages.  They have some of the most beloved characters in movie history.  I don't want to start an editorial review of all the films, but I do think they are all worthy of 5 star reviews.  I for one want to give my 2 cents on the Special Edition vs. Original Trilogy (77-83 versions).  I like the changes made in the special editions, I think they are breathtaking.  But I have been a fan for a long time, I do disagree with Mr. Lucas's decision not to release the theatrical versions along with the Special Editions, I believe they are a part of history that should be preserved.  Nevertheless I will buy the set the first day the set comes out because these are fantastic movies, special edition or originals!
B00008RH3L|5.0|I saw this 1990 film in a theater when it first came out but had generally forgotten it.  Except, that is, for one memorable scene.  That's when John Turturro, taken to Miller's Crossing for the purpose of being murdered by the mob, begs for his life and Gabriel Bryne, cast as the hit man, has to make a decision.  It's all more complicated than that of course.  After all, this is a Coen brothers' film where style is everything, and the characters are complex and edgy.<br /><br />Set in the probation era, the characters are all larger than life.  There's Albert Finney as a mob boss who's smart in many ways with the exception of the ways of love.  He's fallen for Marcia Gay Harden whose toughness is part of her appeal.  She's trying to protect her sleazy brother, played by John Turturro, and she's also romancing Gabriel Bryne.  The plot thickens as competing mob bosses are at war with each other and the cool Bryne, who always wears a hat, is playing them all against each other.<br /><br />The plot is complicated and hard to follow.  Good thing for \\"rewind\\" and \\"replay\\" on my DVD or it would have just raced past me in a blur.  It's supposed to be a blur though.  The genius of the film is that the plot is just part of the fast paced comic strip snapshot of a time and a place with characters that are so exaggerated that they become symbols rather than real people.<br /><br />The acting is over-the-top excellent, especially John Turturro.  I'm constantly amazed how he is always the most memorable character in film after film.  I also loved the details of the setting, especially Ms. Harden's wardrobe and hairdo.  There's also an undercurrent of dark humor in the way the characters go about their lives..<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and stayed up late just to see the interesting extras on the DVD.  It was good to revisit it after all these years. Miller's Crossing filmmaking at its finest and I definitely recommend it.
0380788624|4.0|I would reccomend this book to anyone who I think has the patience to read it. A fully captivating book, and for people who like Stephenson's style, a masterpiece. A four out of five is deserved only because Stephenson leaves too many loose ends. A good wrap up of all plot lines, and total consistency are two things that this book desperately needs. However, the lack can be forgiven based on the excellence of the book overall. Though it has too many small good things about it to describe, the collective effect of these balances out the major problems. A solid read, and worth your time

B00000I924|5.0|JB is one of my favs, and this recording shows that he still one of the best out there. While his music and style continue to evolve and change, the work continues to be tip top. Definitely underrated in terms of his contributions to guitar playing/innovation. Some of the tracks have a bit of an electonica feel which may not suit some ears... personally I enjoy it. Nevertheless, the music &amp; guitar work is top notch.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've been listening to Madonna ever since she was showing off her navel singing &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. It amazes me that she's still current and still interesting to listen to. Her late single off this album for &quot;Love Profusion&quot; just shows her staying power. The song is forever listenable, and reason alone to get this album. Bravo Madonna!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|There is no better album in the world then this one. 27 great tunes that changed the world of music forever-no wonder its still on the charts after being released almost 4 years ago!
0671015206|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door gives mostly hints and tip on how to become a millionaire. But what is different is that the authors actually went to millionaires and asked them how to do it. It is suprising that most of the millionaires are not famous, they are regular people that learned how to live below their means and make good occupation choices. What I got out of the book is that being wealthy is not determined by ones material possessions but by the amount of liable assets one owns. Which to be is more important in the long run anyway. It is a good life starter book, I'll read it again after college!
0380018179|4.0|The Thorn Birds by Colleen McCullough is a novel that seems to include every genre from romance to historical fiction and even tragedy.  The story follows the lives of the members of a family through a full generation.  This results in the development of many characters, and there is probably at least one that almost any person can relate to. One thing notable about the book is its amazing attention to detail.  This was a cause of both my like and dislike for the novel.  The detail is well-written enough to leave an image in the mind of the reader upon completion of a passage, a quality not all books have.  On the other hand, the detail can be monotonous and cause the reader to lose interest. The latter is much less common, and the story kept me interested throughout.<br />This novel seems to be directed at women, and I doubt if many male readers would enjoy it.  I would recommend it to women high school age and older. However, because the story involves many relationships, I recommend that the reader is not completely opposed to the romance genre. Even readers who would not normally choose a romance novel would still enjoy this book because it includes so much more.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|The film was alrite still. It had some dope bits innit with the little kids doing there thing Jessica was really good in it showing a contrast to her role in dark angel. The film had some great parts innit it was not as good as YOU GOT SERVED. And it wasn't as ghetto as i thought i was gonna b but still it was good. The ending was rubbish and the dance scene with tweet was aswell but on the hole a great film to pick.
0375751513|5.0|I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well  ........  You'll have to read to find out.<br /> People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is iron maidens best early album with the exeption of &quot;fear of the dark&quot;. It has the brilliant &quot;aces high&quot; and other great songs. But the best thing about this album by maiden is the song &quot;powerslave&quot; it has great lyrics and bril guitar work a must buy for any iron maiden fan
0486266885|1.0|I did not like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because it took too long to get to the plot. There was a lot of talking, but did not go into full detail of how he became Mr. Hyde. The author would even go back in time to things that had nothing to do with the story line. When I think of Mr. Hyde, I think of more chase scenes and anger. I also think of more scenes of Dr. Jekyll in his laboratory. The ending was also kind of plain and boring; I like endings that give me closure or an ending that hints of a second book.<br />Older people who like old British novels would like this book because older novels were written in the same form. People who have a lot of time on their hands would like this book; it takes a long time to read it. People who read a lot and do not get bored by a slow book and do not fall asleep could read this book. British Literature majors would also like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because of the style of writing. If you get bored really easily and can fall asleep reading; then you should read this book.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Just to reiterate, this is not the original version, this is the edited (...) version. Plot points have been changed and you lose the history of this great movie. Yes, the CGI is better but you will never see the work that won oscars for Best Art and Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. That is a travesty. Boycott this version and hope that Lucas comes to his senses and releases the REAL Star Wars trilogy.
0679720200|4.0|RyneMading<br /> \\"Mother died today; maybe yesterday, I can't be sure\\"  ( Camus 1). These are the opening words of The Stranger, which I found to be one of the most interesting and psychologically challenging books I have read thus far.<BR> The book begins with the stranger attending his mother's funeral and displaying a puzzling lack of emotion toward his mother's death.<BR> I loved reading this book.  There were times when I could not put it down if I tried and other times when it was difficult to get into.  The main reason why I enjoyed reading this book is because of Albert Camus' unique style of writing.  He adds such meticulous character descriptions and detail to every aspect of the book it never really gets boring, even during less interesting sections.  The storyline is somewhat difficult to follow.  For those who have seen Seinfeld, I would relate this book to a Seinfeld episode: lots of jumping around from scene to scene and many complicated situations.  This sense of chaos adds to the intensity and nature of the book itself. <BR> I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy an intellectual challenge and also to people who enjoy learning about different cultures.  This book will open up even the most closed off mind.
B000002MUQ|4.0|I think that this is a pretty good album.  Yes it is a little spotty but still came together nicely.  Coming out in 1995, this album seemed somewhat influenced by grunge.  The guitars were toned down and the sound was very thick on a lot of the heavier songs.  One thing that I need to give VH credit for on this is thinking outside the box on a lot of tracks.  Having lyrically taken on some of the issues that grunge bands were talking about.  Dysfunctionalism, and drugs, and the ills of the world.  This was the only album where VH got serious and still sounded good.  VH was serious on VHIII, but that album sucked.  There were a few tracks I can relate to.  I have been through a painful point in my life in the last year or so so songs like &quot;Feelin'&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot; sound particularly relatable now.  Not to mention that they are great songs.  &quot;Not Enough&quot; was a nice ballad that sounded more from the heart than many love songs do.  &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; was an awesome starter to the album. &quot;Can't Stop Lovin You&quot; was pop, but a decent song nonetheless.  &quot;Take Me Back (Deja Vu)&quot; was an interesting Zeppelinesque song that seemed to be built on layers of Acoustic and Electric guitars.  &quot;Aftershock&quot; was a great rocker about being irritated with love.  &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was a great fun track and &quot;Balunchitherium&quot; was a very nicely done instrumental.  My only real issues were &quot;Big Fat Money&quot; Sucked and &quot;Strung out&quot; and &quot;Doin' Time&quot; were both filler material. Other than that, it was great.  If you want a good set of rockin' tunes with some more serious relatable songs, as well as songs that are a little of both, then this is the Balance (No Pun intended) between the two. <br />On another note, I am glad to hear that VH is back together with Sammy.  I would have been really happy if it were Dave too.  But after 8 years since Sammy's departure andthe botched Diamond Dave Reunion, and the terrible Van Halen III album that followed, and the subsequent departure of Gary Cherone and the long silence that followed, I think that all VH fans are hungry to hear from their heroes again.  I hope I can afford to see them when they come through Denver.
0679721037|4.0|Hiroshima, John Hersey's retelling of the events surrounding the United States' August 6, 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, gives an historical account different from those that are usually given to Americans.  Hersey tells the story of Hiroshima through third person narratives of the lives of several survivors of the bombing.  This is different from most Americanized stories, in which the bombing is usually viewed through the eyes of one or more Americans involved in the bombing.  This is one of the positive qualities of the book, as it forces Western readers to view the bombing from the receiving end, allowing them to gain a different perspective.  Before reading Hiroshima, I was like many Americans in my beliefs about the use of nuclear weapons.  While I have always known that such weapons are destructive, horrible things, Hiroshima has caused me to rethink my own view on the possible future use of these weapons.  I used to jokingly say, \\"Let's just nuke `em!\\" whenever a foreign power came to arms with the United States.  After reading Hiroshima and taking in the graphic depictions of victims, I would never think of seriously favoring the use of nuclear weapons.  While I cannot say that I enjoyed reading about carnage and the after-effects of radiation, as a history fan and as an American, I enjoyed being given a new point of view of an event which I thought I knew a lot about.<br />Hiroshima, while interesting and thought provoking, is not a book to be enjoyed by all people.  The graphic scenes following the bombing can be physically sickening at times, even for those who think they are prepared for such violence.  These scenes only help to convey the message that nuclear weapons and war in general are terrible things.  Most history fans, especially those interested in World War II, might like this book for its historical importance.  As a novel, the book does not serve much of an entertainment purpose.  Anyone researching weapons of mass destruction, Japanese history, or World War II would definitely find this a useful book.
B000002BQK|4.0|Ok,long story short:Mariah&Tommy divorce,Mariah gets sick of having to wear more than 2 pieces of clothing,Mariah wants to be more diverse musically.She completes the 3rd task with this album.Sure,I know what you're thinking,\\"how can Mariah make a genius album?\\".But,believe it or not,MARIAH CAREY makes an album anyone can like.It's a critic's wet dream!<BR> The album starts off with the memorable song&video(WOO WOO!)\\"Honey\\",which you can't help but love,especially since it was co-produced by Diddy himself when he was actually good back then,the song also takes samples off 2 songs:\\"The Body Rock\\" by hip-hop group The Treacherous 3,\\"Hey DJ\\".<BR>Moving on...the album has it's usual Mariah ballads,BUT you can't help feeling that the ballads have a more urban feeling to them,2 prime examples:the sesnsual \\"Babydoll\\"(co-produced by then rising star Missy Elliot) and the Latin R&B flavored \\"My All\\",which is actually the best ballad on the song.But,you adult contemporary Mariah fans don't have to worry,she's got some of that under her belt,too:the tearjerking song \\"Butterfly\\" and the lyrically inspiring but weak in producing closing song \\"Outside\\".<BR>And there's one more thing that separates this album from all of Mariah's previous albums:she collaborates a lot more.From hip hop group Bone Thugz N Harmony to the biggest R&B group in the country(at least they were back then) Dru Hill,Mariah collaborates with more than 5 people making this great album.<br />But,I took a star off this review,and there's a few reasons why.Some of the songs are weak in producing,including \\"Outside\\" and the wannabe-dance song \\"Fly Away)Butterfly Reprise)\\".Also,one word comes up during some of the songs:sleeper.Prime examples:\\"Close My Eyes(literally)\\" and \\"Fourth Of July,a song that starts off beautifully but,after a minute and a half,loses your attention.<BR>Other than that,you should definitely give this album a chance.It's worth a listen.Especially since Mariah put her heart and soul into it,and you can really tell when you listen it.<br />Best Songs:\\"Breakdown\\", \\"My All,\\" \\"Honey,\\" \\"Babydoll,\\" and \\"Butterfly\\".
0679777377|5.0|At the closing of the Second World War, amongst the chaos and destruction, four people's lives intersect at a battered villa in Italy.  Each individual carries a scared past.  Hana is a nurse drained from war and seeking a hideaway.  When the unit she is with leaves, Hana stays behind to care for a horribly burned, enigma of a man--known only as the English patient--who fell from the sky with a fiery crash into the desert.  Later, a scarred thief named Caravaggio and a bomb-wary sapper cross into their lives.  Each stranger unfolds and slowly is given character.  Laced with the current story is that of the bed-ridden English patient; haunted by his ghosts, whose constant recanting gives light to a dazzling tale of the obsession of love for a woman and passion so strong it is worth betrayal.<BR> Many abstract memories of each character interlace into the main tale, which many readers are discouraged by.  If a reader takes the time to understand and pay close attention to detail, the story unfolds brilliantly.  The characters are some of the most human and diverse that have been crafted.  It is introspectively healing, but more importantly it is a tale about love and the obsession that it brings, including the human need and lust for it.  This story is for meticulous, passionate readers, seeking to simply looking for the human truth about love and pain.  I enjoyed this book and have granted a special place for it as one of my favorite books of all time.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I've just gone through all 38 reviews of this CD that I've seen posted...and I'm laughing at some of them...a few people think more from Appetite for Destruction should have been included, when they probably have the CD already in their collection. Can't put EVERYTHING in one package, why would you need the other albums if they did that? And 79 minutes too short for a greatest hits collection? Most bands with only a few original albums couldn't fill 79 minutes with their greatest hits...<BR>seems like everyone's got a complaint...meanwhile the new album conitnues to take forever, so Geffen went ahead with this one, and in my opinion, the band could take a hint from an old Elvis song...a little less conversation, a little more action. Get the new album finished and stop fighting already. <br />If you're a big Gunners fan and like the songs you think should have been on here in addition to these or in place of some of them, you either know where to get them, or you already have those albums to begin with. Burn your own favorites to CD if this isn't good enough for you! As for Sympathy...get the album if you want the tune!
0679777547|4.0|I enjoyed the book The Club Dumas by Arturo Prez-Reverte.  The pace of the book quickly moved me through the story, keeping me interested throughout.  The characters are the cornerstones of the story. The personality of the protagonist, Lucas Corso, is easy to identify with. He is a lonely man who, although selfish and cutthroat, still holds at least some of the reader's sympathy.  The most interesting and fascinating pieces of the book are Corso's dialogues with Boris Balkan and the mysterious girl. These conversations are often thought provoking and filled with discussion on good and bad.  The antagonist, Boris Balkan, is a less interesting character, conforming to a standard literary archetype of the old, wealthy man, obsessed with a dream that takes it too far.<BR> Much of the plot revolves around the story and characters of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers.  The personality of The Three Musketeers characters and plots are so intertwined with The Club Dumas that I would recommend this book mainly to those who have read The Three Musketeers.  Although fans of mystery and suspense novels may still enjoy the book, to receive the greatest understanding and delight from the book a reader should read both.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucas made a terrible error in judgment when he decided to make his altered versions of the movie the ONLY versions available. The \\"last chance to buy the originals\\" campaign years ago translates into \\"no-new-dough\\" for Lucas this time around.<br />I'm 32, saw Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back in theaters about ten times each. Those movies were so exciting and fresh... it's a shame that Lucas won't leave these gems alone, or at least give us viewers a choice.<br />But really, it's not THAT big of a shame. We do have choices in the form of other entertainment that truly does leave this series in the dust at this point.
0060926317|4.0|Mutant Message Down Under is a book that proves to be an experience that takes its readers away from their idea to today's social facades and almost demands them to examine and learn more about themselves, all between two covers.  The story follows an American woman who comes to find herself becoming a part of an ancient civilization and relaying their message of life.  Because everyone at one time or another can get caught up in hurried and materialisitic ways of life, Mutant Message is able to point out that what is urgent isn't always necessary, and what is necessary isn't always urgent.<br />This book bends the minds of those people who forget the truest and most basic purpose of life.  For anyone willing to open a third eye and think about a different way, this book will hold its reader to a different standard.  Mutant Message does not hold a strong plot or even a noticeable climax, but what it lacks it makes up for in a strong message through themes and symbolism.
B000089CJI|5.0|one of the most refreshing albums in modern music.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis, is the first book in a series of stories about a fictional land called Narnia.  It begins in the country, in a strange old house.  Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, have been sent to live with an unusual professor.  While exploring his house, the four find an old wardrobe.  Inside the wardrobe they discover the beginning of their magical adventure.<BR> I had fun reading this book because it is written on two reading levels.  One level is a simple children's story.  The other had a deeper, religious connotation.  I would recommend this book to the young and young at heart because it makes a person think and is enjoyable on all levels.
B00013F38K|5.0|There are series from the 60s and 70s that I never thought I'd see on DVD, and this is one of them.  I adored this series when I first saw it on TV, and of course in those days there was no way to see episodes over again without waiting for them to come around in syndication.  So when I read on Amazon all the complaints from people about the wide-screen format and their dislike of David Carradine, I paid them no mind.<br />Yeah, the wide-screen format, which sounds like a good thing, really isn't, but the production values are fine otherwise, the set is nicely packaged, and the special features are amusing, if not totally spectacular.  Best of all, I get to see this series as many times as I like.  <br />If you've never seen Kung Fu, and westerns are one of your guilty pleasures, take a chance.  For the time, it's pretty P.C., despite the fact that you'd have to be on drugs to think that David Carradine is Chinese.  Also the treatment of Native Americans is pretty shabby.  The main attraction is Carradine himself, who has never acted this well at any other time in his career.  The character of Kwai Chang Caine obviously really spoke to his heart.
068983571X|3.0|_The Hound of the Baskervilles,_ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is a classic Sherlock Holmes mystery that will keep the reader guessing from cover to cover. Set in Nineteenth Century England, the tale of murder and a family curse will hold the reader's attention until the end. When Sir Charles Baskerville mysteriously dies and the heir to his estate is threatened, the real mystery begins. Doyle's masterful writing style is easy to follow and flows so well the book will be over before the reader realizes it.<br /> I enjoyed this Sherlock Holmes mystery because it is easy to read and it flows well. For me, a person that does not usually like classics- or mysteries for that matter, I really enjoyed this book. The story kept my interest and it kept me guessing throughout the entire book. This story is not a thriller, but it is still a good mystery. For someone who prefers John Grisham suspense or a CSI type story line, this book is probably not for them. However, for someone who enjoys simple mysteries and likes to play the role of detective as they read, I would recommend this book.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|....SERIOIUSLY. Take a few minutes and think about this before rejecting it as a silly intepretation. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is extremely similar to Captain Kirk in both appearance and temperment...you know the beloved-by-the-crew even though he's tough  guy, who tends to act impulsively but manages to triumph over seemingly impossible odds, over and over. Dr. Maturin (Paul Bettany) is a sort of combo of Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy -- the brilliant humanitarian and almost miraculously gifted physician PLUS natural scientist and curious-seeker whose personality is constantly being contrasted against the Captains. Add a \\"salty\\" crew of unremarkable sailors -- seemingly there for the sole duty of being bumped off and then quickly forgotten. Oh and let's not forget a stalwart ship with plenty of personality...<br />It may sound near to impossible, but keep in mind that the Aubrey-Maturin series BEGAN in 1970, after Star Trek had finished it's three year run as a TV show. There was plenty of Horatio Hornblower adapted into Star Trek, so it's probably \\"turnabout as fair play\\" to see a historical writer -- otherwise consumed with accurate historical detail -- who was so heavily influenced by popular culture!<br />While watching this film, I couldn't get this concept out of my head as the dialogue and situations just kept reminding me of Star Trek over and over again. However, I want to be perfectly fair to the movie -- it's highly enjoyable with superb special effects that make the ship and it's isolation out in the ocean very convincing. The depiction of the really tough, dirty, cramped conditions that the sailors live in is also done in an outstanding manner. Battle scenes, etc. are all superbly staged and photographed.<br />The weaknesses largely come from the problem of combining TWO of Patrick O'Brien's excellent seafaring books into one film. Why? Wasn't ONE enough? And then changing the historical details, such as having the enemy vessel be FRENCH (yeah, I guess weare still busy getting even with France) instead of American. I guess the filmmakers couldn't concieve of an US audience accepting an American ship being defeated by a British one! even with the historical reality that Britain ruled the seas at this time.<br />Crowe and Bettany turn in fine performances, even if channeling old Star Trek characters, and young actor Max Pirkis does a outstanding job as a adolescent sailor who loses and arm and becomes an important addition to the crew. Although the presence of so many very tender looking young boys brings up the ugly question of sexual abuse under this kind of isolated circumstance -- something that was a reality in the British Navy at the time -- and it's completely glossed over here. The boys are treated with real fatherliness by Captain Aubrey, which is very charming but probably totally unrealistic.<br />If you enjoyed the PBS series Horatio Hornblower, or really any old movie that dealt with period sailing ships and the seafaring life, this movie will appeal to you. It was by far one of the most memorable films of 2003, and I think only missed winning awards because of heavy competition from LOTR.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is full of symbolism, allegory, suspense, and a myriad of mysteries that will have readers twisting and turning every chapter. This book kept me on the edge and wanting to know more and more. The many riddles in this book are intricately woven and geniously put in to keep the reader guessing. This book doesn't just jump around like others, but gives you, in full detail, the situation of the current events and any background information needed to understand (and there's a bunch). I thought that the symbolism and allegories were very intriguing, and they made me want to try and figure out what they could be before I actually knew the answer. And maybe the best part is that there seems to be no resolution, only climax right until the end! All-and-all, this is one of the best books that I have read.<br /> This book is for anyone who loves to be toyed with and kept guessing before the revealing of the twisted truth. For those who like to find hidden meanings in allegories, this is a great book. The plot is consistent throughout, but it is how the story plays out that makes it most interesting. If you like tons of mystery and suspense that will make you want to stay up late at night just to figure out the next mystery, this book is for you. And let's not forget those who are interested in a novel that deals with religious artifacts, great action, and a good thriller.<br />Chris Protos
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This was by far the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  I recomend it to everyone.
0671042858|4.0|I chose to read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Steven King.  It is about a little girl who gets lost in the middle of the woods and can't stop thinking of how many people die in the woods because of starvation, thirst and even disgusting creatures that lurk in the dark.  (I really liked this book because it kept me reading and wanting to keep reading.  I am not much of a reader myself, but this book captivated me in a way that most books wouldn't have.  The main character was a city girl who went by the name of Trisha.  During the novel she shows that she has a very wandering mind.)<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, drama, and a little sense of reality.  A person with a good imagination and multiple personalities would also, I believe find this a very indulging novel.  This is a short book, which makes it very easy to read for speed-readers.  There are a lot of plot changes throughout the novel, which adds to the reader's suspense.  I would most definitely recommend this book to all readers in general.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Besides the song, \\"Dirrty\\", the album \\"Stripped\\" is a good album. There were many different styles of music which make it great. There is R&B, Soul, Rock and Hip Hop on it. I'll tell you why the following songs made me feel good:<br />Fighter- Helps to overcome victimization. Anyone who has been abused in any way will relate to this song.<br />Makeover- People manipulate others for their own gratification. Those \\"others\\" don't need people to make them over.<br />Beautiful- We all have differences that we must love each other for.<br />Soar- You have to listen to your inner self no matter what others say.<br />The Voice Within- Listen to the good voice within yourself, and not the negetivity of others.<br />Can't Hold Us Down- It's funny how Christina and Lil'Kim EXPOSE the double standards of Male/Female sexuality. ... <BR>I'm a Male and I agree with Chris and Kim on this song. ... <br />If you minus the sexuality of this record, \\"Stripped\\" is very good, and diffinitely helps people of all ages.
0393312836|5.0|I read Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange.  I enjoyed the book very much.  The story is will developed, and it is written in a creative way.  Anthony Burgess uses many words pulled from other languages to replace ordinary everyday English words.  For example he uses the word \\"krovvy\\" to replace the word blood.  There is a Glossary of Nadsat Language in the back of the book.  At first the words make it difficult to comprehend what is happening.    The first couple of chapters I had to keep flipping back to the Glossary.  Then I got the hang of the words.  Not only do the different words make it an interesting read, but he also has a creative style of writing. <BR> The story is the first person view of a young boy named Alex.  It is about how he and his friends, droogies, like to walk the streets and beat people up.  Unfortunately for Alex all the trouble comes back on him.  Anthony Burgess uses Alex's story to get across many points depending upon how much one wants to reads into the story.  Burgess refers to the change in times and how the police abuse their powers by cracking down too hard.  The story is violent, but does not go into details too much to gross someone out.  I am not one who likes to read a lot, but I certainly liked this book.  I would recommend this book more to males even if they do not like to read.
B00001NFCY|1.0|How can you say that this band is totally original? How can you say it's PARTIALLY original? These guys probably started a Pearl Jam fan club in their church. Maybe when writing an album praising God is more important than scraping up some originality...too bad there seems to be no artful way to combine the two.
0375758992|4.0|I enjoyed Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood by Alexandra Fuller. The author, Fuller, tells of her experience living in segregated Africa.  Her family was not the best; her father and mother were both drunk a majority of her childhood.  At one point her mother has a nervous breakdown and also suffers from depression because only two of her five children survive due to various causes.  Alexandra writes about how Native Americans were treated and also about the Rhodesian civil war.  She speaks a little about her life during college in Canada, her sister's life, and when she met and married Charlie.<br />This is a great book, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about a person's life growing up in a different country and/or continent.  The book does jump from one subject to another, which makes it more interesting, and not like a regular biography.  Even if people do not like non-fiction books, this book seems like a fiction book because of the events that are not realistic.
0893815187|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews for this book, and most of the negative ones seem to mostly criticize the expressions on the faces of these children, and how they must reflect a miserable childhood.  However, I know that when I was a child, I did not go around constantly with a huge grin on my face, even though my childhood was overall pretty happy.  I think that if these photos showed these children all at happy moments and always smiling, then they would be boring, and I wouldn't consider them to be art.  I think that these gorgeous photos honestly reflect their childhoods, and the ordeals they went through growing up.  Just because the child's faces are blank does not mean that they were unwilling participants in these photos.  Also, just because they were raised in an environment where nudity was accepted and not an issue isn't a cause for critism here either, in my opinion.  Some people are just raised differently and in different environments, and I think it is fascinating to see how open this family was.  I don't find it dirty [...] in any way at all.  It's just honest, real photography.
0590353403|4.0|~Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone~<BR> <BR>This book is not like most stories someone might read.  By looking at the cover, readers see a young boy flying on a broomstick with a cloak on his back.  When I first started reading the book, I was very interested.  A baby being dropped off at someone's doorstep, and cats reading newspapers are not normal to most people.  You just want to keep reading, because they cannot think of what might happen next.<BR> <BR>This book has many other books along with it.  It's kind of a never-ending story, with all the other books and movies that have come out since they started making Harry Potter.  This book is a fantasy with a mystery. This book is not for all people because of some beliefs about magic, myths and lies.  At the same time, it's mainly written for children and young adults.  There is something that makes its seem so real and extremely interesting, that makes adults and the elderly love this book as much as children. It is kind of a family story that everyone loves.
B000002LJW|4.0|Eric Clapton is a genius musician, and when all's said and done, he has a musical vision that, when he exposes it, makes for some compelling listening.  But he has an unfortunate tendency to 'go with the flow' of musical tastes and trends, and the results when he tries to fit into someone else's style are inconsistent.<br />This album gives you both his genius and his acquiesence to lesser musical lights.  He gives us some great renditions of classic blues and R&amp;B (&quot;Before You Accuse Me,&quot; &quot;Hard Times,&quot; &quot;Hound Dog,&quot;) some newer songs in the traditional style (&quot;Running on Faith,&quot; &quot;Old Love,&quot;) but also a few numbers that meekly adopt the bombastic style prevelant in the late 1980s when this album was released.<br />The opening cut, &quot;Pretending,&quot; is a good example.  It's certainly not a bad song, and his guitar solo is excellent. I just don't believe it.  I don't think this song, or the others like it, mean anything to Clapton.  The sense of conviction on &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot; is completely missing from this song or the others in this style.  Someone talked him into doing these songs, and using these arrangements.<br />Clapton has sustained a long career, and I'm sure he believes that these sorts of compromises are why he's still around and can do blues tributes like &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson,&quot; which are obviously closest to his heart.  I'm not a professional musician, so who am I to second-guess?  This album is worth getting, but be aware that the shifts in tone are a little jarring.
0452282152|4.0|Tracy Chevalier writes an outstanding novel, Girl with a Pearl Earring. The main character is Griet, a young girl from Holland who is devastated when she discovers that her father has become blind. With her family unable to pay for living expenses, Griet must become a maid to the famous artist Vermeer and his family. The author does a marvelous job describing the portraits Vermeer paints. It is almost as if the portraits come alive in the story. The story does not have any boring points and keeps readers on their toes as Griet struggles with growing up and is torn when deciding who or what to love. <br />Teenagers, myself included, can relate to Griet as she searches for herself and realizes her responsibilities as she grows up. Griet understands that she must support her family. Living with the painter forces her to grow in many aspects. All teenagers should read this book because of the life's lessons it portrays. Readers do not have to like art to appreciate this book. The appreciation comes with the author's beautifully written novel that causes readers to be anxious for the end throughout the whole story.

B000001GQJ|5.0|Its from reading reviews like your which tell us essentially nothing more than the title of the album and that Martha Argerich plays the Liszt B Minor Sonata!  Besides, what would you like them to call the album: &quot;Martha Argerich Debut Recital, Which Happens To Include Her Important Performance Of The Liszt B Minor Sonata As Well As Some Chopin And Several Tracks Which Aren't Actually From Her Debut Recital But For Some Reason We've Included Them Anyway&quot;?  Great CD though!
B0001MDQ6W|3.0|What we have here is the video replica of the self-titled 1995 live cd, with an identical setlist of songs extracted from 2 gigs at NYC Sony studios. The owners of the previous VHS tape edition can now throw it away or give it as a present to some annoying relative, and enjoy the four &quot;new&quot; songs (that do appear in the cd, they are 'Tombstone Blues', 'John Brown', 'Desolation Row', and 'Love Minus Zero/No Limit') and the improved image and sound (both PCM stereo &amp; Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) quality.<BR> <BR>These differences with last century's tape version are boasted on the dvd cover as 'special features' (cheeky guys!) and, yes, that's all there is. No previously officially unavailable songs from the sessions have been added (big 'OOOH' here), nor anything at all anybody might have expected or fantasized with. The disc contains 4.20 Gb of information consisting in a 73 mins concert, and nothing else, that's all, folks. It neither has subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing which, given the state of Dylan's voice, might've been welcomed. But i know every word of the lyrics, and so do you. At least it's cheap, and cheaper than here in Spain, my dear lucky americans, i paid 17+ euros for my fresh copy. <br />As for concert itself ... well, we've all heard or seen it, don't you? ye fellow dylan-iacs. I quite like it, especially the totally plugged rocking acoustic guitars. Not your average mellow unplugged 'oh-but-we-are-sensitive-souls-deep-inside' concert, thanks Bob. The Major drawback is the cinematic quality itself: dull, unimaginative, repetitive. what can you expect from an awful channel such as MTV? the thing is filmed in a kind of loop of a few shots with lots of showoff dollys showing nothing interesting. the same shots over and over again. you can predict which will come next like with the lyrics of a bad song. Sometimes Bob starts a solo and boom! they cut to the bass player or something. maybe it's very avant-garde and i didn't get it.or maybe it's that i bought 'The Last Waltz' dvd the same day and watched bits of it before and, boy, 'The Last Waltz' is, simply put, the best filmation of a concert EVER made, and comparing the work of Martin Scorsese with that of some MTV director is well, like comparing the animation of Walt Disney's 'Pinocchio' with that of 'Beavis and Butthead'.
1577311523|5.0|I have read many books on spirituality, not for the historical information, or the need to belong to a group or to take up a ritual practice, but I wanted to learn how to experience what the original messenger experienced. I believed that if one person could be enlightened (what ever that meant) or could be so connected to God or universal energy, so could I and so could other people.  I never wanted to be a follower of an organized religion, but I believe the prophets of all major religions truly experienced a deep connection to life that allowed them to live in fearlessness and in with a deep sense of peace and compassion.  I wanted to live like this and I believed this experience was available for us all.  Unfortunately the message from the books I read and people I talked to always made me think too much and left me imagining what it must be like to feel this special connection to life (so mostly I continued living in a state of anxiety looking forward to a better future). <br />I had the pleasure of meeting Eckhart Tolle in Vancouver at one of his teachings before I read this book.  His presentation was very moving - maybe shifting is a better word, as I have never seen a person speak to a crowd so calm, humble, almost child-like, but fearless - a strange power to witness.  I didn't understanding it at the time, but I could feel an intense energy from him; and everyone in the room seemed to be connected energetically.  I talked to him afterwards, and although he was teaching that we need to still our minds, I was in constant thought before I approached him - things like \\"is this a cult\\" or \\"if God is seeing through his eyes, will he know all my faults\\":).  I was a little nervous about this whole thing.  My question to him was, \\"I have a meeting on Wednesday and I need to think about it before hand, so how can I live in the Now?\\" his answer was, \\"While you are planning, know you are only planning and you are not at the meeting, so don't react to being somewhereelse, know where you are which is always in the here and now.\\" (Something like that).  So when I was planning, I looked at my pen and paper and sure enough I was in the Now :)  Although this may seem simple and obvious, to me it was a profound experience because it broke the usual feeling of anxiety I would get about a meeting (or about most things before they happen).  This initial meeting and reading of his book was such a monumental experience for me, I ended up spending the last 3+ years with this book learning to live in the present on a more consistent basis (and what it means to do so: in terms of the effect this state has on people around you and why this state is important for us on an evolutionary or universal level).  <br />This teaching has helped me and people close to me on a very deep level.  Reading this book provides the first step into \\"reality\\".  Most books don't have this effect, because they are written by people who may understand the message from ancient texts but not the experience itself.  Eckhart Tolle has a strong understanding of both.  He is not interested in dogma or a following (as far as I can see).  He is interested in you experiencing what he is experiencing.  He writes from a state of pure consciousness.  I have never read a book that is so direct and practical.  Please do not get fooled by its seemingly simplistic message - it was written this way to help you experience or connect with truth, peace, stillness, pure consciousness, etc. while you are reading it. Depending on your experiences so far, you may need to read it only once or it may take you many times to fully comprehend, either way, it provides a practical way for you to stop seeking and to finally be a finder.  Experience the state the prophets have experienced...experience the state that Eckhart Tolle is experiencing... but... \\"its not what you think.\\" <br />After reading it a few times, the challenge for me was to stop assuming what Eckhart was experiencing and to take up the actual practice.  To stop concerning myself with questions pertaining to him or the book and to experience the sense of presence he is writing about.  The great thing about this book is that he suggests that you take breaks between paragraphs and experience this state, and that you shouldn't take the wording too seriously because the words are only pointing to an experience that the reader should live...and not just think about.  He uses the analogy of the tasting fruit, you can describe it all you want but you will only truly know the taste by taking a bite.  Most of us are so conditioned to think of reality, that we rarely experience reality on the level of awareness beyond thought...just being here and now.  This book will provide an understanding of this experience and why it is important for all of us to evolve to a state of presence, but more importantly it will provide you with practical ways of becoming present which you can use throughout the day in any situation - which in my opinion is the only answer, as waiting for uncomfortable situations to pass so that you can get to your yoga class and be at peace, only perpetuates your habitual thinking to believe the future will be better... or worse (and in doing so you are avoiding or ignoring the present). <br />This is a great guide to help people move through fear, anxiety, depression, etc.  and experience a sense of peace.  It provides ways for you to slow the mind down enough to actually listen and to see things clearly in the present, to be more creative and to access an energy and intelligence far greater than the conditioned mind allows.   This book has helped me and many people I know experience the power of Now.  I encourage you to read it and to experience what Eckhart means `to stop seeking and to find', to no longer resist, but to accept the here and now - which makes sense because we truly only have, and ever will have the Now.   <br />Enjoy.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Clapton plays Robert Johnson true to the original recordings.<BR>No extensive guitar solos, no reinterpretation of Johnson's songs. So it's a bit boring and predictable, in that just about<BR>every song sounds the same. It might take a few more listens before it will grow on me.
B000093BDX|5.0|OK this album is great you get 30 Beach Boys songs.  Most people probably only want a cd with their biggest hits on it.  However, I think this album ignore their awesome 70s albums way too much!!!  Sail on Salior, Rollar Skating Child, Add Some Music to Your Day, It's Ok and many, many more of their songs from the 70s would have fit perfectly on this album.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I grew up with these movies.  I remember being 6 years old and standing in line opening weekend to see the original Star Wars.  To this day I can remember the excitement and hoopla the first film created.  I, and my friends, helped make George Lucas a very rich man by going to see these movies multiple times and buying just about anything and everything we could get our hands on that had Star Wars on it.<br />When the original versions of the films were released on VHS back in 1989 (I think) I purchased them and to this day I still have the occasional marathon where I will sit up all night and watch them back to back.  I know there are some people who aren't Star Wars fans who might think this is a little nutty, but as I said, I grew up with these films and they hold a VERY special place in my heart.<br />When the special editions of these films were released a few years ago I didn't go to see them.  I had no reason to.  I didn't particularly have anything against them, people update and make older versions of films \\"better\\" all the time...but the original versions of the film are generally still available.  Same thing goes for when the SE versions were released on video.  I never purchased them, nor have I even seen them.<br />When the Phantom Menace was released I again stood in line to be able to be one of the very first people to see it.  I was in the theatre at Midnight with 100s of other fans and nearly started crying when \\"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...\\" came onto the screen.  Unfortunately, by the end of the movie (actually, about 5 minutes into the movie), I was nearly in tears again because the thing was so god-awful bad.  Actually, the movie really wasn't THAT bad...if it had just been released as a movie itself and there had been no originals, I think it would have been ok.  But, seeing as though it was supposed to be the prequel to the originals and had so much to live up to, I (as well as just about anyone) thought it was vastly inferior to the originals.  Same thing goes for \\"Attack of the Clones\\".  Just horrible.  I never purchased either film because although I'm a huge fan and felt somewhat \\"obligated\\" togo see them, I didn't enjoy them...and only saw each one once or twice.<br />I've been waiting for years to get the original movies on DVD.  When I heard some months ago they were to be released I could barely contain myself.  Now, I'm learning that only the SE versions will be available and to make matters worse again...they have been tampered with AGAIN.  So...they look even LESS like the originals do.<br />Another film I grew up with was ET.  I waited years to get it on DVD and when I did I wasn't disappointed.  It had a newer \\"cleaner\\" version which is great to watch, but Steven Spielburg knew his fans and he also gave them what they really wanted...the original film...the film they grew up with.  It's not that difficult to put two versions of a movie on DVD...it's done all the time.<br />It seems as though George Lucas doesn't care what his fans think.  He doesn't care that many of us gave up entire weeks of allowances to buy toys, costumes, books, etc. which all added to his wealth.  By all accounts he's an extraordinarily greedy man, which is proven in the fact that he plans to release them yet AGAIN in three years...still, not in the original format.  Just another ploy to get our money...again.<br />I won't be buying this set of DVDs.  I won't be going to see the latest installment of the series when it comes out.  I am officially boycotting anything and everything this man touches.  I'll take my money and go buy another copy of the original releases on VHS on Ebay and hang onto it for when my copies finally die.<br />Maybe one day Mr. Lucas will come to his senses and release the originals.  When he does I'll be the very first in line to buy two copies.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|Although the director's effort is fairly allright the DVD does not have certain features of a live show.<BR>1.No crowd at all (most important)<BR>2.Few tracks (dissapointing)<BR>Much appreciate if Amazon.com could add &quot;Pink Floyd - Live in Venice&quot; DVD into the store.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil isn't flawless, but it's not bad. There's a lot to like in this movie. The way Daredevil grows from taking the law into his own hands to being more heroic makes for an entertaining movie. The development from killer to hero is interesting stuff for a supehero movie and it's dealt with very well. That and the extras earn it a B+.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Hehehe, well everyone has different tastes, but I don't get why so many put less than 5 stars. For me, worldwide underground and mama's gun are erykahs finest hours (so far), and oddly enough, I'm not as keen on baduizm, though the live album rocks. I was told that strictly speaking, this is an E.P., and not an album. Don't ask, I have no idea why, lol. Anyway, I find nothing to complain about regarding WWU, it is, in my opinion, another masterpiece. The thing about Erkykah is, she's always fresh. You never quite know what to expect, each album is completely different.<br />I bought this last september when it came out, and it didn't leave my CD changer for a long time. There's been loads of great Cd's come out since by other artists in this genre, but none have the unique style and sound of WWU. It grooves like a mofo all the way through, not one duff track. 'Bump it', 'back in the day','I want you' are superb. It's not mentioned in the song listing above, but at the end of my CD, there's an extra song called 'Hollywood'. That song alone is worth the price of the CD.
B00018D44U|5.0|I liked this better than the first album. It's happier and less dissodent than the first cd. The first cd had some nice songs, but these are better. It's different than the first, so I assume there are those who won't like this CD just because it has a different flavor from the first. Good Job Norah! It's nice to see you haven't boxed yourself into a style.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Too bad &quot;Der Kommisar&quot; didn't actually listen to the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD. If he had, he would know that the CD in fact does run 79+ min., and therefore is as full as a single CD will allow.<br />This is not to say that &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is good. The liner notes and packaging are skimpy, and it does smell like a quick money job by Geffen. But can you really blame them, when they have been waiting for 12 years on new studio material from Axl?<br />In unrelated news, Axl yesterday announced that GnR is pulling out from performing at the &quot;Rock in Rio/Lisbon&quot; festival in June. Is anyone really surprised by that? Meanwhile, back to the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD: good music, but flawed compilation.

B000005RT8|3.0|McCartney II comes fresh off the heals of Wings' breakup and finds Mr. McCartney expiramenting with an unyet popularized instrument at that time (The synth). I am and always have been a McCartney fan. To me, Mr. McCartney is second to no-one with his musical abilities ranging from composing, having diverse vocal stylings, ability to play any type of musical style and on any instrument he pleases BETTER than most musicians out there.<br />As you can see, I've rated this album '3 out of 5' stars, let me explain why:<br />-  Paul has always been one musician that has never been afraid to try something different, ever. Even from his early days as a Beatle he's been pushing the envelope of avant-garde sounds, this album is no different. This was an experimental album.<br />- Every instrument, voice, and note performed on this album was done by Paul. And if you can look through the pretense of the album, you can definately see the genious in this man.<br />- (In my opinion) this album is very much a precurser to what modern day Hip-Hop is.. Synthesised-groove oriented songs that have repetative hooks. Remember, this album was done at a time when Synthesizers were still not in the mainstream.<br />- In some tracks, you can hear a resemblence to &quot;outkast&quot; 20 years in the making.. BUT what Outkast has that this album doesn't is enough melody to keep you interested and listening in. It tends to drag and go too long on 'ideas' and doesn't focus at all on melodies throughout.<br />As a musician, I actually find this album intriging (musically). The sounds he received from those early synths are quite good.<br />As an overall music fan, I do find the album a little brash just for recreational listening. It is very ecclectic, and should be viewed as an 'expirament' and nothing else.<br />Take in all of Pauls other solo output before purchasing this album. If you do that, you'll come to appreciate this 'expirament' much more..!<br />All the best, -AndyMan-
0425170349|2.0|Mr Clancy appears to be getting sloppy:<BR>a) He has obviously never been to Hereford<BR>b) He has no clue how the UK health system and training works (Mrs Chvez appears to be doing American medical training in UK)<BR>c) He is apparently not aware that you do not need to cross the International Date Line flying from UK to Sydney (I assume he is looking at it from US, where you do have to cross the dateline)<BR>d) He has forgotten that when it is summer in UK, it is winter in Sydney (rather silly)<BR>e) He has no idea what actually happens when you inject 40cc of heroin quickly into a vein (his description is laughable really)<BR>f) He thinks veganism and vegetarianism are synonymous<BR>If this is any indication of Mr Clancy's much vaunted attention to detail, I am leery of his accuracy regarding military matters. Perhaps this is why he continues to publish without any real government inteference - I'm sure they like a good laugh every so often like the rest of us.<BR>I wouldn't mind it so much if he would just tone down the rampant self righteousness in his books
B0001HAHXW|5.0|On this outing from Mr. Clapton, we find him sounding his most enthused about music than we have in years. As Eric and his band easily glide through these obscure (to most music fans) tunes, we see him bring all of his experiences in blues and meshing them all together to give us a very unique blues experience.<br />The first thing I noticed when I put this cd on was his voice, it's very strong and full of energy. You can definately tell that he is completely enjoying himself on each track as he sings his heart out. I can honestly say that this is the best that I've heard his voice in quite a long time.<br />The production on this album ended up terrific. I was very impressed how Simon Climie (Producer) fused the instruments together. Not only that, but the musicians on this album definately need to be commended because they did not overplay one second on this album. Everything was intentionally kept true to the artform they call 'the blues'. The backing instruments were recorded and mixed just right to make them sound as 'vintage' as possible without losing the current modern 'sound'. (Did that make sense..?!?)  Overall, with the intensity and passion of Erics vocals and the production and instrumentation of the album makes this a definate keepsake for any blues enthusiast.<br />This is a great blues gem, and I definately suggest it to any fan! And if I dare say so, I believe that in the near future that this album will someday be reguarded as a &quot;blues essential&quot; to anyone who comes across it.<br />All the best, -AndyMan-

B000002KE2|5.0|Vol. 4 was the first Black Sabbath album I heard.  I picked it up in a thrift store (in 8-track form) back in the early 80s. I've upgraded since then and Vol. 4 is still one of my favorite Sabbath albums.  I'd only put Sabbath Bloody Sabbath above it as it is more solid.  Some of the tracks here are amazing!  &quot;Wheels of Confusion,&quot; of course, is classic.  &quot;Cornucopia&quot; is perhaps the darkest track here followed by &quot;Under the Sun&quot; (until it starts rocking during the bridge) and both are excellent. I like the lyrics to &quot;Under the Sun&quot; (I don't want no preacher telling me about the God in the sky and I don't want no one telling me where I'm going to go when I die&quot;) as well as the guitar solo at the end. This album offers variety with the slow &quot;Changes&quot; and the pleasant instrumental &quot;Laguna Sunrise.&quot;  &quot;FX,&quot; which some regard as pointless, always intrigued me.  As a kid, I'd swing the drawer knockers on my dresser to try and replicate the knocking noises on the track.  It is not great even from an experimental standpoint, but, at least it is a quiet interlude and is not annoying (not to me anyway). &quot;St. Vitus Dance&quot; has an almost country sounding guitar that begins to rock at the verses.   My favorite, though, is &quot;Snowblind.&quot;  Most of the reviewers here agree and why not--it is amazing!  It is my all-time favorite Sabbath track.  It is about cocaine abuse (&quot;Feeling happy in my vein Icicles within my brain&quot;). Anyone just getting into Ozzy and Sabbath who does not have that song needs to get this album right away!  Neither &quot;Snowblind&quot; nor Vol. 4 will disappoint.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|WOW there are a suprising number of people who truly destested this film - suprising because I REALLY enjoyed it. I do have to say that the portrayal of Japanese people was for the most part very much playing off of the stereotypes (which is the only reason that I didn't give it a 5-star rating). <br />Aside from that BIG issue that I had with the film, I will echo the sentiments of several before me: the movie is not about the plot - it is about the atmosphere and tone. But unlike others before me, I did not find it in the least trying to hard to be a nose-in-the-air, pretentious and overly ambitious &quot;art&quot; film. It felt very natural and human. I was blown away most of all by Scarlett Johannson - a truly special performance. <br />This brings me to what I see as a horrible and really unfathomable flaw in the DVD.  While they have several extras including a 30 minutes &quot;behind the scenes&quot; documentary and a moderately lengthy interview with Murray and Coppela, THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO COMMENTARY ON OR WITH JOHANNSON. It really makes me wonder what REALLY went on behind the scenes. Her performance was as good if not better than Murray's and yet he is the sole focus of everything. I would like to say it was a terrible oversight, but it is such a blatant omission that it really made me feel that they totally cheated her and that there was some bad blood there or something. The documentary had (from my recollection) only two shots of her: one as she was coming onto the set and a long shot of she and Murray eating sushi. There was also a clip of someone involved with the movie raving about her. In the interviews, the people involved raved about the director, the videographer, the technical &quot;thing-thanger&quot;, but not Johannson who was only THE STAR OF THE MOVIE! It truly was an incredible slap in the face. <br />So nutshell version: Incredible movie. Unforgivable and cheap stereotyping. Beautiful acting and characters with a horrendously underappreciated Scarlett Johannson in a stand out performance. Oh well - she will leave them in the dust as her career progresses. Oh and GREAT SOUNDTRACK! <br />...and lastly: the ending (whispering)was PERFECT. Where they could have stuck in some cheesy-ass &quot;Goodbye, fair love&quot; speech that could easily have ruined the end, they leave it up to the viewer to trust that whatever was said was the right thing to say; magical in a way that no true words would satisfy either the characters (see how happy they are afterwards), or the audience's expectations. It was beautifully done and made my heart jump.  Again - perfect.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Not a bad album, but really nothing great. Some good singles, but very inconsistent as an album. I think over time most of the White Stripes catalogue will fall into the novelty rack - this is at best gutsy and grabbing, but at worst poorly done. Yeah it can be fun, but doesn't go anywhere really. I heard this album was a huge breakthrough for them. I think the opposite. They were a novelty act, who when stepping up to the big time, are revealed for their thinness. I was dissapointed enough to sell it, but don't get me wrong, it ain't all bad, and can be fun if that's what you're into these days.
B00009V7T2|5.0|There's a reason that you don't hear this type of music done with a consistency among the radio waves.  Not many bands can wrap their minds around the task without rendering a virtually unlistenable album altogether.  The fusion of intensity, relentlessness, emotion, and (most importantly) diversity is not often harnessed.  TMV's sound is remarkably tight and makes sense to me in some odd way, which is ultimately the best way!  The last time (and only time)I heard a band be able to artistically form this organized style was Arson Garden.  AG coincidentally tops my fav band list to this day, not to be unseated by even the likes of Tool, Rush, or Peter Gabriel, so maybe that indicates the comparison of band I put TMV into the realm of.  I have to get acquainted with ATDI to build an archival consciousness of their ability, but at this point, I'm ready to make the assumption that this the next best band on my list.  Lets hope for durability and an unending creativity in the future.
0800105141|5.0|Hollywood take note, this is probably the best film ever made. Without a doubt it's the best of the modern era. You'd have to go back to 1939 to find such a story driven movie with acting and production values at this level. The film lives up to the man, no easy feat. I didn't even notice the three hour length. Casting directors - start chasing Kinglsey again for any role he wants, sadly he's been swept under the rug and typecast. I'm betting he can pull off any role if only given the chance. Not just Kinglsey though, ALL the actors in this were superb. The sets are utterly magnificent; the story as true as can be for a film and a very valuable history lesson to boot. I'd give it 6 stars if possible. It's THAT good.  Gandhi sets the standard by which all other movies should be judged. Peace.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I recently purchased this album after hearing &quot;You Raise Me Up,&quot; which is an incredible song.  This young man has the most clear, extraordinarilly beautiful voice as I have ever heard.  In my opinion his voice could never be overated.  He is just marvelous.  On a scale of 1 to 5, he is a 10.
B00003CXCT|3.0|These movies are the \\"special\\" editions that were released in 1997. There is nothing special about them. One word to describe them: sloppy. It's great to see the movies finally on DVD, but the revisions just detract from the movies. They make the movies seem more like cartoons in places. Lucas should have given the fans a choice like Spielberg did with E.T. (releasing both versions, new and old, on the same disc). In order:    1. Star Wars--Greedo still shoots first, and makes one wonder how he lived so long being such a poor shot. The added scene with the digital Jabba looks very bad and the addition of Boba Fett to the scene takes the character from an intriguing loner to a hired thug. The digital X-wings show the sloppiness of the work. The original modelmakers had red stripes on the X-wings for each pilot's designation (i.e., 5 for Red-5, 2 for Red-2). Now they each have two red stripes, making them all the same (i.e., all Wedge). The added scene with Red Leader and Biggs is poorly edited, as someone is obviously digitally imposed crossing in front of the actors, causing R2D2 (being raised at the time) to jump about three feet. If Lucas wanted to \\"correct\\" things, then he should've corrected the bad computer effects during the pilot briefing scene and the boxes around the TIE fighters pursuing the Falcon (they look worse than they ever did on VHS).    2. Empire--Did anyone ever really wonder how Darth Vader got back to his command ship after Luke escaped? If so, then that scene's here, with Vader instructing a subordinate to have his shuttle standing by. Only problem: it's not James Earl Jones doing the voice, or if it is, he must've been sick at the time. Also, if Lucas really wanted to replace the first emperor with Ian McDiarmid, okay, but couldn't the makeup have been better? Again, sloppy work. And there is no reason to change the dialogue (this, the edited jump cut of Biggs/Red Leader editing out a line of dialogue about Luke's father in the first Star Wars movie, and the addition of Hayden Christianson in Jedi prove Lucas never intended for these to be the actual versions of the movies, as he contends now).    3. Jedi--Okay, there's not much that would help this beyond digitally removing the ewoks, but adding Hayden Christianson into the last scene was a bad idea. His long hair looks absurd, and he appears to be just standing around waiting for someone to tell him what to do. Sloppy. The same goes for the new song and computer-generated cartoon in Jabba's palace.    Hopefully Lucas will realize Star Wars was put on Congress' list protecting the movie as a national treasure for a reason. His revisions are like someone taking The Wizard of Oz and colorizing the first part, or removing the tornado and adding a digital tornado.  Or like Ted Turner colorizing Casa Blanca. With any luck Lucas will release the originals but until that happens, these are great to have if you can close your eyes during the revisions. They're just too jarring to watch.
B00014K5TQ|2.0|After seeing the documentary on cable, I couldn't wait to see the movie. The movie lacked quality acting and did not flow well at all. The movie also lacked the nightclub seen, which was supposed to be, the basis of this movie. The beginning of this movie bored me and rest was not better. And by the way, what was with the man dressed as a rat telling the story and showing it on a video from a rat hole? I guess Disney had some input. See the original documentary. Use the DVD movie as a drink coaster.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I like many StarWars fans couldn't wait for the original trilogy to come out on dvd. However, I think both versions of the films should be released and just not the Special Editions. I loved the original version of Return of the Jedi and the Special Edition takes the darkness mytery out of the Jabber the Hut scene. I mean the scene with creatures perforrning there is now turned into annoying cgi musical number. It's just goofy and doesn't belong in a scene that is meant to be dark and mysterious.  Well Lucas obviously didn't think it was meant to stay that way. The new score at the end of the Return of the Jedi as well, I think is really bad and I miss the original score. Lucas is too much into effects and todays technology. Mean look at the prequels, if he put more time into the scripts and less into the visuals, the movies might compare with the original movies. Anyway I think the original movies were fine before the special editions. Ok the Jabber the hut and Han Solo scene that was added to the original in entertaning. Some other changes like the ones to Return of the Jedi are really bad though. I heard rumors that Lucas actually wants to make Special Special Editions now but I think he hacked his beloved trilogy to bits enough. I'm still gonna buy these dvd's, don't get me wrong but the original versions should be there as well. If anything needs to be hacked up to be made better.....it should be the prequels.
B00005JMNA|5.0|The film was amazing!! i liked it just as much as the first one!! absolutly amazing, you have to see it!! the best film thats been made in the last 5 years, at least!!! such a good film, great acting, dancing n a good plot!! a mix between the first dirty dancing and save the last dance, but u dont need to have seen the first one to love this film!everything was good the music is outstanding!!! definitly have to see this film! he is gorgeous, n her clothes are great, a must see film!
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service knows how to deliver good music.  The chords, the electricity, the emotions all intertwine gracefully, leaving your entire self glowing with a minty-fresh aura.  I'm not exaggerating.  It's a beautiful album.  Tracks like &quot;From Such Great Heights&quot; and &quot;Clark Gable&quot; instill colorful photographs of love and adoration, while scripting out the perfect romance story.  The music and the lyrics, along with Ben's vocals combine perfectly into a cake so fluffy and rich, it can only be called Angel's Food.<br />I generally compare the soundscapes and mood of this album to another artist, The Incredible Moses Leroy, who seems to follow the same style and sound.  Pure, electronic sensuality.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|This is Clapton's electric interpretation of Robert Johnson. Eric plays guitar and sings with the same passion that made Layla and I Shot the Sheriff the modern blues/rock standards that reshaped the 70s.  Listening to this CD tonight, I had visions of Elmore James strapping a DeArmond pickup on an acoustic guitar for the first time and playing new, electrified blues.  Clapton takes Robert Johnson to a higher level, incorporating what seems like everything he learned from the Bluesbreakers and Cream days into a compact, mellower, yet growling modern blues classic.  This CD is sure to be a classic that will no doubt ignite a new fire in the modern rock world.
B000001FZK|5.0|The jazzy [[ASIN:B000006UNG Colour Of Spring]] and less accessible [[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit Of Eden]] might have firmly moved Talk Talk out of the 1980s synth-pop that never suited Hollis' mumbling, but plaintive vocals, but it was only with \\"Laughing Stock\\" that Talk Talk really came of age.<br /><br />Reduced to a basic trio of Hollis, Tim Friese-Greene and Lee Harris as a result of the departure of bassist Paul Webb, the effect was very clearly felt. The first song, \\"Myrrhman\\", might seem almost to be just soft and roughly orchestrated strings and horns upon first listen, but after a few listens the logic behind the interceptions of a few repeated notes on acoustic guitar begins to surface because of the fact that this guitar is part of the orchetration. The deep, mumbling vocals are the perfect complment: this is stark, simple music where the whole purpose is to use the most limited talents of as many people as possible.<br /><br />Nothing on Talk Talk's previous output will prepare one for the following two tracks. As Mark Hollis imagines himself seeking redemption on \\"Ascension Day\\" and \\"After The Flood\\", he injects the orchestrated rock (piano, organ, strings, trumpet, contrabass clarinet) with an intensity that is starker than punk ever was. This virginal music reaches an absolute apogee every time Hollis guitar releases the tension because we see how important each part is to the unbelievable sense of despair conveyed. Every word from Hollis - and there are not that many - managed to sound as if he was literally and deeply frightened of his future.<br /><br />The second half, perhaps out of necessity, was a release of the tension of the virginal music of the first side, but the austerity did not let go until the stings and horns on the amazing, wordless \\"Taphead\\" move with a flow that almost suggest classical music, yet Hollis in the early and closing parts of \\"Taphead\\" showed that the move towards a rawer sound was for real with the sparsest electric guitar you will hear. So simple and soft is it that one really feels every note: the absence of Paul Webb freed Hollis in a surprising and overlooked manner to bare his soul in a way that fits the album's altogether depressing tone: Hollis gives each word the intensity of a pain most people would never overcome, unlike the often joyful tone of earlier Talk Talk songs like \\"April 5th\\".<br /><br />The closer \\"Runeii\\" was reflective, wordless again and truly piano-based, whilst \\"New Grass\\", at almost ten minutes, seemed to sum up the orchestral, deep yet virginal sound of the five other tracks.<br /><br />\\"Laughing Stock\\" is a record that will truly make you feel about your music. So emotional are the few words on it that its depressing character actually gets the music under one's skin. There is almost no record like that - anywhere.le and soft is it that one really feels every note: the absence of Paul Webb freed Hollis in a surprising and overlooked manner to bare his soul in a way that fits the album's altogether depressing tone: Hollis gives each word the intensity of a pain most people would never overcome, unlike the often joyful tone of earlier Talk Talk songs like \\"April 5th\\".

0790737345|1.0|Except for the mugging of Solaris. <br />This film is to be avoided at all costs. It loosened my bowels. Do yourself a big fat favour and give it a skip and see the original film, &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; by Wim Wenders, which is one of the best films. Ever. &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; is worth owning. City of Angeles isn't worth visiting, in oh so many ways....
0783231032|4.0|After seeing the extended version and basically watching 1941 for the first time in over 10 years, I must admit, it's rather foolish, but I think that was the whole idea.  It was a throwback to all those star-studden slapstick comedies that Spielberg and Zemekis grew up watching.  It's not racist in anyway.  It would have been if JUST the Japanese were portrayed as bumblers, but everyone in this movie is nuts.  After the Anthrax scares following Sept. 11 (remember those), I think a movie like 1941 should be appreciated more.  It takes a paranoids to a new level.  yes, people were scared and the movie, which writer Bob Gale says lifted some truths, shows just how America was sixty years ago.  Yes, it's a screaming movie.  On the closing credits, every actor is screaming or yelling.  After seeing how hard the filmmakers worked on the special features, you got to appreciate the movie. Also, some deleted scenes add more, such as the racial tension between John Candy and Frank McCrae that is just touched on in the original is extended so we know why they're fighting in the tank anyway.  It's an anti-war movie that decides to have fun of the Greatest Generation.  And it does have Mickey Rourke before he got corrupted.  Also, the Jaws spoof at the beginning is terrific.
6304925131|4.0|Adapted from a novel by John Grisham, The Rainmaker details the life of a young and poor lawyer, Rudy Baylor.  Based in the South, Baylor takes on several cases: a young man battling leukemia (and the Great Benefits healthcare provider), an elderly wealthy woman revising her will, and a married woman suffering domestic violence.  Donny Ray Black's case serves as the central storyline for The Rainmaker, though the movie follows Baylor and his interactions with all his clients and legal staff.   Rudy Baylor serves as an exception to the legal system as a whole, and is portrayed as a man who is genuinely concerned for the well being of his clients.  <br />The Rainmaker is a well directed and acted film.  Its characters, plot, and situations make the video both educational and entertaining to watch.  Matt Damon, who plays Rudy Baylor, is at his best.  The supporting roles played by Danny Devito (Deck Schifflet) and Claire Danes (Kelly Riker) add to the moving storylines.  The most fascinating aspect of the movie, however, is its exploration of the legal ethics.  The audience is encouraged to form their own opinions of the principles within the legal system from The Rainmaker's plot.<br />Though Rudy Baylor becomes too involved with his cases, he teaches the viewers an important lesson about legal careers and life in general:  that people respond to those who care.  Baylor experiences both criticism and praise in his cases, and ultimately, he accomplishes several important tasks- overcoming the fraudulent Great Benefits health insurance company, freeing Riker from abuse within her marriage, and developing a trusting relationship with the older woman.  The Rainmaker is both a worthwhile and thought-provoking film that explores the legal system and ethics while absorbing the interest of the film's audience.

But anyway i reccomend this 2 all linkin park fans and rock fans!!!!!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|To the &quot;music fan&quot; who thinks this album is a desparate attempt by Mr. Rose to make a quick buck, guess again. He sued Geffen for releasing the album because he did NOT want it released. It is a great album for the casual Guns listener. I wish Rocket Queen and Hair of the Dog were included.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Guess Mr.Rose started having to buy MAD-DOG 20/20 instead of Crown Royal...desperate attempt at making some final money before he has to get a real job. Well, the way I see it as most of these songs are already on Albums ALREADY owned...You must be mentally deficient to waste NO LESS than 15$ on this garbage.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|We're all aware of Britney's limited vocal range. Most of the negative reviews are based on the fact that &quot;she can't sing so it's a bad album&quot; so you may aswell ignore them because they obviously haven't even heard the album. They're just haters!<br />Anyway, moving on. In The Zone is a really fun album for many different scenes. It's got all the right material for it to be listened in the car, the house and in the club. Plus it's fun to sing along to. While some artists are wanting to lean towards more soul/r&amp;b/hip hop albums, Britney offers you a little something different for a change. It's full of very upbeat tunes. Some are really beautiful, like 'Touch Of My Hand' which has a nice trance feel, so does 'Breathe On Me' You can dance or chill out to both of these tracks. Others like 'Showdown' 'I've Got That Boom Boom' 'Toxic' 'Me Against The Music' are different dance tunes, incorporating hip pop and electric make definate club bangers. 'Brave New Girl' starts off similar to 'And The Beat Goes On' and develops into an electric tune with a get free idea. There are also some very beautiful ballads 'Everytime' and 'Shadow' which stay in Britney's range so they're easy to listen to. They also both hold a nice fresh sound. <br />So it's not Aretha Franklin! But since when was Britney trying to be? She's aware of what she can vocally achieve and she works with it rather well. Ignore the haters and pick up a copy if you want to have a good time!!

If on the other hand you like cartoons like Lenore and the Far Side, then this might be right up your alley. This book is full of spot-on funny drawings of little fluffy bunnies who just don't want to live any more, and find creative ways to end their fluffy little existance. My favorite: The little fluffy bunnie doing the \\"peace\\" sign standing in line-up with Fascist soldiers...<br />This book is giving me daily laughs, and I glory in making sane people squirm, then burst out chuckling, shamefacedly admit that they LOVE this book. <br />Oh, and I gave a copy to my professor in \\"Clinical treatment of personality disorders\\". It was well received.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I must say, the first time my ears heard Weak and Powerless on the radio, I was enchanted. I loved the way the song flowed, kind of soft yet driveing at the same time. I loved the vokles. Maynard has such a great voice. I thought I have to go out and buy this album. Then I heard some other songs off it. I wasn't too impressed and thought they were kind of boring. Well, that was when this album first came out but since then I've become obsessed with Tool and I'd alsow heard the song The Outsider on the radio. It stuck out amungst the usuall  bland, nerow-minded music that is played today. I thought that I would give them a second chance. boy... I'm never going to regret doing that! Wen I listened to friend's copys of the album and to the sound samples here at this site I was blown away! Everything Maynard does he puts a dark and mysterious twist on it! Of course he shouldn't be given full credit for his work with both Tool and A Perfect Circle. With out the rest of the band it would just be his hypnotic voice with some strange ambient noises in the background. This album from beginning to finish left me with a chilld spine and a knot on my head from when it had knocked the sense in to me. Hear is a track by track rundown. <BR>1 The package This is an amazing song that starts soft and dark but that builds up. It's great! 5/5 <BR>2 Week and Powerless A nice driveing song with soft structure  to it. I love the drum beat. Some of Maynard's best vokles can be found here. 5/5 <BR>3 The Noose This song is calm at first. It's relaxing. After this it builds in to a loud finish. At this point  Maynards voice is looped and two parts of the song are repeated at the same time. With the hard driveing guitars bass and drums this makes for a spine-chiller.  5/5 <BR>4 Blue This song has a straight forword beat. It's a bit less dark then the others. (songs don't have to be dark to be good.) 4/5 <BR>5 Vanishing This song is for the most part instramental. It has a nice beet and smoothbass. On this song the guitar department has got some pretty awesome ambients going on. This one will put you to sleep. 5/5 <BR>6 A stranger A verry acoustic number with cool nature sounds in the background at certain points. There are alsow what sound like violins in the background. Don't quote me on that, but they are some sort of orchestral stringed instraments. 5/5 <BR>7 The Outsider This is a song about suicide and how it should not occur. It's alittle hard to understand Maynard at some points in this song so that's what I've gathered. 5/5 <BR>8 Crimes It's just a filler, All it does is serv as a link between  songs. It's not something to skip around and listen to however, if you choos to listen to the album in succession then it fits better. 3/5 <BR>9 The Nurse Who Loved Me It's just a cover. Maynard sings while electronic keyboards and moore orchestral sounding instraments are played in the background. It's really out of place. 3/5 <BR>10 Pet This song rocked my world. This is one of the harder songs on the album. Exolent guitar work and the drums are perfect. 5/5 <BR>11 Lullaby Yet again another filler but it's interesting to listen to as it's vary eary in my opinion. 4/5 <BR>12 Gravity This song is melow, and carrys a positive message through out. You hear Maynard say &quot;I choos to live.&quot; Since the rest of the album's lyrics deal with death this is a flip-flop. It's a nice end to the album. 4/5 <BR>This album is a must-have.  I recommend it to all Tool fans.  The Instramental aspect is awesome and so are the vokles. I am getting Mer de Noms soon. Well, thanks for reading my lengthy review and do yourself a favor and by this album and Mer de Noms.  You'll love A Perfect Circle.

0312995423|1.0|I've read three of Dan Brown's books (Digital Fortress, Angels and Demons, and The DaVinci Code).  All three have technological flaws that make the stories hard to swallow.  In the Digital Fortress at the end of the book, the big problem is preventing all of the Internet hackers from getting into the NSA's massive database with all of the world's secrets.  As the security is slowly breached, nobody can figure out how to prevent the hackers from getting in.  Anybody think about disconnecting from the Internet?  This is a &quot;national crisis&quot; so keeping out the good guys is not as important as keeping out the bad guys.<br />The other problem I have with Dan Brown's characters is that they are brilliant in the beginning of the books and then half way through they can't figure out the simpliest problem.  This is especially true in Digital Fortress and the DaVinci Code.<br />The stories are fast moving and engrossing as long as you're willing to accept Brown's flawed premises.
B000067JG3|5.0|The Sound of Music is a wonderful, romantic, family values, jam-packed musical set in Austria in the late 1930's. It tells of the nun, Maria, who comes to be the governess for seven cute kids, the children of Baron Von Trapp, a widower and former Admiral.<br />Despite some initial opposition from disciplinarian Von Trapp, she injects life and fun into the household. Plenty of fabulous songs, which will survive forever. It is set when the Nazi forces extend their malignant web into Austria, showing how beauty and innocence can be threatened by malignant ideologies like Nazism, Communism, Bolshevism and Palestinianism.<br />The Sound of Music is a classic, certainly a valuable reminder of innocence, beauty and family values to hold onto in the rather dark days of terrorism and loss of values we seem to have entered- perhaps the darkest since the days of Hitler.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Bill Murray plays an ennui-stricken actor in the twilight of his career in his most subtle, nuanced, and engaging, ever: Nothing at all happens. He's in a bizzaro-world, filming a whiskey commercial for a Japanese director in Tokyo. His charcter, Bob Harris, is going through the motions, doing what he needs to do to get his multi-million dollar paycheck, but he's phoning it in. Every day, he goes to the set, does his 'thing' for a director he can't understand, then goes out and wanders about the city, bemused and detatched. Later, he calls home in the wee hours of the morning, to talk to his equally jaded and exhausted wife. It seems their relationship is rolling along on inertia - They obviously once cared for each other, but there's no energy or spark left, and their relationship is also being phoned in, figuratively as well as literally. Every day, the same routine.<br />Then, one evening, Bob Harris meets Scarlett Johansson, the lonely and neglected wife of a high-market photographer lost in the city and at her wits-end. The two tired, bored, worn-out souls connect in a solid but low-voltage bond, and they proceed to entertain each other in a platonic and detatched way. They share intimate confessions in the most superficial manner, and give each other cheap drunken laughs as they stumble through the alien backdrop of the city. Neither charcater is so much interested in each other, as they are in finding relief from their psychic pain. There's no passion in their relationship, no flare or future either. They simply stumble through their days together each propping up the other.<br />While this non-event, as described above, should be depressing and boring, it isn't. Instead, we get an intimate look into the lives of two people trapped by their choices, and without the strength or will to break away from their ruts. It's seductive in a PG-13 train-wreck sort of way: You can't look away, but at least you're spared the gore of a messy self-destruction. Instead, youkind of dream your way through the movie, entranced, but not quite sure why.<br />I'd give thie movie one more star, if I didn't feel so... exhausted after watching it.
B000002KDS|5.0|For far too long, I dismissed Alice Cooper as something of a novelty act with a few classic hits, but mostly a lot of drama.  However, a friend introduced me to the Alice Cooper Band material, as opposed to the Alice Cooper solo material and I completely changed my opinion.<br />Alice Cooper has four truly classic albums, IMHO, &quot;Love It To Death,&quot; &quot;Killer,&quot; &quot;School's Out,&quot; and &quot;Billion Dollar Babies.&quot;  Of these, &quot;Killer&quot; is the pinnacle.  Or, more accurately, they're all roughly equal but &quot;Killer&quot; is my favorite.  It has the rawer production that I prefer, great songwriting (with the whole band participating) and doesn't overindulge in the musical theater style drama that some of the stuff that comes later does.  &quot;Halo of Flies&quot; is just an incredible highlight, but there are really no filler tracks on this release so you won't have to use the skip button ever.<br />This is definitely one of the 1970's top rock albums.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Hearing this remastered edition of Television's 1977 debut album makes you wonder why it was called punk, when it's clearly not (as we know it today), or why it's rarely seen in the top ten of the best albums ever made, because it clearly is one of the finest.<BR>It seems amazing that a debut album could be so good, but Television was a rare band that struck the right chord at the right time and created a seminal masterwork whose status grows over time. The rhythm is much slower than future punks, the guitars more crisp (what wonderful guitar playing!), and the songwriting more spacy than concise (the title track stretches for almost 11 minutes, that's not very punk). What makes this album a &quot;punk&quot; album for many people is its lyrics: this is obviously meant to be deep poetry, and it is.<BR>For newer fans, this album is more like a breath of fresh air: the arrangements are never presumptive, and the playing borders on virtuosity. Whoever compares the Strokes to Television is grieviously erring (not to mention they've probably never heard this album to begin with): the pretty-boys of the Strokes only wish they had as much talent as Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd have in their pinkies. Bottom line: amazing guitars, amazing lyrics, amazing songs = Classic Must-Own album. Buy it today.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is the greatest album of all time in my opinion. Brian Wilson used the rest of the Beach Boys for vocals on this album but he was the main producer and contributor. This album is a collage of teen angst and growing up provided with heartfelt lyrics by Tony Asher. This album sounds the best on vinyl when it was recorded in mono, but this new cd is really awesome. &quot;Wouldn't it be nice&quot; is a great opener and it is followed by more outstanding instrumental tracks and classic love sick songs.  The worst song is Sloop John B, but even it is really good. Pet Sounds was the album before the infamous &quot;Smile&quot; saga, but if you follow Brian Wilson then you should be &quot;Smiling now&quot;.
B00008A7QK|5.0|While he is close to a mythic figure in his native Britain, Marc Bolan has regretfully been relegated to a one-hit wonder here in the US with &quot;Bang a Gong&quot;, a sort of red herring for this album that is full of complex and laid-back melodies and spacy sounds. T. Rex's albums are available in cheap CD packages and this masterpiece seemed to be headed for the same path, had the good folks at Rhino not remastered it in a lovely (but flimsy) digi-pack set with several bonus tracks and a sad interview with Bolan. He was speaking about how he was hoping to conquer to the US and give them an album that everyone would enjoy: instead, no radio station wanted to play the songs (prog radio thought it should be on pop, and vice versa) and the album quickly became a lost classic.<BR>With this reissue, we can now all enjoy the magnificent sounds within the album, and lament the untimely loss of Bolan in 1977 in a car accident. It is sad that this album, a true musical and lyrics masterwork, should be relegated to &quot;underground&quot; status when it should be multi-platinum and ubiquitous. However, the true fans can now enjoy this lush album to its full sonic wonders and let the legend of Marc Bolan live on. Enjoy.
B000002J1O|5.0|The three best genesis albums (IMO) were made in succession of each other starting with Foxtrot and ending with The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. This one comes right smack in the middle, and it just may be the best one of them all. Reasons? Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Firth Of Fifth, The Battle Of Epping Epping Forest, and The Cinema Show are all extremely excellent Genesis pieces. I Know What I Like is a classic playful little song. After The Ordeal is a nice instrumental. More Fool Me is a Phil Collins-sung piece, and Aisle Of Plenty reprises DOWTMK ending the album perfectly. Besides being possibly Genesis' best album, it's also the perfect starting point.
B0000931QA|1.0|Now to me this sound's nothing like Iron Maiden,and totally nothing like my favorite band Mid career Helloween,I would recommend the Warning album way,way over this glammy commercialistic uncatchy one.I mean the only just kind of catchy song's,are the song's,Eye's of a stranger,and I don't believe in love,and I still don't think even those are really all that catchy.I mean I was so discusseded at this album,and the greatest hits that I totally accidentally bashed the album Warning,which in my experience sofar is their only really good album.But,I guess it just depends if you like the more glammy sound,over the traditional distorted sound,or visa versa,and truthfully it's not just that,sometimes I'll be really into a song  at first,like the song Revolution calling,but then right when Geoff Tate hit's the chorus I'll be totally let down.I mean that chorus is just repetitious,and stupid.Pretty much like this whole album.I think this hole band is kinda slow anyway's,but atleast the Warning album was slow,and sounded good.This is just slow,and it's not really that catchy at all.Put it this way I mainly listen to Power Metal like Mid career Helloween,Firewind,Brainstorm,Mystic Prophecy,Jag Panzer,and Iron maiden,plus many,many more group's.But when I first heard this album I really,really thought that Queensryche totally sucked,I mean,I still,hate pretty much every song on this album.<br />So I thought that's impossible!right?What with the hype,and the fact that Helloween fan's,and Iron Maiden fan's,and Power Metal fans in general usually like Queensryche.So I bought as a last resort the Greatest hit's album,that I think now must not have had very many song's from the Warning album,because I hated pretty much all the song's on that album too.I think the problem is that I might only like their older stuff or something,because I hate the Greatest hit's album,and this one too with a passion.So if you'r like me,and only seem to like their older stuff or just like them beforetheir pre sell out glammy album's that might be like this one,or maybe if you just like Queensryche old,and new.I strongly recommend these semi hard to find copy band's like Ion Vein,and their album that to me beat's the everliving snot out of this one,Reigning Memories,and also the band's All to human,Shadow keep,Kategory V,and Black Majesty,Plus from the reigning god father's of all Power Metal Mid career Helloween,and any of their first two albums Keeper's of the seven key's part one,and part two,after that they start getting a little weird sounding though.So listen at you'r own risk,and I think that's about it,except for the fact that I wrote a couple of low rated reviews on the Warning album,that I did purely on assumption before I even really listened to it,but just disregard those,because I did type another review,and gave it five star's so hopefully it will all even out....
1401300901|5.0|Fantastic chick-lit book with a twist.....I loved this book!!<BR>It was a quick read and extremely entertaining! I can't understand why people did not enjoy it, but take it from me (as a chick-lit afficcionado (sp?)), this was WORTH THE MONEY!! FANTASTIC!!!
B00006J3WH|5.0|What is part rock, part pop, a large dollop of Broadway, a dash of new age, and, without question, a whole lot of Hollywood.  If you guessed that it is the last Monkees album - you're wrong.  Instead, imagine the sublime - Opera Buffy.  Only the powers that be know how long Joss Whedon nursed a secret desire to pen musicals, but one day he realized that his actors could do more than just carry a tune, and months later an enthralled television audience was listening to the impossible - a vampire slayer musical.<br />Giles (Anthony Head) has already demonstrated singing ability, but we quickly forget that today's actors often have invisible talents.  Thus, the singing abilities of Tara, Spike, and Anya come as a surprise.  And, even if Buffy will never be the next Aretha Franklin, her voice has the poignancy needed to communicate her loss.  Truly, the show was the triumph of the season, and one of the most memorable episodes in a series that produced more than its share of the remarkable.  Remember though, what we find engage and the actors find fun was a harsh visit to reality for the characters.  For each, honesty prevails, not as release as a face to face confrontation with truths unbearable.  The price of the demon's curse is to make one's dearest illusions equivocal at best.<br />Whedon has never fallen victim to the temptation of being too cute.  Once More With Feeling follows the pattern of the season - bitter, painful, and in the long run, tragic.  As Buffy struggles to adjust to her fall from paradise, Tara confronts Willow's compulsive spell making, Giles realizes the Buffy needs to grow, and Spike realizes once again that all he can ever create with Buffy is a self-destruction.  The music is used to deepen the episode rather than gloss it over, short-circuiting the contractions of the spoken dialog.<br />Production values - considering this was a made for television effort these are excellent.  In fact, the music exceeds all expectations.  Tongue in check at moments when it adopts the pompous attitude of the classic broadway extravaganza will all the fanfares, it also delivers intimate moments of tenderness and loss with the same fidelity.  While Whedon had a lot of help reaching this level of polish, the inner concepts and structure are his, enhanced mostly by his own staffers, and then perfectly executed by the staff.  This would be good music regardless of its context.t moments when it adopts the pompous attitude of the classic broadway extravaganza will all the fanfares, it also delivers intimate moments of tenderness and loss with the same fidelity.

B00005RDRO|4.0|If you grew up in the 80's and liked Clue, you'll also like Murder by Death.  The performances are first-rate, the comedy is timed perfectly, and the story keeps you guessing till the final scene (literally).<br />That said, this DVD is EXPENSIVE for it not to have any special features.
0060730552|3.0|Where to start....<br />well, the story itself is riveting. LOTS of technical details, which is to be expected, but a bit difficult unless you've had Mountaineering 101! Familiarising yourself with basic mountain-climbling terms would be a help before you plunge into this incredible story. <BR>I found myself asking these questions at the end of the story:<BR>Joe, how was your vision?<br />did you have more surgery when you got home? <br />how was your recovery at home, physically and mentally?<br />have you climbed with Simon again?<br />why didn't Simon write so much as word one for your book? not even the briefest of comments in the intro?<br />why did you abruptly cut off the &quot;epilogue&quot;?<BR>It leaves the reader wondering just what happened to you after you got home? <br />How was the journey home?<br />Why didn't we hear Simon speaking for himself?<br />How is it that you found the desire and strength..inner and outer..to go climbing again?<br />I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this book, and I plan to give it away to a friend who is &quot;into&quot; climbing. <BR>The story is interesting enough, but I was left at the end saying WHAT?! that's the END???? Not in a breathless way, but slightly disappointed.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|While the storyline ended up somewhat disappointing and strangely obvious, the matrix revolutions still has a lot of incredible action to watch. I personally thought that keanu and his on-screen girlfriend came off as dull and almost lifeless throughout the trilogy, but the W brothers created such lush visuals that I don't mind the shortcomings.  The Zion battle is the most intense fight sequence I've ever seen at a theater. CGI's come a long way hasn't it.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|This is the only cd that should ever be re-released . With all the bull sh*t on the radio and in the videos today ( uncluding alot of nas new material ) , kids need to know what real hip hop is and its not all about ho's clothes and money rolls . for realla !  if you have never heard this cd untill now i recommend Cormega's music to you > But ILLMATIC is on another level  AND IM GHOST  ! ! PEACE
0465011020|4.0|this book was everything I hoped it would be. it was a sad story, but its words were not simlply used up in emotions. as I finished up the book, it really even inspired me to take action regarding north korea. how? that I don't know, but somehow. perhaps I should contact my congressman or find out about some agencies working with north korean refugees.<br />the stories about the camp were horrifying at times and well-written about. the flow of the middle chapters was not perfect, but its content, not to mention the rest of the book, totally made up for it. the chapters at the very beginning and the very end were especially good, particularly his description of his &quot;happy childhood in pyongyang&quot; and adjusting to life in south korea. excellent book worth my time. if you have any kind of interest in east asia or north korea in particular, you should definitely read this.
0385512104|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It's one of the most memorable books I've ever read.  The writing is fantastic.  It's incredible how the author &quot;gets into the head&quot; of the autistic 15-year old.  The scene in the London Underground is so descriptive.  It's worth reading the book for that one part alone.But other reasons to read the book are the fun diagrams, mathematical equations, and other schematics which are incorporated into the text.  I have recommended this book to a number of my friends.  To those who are animal lovers (like myself), I do offer the disclaimer that the story begins with the discovery of the corpse of the neighbor's dog.  But I qualify that by stating that it's not all that sad to read about, since we have not been previously introduced to the dog.  I am on a personal mission to encourage as many people as possible to read this book.  But, I'm not loaning mine out, because I can't wait to read it again.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Okay, while i'll admit, along with the majority of you that this album is probably the best of 2003, i can not even comprehend how many of you can even begin to compare this band to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, among others.  Yes it is a beautiful Debut album, and does some very experimental things with the rock genre, but that's all it is, just one album.  I wholeheartedly recommend buying this ablbum, if only because the music to dollar ratio is so great.  But that's all it is.  One album.  Wait a few years and tell me where these guys are.  I feel them reaching the... say... Foreigner type status.  You know, remembered for a few things, but just not on the same level as the greats.  Go ahead and rip me, fans, but you know it's the truth.

0446310786|5.0|This story is about a 8 year old girl named Jean Louise (Scout) Finch that lives with her father Atticus and her brother Jeremy(Jem) Finch in the little town of Maycomb.This book was really interesting and touching and made me think about what colored people had to go through to live in the south.My favorite part was the Tom Robinson trial.I also liked the movie too.It didnt show all the details that were in the book, but it was a great reselmblence :)
B00005OAIE|4.0|Despite the poor review given by Rickey Wright (Amazon's own critic), I find Mayer's album to be quite on the money.  Indeed, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is casual and not extremely definitive, but so was Mayer's style at the time.  It has the easy listening beat and vocal, and the lyrics are positively charming.  <br />&quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Why Georgia,&quot; and &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; are all rather self explanatory.  The so-called error in &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; in not mentioning the verbal offense, is not so egregious, rather it is the point altogether; the ambiguity allowing for a degree of personal relation.  I particuarly enjoyed the momentary pause and &quot;...just one more thing...&quot;  Very amusing, and uncommon to solo vocalists.<br />Finally, I adore &quot;St. Patrick's Day.&quot;  A witty work of creativity.
6302814359|4.0|Its pretty clear to everyone that this sequel is not a good as the first one....but it has its cool moments, unlike the third one!!!! BUT BEHOLD RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD FANS!! A studio is finally producing this classic sequel on dvd for the first time. There will also be many extras to satisfy the long wait on this title. These are not rumors either, this is accurate news. Just be patient..I have a feeling whatever studio producing this title on dvd will not let the fans down...so be on the look out!!!!!!!
B000001G5H|5.0|At first, though I love music very much, I don't know about piano music very much and I can't play piano, for that I may be not able to write the professional piano review.<br />I always listen to the music of many genres, off course classical music too. My father is a classical music fan and in my home there are many cds. I chanced to find the pollini's cd in the house. The knowledge that I had known about chpin etudes before listening the CD was [the most difficult musics by pianists][etudes is bore works made by developing their skills]only. But after I listened to the CD, such the thinking reversed to contrary way,that is to say, their etudes was what I could be fun very much rather than bore musics, and felt the chopin's geniouse abbitity that could fill his emotion and feeling etc to their piano works, even etudes, that is, as he wanted to do what he wished, he feflected to his works.<br />In Japan, the special title words are named to the most famouse chipin's piano etudes, for instance in Op10 No 12 is [Kakumei=revolutionary] in Op25No10[Kogarashi=the name of the winter dry and cold wind that blow in Tokyo region only ] in Op25No12[Taiyou=great ocean]etc.<br />My most favorite works is[revolutionary, Kogarashi, Taiyou].<BR>By chance, my favorite works agree with named number in Japan.<BR>Especially, I loved the intro of Revolutionary, the unique down sound moving, the sound making of the intro and the contradiction of the bright melody and the dimmy Alpegio of the accompaniment is as if Chopin filled to the works his emotions that was at the mercy of the dramatic history in Porland. The reasons that I love Revolutionary is off course the supecial sounds and skill, but in addition to them, like upper writing the sounds that enclosed his emotion to the works is the one reason of my favorite thing.<br />The reason that I like [Taiyou etude] is the greate sounds as if men more than three play the work. <BR>In such meanings, Japanese title name is proper naming that agree with our thinking etc.<br />Thank you for reading poor English.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Once again, I feel ripped off by this extremely irrelevant Beatles release. Once again, a job completely gets botched. How do I even begin? The sequencing? Horrible. It sounds like the cd is on random. The original album has a character and a flow, this piece of garbage has neither. The &quot;alternate&quot; versions? Other than an improvement of the sonic quality of the guitars and drums, the takes are not as good as the ones Phil Spector picked for the original, the takes are hardly THAT different in terms of performance, except that they hit their marks alot better on the Phil Spector original (Dig A Pony and For You Blue-which doesn't include George's quips in the solo section-are PERFECT examples of this..., and the remixing totally takes away great moments and botches things like the vocal blend on Two of Us....THIS IS NOT THE BEATLES &quot;NAKED&quot;....there's overdubs, there's &quot;flying in&quot; stuff from other takes, they include &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (recorded one year earlier in January of '68, with overdubs) but not Maggie Mae, which is the kind of little item that gives Let It Be it's whole character (similarly, ALL the quips have been removed, like &quot;We hope we passed the audition&quot; or &quot;I dig a pygmy by Charles Hawtrey&quot;,etc...this reminds me of the Yellow Submarine dvd, which rerecorded the score horribly and removed MANY little sound effects that cumulatively effect the movie, in my opinion).....basically, this is a huge waste of money. We could have had the 20 minute version of Helter Skelter, the unreleased &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, the original electric version of &quot;Love You To&quot;....instead we have them REPLACING the rooftop versions of &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; and &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot;...where they are playing truly &quot;naked&quot;.....actually I had to stop the cd player at I've Got A Feeling....the original, rooftop version you can actually hear Paul's voice echoing off the buildings in theintro, it's a really subtle, but magic moment that is now &quot;dry as a bone&quot; on the &quot;new&quot; version. Maybe it's a different take, I didn't even look. And the &quot;lost&quot; version of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was ALREADY RELEASED on the Anthology (ie:the Phil Spector take without the strings)!!!! This is just another, inferior take. If this was so damned important, what they should have done was remaster the original Let It Be album (ALL THE BEATLES ALBUMS SHOULD BE REMASTERED!! THEY SOUND HORRIBLE!!!!) and put a second disc of alternate versions so that everyone was happy. Basically, Phil Spector, love him or hate him, is one hell of a distinctive producer and this album only makes me appreciate his efforts even more. APPLE, EMI, OR WHOEVER.....JUST REMASTER THE BEATLES CATALOG ALREADY, YOU IMBECILES!!! THEY'VE JUST RERELEASED &quot;WHO'S NEXT&quot; FOR LITERALLY THE 4th or 5th TIME! HENDRIX IS THE SAME WAY! THE BEATLES CATALOG HAS ONLY GOTTEN ONE (HORRIBLE SOUNDING) RELEASE IN THE 1980's!!!! (other than the White Album remastering which sounds amazing). WHAT IS SO HARD ABOUT DOING THIS RIGHT? And stop marketing these glorified &quot;bootlegs&quot; as legitimate product so that people who don't know any better buy this and not the original albums. Do you know how many people I know ONLY have crap like this or the Anthology series, but not ONE actual Beatles album? My entire life I've seen horrible compilation (Reel Music, Beatles Love Songs, 20 Greatest Hits) released after horrible compliation (the Beatles Rarities, Rock and Roll Music). I have TONS of outtakes from the Let It Be sessions, this lousy release does NOTHING to compliment them. I could go on and on but I haven't enough pens!!!! Don't even get me started about the bizzare, dizzying second disc of chatter and jams, crossfaded every 10 seconds or so....YOU LITERALLY WILL FEEL LIKE A FLY!!!!!
B00008ADPF|4.0|Nickelback is simple. Their guitar riffs are extremely easy to play and follow, and their lyrics have nothing complicated about them whatsoever. I thought about that for awhile, and then relized exactly why I like this CD so much...its raw. Basic emotions and lifes problems are the basis for most of the songs here, and with the music loud and the distorted electric doing that signiture Nickelback 'chug-chug-chug' most of the time, you just can't help but love it. The choruses are catchy and fun to sing (scream) along with, so if you're looking for a very solid, rock CD that you can listen to over and over.. this is the best I've found in a long time. I couldn't bring myself to give it five stars simply because the pure talent isn't there to compete with my other five star ratings, but don't let that deter you... its well worth the purchase.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Are you stark raving mad Lucas?!?  Issue the original theatrical releases of these movies on DVD as well.  If you don't, you'll be totally responsible for destroying your own Star Wars legacy!  You'll be synonymous with Grand Moff Tarkin's comment to Darth Vader, \\"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.\\"  Personally I'm not buying these DVD's.  Thankfully, I have my original Star Wars Trilogy Widescreen editions on Laserdisc.  So I'm not as desperate as those with VHS tapes.  But I promise you that if you don't release the originals, a lot of fans like me will not purchase your media again.  [***], even your friend Spielberg released his original version of E.T. along with his special editions!  So for the love of the Force, listen to your fans!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Here's the good news. The majority of people who saw &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; DID get it. That's simply why it has earned so much praise and sold so well, not only here but worldwide. <br />It's a not to be missed film.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Firt of all this movie is more of a suddle comedy and not a lugh out loud comedy, and that's what I like so much about it. And aside from the comedy, the acting is the best I've ever seen! Bill Murray is at the top of his game in this film. Another thing I like about it is the wacky romance between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Overal, if youre somebody whose favorite movie is something like Scary Movie, chances are your'e not going to like it.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Wednesday, March 31, 2004 / 4 of 5 / An above average comic book to movie translation.  I found Ang Lee's treatment of the Hulk mythos to be interesting and compelling.  While some liberties were taken with the back story and creation of the Hulk, I think it worked out pretty well.  The pure CG Hulk himself doesn't detract but does serve to stand out against humankind and nature.  Banner's dad as the Absorbing Man was a bit of a stretch, couldn't they have waited for a Thor film for that?  Still, the effects for the Absorbing Man were good while he was on film.  Oh Jennifer Connely, where are those fit and full days of the HotSpot and Rocketeer?  You're too thin and look sickly now, it saddens me to have to say.  Overall the cast does a bang-up job especially Sam Elliot as Thunderbolt Ross.  Bruce Banner is adeptly played w/ wide range by Eric Bana.  There are some Crouching Tiger angles and sensibilities sprinkled about if you watch for them.  Recommended.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a movie that is in a class of its own. Like a new strain of movie-making. It forces you to keep your eyes glued to the screen to see what will take place next. This movie made me think &quot;what if&quot; all this is true, and I am programmed everyday to do things I normally wouldn't do. Its kind of scary if you think of it. I never get tired of watching this movie. No matter how many times I have seen it before. With its unmatched special effects and grade A acting it's easy to see why &quot;The Matrix&quot; was such a critical as well as a box-office smash.

B00000J6AG|5.0|This entire album rocks. The only problem i heard was the placement and order of some of the songs. There would be a nice ambient song and you would be thinking how nice it was and suddenly fast pace blaring techno is flung at you. I also want to compliment track 15, &quot;Inside&quot;. Many people overlook this song but in reality, it is very good.
B00003CXWV|4.0|George Jung is the focus in this film by Ted Demme. It's about the rise and fall of one of the country's biggest drug dealers. Johnny Depp is at it again playing Jung with a vulnerability that's easy to like. Ray Liotta co-stars as Jung's father. A man who tried as hard as he could, but never quite made it. Jung's mother ( played so good by Rachel Griffiths) is the example of what happens when a child doesn't exceed the potential of a parent.<br />After being caught with 660 pounds of marijuana and sent to prison for 26 months, Jung meets Diego. A Columbian who has a dream of bringing cocaine to the mainstream and getting rich while doing so. When Jung gets released he comes into contact with Diego and the great Pablo Escobar. The three form a partnership and everyone is filthy rich. However, Diego steals Jung's &quot;California Connection&quot; played by a welcomed Paul Reubens.<br />Penelope doesn't fit in this movie at all. Almost like a Highlights book. What's wrong with this picture?<br />Overall, this film was a great look into the mindset of a driven person who's ambition far exceeded his talent. Even though I felt sorry for Jung throughout the movie, I had to tell myself that he put himself in those situations. No one forced him to do what he did. So goes the cliche, &quot;You play with fire... you get burned&quot;.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I was sceptical when I first heard that Sofia Coppola, the daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola, wanted to become a director. This seemed to be carrying even Hollywood nepotism way too far. <br />I'm happy to say that Sofia Coppola completely overcame my scepticism with her first film: \\"The Virgin Suicides\\". Now, with \\"Lost in Translation\\" she's made a film so full of charm and observation that I just can't wait to see what she's going to do next. <br />Although \\"Lost in Translation\\" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.<br />Sofia Coppola's script is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson to develop their characters' relationships through looks, gestures, moments of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.<br />Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally. <br />Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land. <br />And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are somewhat more amusing. Some, most notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.<br />Film-makers sometimes don't do so well when they are visiting another culture. Even a mostly observant director like Wim Wenders can find him or herself coming over as a cultural tourist, as Wenders did in \\"Tokyo-Ga\\". <br />Coppola and her cameraman Lance Accord, take us through a similar landscape, of pachinko parlours, video game arcades, and karaoke bars, but they're less overwhelmed with the environment and a bit more willing to draw satire from it. A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols \\"God Save the Queen\\" in a karaoke bar, does - after all - have potentially humorous overtones. And the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant. <br />Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot. But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple. <br />Sofia Coppola's casting is inspired. The origin of the film was the city of Tokyo itself, which Coppola felt she wanted to put on screen, But once she'd decided that she began to look for characters and - from the beginning - had Murray in mind. In \\"Lost in Translation\\" Murray gives free rein to both his comic ability and his sensitivity.<br />Cast opposite him, Scarlet Johansson is about five years younger than the character she's playing. She's not yet even twenty, but she is already more than able to suggest a level of complexity far beyond her years. <br />Much the same statement also applies to director and screenwriter Sofia Coppola. Some have been sceptical about how someone so young could get into the head of a middle aged guy having a mid-life crisis. It doesn't surprise me so much. Coppola clearly possesses the art, insight and sensitivity to do it. And the only criticism I have about \\"Lost in Translation\\" is that it's all over way too fast.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is NOT RATM... How can you compare Chris to Zach (Chris Cornell is ten times the singer Zach is)! Why should Cornell write political songs? He's not Zach... Last I checked the band is &quot;Audioslave,&quot; not &quot;RATM&quot;. Get over your grieving and move on... It's Zach's fault the band is dead.<br />Soundgarden fans seem a bit more open minded...
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nas is truly one of the most intelluctual rappers of our time. He busted open the door for rap in 1994 with his classic Illmatic. Now that it's been 10 years, the new anniversery edition is out and trust me, this will not dissapoint. First off the booklet has been extended and the layout and design of the booklet is top notch. Also the CD faces have been redesigned and once again, it is top notch. The music is nas's best and the lyrics he spits our fire. They dwell into the streets as a poet onlooker and aknowledges violence as part of the environment, not the focus of his rhymes. EVERY signle song on Illmatic is a classic. The remixes on the second cd are just as good as the original, and in one instance, sometimes better. The only complaint is that even in the Parental Advisory edition, the Remixes on disc 2 are edited. Yet, 5 stars, it's a classic and Nas is the best rapper to ever grab a mic...this will only release his classic material to a new age of audience who might have overlooked illmatic simply because of it's age. Also, it sounds incredibly clearer than the original due to Digitally Remastering every song. WORTH EVERY PENNY!
1572814349|5.0|I buy a lot of Tarot decks and end up turning around and selling many of them when they don't live up to my expectations, but the Golden Tarot by Kat Black is a keeper.  What an amazing deck!<br />The collage work is nearly seamless and, because the images are taken from paintings rather than photographs, it doesn't look like a collage deck at all.  It looks like someone discovered a series of Renaissance paintings on the subject of Tarot!  And as others have mentioned, the symbolism is similiar enough to RWS that anyone familiar with that classic should be comfortable with this deck right out of the box.<br />The cards themselves are smooth and silky-feeling and strong enough to hold up to use, without being overly stiff.  The gilt edges give the deck a rich look.  And I LOVE the packaging US Games has come up with for this set and hope they use this design in the future!  The box is sturdy and attractive and easy to use without mangling the cards getting them in and out.  And the book, while small compared to a &quot;real&quot; book, is MUCH larger and more comprehensive than the typical LWB that accompanies most decks.<br />If I could give this set more than 5 stars, I would!
6301978587|5.0|There is little I can say to add to the reviews of this video below.  However, there has hardly been a mention of the musical composers who really went all the way and created one of the best scores for a &quot;musical&quot; drama done in the 1980's.  Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand created a series of musical numbers that made the movie such a great success.  Soft, lilting, longing tunes such as Will He Ever Look at Me That Way? and Papa Can You Hear Me? and the funny tunes such as Tomorrow Night are real show stoppers with melodies that stay in the memory for long after. Add to this the experienced vocal talents of Streisand and Patinkin.<br />All of the characters perform stellar roles.  There is certainly the demand for a DVD release, but will it come?  Does Hollywood give up its grudges so easily?  Maybe its time that Hollywood puts things in the past where they belong and give the audience what they want.  Streisand has proven time and time again that she has a great acting talent as well as a voice that cannot be beaten.  Funny Girl, On a Clear Day, What's Up Doc?, Prince of Tides are just some of the examples that outline a brilliant career.  Who will ever forget A Star is Born or The Way We Were?  A DVD of Yentl would be a great, well-earned topper to a brilliant career.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album has it all! Energetic songs, slow songs, ALL excellent songs! It's great to finally get an album where I love all the songs again! Life hasn't been this good since Metallica S&amp;M, or Euphoria Morning!
0451450523|4.0|&quot;The Unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone...&quot;<br />But when one day she overhears two hunters arguing about the existence, or not, of her kind, she starts wondering if she's indeed the last unicorn, and sets off on a quest to find others like her. Nobody believes in fairy tales anymore and everyone she meets thinks she's nothing more than a white mare. Even Mommy Fortuna, who captures her one night while she's indiscreetly sleeping on the edge of a wood, and puts her in a cage to entertain and impress customers of her Midnight Carnival, alongside other animals that the witch turns into various illusory mythical beasts. Hopefully, one of Fortuna's assistants, Schmendrick the wannabe magician, recognizes the unicorn for what she really is. He releases her, and travelling together, meeting a new companion called Molly Grue on the way, they make for King Haggard's cursed castle. There lives the terrible Red Bull, the blind, devilish creature responsible for the disappearance of the unicorns, or so they've heard.<br />The Last Unicorn is a real fairy tale, where everything seems to happen in a kind of ethereal, parallel reality. Beagle's style is such that every place, every character, and every action that takes place is hard to focus on, as if it were a dream that you're trying to remember. And on the other hand, it approaches very real themes, ones you can relate to, such as finding who you are and what you want to be, or making the right choices and compromises in your life... I won't say I understood it all, but I was charmed by this deep, very poetic, and sad tale of love and magic, good and evil, by this quest for seasons of candor, when we believe in fairy tales and legendary creatures.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This double-cd is one of the few arguments against pop music being brainless and bland (which is what it's rapidly becoming the last 10 years). It covers the era ranging from the Careless Whispers times to the Older LP and it's basically from those days when George Michael couldn't miss even if he sang his shopping list.<br />   Being that it is a double CD it really leaves nothing out and it's an honest offer as well: there is absolutely no filler to be found here.<br />   The first disc is dedicated more to the ballady side of George's and it's an emphatic reminder that not only pop music can be of high quality but simoultaneously very intelligent as well. The core of these ballads come from the brilliant &quot;Listen without prejudice&quot; album with the additions of mainstream classics such as the &quot;...Whispers&quot; or the duet with Elton John which is surprisingly good and 2-3 shots from the &quot;Older&quot; album.<BR>   These are seriously good songs any way you look at them. Michael has a tremendous voice but that wouldnt be enough were these songs lyrically cliche (which they're far from). They are basically ballads that carry the weight of a great combination:<BR>   heartfelt delivery with extremely intimate lyrics.<br />    The second disc explores the more funky-discoid side of Michael's and even though -in my opinion- it's not necessarily this singer's strong point it's still a decent proposition.<br />   George Michael may have been somewhat off-target with his last album (&quot;Patience&quot;) as well as with the previous one (&quot;Older&quot;) but this double-cd Best Of is overwhelming evidence of his talent as a singer and a songwriter.<br />    When it comes to music for the masses they dont come much better than that...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I watched this movie two weeks ago and I am still waiting for something to happen.  It stumbles and bumbles along with no real point. I guess critics like that kind of thing; I found it a complete waste of an evening.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie was so boring I ended up turning it off before it ended.  I have NO idea how it won so many awards.  There was definitely better movies made this year then this.  Don't waste your money purchasing it!  If you for some odd reason still want to see it, rent it. You will end up thanking me that you only wasted $3 and not $17.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Put aside all the &quot;Manson-Hater&quot; comments and listen to the album for what it is.  Perhaps if there was not so much conflict between the &quot;Manson's Not Goth&quot; crowd and true fans, this album would have received even more credit then it did with it's release. &quot;Beautiful People&quot; has become such a timeless hit blasting more then just &quot;Beautiful People&quot;.  It goes beyond the obvious meaning, and to all those people who refuse to expand their musical horizon and refuse to listen to anything except underground music are just another one of the beautiful people.  If you truly don't like Manson's music, fine...but to be &quot;afraid&quot; to admit you like him because your &quot;true goth&quot; friends won't like you that's crappy.  And to not like him because he became too &quot;mainstream&quot;, that is also stupid.  Any artist who says he does not want to bigger then just underground, that's bulls***.  No one is saying you have to collaborate with the Backstreet Boys or change your music just because your well known.  It would be a greater success to have your music heard by more then just the underground so you can expand your musical message and maybe make a difference rather then just being close minded.  Anyway, back to the album.  I could go on and on about each individual song, but they are all great.  A true masterpiece indeed.  I will always remember this album, and will most likely find myself listening to it even many years down the road.  Very high marks go out to Marilyn Manson, A+.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|WrestleMania XX was amazing,I would never think of forgeting <BR>it. The matches were excellent no PPV could top it but some of the matches like Kane and the Undertaker should have had something like a Buried Alive stipulation. Overall WrestleMania XX belonged to the Crippler winning the best match of the night. Here are my ratings:<br />1)John Cena VS The Big Show 8/10<BR>Great opener John Cena with two  F U's to the big man<BR>and also using those custom made US knucks.<br />2)Chris Jericho VS Christian 9/10<BR>This match was better than I thought it would be Trish Stratus <BR>making an appearence and hitting Chris on the head with her shouder and Christian got a Roll up.<br />3) La Resitance VS Booker T and RVD VS Garrison Kade and Mark Jindrak VS The Dudley Boys 8/10<BR>This was good for a Tag Team match with Sudden Death rules this match ended when Booker T hit the scissors kick and Rvd landing the Five star frog splash.<br />4) Rock n' Sock Connection VS Evolution 9/10<BR>Well this match was defineatly one of the funniest espeacially <BR>the Rock and Flair. Flair trying his own version of the peoples elbow. MIck Foley tryed to use Mr Socko on Randy Orton but Orton hit the RKO from nowhere and covered Foley for the Three count.<br />5) Torri Willson and Sable VS Stacy Kiebler 5/10<BR>The only reason this match got 5/10 was because they are hot.<br />6) Cruiser weight Open 9/10<BR>This was one high flying, fast paced match with Chavo Gurrero <BR>retaining his title with some help from Chavo Senior.<br />7) Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar 6/10<BR>This match was very boring Goldberg and Brock Lesnar were just standing in the middle of the ring just taunting at each other.<BR>Goldberg defeated Brock with Two Spears and a Jackhammer.<br />8) Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi VS The APA VS The Basham Brothers VS The Self Proclaimed World Greatest Tag Team 8/10<BR>this match was also great for a Tag Team match with all four teams hammering the hell out of each other. Rikishi endingthe match with a Banzai Drop.<br />9)Molly Holly VS Victoria 7/10<BR>A Decent match with Victoria retaining the Womens Championship with a Roll up. Then Molly got her head shaved she tried her best to escape but couldn't because Victoria knocked her out and tied her to the chair.<br />10) Kurt Angle VS Eddie Gurrero 10/10<BR>This match was amazing it proved that Eddie could be a great champion and he promised that after Wrestlemania he is going<BR>to Lie, Cheat and Steal like never before.<br />11) Undertaker VS Kane 10/10<br />Undertaker making his return as promised but a suprise return was also made by Paul Bearer. Kane couldn't beleive what he saw infront of him. Kane learning never to mess with his brother again and he learned it with a Tombstone Piledriver.<br />12) Chris Beniot VS Shawn Micheals VS Triple H 10/10<BR>The best of match the night Triple H and Shawn Micheals Double teaming on Beniot but at the end of the night Chris Beniot reigned supreme with his head up high and his title on his shoulder and he did it with a crippler crossface.<br />The extras on the DVD are: Matches<BR>                           Photos<BR>                           WRESTLEMANIA XX Trivia<BR>                           interviews <BR>                           The Mania of WrestleMania<BR>                           Hall of Fame inductes ceremony <BR>                           10 Greates Westlemania matches<BR>                           plus more<br />There are many reasons why I want to Buy WRESTLEMANIA XX two of them are: 1) Because it is Wrestlemania XX.<BR>          2) It was a great PPV.<BR>So I recommend this DVD to you.
B000001DYD|2.0|P.J. Harvey`s sophomore album combines some grunge elements, punk attitude, riot grrrl echoes and indie rock signs into and uneven and flawed whole. There`s some real energy and raw power here, still most of these songs are just curious but not particularly interesting achievements. Yes, there are a couple of good moments such as the opener title-track \\"Rid of Me\\", the more calm \\"Missed\\", the sinister \\"Man-Size Sextet\\" or the mellow \\"Dry\\", even if the majority of the other songs are just so-so efforts that fail to rise above average. Maybe this is due to Steve Albini`s production (who also worked with Nirvana, Pixies, Breeders and, yes, Bush), highly gritty and rushed, making the record replete with inconstant sound levels that become mildly irritating and distracting. \\"Rid of Me\\" shines at parts, but a solid and rich record it is not, offering little staying power. For a great P.J. Harvey album, try \\"Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea\\", probably her more mature and developed work.<br />Not bad, but not good enough either.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|this is a great record.  glad I bought it.<br />I've never really listened to Muse before, and I just got on my friend's reccomendation.<br />dreamy but heavy. lots of orchestration. seems to be a concept album. <BR>very well written.  much better than most records I have heard in the last 4 years.<br />just trust me and go out and buy this album
B000001Y5X|4.0|Very cool album especially at the time of it's release when grunge seemed to be the dominant form of rock and metal.  You could sense the mastermind ways of Manson and how much he was going to expand on his talent and shock content with future albums.  &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot; has to be one of my favorites.  &quot;Dope Hat&quot; is definitely up there as well as &quot;Cyclops&quot;.  The last 6 songs on the album are not as good as the first 7 but overall this is for sure a great album.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Reviewer: catpole from Canada<BR>As said before, this may be the finest film ever made. However, just reading Kabir's review further down this page I have to agree with him 100%. The fatal flaw in not in the film itself - which may be the best ever made -  but in the DVD package since it was made over 20 years ago. It's a BIG Question Kabir raises, and a crucial one. Why ISN'T there equal if not greater space given to bios of the magnificent Indian actors who made this film shine when the white actors are given this basic attention?! This smacks of the discrimination Gandhi dedicated his life to. I don't blame Sheen and Co, who also put in great performances, but I DO blame the company that put the DVD together. And why isn't Hindi included along with English, both as as audio track and major subtitle when lesser known languages are? This just doesn't make sense and IS an insult to Indian people. I'm sure Attenborough, Kingsley, and Gandhi himself would disapprove (I'm a white guy by the way). I won't boycott this film because apart from these things it still carries a great message but c'mon Colombia, get with it!! Money grubbing dogs. The company might makew some amends by donating a major portion of this film's profits to, say, the Dalits, but I won't be holding my breath. In the meantime, Kabir, maybe I'll just show it to all my friends for free, free of any guilt. :) Peace.
B0000507PC|2.0|Although it tries to create some controversy about key issues like abortion or incest, this movie is nothing more than an average story about two cute innocent youngsters who begin to deal with the real world and its diverse difficulties. Director Lasse Hallstrom intends to deliver some mildly shocking material here to provide thoughtful deep questions, but it is presented in a common, simplified and almost soap opera-like way. The rest is a sweet little romance between the appealing leads Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron, two cofused young adults who don`t understand their envoironment. To their credit, they perform their roles well, as does Michael Caine, so there`s still a reason to watch the movie. Overall, though, it`s just another fluffy well-made Hollywood movie with pleasant direction and a plot that could have been from an above average TV-movie. <br />Probably worth watching once, and that`s it.
B00008J2DR|1.0|Apparently nobody told Godsmack that new metal is in its dying gasp, which makes them only easier to hate, even new metal innovators Korn have moved on by now. The band is still steeped in riff heavy metal, in the same style as Metallica, Megadeth and Soundgarden, only the band has neither the musical ability or the intellectual stamina to keep up with any of those bands. Frontman Sully Erna, like Creed's Scott Stapp is better at baring his pecs then he is at commenting on society, he tries the same route as James Hetfield, and sometimes he sounds almost as heartfelt, but not nearly as intelligent, the fact is any fifth grader whose read a couple of Curious George books could probably make observations on the same level as Erna. The album has its moments, but these are rare and Erna still sounds like a bad Eddie Vedder parody. In any case the album is (id like to end this review with something completely unoriginal, fitting considering its a Godsmack album) boring.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Following the release of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, Marilyn Manson did the exact opposite of what everybody expected from him by releasing &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;.  The album is far different from the Industrial-Metal sound that Antichrist had.  However, this is not a bad thing.  Mechanical Animals is not only my favorite Marilyn Manson album, but one of my favorites of all time.  This album has a Sci-Fi Death feeling to it featuring fresh guitar riffs, spacey atmospheres and the classic depressed infused vocals of Manson.  &quot;Speed of Pain&quot; is one of my favorites and &quot;Dope Show&quot; has such a great Future-Cyber feel to it, perhaps the sci-fi evolution of &quot;Beautiful People&quot; from antichrist.  Overall the album reminds me of David Bowie with hints of Pink Floyd, two great artists which I'm sure influenced Marilyn on this album.  Great album, beyond worth purchasing and indeed worth a listen no matter what style of music you like.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This move is with out a doubt the best movie ever made.<BR>It has some of the most famous quotes and scens of all time.<BR>Tony shows how life is at the top and the bottom.<BR>The movie also shows what happens when you get to greedy.<BR>I watched this movie over 20 times and i still love to watch it.<BR>Scarface should get 10 stars and it is the greatest movie ever.<BR>Thank You Tony Montana
B00005JMEW|2.0|(...) Basically, Uma Thurman`s character just wants to \\"Kill Bill\\". And this movie is pretty much a staightforward sequence of well-directed and cleverly made action scenes with enough blood and violence to deserve cult status and some appeal. Mix some black humour, cultural and cinematic references, technical gimmicks, a cool soundtrack and even an anime sequence and you will have \\"Kill Bill\\". What seems to be lacking is a decent and original plot, since this is nothing more than a typical revenge story about a vitimized and angry tough woman. Overall, this is flashy and disposable entertainment that doesn`t care to provide much food for thought. Not that it is a bad thing, but Tarantino has done better and a movie like this doesn`t deserve all the praise it got. <BR>Disappointing.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|&quot;Holy-Hot-Devil-Rock,&quot; this music makes you want to get up and move around like you lost your soul to the devil.  I bought this CD like 4 days ago and can't stop playing it wherever I go.  This is a CD that on your first listen you can't take seriously or you'll easily pass it off as a large peice of underproduced crap.  After you give the disk a chance you'll be sucked into its charm and tranced out by its simplicity.  Featuring &quot;Dr. Cool&quot; himself &quot;Josh Homme&quot; from Queens of the Stone Age, not singing and playing guitar but drumming of all things, he's not an incredible drummer but he belts out the stripper beats effortlessly and everyone knows that whatever Josh Homme touches turns to solid gold. The album is very reminescent of the &quot;Desert Sessions&quot; series, only better and made for dancing.<BR>I can't pick a favorite song on the album because they're all really amazing, but &quot;Flames Go Higher&quot; catches your ear on first listen as a grooved out stomp in hell, oh yeah, &quot;HELL,&quot; that's where the humor comes in, most of the songs have overtones of references to &quot;the Devil and Hell,&quot; stemming from Jesse Hugh's love for the Devil.  The novelty won't wear off because &quot;Satanic tranced out boogie-woogie music&quot; is just such an original concept.<BR>This album is not a Queens of the Stone age CD to say the least, so don't get confused, its just highly original rocka and roll.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Looking at one particularly bizarre review here I have to say that some people's way of looking at this charming little film is so very strange<br />First, the characters DO go out and explore and enjoy Tokyo and Japan, (Charlotte does anyway, Bob is mostly caught up in work) but they ARE carrying within them their own sadnesses and jetlag. This is not a hard thing to see in the film. <br />Neither are either of them remotely describable as &quot;ugly Americans&quot;. They are puzzled by an alien culture, but neither of them puts that puzzlement down to the other culture's fault. Charlotte in particular would clearly like to know the place around her better. Shown particularly clearly in the Japanese wedding scene.<br />And they phone home to reawaken contacts with old friends, NOT to complain about anything that is happening to them in Tokyo. Charlotte is not upset with Tokyo. She's upset with her husband. Bob is dealing with strains within his marriage. <br />So yes, they meet, both jetlagged and sleepless in the middle of the night. The ranting reviewer has failed to point out that there are plenty of &quot;white faces&quot; around in the hotel but these two spot kindred spirits in each other. And they'd actually RATHER explore the city and the people together than hang out with any of the Americans. <br />And neither of them does refer to Tokyo as a &quot;miserable hell&quot;. That's all in the writer's own &quot;mind&quot;. Pinning all the marvellous complex relationship issues in this film down to a dislike of the &quot;alien&quot; is evidence of a chip on one's own shoulder. Some reviews are autobiography. Not about the movie at all.<br />The spectacle of a girl standing and watching her boyfriend playing a music video game is hardly specific to Japan (as anyone who has a PS2 will know). And yes, it does look weird, unless you are actually the one doing the playing. I've seen it in other places than Tokyo. These guitar, drum, dance, video games can be encountered in many parts of the world you know. In America we might also film people gazing mindlessly at a TV set to show the same kind of concentration (and to what end). <br />In the karaoke scene, no one implies that Bob or Charlotte can sing any better than the locals or show them how to do it. Everyone has fun with it in their own way. And if you HAVE ever experienced karaoke (which has - incidentally - again spread worldwide from Japan) you'll know it's not about the quality of the singing anyway but the enjoyment. To put this scene down as the &quot;arrogance&quot; of Americans shows that chip on the shoulder yet again. EVERYONE is enjoying themselves here, until Bob and Charlotte's jetlag finally does catch up with them. <br />The film makes fun of the weird things that the Japanese do, but it also makes fun of the weird things Americans do in a foreign country. And this apparently has gone right over more than one reviewer's head. And the humor in the movie is invariably affectionate. Unlike some of the bitter comments here on Amazon.<br />It isn't about being American, Japanese, or any other nationality, if I had written a review as full of idiocy and as self-revealing as that one, THEN I would have been so ashamed.
0671027344|4.0|I just finished reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower after 2 days of my nose in the book - it's that engaging. What a beautiful first novel. &quot;Charlie&quot; made me laugh, cry, and relate to everything he was going through. Very easy to read and difficult to put down once begun. The stories he tells through his letters are heartwrenching, comical, adroit, touching, sad, and hopeful, with a simple yet overwhelming gratefulness for life, love, friends and family. I highly recommend this book to junior high and high schoolers, especially, and to English teachers for that age group as a book to read and discuss in class. Charlie is such a beautiful, sensitive soul, I wish I knew him as a friend. Ultimately uplifting, read this book and feel infinite.
B000089RVX|4.0|Amy Lee has an amazing voice.  Simalar to Kelly Clarkson's,but she uses it in a gothic-rock-pop sort of way that makes it seem quite a bit different and more favorable in my opinion.  This CD has those slow songs-My Immortal-and faster paced ones-Going Under.  Evanescence very uniquely mixes different types of music, yet simalar to many groups that i think it lists for you somewhere on this page.  The best songs according to my friends-going under, bring me back to life,haunted, and imaginary.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Just watched and listened to the CD/DVD last night. I thought that it was great! The DVD really shows how Michael and his marvelous band have a true passion for this genre of music. Plus, the CD is great... I really like his version of &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; and the other tracks are from live concerts. I also like how the DVD shows the true side of Michael, and that he is very straight forward and is who he is whether we like it or not (but that's why we like him) - phe[...] This is a must have for any Michael Bublé fan, and for whoever loves this fantastic music.
B00008PC2O|5.0|I haven't read all 531 reviews here as of this writing, but most everyone seems to focus on the 2nd DVD with the Hi-Def content. I actually bought the Extreme DVD for the high def content, but then decided the set was worth it for the 1st DVD alone.<br />The 1st DVD disc has two things that totally thrilled me. An interactive mode which completely details all the special effects on screen and lets you break-away at several key-points to hear about sound, special effects and production notes from many of the people involved in the film. To me this is much more compelling than a Director's narrative.<br />The other thing that totally blew me away on the 1st DVD is the Dolby Headphone Soundtrack. I've heard many headphone oriented surround technologies, but nothing like this. The sound over headphones is truely awesome. If I din't know I was watching a movie I would absolutely think the dogs barking in one particular scene were outside my condo. I actually prefer it to listening to the soundtrack over my thousand dollar speaker system.<br />One other note the picture quality of the 1st DVD seems signifigantly better than the quality of the origional DVD release of T2. I often found it hard to beleive I was watching a DVD.<br />I didn't consider myself a huge T2 fan before I bought this DVD, but it has defintely made me a bigger one. The high-def content is nice, but it doesn't make the set in my opinion.
014028009X|5.0|How could you not like Bridget Jones? She is everywoman...struggling with weight, her job, and getting a boyfriend...this is a very funny, amazing book about a woman on a the longest journey called life...you'll Laugh Out Loud for SURE!...and she's British!  She has many funny episodes happen to her, and Mark Darcy is someone to very like.   Now, Bridget gets herself a boyfriend, who happens to be her boss, and her mother constantly nags her about getting a man, and everyone around her seem to tell her that her biological clock is ticking! \\"Tick- tock, tick-tock!\\" Ugh!  Poor Bridget, how will she cope?  What will she do? R-E-A-D the booK! You'll laugh.  This book is what started this whole chick lit genre, and if it started it all, I think it is very much worth reading!     EnjoY!
0060536969|4.0|I listened to this one on four cassettes, over the last week to and fro from work.  It was quite a solid story, with the quick caveat that there's an introduction read by the author.<BR> <BR>You know that saying, &quot;That guy has a face for radio?&quot;  Well, Michael Crichton has a voice for print.  I could barely maintain listening and concentration to his part, and heaved a sigh of relief when he finally shut up.<BR> <BR>Then the story started - and it was good.  Read by Robert Sean Leonard, he gave it a good go (though often his voice seemed younger than the forty-something hero of the tale).  Jack is a &quot;did the right thing and got fired&quot; tech fellow, who specializes in writing code that mimics natural biological behaviour.  His wife is working with a company doing something with nanotech.  Things start to go wrong, and what escapes is nano-sized, pred/prey programmed, and self-replicating.  Cue the cacophanous &quot;Oh no!&quot; music that ends each side of each tape (acually, it's a horrendous screech that has no place on an audiobook, and should &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt; have been chosen), and the slowly rising tension that I'm used to Crichton providing.<BR> <BR>If I have any qualms, it's with the not-always explained abilities of the escaped nanotech, and a somewhat obvious &quot;this is what I think is inevitable, so smarten up, humanity!&quot; overtone that Crichten might have toned down just a little.<BR> <BR>'Nathan

0375759174|5.0|Jane Austen enthusiasts (Janeites) tend to re-read \\"Northanger Abbey\\" less often than they do her other novels.  It nevertheless has several merits.<br />One distinction is that the voice of Jane Austen the narrator is perhaps picked up more clearly here than in her other novels.  Here you will find, for example, her minor dissertation in praise of the novel, \\"... work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of the human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humor are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\\".<br />A second quality is the strong sense of location that emanates from its pages.  Jane Austen is rarely a travel guide, but here she conducts the reader around the small English city of Bath.<br />A third excellence is its depiction of its \\"heroine\\" Catherine Moreland, a 17 year-old who gradually learns that reality is not the same as it's depicted in Mrs Radcliffe's novels.<br />And so it is great fun to read of the novel-reading heroine Catherine finding mortifications and infatuations in Bath.  It is fun also to see if \\"something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way\\".

B00003CXCT|1.0|In an era when we are getting great DVDs for many films with different versions available (think Abyss and the Alien 9 disk series) it is a shameful that perhaps the greatest Sci-Fi movie ever made is not available in its original version, only in the director's cut. Whether or not you like this version better, the lack of availability of the original is a crime to any film lover.
B000000OQY|5.0|In 1988,Guns 'N Roses' APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION album was selling by the dozens. On December 6 that year,this album was released. The date even appears on the album(this site lists the date as November 30 which is incorrect). The same day this album was released,Roy Orbison passed away. He was just enjoying success with his TRAVELING WILBURYS VOL. 1 album. The first 4 tracks are live,recorded in 1986. One of them is MAMA KIN,written by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. The other 4 tracks were studio recordings. PATIENCE,an acoustic piece,was a #1 hit. YOU'RE CRAZY,also an &quot;unplugged&quot; track,was first heard electrically on APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION. That song along with ONE IN A MILLION contain some profanity. USED TO LOVE HER is a tadbit silly(&quot;I used to love her,but I had to kill her!&quot;&quot;I had to put her 6 feet under and I can still hear her complain&quot;&quot;She's buried right in my backyard.&quot;). Total playing time for this CD is approximately 35 minutes.
6305278016|3.0|Before I review Black Rain, let me tell you that I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the picture quality of this DVD (its better on VHS) is totally unacceptable.  When I first watched it, I had to check my cable connections to make sure they weren't at fault.  What a let-down.  Mr. Scott should be raising hell over this.<br />With that said, this is one of my favorite action movies.  It portrays Detective Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) as an outgoing, old-school cop who takes moral short-cuts to get the job done.  His partner, a relatively new Detective (Andy Garcia) is along for the ride.  They have a run-in with a Japanese mobster (Yakuza) named Sato.  After arresting Sato for commiting two murders in a New York restaurant, the Detectives are ordered to escort him back to Japan to face charges there.  They manage to let Sato escape as he arrives in Japan.  A Japanese Detective (Ken Takarara) is assigned to help out the New York Detectives.                                                      <br />Douglas, Garcia and Takarara are excellenty cast in their respective roles.  The screenplay is well written.  I must say that the cinematography is really good.  Japan, the once-conquered nation, is now an industrial powerhouse.  But, like the U.S., it suffers from the ills of corruption and violence.  Ridley Scott does a great job of showing the tension between the two cultures.  The Japanese, &quot;bound by duty and honor&quot;, and the Americans, loud and outspoken, are viewed as somewhat obnoxious by their counterparts. The musical score is incredible.  Hans Zimmer really brings this movie to life with an array of Japanese and American-themed music that injects just the right amount of tension for the corresponding scene.  Brilliantly done.<br />This movie is 5-Star material, but the DVD version is a huge disapointment.  I would wait to see if a special edition DVD comes out (I can only hope) with the video quality this movie deserves.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album was released in 1987 but it wasn't until the following year that it became a multi-million-seller. SWEET CHILD OF MINE was a Top 20 hit in the summer of 1988. That's when and where Guns 'n Roses' popularity skyrocketed. Other hits from the album include WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE and PARADISE CITY. The band's frontman,William Bailey aka W. Axl Rose has an &quot;appetite for profanity&quot; undoubtedly. IT'S SO EASY,OUT TO GET ME,YOU'RE CRAZY and MR. BROWNSTONE contain profanity. For example on MR. BROWNSTONE,one of the lyrics goes &quot;that old man,he's a real motherf---er!&quot;. There's an acoustic version of YOU'RE CRAZY on the follow-up G 'N R LIES. PARADISE CITY became a hit in early 1989. By the end of that year,the sales record hit thirty million! Awesome album!
B000089RVX|2.0|This album is highlighted by the up and coming Amy Lee's unknown,yet surprizing good vocals. She is a brilliant vocalist, able to hit any note, yet sound smooth and entrancing. Unfortunately, the rest of the band is bland and completely generic.  It's sureal to listen to such a great talent along with a band that can make you fall asleep with failed attempts at sounding &quot;heavy metal.&quot;  The album does include two diamonds in the rough. The chilling ninth track &quot;Hello&quot; exhibits Amy Lee's incredible voice with a unsurpassed passion that will send chills down your spine.  Her second single, &quot;My Immortal,&quot; is another track that features Amy Lee's seductive, but smooth as silk voice. Coincidently, both these songs were created on piano and without aid of the rest of the band. Hmmm.<br />I believe that Amy Lee will become a household musical name in years to come, but first she needs to find a band that can enhance her talents.  &quot;Fallen&quot; contains nothing but generic, (sounds good once) tracks that will ultimately lead you down the road of disappointment.<br />Amy Lee gets an A, Evancescence gets a D.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I like romantic comedies, so I thought this film would be just the ticket, well I was wrong.<BR>There are a few (and I mean a few) funny moments, but they are interspersed with too many ordinary & unfunny will-they-or-won't-they typical scenarios and dialogue that we've seen a million times before.<BR>Some of the deleted scenes are actually funnier than the movie itself!<BR>If only they had included these scenes and had, well, a LOT more humour, then it would be a great comedy film.<br />As for the romance - erm - very weak quite frankly. The film flits between different 'romances' but the chemistry between the actors on screen is zero. Its all very predictable, OF COURSE certain people get together at the end, yawn. And what was with that waste-of-space storyline of the man who loved the black man's wife, that wasn't finished, nothing happened with it!<br />I've given it 2 stars not 1 because of the (albeit sparse) funny scenes.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire (Rob Bowman, 2002)<br />Veteran TV director Rob Bowman gives us his third feature film, Reign of Fire. \\"Stupid\\" is the first word that comes to mind, but it's stupid in an affectionate, agreeable sort of way.<br />Christian Bale (American Psycho, Shaft) plays the leader of one of the last remaining outposts of humans on earth, which has been devastated by dragons. Yes, dragons. Seems they'd been hibernating for millenia and were awakened by a team drilling a new subway (which just happened to include Bale's character's mom). He and his crowd are just trying to get along in the world, until a band of marauders, headed by Matthew McConaughey, stop in claiming to be dragonslayers.<br />The best parts of the movie feature Bale and McConaughey engaged in a kind of tug-of-war for the loyalty of Bale's compound, while at the same time forming a grudging respect for one another. There is actually very little of this. Much of the rest is either a special effects extravaganza or attempted sexual tension between Bale and ex-Bond Girl Izabella Scorpuco (GoldenEye). Silly and predictable, with great unrealized potential. Still, there are worse ways to turn your brain off for a couple of hours. ** 1/2
0786711647|5.0|Stephen King once commented about author Ira Levin: \\"Every novel he has ever written has been a marvel of plotting. He is the Swiss watchmaker of the suspense novel; he makes what the rest of us do look like those five-dollar watches you can buy in the discount drug stores.\\" He went on to lament that Levin's most effective book (and his first!), \\"A Kiss before Dying,\\" is not much read these days.<br />Here's your chance to fix this situation! \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is now back in print, in a nice trade paperback, for the first time since the early 90s (when a mass-market paperback was briefly available to tie-in with the forgotten movie adaptation starring Sean Young and Matt Dillon). First published in 1953 when Levin was only twenty-three, \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is one of the most remarkable suspense novels ever penned and a masterpiece of literary noir. The greatest suspense writer of all time, Cornell Woolrich, highly influenced Levin, and this book seems like an overt homage to many of Woolrich's devices. It's the only suspense novel I know of that honestly compares with the master.<br />To tell much about the plot would ruin the shocks and surprises awaiting you in these pages. Levin hurls out plot twists that genuinely jolt the reader and turn the whole story upside down in moments (King referred to one of the twists as \\"a real screeching bombsell\\" of a surprise). The story begins at a large college, where Dorothy Kingship, daughter of a wealthy industrialist, has learned that she is pregnant. Her boyfriend, a handsome, dashing, but callous, calculating, and completely amoral young man is unhappy with the news; he hoped to marry into the rich family as his quick ticket to success, and the uptight Leo Kingship will certainly disinherit his daughter when he finds out about the pregnancy. Dorothy wants to marry right away, not caring if her father cuts her off or not, but her boyfriend starts secretly devising another plan...if only he can make it look like suicide...<br />And that's merely the beginning. The book takes so many u-turns and switchbacks that you'll spend most of your time reading it shaking with tension. Levin crafts his three central set-pieces using minute detail that makes for agonizing suspense. He lets the reader in on the secrets of the story bit by bit, but the more you know, the tenser the story becomes. Sometimes, you know the WHAT and WHO of a situation, but not the WHEN or HOW. At other times, you know the WHAT and WHEN but not WHO. Levin will drive you nearly mad in places! King is right: Levin's plotting is so ingenious it's like workings of a perfect machine.<br />But beyond plot machinery, Levin dazzles in another area: characterizations. Like Woolrich, Levin can create haunting portraits of lonely souls, and frightening sketches of soulless killers. \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is pure noir: a world of sad people aching for real love and of people who find that killing is no more difficult than putting on a jacket. This is not a \\"snack food\\" suspense novel like you find sitting on bestseller shelves. This is a novel that will stay with you for a long time.<br />It's unfortunate that Levin has written so few novels since (he didn't write his second novel, \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" until fourteen years later; he spent the time between as a writer for TV and Broadway stage). Everything he has written is worth reading (check out \\"The Stepford Wives,\\" \\"The Boys from Brazil,\\" \\"Sliver,\\" and his hit play &quot;Deathtrap&quot;), but \\"A Kiss before Dying\\" is his art at its best. Don't miss it.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Gothika (Matthieu Kassovitz, 2003)<br />I had such high hopes for this movie. Matthieu Kassovitz, director of the stunningly silly The Crimson Rivers, gets behind the camera for his first English-language feature, a supposedly spooky tale about Miranda Grey (Halle Berry), a psychiatrist who wakes up one morning and finds herself imprisoned in the very facility where she works, accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton, late of Alien 3 and Roc). Her friend and co-worker Pete (Robert Downey Jr.) is trying to help her remember the murder, about which she knows nothing, but Grey finds many of her own platitudes forced back down her throat, coming to understand that sometimes the saner you are, the more crazy you look to the outside world.<br />It's all quite a nice little cautionary tale, and there are a couple of jumpworthy moments, but what really remains after watching this is the profoundly leaden moralizing throughout. Even the usually wonderful Dutton labors through the wooden script.<br />All in all, though, it could have been worse. Robert Zemeckis (one of the film's producers) could have directed. Maybe worth a rental if you have an hour and a half to kill, but don't go looking for great, or even good, cinema. **
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Some movies can withstand the expectations that come with great reviews. This one apparently cannot. It probably helps if you can relate to one of the two main characters...both physically and emotionally in a place they'd rather not be. If you can, you will likely enjoy this movie immensely. Probably even more if you've spent time in Japan. For myself this is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.
0385504209|3.0|Like many here I read this book on the urgings of others. Eventually, I could only have so many people tell me what a great book this is before breaking down and reading it myself. Also, like many here, I found my enjoyment decreasing as I noticed an occasional error or strange interpretation of something I was familiar with. In terms of the history, I think the strongest thing I took away is the importance of having multiple sources, and always looking for bias on any issue where interpretation will account for a sizable amount of the research.<br />As for the actual story, I thought it was fun. At times the author seemed to be pandering to the target demographic, but it's not common enough to cause too much annoyence. While certainly the characters are a bit cliche at times, and seem to often have their mental functions tied down so as to not outpace the reader, I still found them to be enjoyable. They're candy rather than a full meal, but sometimes one just wants some sugar and fun.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Not only are the versions of these tracks better than the Spectorized album, it is also one of the only proper modern audio remixes of an old Beatles record.

0064471837|4.0|\\"Sabriel\\" is one of the best fantasy books out there, full stop. Although not up to the deep literary analysis of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\", it is a realistic, fantastical, intriguing and thought-provoking novel that's right up there with the best of them. Garth Nix creates a dark, almost Gothic world that echoes with age and believability that is intoxicating to explore: the magically-imbued Old Kingdom that lies across the Wall from the more scientific-orientated Ancelstierre, which has the mechanics and technology of a post-Victorian Britian (by my estimation anyway).<br />It is within these two totally different, but connected worlds that our protagonist Sabriel lives. Sabriel is an eighteen year old girl about to finish her education at Wyverley College in Ancelstierre, though her true home is across the Wall in the Old Kingdom, that she has not travelled to since she was a child. More interestingly though, she is the daughter of the Abhorsen - a necromancer that does not raise or disturb the dead like his evil counterparts, but lays them to rest and speeds them on their way to Death. But now he has gone missing, and after recieving his last gift to her (the necromancer's tools: a spelled sword and a bandolier of seven bells) Sabriel sets out into her homeland that she hardly knows in order to find him, and go up against the ancient evil that is steadily snaking over the land...<br />On her quest she comes up against a number of obstacles, both terrifying and fascinating, (but thankfully all serve a purpose and are not just there for their own sakes) and landscapes that are described so vividly they can be seen with perfect clarity in the mind's eye. From her father's house on an island at the brink of a waterfall where she joins up with a mighty power in the shape of a tiny white cat, to an underground harbour of buriel ships where a wooden figure-head is returned to life, Sabriel's journey is filled with amazing and original occurances.<br />Garth Nix somehow creates this world with perfect clarity, and his writing style is insightful, descriptive and clear - in other words its wonderful to read. Out of all his imaginative creations two stand out: that of his nature of Death as a Hades Styx-like river that flows throughout Nine Gates that can be traversed by both the living and the dead that refuse to properly die, and the bells of the necromancer - each has a name, a title, a purpose and different note: a perfect example of the depth and beauty of the world he's created. A further delight is the character of Mogget - the white cat that accompanies Sabriel, but is in many ways more of a hinderance (not to mention a danger) than a help. If cats could speak in real life, they would sound like Mogget - and the idea concerning the ring and his collar is inspired!<br />Sabriel is the latest in a steadily growing line of strong female protagonists. For centuries there were the standard damsels in distress. Then with the wave of feminism came the stronger but still rather insipid \\"I'm spunky and spirited...but I *still* need to be rescued from captivity\\" female figure. But now come the women that have long been dormant - beginning with Tamora Pierce's heroines and Phillip Pullman's Lyra, Sabriel follows in their tradition of being intelligent, resourceful, brave, compassionate and in charge of her situation. It can't be just a coincidence that most of the people she rescues in her travels are male!<br />Though I would love to give \\"Sabriel\\" five stars, I have to take a point off for the instigation of two of the most cliched and over-used fantasy plot developments of all time - that of the \\"misplaced royal heir\\" and the \\"true love\\" senario. When Sabriel rescues Touchstone he claims himself to be one of the guards of the royal family of the Old Kingdom. Don't think I'm spoiling anything for you when I say he *isn't*, as his \\"secret identity\\" is almost painfully obvious. Likewise, the romance between him and Sabriel is sudden to say the least, with them both awkwardly confessing their feelings near the end of the book. Nix could have gotten away with using one of these plot lines, but both together?...No.<br />Despite this however, \\"Sabriel\\" is intoxicating reading, and very difficult to put down. Combining the genre of fantasy with touches of horror and Old World technology, Nix's \\"Old Kingdom\\" trilogy must be brought, not borrowed! Look out for a sequel that gets even better than this - \\"Lirael\\", followed with the third installment \\"Abhorsen.\\"omance between him and Sabriel is sudden to say the least, with them both awkwardly confessing their feelings near the end of the book.

630575067X|1.0|I know George Lucas makes this movie for kids, but he has seem to forgotten that the same kids he inspired 25 years ago are still big fans of his. I think he has become a selfish, self-indugled man, his attitude during interviews definitely shows it. <br />As for this movie, it is insulting to watch as a grown up. My cousins who were only 6 and 7 when Phantom Mencace came out even told me the movie made no sense. Lucas says he made this movie for kids, but yet it is too confusing for kids.<br />The plot is bad, the script is poor and so is the dialouge, the acting is beyond terrible, Mcgregor does a good job, but the rest of the cast doesnt have it<br />How can Anakin build C3P0? He builds the droid he is looking for in the later episodes? it makes no sense, what is going to happen in Episode III? Is a young Han Solo going to be father to a baby Chewbaccca? Why all the corny connections? Just tell the story<br />Lucas reminds me of a kid Johnathan in my neighborhood when I was young. He had all the best toys and was always the first to get everything and you couldnt play with his action figures unless you followed his corny storyline which was always silly...<br />Dont waste your money on this, buy the Lord of The Rings, by Peter Jackson, watching that movie gives you a feeling it has really happened, like the original Star Wars pictures.  Geroge has lost it and he can hide and be selfish in his little ranch but he will never be able to tell a good story ever again because he is blinded by technology...
B00006RCNW|5.0|This show is the reason why I go running home after work.  The shield has me at the edge of my seat through out the whole show.<BR>The cast is one of the best actors on the job. Definitely the best show on T.V.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I love Star Wars. It's the first movie I ever saw on a VCR, I find occassion to quote it every day, and, heck it even helped save my life once. So yeah of course I'm pre-ordering this DVD set, buying a movie trilogy I've already purchased 3 or 4 times.<br />The only thing I want--the only thing I hope to Yoda will be on these discs--is an option to remove some of George's \\"enhancements\\". <br />You know the ones. The little tweaks that he put in back when he first started to lose his mind. Like that awful Jabba scene. And Biggs. And... Greedo firing first.<br />These changes heralded the Dark Times, when George started to fall to the temptations of The Dark Side: computer graphics. Such technological terrors were the harbingers of Jar Jar Binks, the Dark Lord himself.<br />I pray that George will include the original cantina scene, unspolit and uncorrupted. And, failing that, I pray DVD-R technology will have advanced enough by the time this set comes out that such a restoration is made possible for home use. :)<br />May the force be with us,<BR>Mike Fehlauer<br />ps: actual quote from a friend and new father, to whom I sent a \\"Share the Love\\" notification after I purchased this set:<br />\\"Dude, I'm so torn on this. I mean I want to own them<BR>... but I don't want Greedo shooting first. I mean, is<BR>that the version of the movie I want my son seeing?<br />Curse you George Lucas!\\"
B00001NFCY|1.0|Just like the 80s took remarkable metal and slowly turned it into a laughing stock of painfully trite hair bands, the 90s grunge also spawned it's own embarrassing genre. And, from the fatal loins of grunge gone wrong, sprung Creed. <BR>It never fails to amaze me how religiousness can produce some of the most incredible works of passion, from music to architecture, and at the same time serve as an excuse to produce the most offensively bad albums ever. Scott Stapp is obviously ripping off Vedder, only he's singing his praises to his Lord and Personal Savior, Jesus Christ. At the top of his lungs. <BR>Which makes me wonder if God is listening. If I were a universe spanning entity and someone were celebrating their love for me via this album, I would probably go ahead and bring on the apocalypse. Especially if people were buying it by the thousands.<BR>If you're interested in celebrating God through music, go buy a Low album or a Pedro the Lion album. If you're interested in listening to a bunch of talentless crap rockers play into expensive amps then buy this album. <br />And then go play in traffic.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'll say it right off the bat: \\"The Two Towers\\" is my least favorite of the three Lord of the Rings films. But it's only right behind \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"Return of the King.\\" So on a scale of 1 to 10, the first and third are both 10s, and this one is a 9. Still not a bad rating by any means! The Two Towers is an excellent film!<br />The creative forces behind this film gave it just as much effort as the other films. But the way the story is is what makes it not quite as good as the other ones. The first and third films really gave you a sense of wonder and enchantment. You traveled to places that seemed unworldly, but still felt like they could've existed at one point. I felt like I was uncovering a long lost past. With this film, it felt like Middle-Earth, but not nearly as much as the other films. It felt a little TOO much like real history - mostly because the story deals more with the race of men. We don't travel to many new locations that have that etherial feel to them, because we're mostly at \\"man-made\\" locations throughout the film. It all just felt medieval. It wasn't as \\"fantasy-like\\" as the other ones. But that's how the book was, so I don't fault the film-makers for that. They were pretty true to the book, and that's how it should be. It's just my least favorite part of the three part story. Don't get me wrong though, because I still think it's a great story, and I love it much more now that this extended edition is out.<br />What strengths this film has are what fantasy-like elements it DOES have - like the Ents, the Uruk-hai, more of Isengard and Rivendale, etc. And most of all - Gollum. And the battles are really cool.<br />This extended version does make \\"The Two Towers\\" better though. For me, it's better because it has more of the fantasy elements in it. More ents, more Gollum, more Isengard, more Fangorn Forest, etc. There really are a lot of new great scenes in this version, and it's a must have just for that reason alone.<br />However, there's more. This version is packed full of special features! Two discs worth. Everything is there to give you a second-hand look at just how much passion, effort, and love was put into this film. These special features really show how much the creative forces behind these films really care about The Lord of the Rings.<br />Great movie, amazing DVD!there's more. This version is packed full of special features! Two discs worth. Everything is there to give you a second-hand look at just how much passion, effort, and love was put into this film.

B0000AGQ6Z|1.0|I bought this DVD as a way to show off my new DVD player to my family.  I had seen the movie several times in the theater, and knew its bright colors would be beautiful on my TV screen.<br />To my horror, I saw that Columbia had seen fit to alter a masterpiece.  Yes, the film came complete with those horrific black bars at the top and bottom of my screen, which obscured about half of the picture.  I've seen those bars on the &quot;artsy&quot; videos on TV, and I sometimes enjoy them.  But this is a classic work of art!  You don't try to make it &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;relevant&quot; with modern touches.  It would be like adding a moustache to the Mona Lisa.<br />Until Columbia drops the act and releases &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; without those bars, letting us see all of the picture, stay away.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Where the 2nd movie lagged with exposition and useless scenes, this movie makes up for it with a highly impressive war in Zion that exceeded my expectations! It's the best sci-fi war I've ever seen.<br />The plot wasn't as developed as I would've liked. I think I finally understand what the plot of the whole trilogy is about now, but I didn't the first time I watched it. There's very little explanation for certain things that happen. I understand everything not making sense in the 2nd movie, because it has the third to explan all that. This movie hardly does any explaning, and one is forced to resort to the internet to find the explanations.<br />The other thing that I thought wasn't that great was the fact that Neo and Trinity disappear for a half hour while we're watching the war in Zion. It would've been nice to cut back and forth a couple times to just remind us of what Trinity and Neo are up to. And Morpheus didn't get enough screen time.<br />Overall, I liked this movie. The special features are mostly about how they did the special effects and action sequences of the film. But they're interesting nonetheless. <br />Good movie, good DVD.
B000000OQF|2.0|I have worn out two cassettes, and one vinyl copy of this album.  That alone should tell you how much I love it.  But even one who loves the album as much as I do should be able to admit to themselves that it's just not very good anymore.  In it's initial release, sure, it had power and fury, but it all seems so cartoonish and limp.<br />Take &quot;Sweet Child O Mine&quot;, a very nice ballad.  I had many a party with that as the soundtrack.  Listening to it now, the melody is still appealing, but the lyrics are greeting card quality, like bad Paul McCartney.  And Axl's singing does the group no favors, either.  &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; has just become SO overplayed. . .I won't even watch the fifth Dirty HArry movie, which features it prominently.<br />I love Guns and Roses but even I will admit that this album has become nothing but a snapshot of a bygone time.  A true &quot;great&quot; work of art will still sound vital and fresh many years later.
B00000K19E|5.0|When I first saw this movie, it took me by surprise - as well as thousands of other people. It came out at a &quot;non-blockbuster&quot; season (March '99), and just dominated all.<br />This movie is the best of the trilogy because it can stand on its own, and makes sense after watching it. The last two, while really cool, take a few more viewings as well as a few searches on the internet to really make sense of the plot. They offer harldy any understandable explanation to what's going on. This first one was made to stand on its own, and it shows. The plot is confusing at first, but later makes total sense.<br />The concept of The Matrix isn't really anything new, but the way it was done was amazing and made you think. The action was great, and the characters were fantastic.<br />Great movie, great DVD!
B000069KIZ|5.0|There is truly something special about the relationship between this conductor and this orchestra...Bohm has always had a special way with this music.  Never does he allow technique overshadow the beauty and opulence of this composer's writing.  The opening of Symphony No. 4 is breatheless in it's beauty and this sets the mood for the entire interpretation.  The Vienna Phil has always sounded great but here it is UNBELIEVEABLE!!  Take note of the wonderful way with the shaping of phrases.  Never pushy or hard-driven, we have here Brahm's done in a way that is entirely devoid of sentimentality or glossy technique.<br />No. 1 was done by Bohm years ealier in Berlin and this 70s performance is very fine but with a more mellow cast.  The octaves in the opening strings are incredible.  The Vienna horns shine magnificently through this interpretation of the C minor unlike any other.  <br />As for symphony No. 2 and 3 they are given incredibly warm and stylish readings.  Bohm does not plow over the music with a heavy hand(Szell is too detached)...this is Brahms that is Alive and Majestic.  The recorded sound is Excellent!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The more I watch this movie, the more I like it. But I didn't like it as much the first time I saw it. I thought it had too much exposition and a few scenes that weren't needed. I think this movie could've been edited down to about an hour, and just combined with &quot;Revolutions&quot; for a 3 hour movie.<br />But nevertheless, I still like this movie. And I've gotten used to all the exposition scenes. But the Zion party scene where Neo and Trinity go off and do the wild thing for 5 whole minutes of screen time just stopped the movie for a bit. It was totally unnecessary. It served no purpose whatsoever.<br />But it picks back up later on with a great fight scene between Neo and a hundred Agent Smiths. This scene was great. And the highway chase scene was remarkable as well. And I liked the cliffhanger. It really made me want to see Revolutions right then and there!<br />The DVD has great special features, the highlight being the documentary on buidling the highway for the chase scene.<br />Good movie, good DVD.
B000056TKD|5.0|The heyday of the Boston Symphony is recorded here in all of it's glory.  A feverishly intense Also Sprach is simply electrifying.  The tonal quality of this recording is excellent with great balances between sections.  Of all of the American recordings ever made of Also Spach this is certainly the one to own...wind solos are beautifully phrased and paced..the orchestra Trumpets are splendid and Steinberg has a geniune idea of when blend is important and when musical ideas have to dominate.  <br />Compared to the leisurely interpretation of Ormandy(boring!) you cannot only come up with superlatives for this disc!<br />The HOLST is done very well, without any agogic rubato or mannerisms, Steinberg certainly comes out a giant of a Conductor. His was a short tenure iin Boston unfortunately...It was not too be for too long , Steinberg passed away a few years after these landmark recordings.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I think the movie itself is one of the most unjustly maligned movies of all time. It wasn't that bad. Sure, there were parts that were lacking, but ultimately we're dealing with different Star Wars movies here. The prequels. They're not meant to be like the old trilogy. It's more plotting and mystery than it is space cowboy adventures. And that's what I like about the prequels. The stories themselves are better and more well-thought out than the old trilogy. They're more involved and make you think. I will admit that there were some approaches taken with this movie that didn't work for everyone, but isn't that always the way movies are?<br />This movie is good. If you want to know what bad movies are, watch Blair Witch 2, or The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman. The Phantom Menace has faults, but it's not like the other Star Wars films DIDN'T have faults. All five are full of them, and I'm sure Episode 3 will be the same way.<br />The DVD itself has great special features. The highlight is the documentary \\"The Beginning,\\" which compiles hundreds of hours of footage of behind-the-scenes material into an hour long feature. It's very informative, and gives you a feel for what it was like making the first Star Wars movie in 16 years.<br />The other big highlight are the deleted scenes. You have the option to watch them along with a documentary talking before-hand about each deleted scene, explaining what it is, why it was cut, etc. Or, you can just watch them individually.<br />The rest of the DVD is full of other featurettes and such that are pretty cool, as well as TV and theatrical trailers for the film. There's also a blooper reel that shows outtakes, but it's an easter egg. You have to type in 11[enter], 3[enter], 8[enter] in the options menu. 1138 is from Lucas' first film THX 1138. It's quite hilarious.<br />Good movie, great DVD.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|First off, whether you know who Johnson is or not, if the blues hit you so hard you get chills when you hear them or you're just a casual listener, you will consider this album AMAZING. Clapton leads two lives, one as a pop musician and one as a blues historian. He was trained by the music of the masters and creators, and through The Yardbirds, Bluesbreakers, and From the Cradle he's developed into the most disciplined blues musician alive today. This album's not flashy or gimmicky, he retains the original feel of Johnson's playing, and like any good historian, describes it in a way that modern audiences, (with or without the previous background) will understand and appreciate. For those that are familiar with Johnson, you will find Clapton's interpretations technically superior, very respectful, absent of Slowhand's (most qualified) silent ego. Johnson was a master and Clapton humbly and artistically shares this with the world.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|i only got to see a few minutes of this on tv, so i know hardly anything about it, but i was lucky enough to catch clapton playing acoustic guitar with some indian orchestra, and his solo was AMAZING! very expressive and soulful. the fact that clapton can tear it up on indian music in addition to his usual rock and blues is a testament to his incredible ability.
B00004W50T|5.0|One of the best classic rock albums of all time, even though the album defies categorization.  It's folk, it's blues, it's jazz, it's country, with an Appalachian-Gospel feel and a ton of roots influence.<br />These were excellent musicians and they churned out excellent tunes.  If you want a greatest hits album from The Band, this is it.  Nothing like it prior, and nothing like it since.
B000000W6X|5.0|To say that ''Protection'' was Massive Attack's worst album is being incoherently unfair, it is equally good as their previous and subsequent work.<br />I like ''Mezzanine'', ''Blue Lines'' and ''100th Window'' but ''Protection'' is one of my ultimate favores...most likely because Tracy Thorn teamed up with them on two of the cuts (which were both releases). The title track ''Protection'' is definitely Massive Attack's best cut ever (vocally)....It's a pity that Tracy Thorn was only a guest vocalist then, its a real shame that she hasn't teamed up with them again. <br />Massive Attack would do much better if they'd invite in- much more talented vocalists. For example; Tracy Thorn, Nicollette, Madonna and Bjork are arguably the best vocalists Massive Attack has ever teamed up with, of course in Madonna's case, they only teamed up with her once in 1996 in for the restructure of ''I Want You'' which was commercially released on the ''Something To Remember'' album and peaked a healthy 14# In the top 40 Charts.<br />In tracks like ''Sly'' you have the smoky and pining vocals of Nicollette which are just as captivating as Tracy Thorn's and Tricky's vocals. ''Weather Storms'' carries out possibly the best musical tune throughout this label, ''Spying Glass'' features rare fragments of Horace Andy. ''Better Things'' which carries out thin sharp and glass-breaking sound effects with a very much light beat, to me this track is the most accessible cut from this album with lyrics like ''Don't Drag me down, Just Because you're down'', in addition to that you have Tracy Thorn's voice which reaches its highest peak...definitely able to send chills down your spine and keep your finger at the repeat button...The only disappointment is that the track is short.<br />The other tracks are ok, I didn't like the live version of ''Light My Fire''. This LP may be the most unusual album of Massive Attack......but that doesn't make it a bad album...on the contrary its one of their best, seeingits more humane and less involved than ''Mezzanine'' was...<br />In ''Mezzanine'' there was too much of everything, and too much can always end up insolvent.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've always know that Muse would eventually make it to America.  Since Origin of Symmetry though, it has been obvious that the comparisons to Radiohead were no longer valid.  Muse have done enough to set themselves apart from the English crowd through their high intensity music and whailing vocals.  Thom Yorke haunts, Mr. Bellamy of Muse excits and sends shivers down your spine with his incredible range (listen to Microcuts from Origins of Symmetry).  They have a huge sound with only a three member band that I tend to think that any comparisons are no longer valid and they are finally getting credit for their own accomplishments.  Absolution carries this torch and does so with power and grace.  This is a must buy, and I gurantee that you will be purchasing their other albums shortly after.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's debut album ''No Angel'' is one of the best CD's from my collection, It contains a variety of stunning tracks which are beautifully composed, Her voice is so sedative it can cause you to drift off to a comforting dream often. She has a sulky and dreamy voice (almost matching Tracy Thorn's (From Everything But The Girl), Sade's, and a slight reminiscent of Bjork's). <br />My favorite tracks are; Here With Me, All You Want, My Life, Hunter, Honestly Ok, No Angel.<br />The rest are overall good, but those above are in my opinion the best tracks from this album. <br />''Here With Me'' evokes light trip-hop beats, then transforms into a light alternative rock, including some guitar strings, this song would put you in mind of the group ''Evanescence''. <br />''All You Want'' also sounds allot like ''Here With Me'' but Dido's vocals are definitely at their best here after track ''My Life''.<br />''My Life'', probably the slowest (but yet) very moving track, It sounds undeniably like a mixture of Bjork's vocals combined with a passive and slower version of sting's ''Windmills of your Mind'', of course the lyrics are completely different. Her voice is at its highest peak throughout this whole album. This track is very haunting, profound and entrancing.<br />''Hunter'', WOW...this is absolutely perfect to fall asleep to, seeing as Dido's vocals along with the background music fit in perfectly- it becomes etched in your mind, you will probably find yourself singing to this one more often!.<br />''Honestly'', Definitely the best trip-hop sounding track, summoning a more pensive and variable description of Annie Lennox's ''Stay By Me'', featuring more of the ambient and tribal sounding effects.<br />''No Angel'', A mixture of Pop verses R&amp;B, but mostly with more thickset beats unlike the other tracks, this track contains a large amount of pop in it which is comparable to Sting's ''Forget About The Future''.<br />The other tracks are just as satisfying as the rest- except I wasn't so fond of the anthem-sounding ''Slide''.<br />So, If you're a fan of Sade, Everything But The Girl, Bjork, Porthishead, Annie Lennox, Evanescence.....then you'd most likely want to get this CD. because it's highly placed in the same category as those artists.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a great book for anyone who likes to read. It takes you through the life of An Irish family, who's kids were born in America, with the family now back in impoverished Limerick, Ireland. Working hard, trying to find jobs, money, food, shelter, and even friends in the community. Author (Frances)Frank McCourt; is the oldest son in the family, and the story is told through his eyes. It is very interesting, and has a lot of Irish and American history. I highly reccomend this book, and although it is depressing for the most part, it is a real uplifter afterwards, and your life doesn't seem so bad all of a sudden.        READ IT!
B000002VMH|5.0|Annie Lennox is one of the best songwriters in the history of music. I think Annie Lennox, Sting and Seal are (technically) extraordinary writers. And I'm truly ready to defend this album, foremost it is one of the best solo debut albums I have come across. Generally other famous artists like Cher and Madonna (for example) only hit their best chapters nearly 30 years after they initiated their career, and what makes this record so special is that from the beginning Annie Lennox made a great impression on music. However I feel this album features more soul-sounding tunes other than pop tunes like ''Money Can't Buy It''. She carries out the pop tunes in a better manner on her 2003 retail titled ''Bare''.<br />My Favorite songs are: 1. Why, 9. Stay By Me, 7. Little Bird, 5. Cold, 8. Primitive. <br />This is a classic record, do yourself a favor and get it, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!.
B00005NTNM|4.0|This is the third of five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films in which Eastwood stars as a San Francisco police detective. By the time the last appeared (The Dead Pool, in 1988), Eastwood had aged and times had changed but Callahan's non-negotiaable values and unorthodox methods had remained essentially the same. What I find especially interesting in this film is the relationship which develops between Callahan and his partner Kate Moore, skillfully portrayed by Tyne Daly. Until now, Callahan has indeed been a \\"lone ranger,\\" alienated (by choice or circumstance) from his superiors and fellow officers as well as from the criminals whom he pursues with deadly efficiency. Over time, Moore eventually earns Callahan's respect and trust (albeit grudgingly) as they attempt to rescue San Francisco's kidnapped mayor (John Crawford) amidst all manner of mayhem unrelated to that assignment. Credit James Fargo with keeping the narrative flowing smoothly. The supporting cast is solid, notably Bradford Dillman (Captain McKay) and Harry Guardino (Lieutenant Bressler). There is plenty of action, of course, skillfully presented. Despite its lack of much subtlety or nuance, I recommend it to those with a taste for this sort of urban adventure film. Those who enjoy it should also check out Coogan's Bluff and Bullitt (both 1968) as well as The Gauntlet (1977).
B000001FI7|5.0|Before I get started with this review, I would like to say something to the reviewer who (Incoherently) said that ''this album is awesome if you're suicidal'', I don't think you have the slightest clue of what quality music, and second of all, one of your comments precisely ''don't be a dummy: download this before buying, like I did''...I'm sorry, But I'm not a leach and that much of a low and cheap person, I don't download music....I'd rather buy the CD and feel good about the fact that I contributed towards a great artists career (Like Portishead)...So take your ignorant review and put it-- where it belongs?...Take a hint...(Laughs)..<br />Ok, Lets get started on reviewing this album. After being drawn into the world of trip-hop which initially began because I somehow got linked up with Massive Attacks work since I'm a big fan of Tracy Thorn (From EBTG), I tracked down the album ''Protection'' and I was completely besotted with Massive Attacks work, Of course I had heard of them before round about in 1996 when they teamed up with Madonna to do the reshaping and designing of the track ''I Want You'' which is UNDENIABLY Madonna's best trip-hop hit. So through Massive Attack I found out about Portishead, so I got this CD in Jan and I can't stop listening to this album, I love to doze off to this softly playing on my portable CD player. It truly rocks!!!<br />My Favorite tracks are; 8. Roads, 2. Sour Times, 4. It Could Be Sweet, 9. Pedestal, 3. Strangers. <br />The rest are ok, the only track I wasn't so fond of was ''Numb'', the music effects are great but I didn't like the vocals to the song, they seemed too silly for their own good. But other than that, this CD is definitely one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.<br />So, take some of your time and get this CD, It's really exceptional. Some of Massive Attack and Evanescence CD's wouldn't be such a bad idea too.
B00018D44U|4.0|I didn't care for this CD at first - a little too &quot;country&quot; for my taste, a little too consistently slow - but the music began to grow on me after listening to the entire CD a few times.  IMO, not as good as the &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; CD, but still well worth the price of admission, so to speak.  My favorite tracks are 7, 9 and 10.<br />However, there is one thing that I would REALLY like to know:  What is with the cell phone ring you can hear about 2:02 minutes into track 10?  The first couple of times I heard it, I started digging in my pocket for my phone - it really bugged the hell out of me.  I have no idea whether it is there on purpose - it sort of IS in time with the rhythm - or whether it was inadvertent and left in as a joke.  It still irritates me, even though I like the track.
B000002N3J|5.0|''Something To Remember'' is arguably one the best collections of songs that Madonna has gathered together, some of which have been re-designed to fit this albums needs, some of the tracks are previous releases but what makes this album so special is that nearly every song has been restored, receiving first-rate stereo quality, some of the tracks have been slightly spruced up, compared to the original...they're deeply enhanced.<br />On the first track- Massive Attack use their crafty skills to create a unique trip-hop version of ''I Want You'', summoning thickset lush beats, a similar but much better description of Porthishead's ''Roads''. This song sounds like it was recorded 20 years ahead of time. This track, personally is one of ultimate my favorites by both artists -Madonna and Massive Attack-, I wish she would team up with them once again.<br />''I'll Remember'' is also included on this CD, a previous soundtrack from the film ''With Honors''. <br />The beautiful and captivating ''Take A Bow'' steps in surprisingly.<br />''You'll See'' slightly enhanced, and viewed as a sequel/follow-up to ''Take A Bow''...while the song also brings us the sequel video to ''Take A Bow''.<br />''Crazy For You'', incontestably one of Madonna's very early classics, but yet still sounds like it was recorded in the 90's.<br />''This Used To Be My Playground'', a soundtrack from the movie in which Madonna starred in ''A League Of Their Own''. Not one of my favorites, but a good song.<br />''Live To Tell'', taken from the ''True Blue'' album, all-in-all it's a great song, not my favorite though.<br />''Love Don't Live Here Anymore'', David Reitzas creates a moving and 80's rock influenced remix, which is quite genuine in its own way- but it is inferior to the Soul Power Remix, which (unfortunately) was not included on this LP. <br />''Something To Remember'', The title track from which (If I'm Correct?) was taken from the ''I'm Breathless'' LP. Also another trip-hop track, (note thatit was not inspired by Massive Attack). The lyrics are probably the best found on this album, this track proves that Madonna's voice is best utilized as an old soul instrument...whether as today -UNFORTUNATELY- she has (completely) forgone that style and has merged herself into the modern world of Pop &amp; Rap, which can definitely be sampled from her ''American Life'' LP.<br />''Forbidden Love'', Critically acclaimed to be Madonna's most fading track, however it is a nice song and features some more thickset beats which put you in mind of ''Human Nature'' and ''Survival''.<br />''One More Chance'', An Acoustic and Pop sounding track, that certainly does sound like her most recent work found on ''American Life''. I'm not so fond of this track.<br />''Rain'', I remember in 93/94 the press said that this song (supposedly) signaled that Madonna was a grown woman who had matured and was moving away from the ghost of her previous albums ''Like A Virgin'', ''Like A Prayer''. The song is in actual fact one of the best songs from the Mid 90's. I like it allot.<br />''Oh Father'', a ballad which describes pain adjacent to death and loss. This track was taken from the ''Like A Prayer'' LP and digitally restored. <br />''I Want You (Orchestral)'', Massive Attack while experimenting with this track made a suggestion of singling out the beats (which are found on the first version) and leaving the track completely bare and making it their Orchestral version of ''I Want You'', personally I think this version is inferior to the first track.<br />So, out-and-out....If you're a fan of the Madonna we grew up to, who later on delivered us incredible tunes from ''Ray Of Light'' then you'd want use your money on some of her best work ever instead of using it on her most disappointing LP ''American Life''.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Honestly, you'd (optimistically) think that Dream Theater's progressive music would bring a progressive-minded fanbase to the table, but alas this isn't the case: their fans are just as hidebound as, say, Matchbox 20's giddy-smiled karaoke stars.  Train of Thought is the seventh studio album launched by the prog metal legends of Dream Theater, and as you'd more realistically guess having witnessed the response to Metallica's numerous artistic shifts, change late in your career is BAD.<br />Well, don't let all the silly little naysayers clutching tightly their worn copies of Images & Words and Awake influence your opinion of Train of Thought.  Change is most certainly good in DT's case, and even has the added benefit of removing stale fans from the good seats at their shows [...].  The album can best be summed up as \\"heavy\\", but given the maniacally-delivered technicality of performances on the release, one word can hardly be enough.  Petrucci and Portnoy are on the very top of their respective games, and looking back on their collective body of work, that's quite the statement.  Petrucci in particular seems to have decided to craft an album of great disparity: cave man metal riffs (with a huge groove, despite the constantly-shifting tempos and time signatures) juxtaposed with the absolute fringe extremeties of what is capable on a guitar (witness the coma-inducing solo on the album-closing 'In the Name of God').  Portnoy, as always, is passionate about overplaying, but in light of Petrucci's absolute explosion on the record, by comparison he might as well be playing a lounge kit with brushes.  Regardless, his footwork is at its absolute peak, and we thank him for the obvious physical pain he endured to unleash these performances.  'This Dying Soul' and 'Honor Thy Father' in particular highlight his continued prowess.<br />Myung, as ever, is able to more than just keep up with Petrucci, proving once again that even Dream Theater needs someone with at least a foot planted in reality.  Rudess has darkened up considerably ('Honor Thy Father' and 'Stream of Consciousness' par example), and has essentially become a second guitarist in the band (solos on the album in which he adopts anything other than a pseudo-guitar tone are all but non-existent).  The much-maligned LaBrie is losing his upper register's stamina, and has followed the trend he began on 1997's Falling Into Infinity by keeping mostly to the mid-to-lower register, to this time surprisingly successful results ('As I Am' is his least annoying performance to date).  '94's Awake and its stratospheric notes are ten years in the past, folks, and it's time, as the album itself indicates, for a change.  All in all a stellar offering this late in a band's career, and one that promises a future of constant experimentation and (surprise!) continued technical supremacy.
0156027321|3.0|i liked this book very much, although i think it's a very young book. the writer, being young, starts out to impart some great truth, and ends up instead with an enchanting contradiction to everything he thinks he's saying: i.e., he stumbles on a greater truth. or a better story, as he puts it. in spite of its claims, the book will not make you believe in god, unless you already do, but it will certainly make you believe in tigers, flying fish and carnivorous algae, which are much more interesting.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I like the story in the beginning because it talks about how it all started. And the ending was sad but great. But I would reccommend this movie to anyone who is a starwars fan. And I can't wait for the final sequel.
B00000FCBC|4.0|When this double-disc first came out all I heard was &quot;Metallica has finally sold out!&quot;  What about when they cut their hair and embraced Alternative Metal for the album &quot;Load&quot;?  In all seriousness, this is the last good Metallica album.  They haven't sounded this vital since &quot;The Black Album,&quot; belting out cover-tunes with fervor and tenacity.  So, why should anyone want to buy a collection of covers?  For me, I didn't know half the bands they were covering, so it sounded all the more fresh.  The only song I knew well was &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; from Black Sabbath, which is actually a mix of &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; and &quot;A National Acrobat&quot; from the same album.  As far as the &quot;Motorheadache&quot; section on disc 2, I still prefer the original versions.  But I must admit that this album helped me discover Killing Joke after hearing Metallica's cover of &quot;The Wait,&quot; and finding lost gems like &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; by Queen and &quot;Astronomy&quot; by Blue Oyster Cult were pleasant surprises.  I even got &quot;Plan 9&quot; by The Misfits after hearing the covers here for &quot;Last Caress&quot; and &quot;Green Hell.&quot;  While some of the covers are just okay, a lot of the other songs kick ass!  Check out &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; and &quot;Blitzgrieg.&quot;  &quot;The Small Hours&quot; is another gem.  Overall, I never felt this was a sell-out album.  After Metallica was dazzled with dollar-signs with the incredible popularity of &quot;The Black Album,&quot; most that followed was generally on a downward slope.  Most of this double-album is damned entertaining!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is a gem! One of the most original, complex movies I have ever seen! Buy it, enjoy it, treasure it!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|First of all I actually did like this film, the charecters were interesting and Charlotte was so somber and sexy.BUT>>>>Who told Bill Murray that he is sexy???Why would she,Charlotte be attracted to him ? I guess the obvious being he was the only American around.Why no implication of a love making scene. The movie gives the viewer the impression that Charlotte was all for it but it was Bob Harris that abstained... Yeah right. A young girl crushes on an older,much older, guy and he is a complete gentleman. Sorry not believable.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Not in a conventional sort of sense, of course; I'm not some slavering fan or stalker weirdo, and I've never met the woman in my life, but there's just something about her and her music I find impossibly and powerfully attractive. It wasn't always this way, though. I had of course heard Chan's name mentioned before among my slightly pretentious music snob friends, and had read some of the buzz surrounding her in the indie music press, but I never paid much attention. As it happened, a friend of mine, knowing my tastes tend to run toward melodic, lo-fi music, bought me &quot;You Are Free&quot; as a birthday gift. And I have to admit, the first couple of listens, I didn't get it. All the elements of the music I tend to like seemed to be there in the simple, almost stripped down arrangements on the album, but for some reason they didn't seem to be coming together for me. <BR>The epiphany came one night as I was driving home through moisture slicked streets after work. &quot;I want to be/a good woman/and I want for you/to be a good man/this is why/I'll be leaving/and this is why/I can't see you no more&quot;, Chan sang with chiming guitar and sawing fiddle in the background, as the rain spattered my windshield, and I suddenly realized I was listening to the most gorgeously wistful song I'd ever heard. I listened to track after track that night, taking an hour to do a ten minute drive, and couldn't believe I'd missed how brilliant this record was. I guess what I'm trying to get across using this long-winded parable is that there are some albums whose charms are not immediately evident. They take patience and work. This is one such album, and if you devote yourself to it, the rewards will be unimaginable. And maybe you'll fall in love with Chan Marshall too.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|Nobody buys that Jack Nicholson is some sexy god beyond aging ok? He definately is a cool guy,but come on sexy?!? Gimmme a break. Keaton comes off as some self righteous kook, and this movie is about 45 minutes to long. Not to mention that her plays seemed trite and trivial,a playwrite genius? I thought that overall there were a few funny moments, but this film is just to pretentious to be valid.
6304140711|5.0|When 16 year old Nicole meets David McCall for the first time, he is a sensitive and caring man. Over time they build a deep relationship. All the problems start after their first intimate encounter. David goes wacko with jealousy, beating up one of Nicole's best friends, who happens to be a guy. Nicole is torn between wanting to stay with him and never wanting to see him again. After a riff with her father, Nicole runs off temporarily with David. Later that night she catches him with her best friend. She dumps David and turns her back on her best friend Margo (Alyssa Milano), not letting her explain what really happened. David ends up stalking Nicole and essentially holding her family hostage. <br />Creepy in a way because it's a situation that can, and I'm sure has, happened.
B000002JSN|5.0|I first listened to zeppelin when I was 14, (I'm 33 now).  It's funny how much my taste in music has changed. Now it's hip-hop and bands like radiohead and coldplay.  BUT...   recently I purchased an ipod for the gym and decided to revisit music from my youth.  YES!!!  For me it's 20 years later and it is still incredible the beauty of it.  Physical Graffiti has always been one of my favorites, anyone that hasn't experienced this music and is about to is very lucky as they will really feel it.  Enjoy...

B0000C0FJB|5.0|Wow!  I've been a Rush fan for 23 years now and I never tire of their music, and &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; is just another example of why.<BR>I admit, it is quite different to hear the audience so much, but that only enhances the &quot;live&quot; experience! <br />After reading a few negative reviews, I'm completely at a loss as to why they would feel the way they do?!?!?<BR>A few are obviously not Rush fans, or are simply having some trouble with their audio equipment (or maybe think that KISS alive could even begin to compare to ANY Rush album). <br />I would HIGHLY recommend this album -- BUT BE WARNED:  If you are not a Rush fan then it could be a difficult listen, otherwise you should love it!
B000002J1O|5.0|You can't own just one Genesis album, and if you're gonna own any at all, start here.  Earlier tracks like 'Watcher Of The Skies', 'Supper's Ready' and 'The Music Box' were good, even great, in spots but sound in retrospect like rehearsals for this.  On SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND the band delivers the goods in tons (i.e., lots of pounds).  Gabriel's lyrics are self-consciously English (no kidding?) so much of his wordplay and puns are lost on lowly Texan ears like mine but the musical language works on every level:  it's as if the music is controlling the band this time around.  It isn't particularly complex (unlike contemporary Yes, for example, who released the triple live Yessongs the same year) and not at all dark (contempory King Crimson).  The instrumental sections of the lead track 'Dancing With The Moonlit Knight', for example, are among the most expansive and arresting in any genre (with awesome guitar work from Steve Hackett), as is the extended instrumental section of 'The Cinema Show' with its melodic synth leads.  Every track is a stunner on one level or another at one time or another, including the perfectly-titled two-part instrumental 'After The Ordeal' (try listening to it after yours).  Early Genesis was always willfully 'progressive' without being willfully inaccessible and SELLING ENGLAND is their apex.  Oh yeah, Phil Collins makes his (very humble) debut as songwriter in 'More Fool Me', thank you very much, and doesn't even play drums on that particular track- -but it is his spot-on drumwork which helps propel so much of this album forward.  And Tony Banks' blending of organ and Mellotron shadings are subtle and restrained.  Great stuff.  Too bad Peter Gabriel didn't play more oboe, though.
B0001E7LQG|3.0|The reason Something's Gotta Give was so well received has more to do with the pitiful quality of the average Hollywood film than its own merits.  When you have fine actors, pretty locations, and a romantic fantasy you overlook the insubstantial story and unbelievable ending.  Something's Gotta Give with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton is pleasant, but not as good as As Good as It Gets, where Nicholson and Helen Hunt play sometimes unpleasant people with real problems who make a way out of loneliness for themselves.  In Something's Gotta Give the way out falls into their laps without either having to make a hard choice.  As another of Keaton's directors said, it's a &quot;Hollywood Ending.&quot;<br />Jack Nicholson is Harry, a rich sixty-three-year-old who dates only young women and takes Viagra to help Mr. Midnight get ready.  When Harry's latest young thing brings him to her mother's house in the Hamptons,  Harry (1) has a heart attack, (2) finds he can love someone older and not need Viagra, and (3) has to decide whether to change his life.  Just as Harry realizes the good things about older women, Erica (Keaton) discovers the joys of younger men.  Harry's doctor (Keanu Reeves) falls for Erica's body and her mind.<br /><br />The music is great, from hip-hop to Marvin Gaye.  Frances McDormand singing and moving to &quot;Let's Get It On&quot; (which could have been the title of the movie) is one of the highlights of the film.  In fact, McDormand has already made a more interesting version of this story, centered on a successful woman who plays the field.  Check out Laurel Canyon.
B00013F38K|4.0|A classic TV series is resuscitated through this new, season 1 episodes, DVD collectors edition boxed set.  As an added bonus, the pilot movie is thrown in with two documentaries (really, they look like one and probably should be).  While the documentaries are good enough to hold one's interests, they are quite standard fair.  The pilot movie, is like most pilots, establishing a backdrop for a series.<br />And that is what really makes this set special: the 15 episodes.  As a kids, I never really liked this show much.  After all, I wanted action, but maturity set in and now I find the action for this show fits the time period and the softer wisdom philosophy of Kwai Chang Cain.  It is amazing, how the writers, without selling out Eastern philosophy, nicely interweave Eastern and Western ideas into the hour lessons.  Kung Fu is a movie that teaches and entertains.<br />The fight scenes are well, average at best. But David Carradine, and actor/dancer was hired for the dramatic elements, and for lack of martial training, pulls off the character in spite of poor martial skills.  Still, the scenes are enjoyable because the plot is well scripted and directed and therefore, when Cain fights, which involves a purpose completely understood whether displayed visually or through audio message, one ends up enjoying the fights of this show.<br />Certain episodes which would spark much debate today are  \\"eye for an eye\\" because of an overtly pro-life position \\"Sun and Cloud Shadow\\" because it was probably polemic then, but quite accepted now. These episodes are actually marvelous as well as \\"Nine Lives\\" which is light hearted with a good message and \\"Dark Angel,\\" a show about redemption, greed, and hope.  Dark Angel provides a powerful performance from Dean Jagger.<br />The problems with the DVD are the cropping, which others have noted here and well, lets face it, Carradine is not a great martial artists or very Chinese looking.  Even though the producers in the documentary explain why he was hired, this weakness still presents a problem.  It must be noted that, this is also a strength for the show, for Carradine does deliver the lines wonderfully despite lacking martial and Chinese physical characteristics.<br />Look for: Jodie Foster, Robert Urich, Gary Busy, John Saxon, and many many more actors who have in one way or another left their mark.lain why he was hired, this weakness still presents a problem.

076790592X|4.0|I think many times we as individuals get lost in our world hoping to only have to deal with our pain and not share it with those around us.  Morrie seemed like the kind of man that always wanted to share not only his joy with others but his pain as well. This he did not just to burden others with his problems, rather so they would grow from his misfortune and possibly be better for the experience.  While I disagreed with some of the thoughts and actions that Morrie took in his life, he did seem to be a man of conviction and because of that he took action to deal with what he saw as injustice.  I believe that the lessons that we can learn from Morrie include the following:<BR>1. care for others<BR>2. allow others to care for you<BR>3. be willing to learn from others<BR>While this list is not comprehensive by any means, it does include the main points that I took away from this book.  <br />I liked the way Mitch Albom wrote from a sincere and personal view and not as the typical sports writer.  He allowed his character to come from the pages as well as Morrie's.  I think, while this book it doesn't sanatize the issues of suffering and dying it treats them in away that is respectful and light enough to allow readers to explore their own fears and emotions about the certainty that we all must face.

B000084T18|2.0|The recent backlash this album has received from online reviewers is typical of fickle minded individuals who liked 50 one day, then hated him the next. Why is it that when a record such as 50's blows up the charts, everyone's suddenly like \\"Oh he's garbage...he's wack!\\" Get Rich or Die Tryin is certainly not a great album (in fact I would say its a rather weak album), but I feel this collective bashing of Eminem, 50, and Dre is a little excessive. I mean c'mon, Dre is still one the best producers in the game today, as Eminem is still one of the best rappers (albeit a weak producer). Let's be a bit more constructive in our criticism, k? As for my distaste of the album, I think the main problem is that 50 brings nothing new to the table. He's big on guns, sex, drugs, & violence, but so what....so were all the other dime-a-dozen gangsta rappers from the 90's. His rhyme skills aren't much to brag about, as I sometimes have difficulty understanding what's he's saying in his songs. The beats are fairly repetitive, and there's a bit too much singing, especially for a gansta record. All in all, a weak album, but not exactly one star material.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Amongst the myriad fields of art and aesthetics, it can be argued that the medium of comedy contains the greatest level of subjectivity for its audience.  That which makes one man laugh will make another weep (or sneer), and vice-versa; the polarities of `funny' tend to fall into the time-honored wit-slots of lowbrow (Adam Sandler pleb-fests), middlebrow (mainstream sitcoms), and highbrow (satire, tongue-in-cheek obscurest in-joshing). Alas, the boundaries between `brows are vast, virulently defended, and rarely surmounted by either artist or audience... and as to which is truly `better,' well, that is (I repeat) a subjective preference: for each represents a facet of humanity - from the all-encompassing exit-point of the gutter to the slick exclusivity of the Ivory Tower - and should be respected as such.  The language and technique may differ, yet under the surface the similarities cannot be denied - for as any Buddhist will happily tell you, comedy thrives on *suffering*: the pain and folly of humanity exposed, ridiculed, and reduced in turn by the cathartic chuckle; our redundancies, egocentricies, idiocies and plain tomfoolery encapsulated for exorcism and/or easy digestion.   <br />Rare is it for one to find a comedy that deftly blends the best elements of all three `brow aesthetics' into a humor-vehicle that is at once escapist and illuminating.  *Wooster and Jeeves*, an A&E adaptation of the P.G. Wodehouse serial-novels of the same name, achieves this exceptional distinction.  With its natural dialogue (culled directly from the source material), impeccable comic timing and excellent acting, along with an extremely refreshing variation on the standard development-of-conflict/culmination-of-tension sitcom-structure, *Wooster and Jeeves* towers over the dross and diminished returns of mainstream H-wood offerings, exposing the implicit poverty of ultra-recycled miscommunication-muddling, senseless slapstick, lowest-common-denominator joke-dialogue and imbecilic`shock' theatrics.  This is one for the archives.<br />*Wooster and Jeeves* centers around one Bertram Wooster (Hugh Laurie), an archetypical English wealth-scion of the flapper `20s (i.e. a playboy and all-around fop), and Jeeves (Stephen Fry), his sophisticated valet.  Bertie has devoted his existence to simple pleasures: afternoon excursions to the local gentleman's club for drinks and nine-ball; the occasional golf-game in the countryside; learning all the newest tunes on his piano (and, distressingly, a trombone).  But this peaceful existence is constantly threatened by his relatives and school-chum companions, who endeavor often-as-not to involve him in their half-witted shenanigans (often via blackmail), or seek to marry him off so as to be `molded' into an upstanding citizen.  Luckily Bertie has Jeeves, his upper-crust manservant of philosophical bent, photographic memory and astonishing reliability, to help him wriggle free from these various entanglements/entrapments: \\"you're a rare bird, Jeeves!\\" Bertie invariably exclaims upon hearing the elegant, simple solutions his valet conjures.  Indeed, compared to the lassitude and loathsome irresponsibility run rampant in Bertie's circle of the privileged (...peacocks, puff-adders and/or prunes), Jeeves is a pillar and a paragon, far more cultivated in his education and moral fortitude than any of the noble-rank he so impeccably serves.  This could be considered a cliché, and with good reason - but we must remember that clichés often have a strong basis in reality, and such is the case here.  Wooster & co., born with the silver spoon firmly placed in mouth, have never had to struggle for anything: thus, stressful occasion is usually invented or invited, for excitement, a `lark', a means to obtain the suffering so key in delineating character and defining pleasure, whereas Jeeve's fortitude is all self-made, stamped upon soul and sinew through years of willing trial. <br />But I digress.  The one thing I like most about *Wooster and Jeeves,* aside from the top-notch writing, acting, set-design and dramatic construction, is the fact that it sidesteps the typical tension-build of very nearly all comedy.  In the usual spate of sitcom and other `brow-aesthetics,' a situation is introduced, complications ensue, and with an unhealthy over-reliance of miscommunication, the tension is milked and milked until `release' - long after the outcome has been thoroughly predicted by the jaded audience.  In each episode of *Wooster and Jeeves*, however, the writers have combined several of Wodehouse's short stories, therein threading events, character-arcs and complications into a sinuous storm of tension/release.  Rare is it for an uncomfortable situation to wear out its premise: not only are conflicts dispatched in a speedy and sometimes surprising manner, they often mutate into different, contrasting developments...an incredibly refreshing twist.  This show is *not* milked, and there is (almost) always enough material to fill a 45-minute episode.<br />Until, that is, the fourth season.  All that makes this series extraordinary is astonishingly reputed in the disastrous return-to-America episodes, which stretch credibility well past the breaking point and simply are _not_ up to snuff with the prior three seasons.  The Empire State Building climax of `The Once and Future Ex' borders on disgusting parody; the castaway epilogue to `Bridegroom Wanted' is humorous only in a surreal `what were they thinking?' sort of way.  Everything returns to normal (more or less) once Bertie and Jeeves reach England, though the spark of the show is discernable weakened afterward and even the return of powerhouse personality-clashes like that of Finknottle and Spode come of more like copycat comedy when compared to their predecessors. <br />Regardless, this box set is well worth the lucre.  Five stars.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Arguably the greatest hip hop album ever pressed and without doubt the single greatest debut album in hip hop history.  You have friends that want to know what pure hip hop is, give them this album to listen to.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|My test of a \\"great\\" movie is one that has me thinking about it for days afterward.  This one does it in spades.  O.K., it is a thinking person's movie.  If you are into movies with plots that give themselves away after only five minutes and take every predictable turn and leave you feeling smugly satisfied after ninety minutes-sorry.  Try something else.  If you crave something deeper, more sublime and with as many layers of meaning as the walls of the Grand Canyon, give it a try.    I rented this video with few expectations and knowing little about it-other than looking forward to seeing a flick with Bill Murray that was set in Japan.  As a big fan of Bill Murray, I was only mildly disappointed to discover that he was doing a more serious part here, yet one not completely distanced from some of his previous roles.  Murray has the uncanny ability to be both funny and tragic--the perfect existential anti-hero.     Murray plays Bob Harris, the archetype of an aging film actor, who comes to Tokyo for a quick two million dollar paycheck to film a Suntori Whiskey ad campaign.  Overwhelmed by language and culture shock (though we suspect more is behind his alienation), Bob sits forlornly in his posh hotel room, unable to sleep and wanders into the hotel lobby.  There he nurses his Suntori scotch, listens to a mediocre American pop group and slinks away from some American businessmen who regale him with their admiration of his previous film work.    We see this movie through the lens of Bob.  Call it the \\"ugly American-syndrome\\" and get defensive, but Bob is hopelessly monolingual and monocultural. Like the dog that hears only \\"blah-blah-blah, Rover\\", Bob hears only a continuous stream of unintelligible Japanese, mangled R's/L's and abbreviated-but-useless translations from his helpful but oh-so-proper-and-politically-correct Japanese translator.    Enter Charlotte: the 20-ish wife of a clueless, ambitious and insensitive photographer husband in Tokyo for an assignment.Stranded in the same posh hotel (also afflicted with jet-lag/insomnia) she eventually connects with Bob Harris.  Despite their age difference, the two develop a common bond within their disaffection and alienation.  The source of their angst comes from different sources, yet there is an attraction between them that fails to go the (anticipated) distance.     Bob's life, like the existential hero in Camus' \\"The Stranger\\", is without love, vitality, interest or inspiration.  Charlotte, young as she is, finds herself in the same dilemma.  She finds comfort and kinship with Bob.     There are moments of pure existential chaos such as when the two bored insomniacs explore the bright lights and strange sights and sounds of Tokyo in a drunken escapade.    This story unfolds in a crucible--the best of all story devices. A man and a woman, though decades apart in age, find kinship--and a form of love--in a strange land surrounded by a language and people they can barely comprehend.  The plot is minimalistic.  The timeline is one of only a few days.      This is a theme-driven experience that many will not appreciate.  Coppolla does an excellent job of creating a world of high strangeness and sublime beauty that will escape many.  Don't you miss it!
0385504209|1.0|So much has been said about this book... I will just poing out some serious flaws I noted.<br />1) In the typical marxist fashion, too many ideas and concepts are presented as dichotomies. Endlessly, Christianity and Christian Europe is presented as \\"masculine\\" and has directly suppressed previous \\"feminine\\" religious concepts that existed in Pre-Christian Europe.  While this is a tiresome theme within the halls of academia, the ignorance portrayed here is startling. Did this author ever read Nietzsche?  Pagan Europe was one of a tremendous variety of gods and religions. The chief criticisms of monotheistic religions (or dualistic religions as the author seems to favor) is that they present a limited number of ideals to the people.  Rather than the tremendous variety of ideals (and human characteristics) that existed in the classical world, the author seems to believe there was only a masculine and feminine ideal. This is false.<br />2) The second major critique of Christianity is that it supplants normal masculine behavior with feminine behavior.  Feminism, despite its endless ramblings, still has an extremely limited understand of what masculinity truly is.  A truly masculine religion would not condemn violence, demand monogamy, and trivialize creativity.<br />3) If the reproductive aspect of femininity was truly repressed in the world, the human population would not be increasing at such precipitous rate.  The god of war has always been a part of more natural religions due to the understanding that death and destruction is a part of life.  Too much life is what throws the world out of balance, and only through death can that balance be restored.  Despite the authors anti-christian ramblings, his lack of appreciation of war, violence, and killing is ultimately a very christian moralism.<br />4) The discussion of symbols is so trite I was laughing hysterically.  Also in a typical feminist fashion, sexuality is portrayed as dominant aspect of life, including symbols and language.  When will they learn it is females who are obsessed with sexuality, not the other way around?<br />I would have much preferred the authors discussiong of the Swastika than the Lambda symbol which he could not even identify as such.  That symbol is used on military uniforms because it was the symbol of Sparta(...).  Further, such simplistic symbols are hardly as meaningful as the author wishes us to believe.mbols and language.

B00006879E|4.0|There is a great divide between the wannabe highbrow music snobs and people who just want to hear good songs.   The term pop music usually elicits pretty negative responses from those who feel every singer and band must offer up a ground breaking, cutting edge release to justify being given a recording contract.    If you are one of the elitists who feel this way, Maroon 5 will definitely irritate the hell out of you.   This band may not be the saviors of rock that many bands have been called in recent years.  Their musicianship is neither innovative nor is it sophisticated.  The vocals aren't unique. and the songwriting isn't headache inducing poetry.   Maroon 5 is simply a band that combines the best elements of all that is popular in music now and seems to be having fun playing it.   The single Harder to Breathe is one of the catchiest tunes to come out in the last 3 years.  It's follow up This Love is garnering as much (if not more) airplay than the first single.  But these songs offer just a glimpse of this thouroughly enjoyable cd.   Vocalist Adam Levine's voice is pure joy to listen to as he sings songs about love, desire, loss and heartbreak.  He has definitely studied his Stevie Wonder (and maybe a little Justin Timberlake).  Check out my favorite tracks Secret, Tangled, She Will Be Loved and The Sun.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I can sum it up for you: Two unlikeable, bored characters mope around a Tokyo hotel for a couple of days then go home. If you were expecting more than this then you are a shallow reviewer who mistakes ennui for profundity. You wait for something to happen but it never does. If you have seen the trailer you have seen all the funny parts, few they may be. If you are expecting a drama, there isn't any. Much has been made of Bill Murray's acting. Just as Al Pacino does haggard better than anyone, Bill Murray owns a lock on &quot;hang dog&quot;. He just has to show up, look bored with the part, and bingo, Oscar nods. If you are the type who thinks the cliched long camera shot of the man sitting on the edge of his bed too depressed to get off it is the stuff of great theater, this is your movie. The characters could have ended their boredom easily. He could have quit cheating on his wife and gone home to play with the kids. She could get a job or volunteer for some worthwhile cause. No, they feel sorry for their sorry lives instead. Worse, they make us bored and that's the nepotistic director's fault. This is what Hollywood thinks is the stuff of life. Any wonder Hollywood thinks government is the answer to everything but censorship. Like American Beauty, this movie is a peek into the heart of incestuous Hollywood and it isn't pretty. As for Scarlet, frankly madam, I don't give a damn.

B0001MDPV8|5.0|First, I want to say that I looooooove the direction that Nas is heading, Finally! He's giving us PURE street hiphop, with deep, profound lyrics...I have been listening to this album for awhile now and I found myself, replaying it over and over and over again. The metaphors are just too heavy and the beats, are just &quot;beautiful&quot;<br />Much love Nas, can't wait til you drop your double album!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Too bad that you have to give one star - I would love to give this release zero stars.<BR>There's no way I'm going to buy the so-called \\"Special Editions\\" of these movies. I could live with a set that included both the original and the bastardized versions - but if Lucas insists that the \\"SEs\\" are the only versions that will be released I'll have take very good care of my VHS copies of the Original Trilogy. It looks like they are going to be the only copies of these movies that I'll ever own.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|...reading the negative reviews. They're boring, trite and make you want to fall asleep.<br />I don't know why some are so intimidated by this movie they find it deliberately arty or pretentious (while other negative reviewers find it too prosaic - can't please everyone). There's nothing complex about its approach at all. It's a simple story of emotional closeness well told.
B00003CXC7|2.0|[WARNING: movies spoilers ahead] Recently I watched Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, and The Birds.  Out of these four, I only liked Vertigo... the other was not much of anything new, probably due to so many other movies imitating it... but god... even if none did that, can Read WIndow be so highly acclaimed as it is?  It feels only like a low budget Hong Kong black and white movie made in two weeks.  The plot sucked.  <br />Even some re-run of Hitchcock on the TV that is 30 minutes long have more twist and surprise and ending better than The Birds, Psycho, and Rear Window.

Better give them some candy.<br />HOW CORNY are their masks, the only thing more embarassing is their &quot;music&quot;. its like listening to the woman give birth.

6305268843|5.0|this is a good movie and good acting...  [warning: movie spoiler ahead...] but it feels like Jane Eyre modified... the acting is great.  hm, the part when the daughter knew that she is her mom is kind of cliche... not very deep.  but good movie overall.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|Although &quot;Try This&quot; is not really a horrible album, it is not exactly what I would call a good one either. Unlike &quot;Misundaztood&quot;, no songs really jump out and catch your attention which is probably the reason that album and its singles only received a lukewarm reception. <br />After her second album, Pink really seemed to be on a roll, but then she released &quot;Feel Good Time&quot; over the summer of 2003 and it was only a minor hit breaking her string of eight consecutive top 40 hits *counting &quot;Lady Marmalade.&quot;* There are a few good tracks on here. The first single &quot;Trouble&quot; is actually a catchy song, but I think the whole bad girl thing was played out and that's why it did not do that well at radio. The next single &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; is pretty cool upon your first listen but grows tired fast. It did not even chart. The only other decent track is &quot;Save My Life&quot;. The rest fall flat.<br />Pink is talented but I think she was a bit overexposed at the time of this release. She should have waited a little longer and took a different approach with this.

It feels only like a low budget Hong Kong black and white movie made in two weeks.  The plot sucked.  <br />Maybe Schizophrenia was a brand new thing in 1960 and a lot of people are surprised by it.  But it isn't anymore now, so the surprise element goes away.<br />Even some re-run of Hitchcock on the TV that is 30 minutes long have more twist and surprise and ending better than The Birds, Psycho, and Rear Window.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|It's rare that an event with so many strong matches garners nothing more than a bland response from its audience.  As such, Wrestlemania XX will go down as an oddity in the history books of pro-wrestling.  Taken in pieces, the event itself is really something memorable, with Benoit vs. HHH vs. HBK, Guerrero vs. Angle, and Jericho vs. Christian all being memorable and technically sound matches.  Even the \\"entertainment\\" portions of the show merit some repeat viewing, as Evolution vs. Rock and Sock, Goldberg vs. Lesnar, Undertaker vs. Kane, and Molly vs. Victoria were all fun to watch.  <br />Yet, despite all its strengths, the show can't seem to crawl out of the pit of mediocrity fans have dug for it.  Both 4-Way tag matches were completely unnecessary and ultimately forgettable, Cena couldn't carry Big Show to anything remotely watchable, the Cruiserweights weren't given enough time to develop their contest into anything, and the Evening Gown match wasn't impressive in the least.  <br />With the DVD, one can certainly cut the chaff and watch the 7 or so strong matches that the PPV had to offer, thus making it a dozen times better.  As a historical piece, WMXX will be forever remembered for a variety of reasons.  As a wrestling show, the sheer length of the event keeps it from reaching anything above mediocre as a whole.

It feels only like a low budget Hong Kong black and white movie made in two weeks.  The plot sucked.  For The Birds, I guess there is some hidden meaning to the ending, but can it be made more clear...  right now it feels like a horror movie with no ending.  I can accept other movie having no ending, such as Yi Yi or Rebels in the Neon Light... but a horror movie or action movie just ending abruptly?  <br />Even some re-run of Hitchcock on the TV that is 30 minutes long have more twist and surprise and ending better than The Birds, Psycho, and Rear Window.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|After listening to the album, I couldn't stop listening to it! It's been in my CD player for 2 weeks! It has a variety of songs, both rock and some more heart-felt tunes.

B00007K02F|5.0|Oh boy, I like this movie...  and I like Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt.  I don't know... I am a down to earth person, so I like Charlotte and William and how they played the characters.  The Jane and Rochester also look like myself from time to time.  I like them because they are Pisces and Cancer, in particular late Pisces and late Cancer (March 20 and July 22).  I am a Scorpio.
B000002UCQ|5.0|George Harrison's talent had gone overlooked long enough in 1970, when he released his magnum opus, All Things Must Pass. With John Lennon screaming his heart out in his solo debut and with Paul McCartney doing home experiments in his solo debut, George continued where Abbey Road left off and created a sonic masterpiece never to be rivaled again.<br />The strength of All Things Must Pass is in its messages. Many call the album &quot;religious,&quot; yet only &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; and &quot;Awaiting On You All&quot; contain spiritual overtones. Each song's entity is another chunk of Harrison that we hadn't seen much of with the Beatles.<br />&quot;I'd Have You Anytime,&quot; co-written by Bob Dylan, is George's soft and beautiful side. &quot;Wah-Wah&quot; is George's backstabbing, cyncical side (possibly aimed at McCartney). &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; is his peace-hoping side and &quot;What Is Life&quot; is his forever-happy, yearning side. <br />The opening five songs set the mood and set a bar for all rock albums. &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; soars as an answer to &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; and clocks in one second shorter than the former. &quot;What Is Life&quot; releases George's feelings before he calms into a comfortable position.<br />Not only are the five opening songs worth the price, but every song is good and listenable. Phil Spector's &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; is put to wonderful use here, because George's voice is at times hoarse and moreover, the sound is majestic and sounds large. This album was intended to sound large.<br />Some of the lighter songs, however, really add depth to the album. The frolic of &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot; is an ode to the girls who hung outside the Beatles recording studio. &quot;Behind That Locked Door&quot; is a wonderfully shy tune. &quot;Run Of The Mill&quot; is the best of this bunch: a poignant reminder with touches of Spector.<br />Right in the middle of the album is &quot;Beware Of Darkness,&quot; the key of the entire album. The lyrics are some of George's best, invoking an introspective mood.<br />The jams in the final record hurt the album overall, but with two albums of amazing recordings, how can they really hurt it? Eighteen songs that will leave a listener in awe. One of the greatest albums ever created and the album that forever etched Harrison's legacy.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|If you're a Guns N' Roses fan, there's only 2 reasons why you should buy this album...<br />- You're a G'N'R collector<BR>- You have a friend who likes G'N'R, but doesn't own any of the albums. So this album is a great present indeed.<br />A true fan already owns at least &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;, &quot;Use Your Illusion I &amp; II&quot; and perhaps &quot;Lies&quot;. &quot;The Spaguetti Incident&quot; was just a plain bad album, but if you liked &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot;, you might as well go to ITunes or Napster and download it. <br />People on the previous posts complain a lot for this album not including more songs from &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot; or &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; but let me remind them... THIS IS A HITS ALBUM!! ...which includes pretty much every single song played on the radio. There's a lot of fan favorites not included here, but that's just because THEY WEREN'T HITS!<br />Yet this is a great pick for anyone who is just about to get introduced to this band. Guns N' Roses could have been the biggest thing since 'The Beatles', but we all know how that story ends. So don't even bother to wait for 'Chinese Democracy' to come out.
B000003S28|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to all of this entire album,this was  my second &quot;Brian Eno&quot; purchase, the other being &quot;Ambient 1/Music for Airports&quot; which I bought a few years ago.<BR>   I'VE BEEN A FAN OF Brian Eno's ever since I listened to both Bowie's&quot;Low and Heroes&quot; album and watching the documentary film of the making of U2'S &quot;Unforgetable Fire&quot; album 1984.<BR>   I think this album is a continuation of his work from &quot;Roxy Music&quot; in the 1970's and from his album &quot;Another Green World&quot; in 1974.<BR>    I feel that the reviewer who described this recording that &quot;Brian presents 18 portholes into 18 different worlds that range from ethereal to downright eerie&quot; was extreamly accurate and best suited to this ambient music.<BR>    I wasn't fustrated as some people were with the length of the tracks, he did follow through with what he intended to do with his music and I was fulfilled with listening to this disc, I didn't feel like I wanted more,It was very satisfying.<BR>       The Liner notes says these tracks are fragments, which is a good description for the tracks since they only clock in at a average of 2 minutes a piece.<BR>    Wonder, bliss, melancholy and obliqueness, low-key and sad are words that hits it right on the mark.Thank-you Brian for this interesting and challenging work.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Wow, how am I to describe this cd?  Well, let's just say this...have you ever wondered what the sound of pure violence sounds like?  Don't look too much farther, 'cause this cd is it.  <br />I heard about Lamb of God from the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack (A very good buy also if I may add...).  The song 11th Hour made its appearance on the album, and caught me completely by surprise.  I was mesmerized by the frantic, start-stop, blast of insanity that was coming from my stereo.  So from then on, I was hooked.  It's pretty much all you need from an American heavy metal band: pure craziness.  Crazy vocals, crazy guitar work, and crazy drumming.  Although sometimes repetitive, the singer (Randy Blythe) belts out this distinct guttural growl that fits the intensity of the music perfectly.  These guys could hang with any heavy metal band out there today.<br />The only downfall of this cd (if you could even call it a downfall), is that the songs all pretty much have the same tempo.  It fits the album well, but sometimes you think you're listening to the same song.  But still, a fine cd.  The best songs on here are Ruin and 11th hour.<br />Hopefully, if I can get down to Ozzfest this year, I'll be able to see this band.  I can just imagine the mounds of dead bodies piling up after they rip into their first head-crushing anthem of violence.  This cd definitely inspires you to see them.  Whoo...I think I'm gonna go listen to it now and break everything in my room.  <br />Rock on Lamb of God!...and that's the truth!
B000006YYM|5.0|What can I say about one of the best British prog albums of the 70s? Well, for one thing, it doesn't sound like other British prog. Gentle Giant is a lot less bombastic on the whole, and employs their chops towards a more fusion-esque angle with tight arrangements, catchy riffs in odd meters, and uniformly great vocals. Unlike their peers in the symph-prog world, Gentle Giant doesn't really _sound_ &quot;symphonic,&quot; instead their roots are more in 15th, 16th and 20th century classical music, as well as jazz-fusion and English folk. And while the music is complex and unusual, they never seem to forget about having fun -- the songs have an infectious energy to them, and they are catchy as hell.<br />The songs are all very good, unlike other GG discs where there is an &quot;ehhh&quot; song or two. The opener &quot;Proclamation&quot; is a really funky rocker with a powerful middle section of heavy electric organs and dissonant vocals. &quot;The Face&quot; has some really catchy violin and guitar jamming with a propulsive rhythm. &quot;So Sincere&quot; has addictively strange, dissonant chord progressions, weird meteres, and jumpy vocal melodies. &quot;Playing the Game&quot; has delicious main instrumental lines that remind me of the soundtrack from Doki Doki Panic (well, to some people that would be a _bad_ thing). Life has suddenly taken an unexpected twist and I can't really concentrate on this review anymore. So just take my word for it that all the other songs are really good. This is a must-have.
B000005IU2|5.0|This is the soundtrack to the apocalypse.  A Burning fire from beginning to end. The meltdown is unrelenting and unstoppable.  Words are inadequate to truly do this work of divine ungodly art justice. Ig wailing in torment and ecstasy with nowhere left to go but up.  This is the sound of God being Bitchslapped
B000000H6D|2.0|Well honestly I can't see the attraction that so many have to this album. I feel that the only good this album did in any sense was set Type O Negative in good direction to later create &quot;October Rust&quot; and &quot;World Coming Down&quot; which both got 5 stars from me.<br />This was Type O's unfortunate breakthrough because it denoted the bands ability to stand on firm ground with a more diverse base of fans. This &quot;notorious&quot; album pales horribly to associate with the bands inevitable growth. This album is decadent and lacks thier more profound and cunning facetiousness, thier brutal satire with gorgeous melody. <br />Be good to yourself wont ya? Buy &quot;October Rust&quot;, &quot;World Coming Down&quot; and &quot;Life is Killing Me&quot; they are just far superior to this album.
B0001CCXGG|4.0|This is not up to the standards of the first G-3, released in 1997.<br />Mr. Satriani, the illustrious leader of all this I take it, had a lapse of judgment in hiring the embarrasing and desperately out-of-place Yngwie. He is all speed and no taste. His \\"singing\\" is pathetic. He slurs words, growls, and is off-time. His version of \\"Red House\\" is terrible, just terrible. He botches the intro (so beautifully done by Hendrix and on the other G-3 album, where Eric Johnson leads off). He cannot play the blues, which demand feeling, taste, and restraint. The main is just a speed machine--and it get boring very quickly. He nearly ruins the jam disk because he refuses to comp consistently, cannot stick to unision lead lines, and jumps around the fretboard on the final statement of the head on \\"Voodo Child.\\" Moreover, he looks like the epidomy of an aging, but desperately trying to look young and sexy, rock star. No so for Steve and Joe, who let the guitars do the work.<br />I would have appreciated more new songs from Joe, particularly from \\"Strange Beautiful Music.\\" I have heard several of these many times in many versions. That said, the takes are excellent. The new rhythm guitarist is mixed a bit loader than Joe's previous man, which is appropriate. You could barely hear the other guitar player Eric C. Jeff C., the drummer, has added a few new chops, especially on \\"The Mystical Potato Head Grove Thing.\\"<br />Vai's music tends to be more complex than Joe's, probably due to the Zappa influence. He briefly sings on the first number, sounding some vaguely spiritual themes, which are not entirely clear. No gospel presentation there... Vai's longest piece, \\"Whispering a Prayer,\\" is a bit overdone--although it may grow on me. I'm not sure the minimal melody (almost like a lullaby) is rich enough to sustain the whole song.<br />The jam tunes are far less satisfying that the original G-3, largely because of Malsteen's pressence. However, there are some soaring moments.<br />Joe and Steve bring it up to 4 stars. Yngwie is another (sad) story...<br />(...)nd Steve bring it up to 4 stars. Yngwie is another (sad) story...<br />(...)
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some people claim the beatles were over-rated. I see one reviewer here claims that he/she can see The Beatles for what they were , because he/she has listend to more music than most. Well, so have I, I've listend to all styles of music. Country, Jazz, Classical, Reggae, Rockabilly, Bluegrass, Cajun, Folk, Pop, Rock, Soul, Metal, Punk etc,etc Old and New. Yet there is noway The Beatles are overrated, they are quite simply the greatest musical geniuses of all-time. This CD contains all 27 of their #1 singles, but none of their great B-sides or fine album cuts and other singles than just missed the top. Nevertheless, if you don't own a Beatles album, or only own a few and are on a tight budget, This CD is for you. Not as comprehensive as the two double sets of Beatles hit's, it is much cheaper and whilst not a full compaltion, still shows the Beatles making fine music. If you like what you hear, then check out \\"Abbey road\\", \\"Beatles for sale\\" and \\"Rubber soul\\" after.<BR>The first Beatles album i bought myself was \\"A collection of Beatles oldies\\", which is no longer in print, but this is the closet thing to it now if you don't want to fork out a fair fortune for the boxed sets.
B00005JMEW|2.0|KILL BILL has a weak storyline, and next to nothing character development.  That in itself is enough to make you steer clear of this film.  KILL BILL relies on violence and unusual killings to try and pull you in.  The only saving grace of the film is the interesting camera work, but I very much doubt that this film will become a cult classic like earlier films from Quentin Tarantino.<br />The very best part of the film was when it ended.  Let's just hope that Volume 2 never sees the light of day.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is my favorit movie. I am 15. All I can realy say is <BR>This is the BEST movie ever

B0001MDQ6W|1.0|Let me begin by saying how excited I was when I picked up this DVD.  However, as the first track passed, it was very apparent that the quality of Bob Dylan's performance was definitely lacking.  I'm sitting here guzzling a couple beers to contain my frustration.  I would strongly discourage anyone from getting this awful DVD.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|I picked up this CD because Total Guitar magazine said that it had elements from \\"every metal band you've ever loved.\\"  Provided that one of those bands is Linkin Park, this is probably true.  I'm glad to see a new band trying to be heavy, but this doesn't quite cut it.  I witnessed the emergence of death metal and black metal and it seems that they \\"wrote\\" their songs by just sticking together a bunch of admittedly cool riffs from past acts (several Obituary riffs are prominent).  The jerky lack of transitions betrays this method of writing.  The vocalist is just too pre-pubescent to my ears (hence the Linkin Park connection).  M. Shadows may have taken $12 of my paycheck, but I'm hoping that seven people will read this and buy something else instead...then I will be avenged sevenfold.<br />Try As I Lay Dying for metalcore, or Emperor or Morbid Angel for metal.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|If you have time to kill this is the movie for you. Don't buy this movie thinking you are getting a comedy.  I was greatly disappointed in this movie. I expected to atleast laugh once in a while or atleast get some snickers with Bill in the movie. I think there was maybe three(3) places in the entire movie I snickered at all.  I kept watching it expecting it to get better, but it didn't to my disappointment.
B000002MY3|5.0|1995 belonged to an angst-ridden woman by the name of Alanis Morissette. Perhaps you have heard of her? ''Jagged Little Pill was released without much attention atteched to it, which resulted in landing Alanis Morissette's Jagged album the No. 117 spot on the album chart in the US. Howevever as ''You Oughta Know'' raced up the airplay charts and MTV played the video non-stop, it was a given that ''Jagged Little Pill'' would turn out to become a hot seller in the end. The album displayed with each single releases that it was filled with massive hit potential and everyone seemed to have a favourite among the various releases. Suprisenly the single releases weren't the only good offerings on ''Jagged Little Pill, the non-release tracks were top-notch material as well. <br />When the success-train ended, Jagged Little Pill had sold a massive 28 millions and became the biggest selling female album of all time. Now second to Shania Twain's ''Come On Over'' though it was still an impressive feist and still remains so. <br />The album teaser ''All I Really Want'' sets the album off to a perfect start. The demanding offering was a minor hit though by the time, it had been released everyone pratically own the album. Even to this day, I still enjoy putting this song on when I have had a day where I simply can't be bored anymore. As Alanis Morissette stats ''And All I Really Want Is Some Patience'' and I couldn't agree more. There jump-starter off the album ''You Oughta Know'' gathered the attention of listeners around the world with its confronting lyrics and heavy rock sound. It has become an athem for all the ''wronged'' female and males as well. The video sees Alanis Morissette in a desect with bare feet, raving and displaying the world her anger.<br />Another highlight would most certainly included the superb ''Ironic''. It managed to put Alanis on the map everywhere and sales of ''Jagged Little Pill'' rose though the roof. The song deals witall the ironic elements in lifesuch as ''It's Like Meeting The Man Of My Dreams And Then Meeting His beautiful Wife''. Need I Say More? The verses are used to point out the ironic situations of life, whereas the chorus is packed with anger and frustation. ''Hand In My Pocket'' showcases Alanis fondness for checky lyrics. The contradinting lyrics are rather strange at times, however it works extremely well with the melody. It still remains one of my favourite Alanis Morissette songs ever. <br />''You Learn'' and ''Head Over Feet'' gave the public a different perspect of the now branded angst-ridden woman. ''You Learn'' had a less agressive sound to it and the message of essential feeling we all deal with thoughout life. We laugh, we cry, yet we continue to learn and devople. ''Head Over Feet'' is a statement of love to a lover. Perhaps to show Alanis' tender side, it was choosen as a single release. I still think there are better songs on the album than ''Head Over Feet'', however the need for diversity, in terms of subjects, are understandable. <br />In terms of non-single releases ''Right Through You'' is among my favourites on ''Jagged Little Pill''. It could easily have been a single and enjoyed success as well. It's quite an underrated gem, I believe Alanis played it on tour as well and it was an instant crowd pleaser. Alanis also displays other subjects on ''Jagged Little Pill''. From ''Perfect'' to ''Mary Jane'', the album contains more ''bashing'' the male species. ''Perfect'' is a mid-tempo rock ballad of being ''Perfect''. It's sung to a boy/girl by a parent. Sure the subject is interesting though I think it's one of the weaker offerings as I don't really care for the melody and Alanis' vocals. <br />People tend to complain of the Alanis' weak voice, however the hidden bonus track ''Your House'' (?) displays the need for a powerful voice isn't always needed to make a statement. Simplicity is the key factor. It just consits of Alanis and her voice. ''Forgiven'', ''Mary Jane'', ''Not TheDoctor'' and ''Wake Up'' are good offerings as well, however the ones, mention above, are undenialable my choices of the best songs on ''Jagged Little Pill''. An ''alternative version'' of ''You Oughta Know'' is also found on the album, however it doesn't differ much for the original version. The point of adding it to the album still hasn't dawned upon me, so I will leave it as that.<br />So what is it about ''Jagged Little Pill'' that had/has an entire generation of teenagers captivate? Alanis Morissette was able to tap into the minds of teenagers around the globe with an album, consisitong of enjoyable ''rock'' songs. The subjects are universal and perhaps that explains one of the main reasons why the album is still relevant. Melody-wise and lyrically you will surely be able to find albums that are stronger, however ''Jagged Little Pill'' will always remain a favourite of mine. It basically defined the mid 90's of my life and perhaps that is the reason why I keep going back and listening to it.<br />Since the release of ''Jagged Little Pill'', Alanis Morissette has released two studio album ''Supposed Former Infaution Junkie'' and ''Under Rug Swept. Yet ''Jagged Little Pill'' is still her most talked about and it's still my favourite Alanis Morissette album as well though with her third ablum release on the way, perhaps Alanis Morissette might surprise me. ''Jagged Little Pill'' is a must-have in every record collection, so go get it.<br />Overall Rate: 9.8/10

B00005JM0B|1.0|Seriously, my only real complaint with this movie is the special effects. T2 was made over 10 years ago, and still looks like one of the best FX jobs on the plannet. Ever. I thought at least for T3 they'd have realized this high standard and tried to compete with it. Through the whole move I was flinching from the half-assed production. I'm thinking that most of the $170+ million, or whatever it was, went to Arnie. So they turned post production over to the local computer club, gave them $50, and said &quot;Please make this look decent. It's all the money we have!&quot;<BR>Enough ranting I guess, the rest of the movie is decent, and even slightly unpredictable. You can see influences from the other Terminator movies, and from other movies that this mutha would be competing with. Still... digital effects (especially crummy ones) can't save a movie.
B000002C1V|3.0|This is a good album, in my opinion, but it is also proof of how controlling Waters was in the group at this time - and for this reason I cannot listen to it.  If Gilmour was actively involved in this album, it might have been one of their best!   Who knows?  Sorry, I can't agree with other reviewers that this album is crap, BUT I will say this......It is a spec of what it could have been with Gilmour's participation.  Without Waters, Gilmour could have lead the group in a totally different direction and made Floyd into something even more phenominal (again, just my opinion).  I support David Gilmour more than any other musician!
B000002NFM|5.0|This is absolutely the best album that I own!  I frequently use this CD when I lift weights and work out--it really pumps you up with the deep bass--it rocks!
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Who can describe this movie as \\"boring\\"?  Perhaps someone whose lips move when they read, which would certainly preclude reading O'Brien's first class novels (or most anything meaningful, for that matter).  I have the same reaction to a \\"boring\\" rating as I had in the theater when people covered their eyes during some of the more graphic scenes.  You didn't read the books, did you?  If you did, you would know what to expect and appreciate the quality of this depiction.  While it is possible to \\"get it\\" if you don't read these books, you do have to have some appreciation for better literature, or at least better films.  I am, obviously, a huge O'Brien fan, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the depiction of Aubrey and Maturin by Russell Crowe and Paul Brittany.  I initially thought Brittany was too young, but he really nailed the Maturin spirit.  Whether he will pull it off as not just the ship's surgeon and a dedicated naturalist, but also a British spy, in the (hoped for) sequels, we'll see.  (And Jennifer Connolly as Maturin's Diana, hmmm).  The remainder of the crew is outstanding, particularly Killick and the young Mr. Blakeney, who, despite losing his arm early on, completely embodies the fighting spirit of Aubrey, and, of course, Nelson himself.<BR>Boring?  Damn your eyes!  Beautifully played and scrupulously detailed?  A glass of wine with you, sir!  There is a spot reserved on my shelf next to 22 O'Brien novels (including 2 prequels) for this excellent DVD.
0783225849|3.0|Psycho is the only Alfred Hitchcock film that I have ever seen.  I have heard that all of his movies are great.  If his other films are like Psycho I am not impressed.<BR> <BR>Psycho starts out with Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) with her lover Sam Loomis (played by John Cavin).  This scene talks about the one thing that is keeping them apart, money problems.  The scene is also introduces the two characters.  After that scene is over Marion is at work.  A client comes and Marion's boss eventually tells her to put the client's $40,000 into a safe deposit box.  She says that she has a headache and that she will go home but put the money in the safe deposit box first.  This money is the reason she runs.  She does not put it in the safe deposit box, she steals it.  The rest of the film is about finding her and the money.<br />The script is alright.  All scripts can always be improved.  I thought that everything that happened was predictable.  That is just how I saw it.  If I look at the film from a different point of view I can see the suspense in it.  You can try to figure out what will happen next because there are a few possibilities.  The family and lover of Marion never know what really happens to her.  In the end the audience does not know what happens after the truth comes out.  It just ends.  <br />The film works with shadows well.  One of the main characters, Norman Bates (played by Anthony Perkins), always seems to be in the dark.  When you watch the film you wonder why he is in the dark.  Marion is often in the light.  She commits the crime but she never goes into the dark.  This shows how Hitchcock wants you to think about the light and dark and how it relates to the characters.  <br />At first I thought the acting could have been done by anyone.  In 1998 Psycho was remade.  I thought the acting of Vince Vaughn (playing Norman Bates) and Anne Heche (playing Marion Crane) was horrible.  They could not even come close to a good comparison of Perkins andLeigh.  Perkins and Leigh had amazing chemistry on-screen which is great.  Perkins is skillful at being a nice person who appears to have no problems.  He also does an outstanding job at switching his personality throughout the film.  After the movie is over his creepiness sticks with you. The whole time I was watching Vaughn do Norman Bates I was thinking this guy is weird.  He does not bring the same level of acting as Perkins did.  Heche also does a bad job.  She does not have the same talent as Leigh did in the role of Marion.  To me she did not appear to be as confident in the role as Leigh was.  I believe that maybe during the shooting of the film Heche was thinking exactly what I was thinking about her playing in Psycho, what in the world am I doing here.  Leigh portrays Marion as being nervous and on the edge the whole time.  Throughout the film Marion is a nice person even though she has committed a crime.  You would never think that a person like Marion would do anything wrong.<br />The famous shower scene is good for its time.  It is more of a classy scene than a bloody mess like many of the films today.  It shows more after the murder than most films do.  In more modern films the scenes are more like die, die, die, and then on to the next victim.  This one shows a cover-up and how to possibly get away with murder.<br />Today, Psycho is still loved by many.  It is a movie that will always give it's audience a thrilling feeling.  When Hitchcock made this movie it paved the way for all of the other thriller movies to come.  Every thriller movie that is made will always be compared to Psycho.  I do not think that this was the greatest movie ever but I do appreciate it for what it has done to the film industry.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is a milestone for soundgarden and it's brealthrough cd. Outshined got a lot of play. The cd is diverse, however. Holy water not quite as heavy but relies on the lyrics to pull it through. Mind Riot is another favorite not as heavy as the rest but I really like it. The only song I don't like is face pollution, but the rest of the cd is a breakthrough for the group.
B00003CXSP|5.0|The title ought to say it all.  I was extremely impressed by the attention paid to the DVD (as another reviewer mentioned) by MGM - it's nearly flawless.  Some parts of the film are deviant - even grossly disgusting - but that's the point.  Hannibal is a diseased individual, and excessive gore is how the depiction of the character's mental state was achieved.  I thought this visual representation was done quite well, even if it was just a crutch primarily reinforcing the merely acceptable screenplay/writing.  The entire film is shot with a sort of dark, decrepit elegance and the musical score is brilliant - one of the reasons that I gave the movie all five stars. <br />Not a perfect film by any means.  But I certainly enjoyed it.
B00000K31V|3.0|Baaaaad script, but weird enough to keep you going.  A little scattered and with large pieces that are needed to understand what's what missing from the film entirely.  Still, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Willem Defoe, make it worth watching.  Good actors are worth their weight in gold ... or at least in bad scripts.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|This whole musical (opera technically, I believe) is absolutely wonderful, so I'd recommend getting the complete recording or especially the DVD, but this has some of the good songs, though definitely not all. Most of the voices are amazing and definitely perfect for the part, except for Noa. I feel that Helene Segara does a much better job singing Esmeralda's part. I suppose Noa's voice is okay if you like that type of singing, but I don't. That aside, she doesn't sound like the young, hopelessly in love girl that Esmeralda is. She sounds much too old and I don't get much emotion from her voice. <BR>   That's pretty much the only dark spot on this CD-- The music is beautiful, most of the singing is superb. I'd recommend getting it even if you don't speak French, because something is lost in the English translation, really.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|This DVD IS FANtastic! Buble does for live performance what HagenDas did for ice cream - takes it to the next (and highest) level. It's incredible to think this man can sound as good live as recorded - talent with a captital T. <BR>    The behind the scenes footage gives us a glimpse of a real genuinely nice guy with a love and respect for the music he sings. I was taken by his smile and candor. Family, work ethic and great music are his loves. Bravo! Bravo!  <BR>For all around entertainment value, this is one DVD to add to your 'most watched' collection. <BR>The cd that accompanied the dvd is great - love My Funny Valentine - my only wish is that it was 100 songs long.
0385510438|4.0|Grisham's latest book is suspenseful and filled with memorable characters.  Unlike his other legal thrillers, this one only has a few court scenes.  It is about Willie Traynor, a college dropout who buys a local newspaper.  A terrible murder occurs in the town and Willie covers it in his newspaper.  The murderer threatens to seek revenge on the jury that convicts him.  The plot continues as Padgitt, the murderer is released from prison.  The jurors begin to die, one by one.  Overall, this novel is adequate, but not nearly as exciting or intriguing as Grisham's early works.  The unique characters such as Miss Callie, and her family make the novel worthwhile.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I really like the album a lot and am a huge GNR fan, but they left out one big piece that kinda ruined this album for me. Where is &quot;Estranged&quot;? It is probably one of their top 3 songs and it isn't on here.......it might even be their best song. Where is it? Also where is Mr. Brownstone?
0446310786|5.0|WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT THE BOOK BEFORE READING IT<br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; - the title of this book well-known and spread over nearly the whole world sounds unspectacular, perhaps even not very sympathic because including the two words &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, what, when having this words connected in that way, sounds as if the book was about killing some birds. That, of course, isn't the most-liked topic of many readers. <br />And even if you knew what the book was about, you wouldn't just buy or read it. We all know the theme the book deals with is an old theme. A theme that has been covered in many books before, in many films before: The book covers a dark - litterally dark -chapter of American history: The fight Black aainst White. Nothing new, in so far.<br />REALITY<br />You might think so. But: Reality runs another way. The book is only great. I don't really know to describe why, but you can surely call it &quot;history alive !!!&quot; It's not an ordinary history-book as you can get them on each corner, in different layouts and written by different authors, but with the same content again and again and again and....<BR>This book is a story-telling book, but besides it informates. Not many authors get this contrasts together, Harper Jane Lee does. My problem is that I don't know why. Perhaps there are this great characters of Scout and the family, this Atticus-Finch-character, a character we would like to find in some of our politicians sometimes. But there can't be only the characters making this book so great.<br />Maybe there is this town of Maycomb: Harper Lee creates a whole town with all it's problems and advantages, with houses and many citizens that, even if they only appear for a short time, are described so detailled that they seem to live.<br />READ IT!<br />At all, I just can say the book made me angry. It didn't make me angry because it was bad, it was very good, but during reading it, I had to change my mind - and I don't like being forced to cange my mind. At the beginning I thought &quot;Oh no, again a book about blacks and whites&quot; but it is more than that, it's nearly, oh, nonsense, it IS a perfect book. But you have to read it because to understand why, I at least am not able to describe the reason in a proper way. So: READ IT !!!!
0385504209|4.0|This novel relies heavily on facts to complement the fictional plot.  The reader can tell that the author is very informed on the subject matter, which is a refreshing discovery.  However, some of the plot progressions seem a little too linear and \\"Hardy Boys-esque.\\"  If one should decide to read this book, he or she will not find much of the happenings surprising, yet the author manages to maintain the reader's attention.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys learning about historical occurrences, while not really having one's brain overworked.  All-in-all, I would say this book is an outstanding contemporary piece of literature that will be read and enjoyed for years to come.
0446677450|3.0|This book could be dangerous to people who are easily inspired and have more determination than ability.  The author could actually pump up some people too much and cause them to do something foolish with their money.<BR>   To motivate the reader to go out there and make money the author tells about how he did it.  His money-making deals are incredibly successful and apparently accomplished with relative ease.  Readers who lack experience may get the wrong impression that great profits are easy to grasp only if you stop being lazy.<BR>   On page 190 the author relates a short story about a neighbor who bought a condo for $100,000 and the author bought an identical condo for $50,000.  This is fantastic, all in nice round numbers, and he got an apparent bargain for exactly 50% less.  This is the way to get rich.  Most people would love to make a buy like this.  (This is assuming the neighbor did not pay two times too much and real market value of the condo is only $50,000.)  But the author does not provide us with any details on how he managed to pull off this great deal.  What were his negotiating techniques?  What was the real estate market like?  What was the location?  Was the seller desperate, ignorant or stupid?  I have purchased eight condos myself and never managed to get a deal like that.  I know dozens of people who have bought condos and none are in that league.  We would all like to learn how to be like Mr. Kiyosaki but he does not give us any lessons learned on the details that really count.  On page 177 there is another example of a condo he bought for $50,000.  (I wonder why I can't ever buy a condo for such a nice round number?)  Wow!  Cynical/skeptical people may suspect some of his stories are partly or completely fictional!  But again, we are not told where, when and how he did it in detail that would be instructive.  Was it easy or difficult to do?  Could the average middle-class person do it?  Can the average middle-class person start thinking bigand acting like the founder of McDonald's (or Bill Gates) as he urges us to do?  <BR>   On page 81 the author states, &quot;The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets.&quot;  Is that not an insult to the greatest middle-class in the greatest country in the world? -- unless he has solidly researched data to support such a sweeping allegation.  If the intended audience of this book is the middle-class, and they are as ignorant as Mr. Kiyosaki thinks they are, I don't think this book will help get them from here to there.  The book has a lot of inspiration but is lacking essential, detailed &quot;how-to&quot; steps.  There is no detailed discussion on how to avoid the dangerous pitfalls along the way.  His answer is too simple: you just do it successfully like Mr. Kiyosaki and just learn to manage the risk.  There should have been more instruction/discussion on how to manage the great risk involved.<BR>   I only recommend this book for those people who can take it with a grain of salt.  I subtract one star for the lack of detailed guidance and another star for the insult delivered to the entire American middle-class.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is about a man who is very different from everybody else, but doesn't know it. He has nothing to say to anybody, and nobody to tells him anything. Then he finds himself in a difficult situation he can't get out of. The world is against him, and he's on his own.<br />I enjoyed this book, The Stranger because I believe that everybody deserves to get a second chance. And in this book, the author tells how harsh the world can be. I liked how the author put the story so well, and how he set the scene.<br />I also liked how the author set-up the characters, for example Meursault: he has his life the way he wants it to live, and how society can destroy it. Also how the author set up the whole plot from start to finish. I really believe that The Stranger is a really good book indeed.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|This movie is an aboslute favorate of mine. The actors in it are all fantastic, and I like the way the screenwriter left out some parts. I have read the book, and it is fantastic, but there are some parts in it that I skipped because they were so boring, and the screen writer left out those exact parts. I recommend this to everyone.
0140187537|5.0|Steinbeck had this book in a different fashion than I found the many others I read of his.  I have always found him to be a literary god at creating character clashes (in each and every other of his I read).  I loved how he had the characters interact.  Althuogh this book was different.  It was changed in that one character clashed with himself as much as everyone else&#8230; I was expecting maybe a lower personal ranking to his other books, but I found it just as good, and literally beautifully written.  The book not only is fun to read (and im not that much of a reader) but I found its moral lesson very agreeable and useful to societies commonly immoral business habits.<br />i suggest it to be read... though sometimes hard for some of us non readers to keep up with such deep thought, it is none the less a great read and understandable...
B000002G7G|4.0|The Velvet Underground was the followup to their second album, the excellent White Light/White Heat. While that album was almost completely dominated by loud and noisy tracks, with many played with reckless abandon, this album is almost the complete opposite. This is also the first album the band recorded without John Cale and his vocals and musicianship, particularly his viola playing, are certainly missed here. With Cale's departure, Lou Reed claimed nearly total control of the band and many of the tracks here point to much of the introspective work he'd perform in his solo career.<br /><br />Having said that, this is still a very strong album. Many of the tracks here are calm and soothing and the harder rocking songs have much more restraint than on their previous releases. The opening track \\"Candy Says\\" is the band at their most mellow and Doug Yule's soft vocals add to the mood. Other softer tracks such as \\"Jesus\\", \\"I'm Set Free\\",  and \\"That's The Story Of My Life\\" are also very strong. \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" is probably the best track here and one of the best ballads that Reed has ever recorded. Listening to these tracks, particularly the excellent harmonizing on \\"Jesus\\" and Reed's emotional vocals on \\"I'm Set Free\\", it's hard to believe this is the same band that recorded \\"Heroin\\" and \\"White Light/White Heat.\\" The  tracks \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Beginning To See The Light\\" are both strong rockers and the guitar sound here points to much of the music that dominated college radio in the 1980's. The only track which hints at the chaos of their previous releases is \\"The Murder Mystery\\" which combines Reed and  Sterling Morrison's spoken vocals on the verse with Yule and Maureen Tucker's softer vocals handling the chorus. Other tracks here include the folky \\"After Hours\\" sung by Tucker and \\"Some Kinda Love\\" which sounds very much like Reed's solo stuff from the early-80's. Although this isn't top notch like their first two albums, this is still worth checking out. Definitely a great album to chill out to.t album to chill out to.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|I see that alot of &quot;fans&quot; are accusing Axl of trying to cash in on this one when the truth is he, as well as others associated with the once mighty G N' R, were opposed to it's release. Axl was &quot;concerned&quot; it would interfere with &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. I promised myself I wasn't going to bash Mr. Rose, so true to my word, I have no opinion on his opinion. What I do have an opinion on is this so-called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD. First off, by including 5 [!] cover songs on this, just whose &quot;greatest hits&quot; was Geffen trying to sell? First things first, NOTHING from &quot;The Spaghetti Incident&quot; belongs here, and trust me, I'm w-a-a-a-y more into punk than hard rock, so that's not the reason I feel this way. The bottom line is, &quot;The Spaghetti Incident&quot; just wasn't that good. Nor was the ENTIRE &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; project as a WHOLE. Combine all the great songs from both UYI albums &amp; you'd have a masterpiece, but as a &quot;double album&quot;, there's just way too much, er, filler. As for the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, how on Earth do you not include &quot;Estranged&quot;? [Easily could &amp; should have omitted &quot;Ain't It Fun&quot; &amp; &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot; and it would've fit within the 79 minutes] &quot;One In A Million&quot; &amp; &quot;Used To Love Her&quot; are both notably absent as well, and so are any of the songs from &quot;Appetite&quot; that didn't have accompanying videos. The remastering has done wonders for the sound, which only makes me think Geffen would have been better off re-releasing remastered editions [with rare stuff that I'm sure exists] of Appetite, Lies, and both UYI. I know I would've bought all of 'em. And as much as &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; may suck, THERE IS NO DENYING WHAT THIS BAND ONCE WAS. UNFORTUNATELY, MUCH LIKE AEROSMITH, VAN HALEN, AND NOW METALLICA, THERE IS ALSO NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME, EITHER.

Her father Atticus is a lawyer and he defends a black man who is blamed for raping a white girl although he is innocent, but the whole town is full of racism and against the black man and his lawyer. <br />The story is told in a realistic and detailed way so that the beginning of the story is difficult to understand and not very interesting. But later you get a part of the book and it is easier to understand. The novel gets very interesting and is a fascinating new part of the anti-racism literature.
0385336810|3.0|I was eagerly anticipating Sophie Kinsella's &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; after greatly enjoying all 3 books in the Shopaholic series.  However, this new novel did not meet my expectations.  While there were a few parts that made me smile or laugh out loud, overall, I thought the book was a flop.  As another reviewer stated, Emma does just not have the charm of Shopaholic's Becky Bloomfield.  And yet, in so many ways, Emma seems to just be a watered down version of lovable Becky....rather than being her own person.  It's like she's Becky, but without Becky's wit and personality and charm and spark.  It just seemed as I kept reading the book that it was following the SAME format of Shopaholic....and while some parts were quite humorous, this novel just didn't have the charm.  Instead of the romance with Luke the boss, it was the romance with Jack the boss; instead of Becky's cute parents, it was simply a less warm version of parents; instead of annoyingly successful next door neighbor Tom, it was annoyingly successful  cousin Kerry; instead of annoying co-worker Claire Evans, it was annoying co-worker Armetris; instead of sweet, ditzy, supportive flatmate Suzie, it was sweet, smart, supportive flatmate Lissie....and so on.  Throw in a little more spunk, and this very well could have been another story about Becky.  I just wasn't all that impressed with this book.  And the BIG secret was pretty lame.

0714843377|3.0|This book is packed with wisdom and insights on how to succeed in any creative based business. It will inspire you and push you to heights you never knew you can reach However, the way it is written/presented makes it one of tthe greatest rip-offs of the year. It is basically a collection of one liners and phrases. Not that what's written are rubbish (it is very helpful) but some are obvious common sense. It is a very quick read, I managed to read the WHOLE book in a bookstore while standing. This where I balk at recommending this book for purchase. Borrow it from someone or wait when for it in the bargain bin or used books section because spending for the cover price is not worth the content.
B00000JKH2|5.0|From the first time i heard this album, I was hooked on At the Drive-In.  This album is solid from start to finish, a favorite for many including myself.  &quot;Metronome Arthritis&quot; instantly became one of my favorite songs and the others, especially &quot;198d,&quot; are among the best I've ever heard.  This album presents sonic landscapes that are in many ways unparalleled.  While I love their other albums, &quot;Vaya&quot; separates itself as the best.
B000002MFE|5.0|I am going to approach this review from what 'I' experienced through it, and not what I think YOU will experience!!<br />What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Everyone loves it for their own reasons, and if you're anything like me, you've been completely moved by it on either an emotional or entertaining level. This is just one of those albums that anyone who listens to it can never say they DIDN'T like it.<br />13--I was just beginning to play bass, piano, and guitar. I'd already known how to play drums for years. I had been listening to Rock music from the 70's and had been an absolute BEATLE freak. When a friend of mine let me borrow his 'Unplugged' CD, I was hesitant because I'd never really heard of Clapton before, but I accepted it. I took it home, put it on, and though I'd never listened to music like that before, I immediately loved it! See, (...)This was just so fresh to me, and I loved it from the start. I literally listened to it from start to finish!<br />What struck me immediately was the overall 'emotion' the album put out. From the lyrics straight through to every single note each musician played, it just seemed to connect with me. I didn't know what it was that I was getting out of the album then, but I knew I felt something special back then..<br />23--When I revert back to this album today, I still get the same feelings about it that I did back then. But now that I'm 10 years older and am a skilled musician, I am still blown away by the instrumentation on the album. Each musician plays with so much fun and emotion that you always hear something new when you put the cd on.<br />Take it from a plain ole' fan. I love it, it's stylings are limitless, and even though it's a live album, the overall 'production' is even better than most of Claptons studio output (especially his seventies works).<br />You will not be dissapointed. Try it out, and you'll see what I mean.<br />All The Best, -AndyMan-
0553573403|5.0|I've never before written a review on Amazon.com, but I couldn't in good conscience allow the review below to remain on top without answer.<br />It's true that in A Song of Ice and Fire, you won't find clearly delineated heroes and villains.  It is not a fairy tale, like most fantasy.  It is more historical fiction, set in an alternate world.  There is actually relatively little 'fantasy' in it, in terms of magic and wizards and other things traditionally included in the genre.<br />I find the statement that the motivations of the characters in ASoIaF are less real than the ones in other fantasy laughable.  All I can say is, since reading A Song of Ice and Fire, I've been unable to read any other fantasy, so apparently the 'moral ambiguity' strikes more of a chord with me than the fairy tale fantasy that I read when I was younger and the below reviewer seeks.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I had to buy this CD/DVD when it first came out because I had watched Michael Buble on many talk shows in the past couple of weeks. It definitely didn't disappoint. He adds some lesser known songs to this album; ones that are sure to become favorites. His voice is smooth and simply amazing. This man has talent beyond any of his contemporaries and should go far releasing albums like this one. Buy it, sit back, and enjoy some sincerely amazing sounds.
0767830555|1.0|Overrated piece of !@#$.  Absolutely NOTHING happens in this movie other than being forced to listen to the same incredibly cheesy music over and over and over again.  After an hour and a half of wondering if anything is ever going to happen, DeNiro shoots a couple people.  The end.  Wow.  What was all the hype about?  Genius?  Artsy?  I don't see it.  Don't waste your time.  Is this movie highly rated for any other reason than being one of DeNiro's earlier films?<br /><br />I rented this movie because I saw it on a program \\"The 100 most thrilling movies of all time\\".  What a joke.  I'm sorry I wasted the $3.50 to rent the DVD.<br /><br />If this is movie is considered to be a \\"classic\\", then certainly it's true that nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.  Okay, let the \\"not helpful\\" reviews flow..
B000062X9B|5.0|I was not a Johnny Cash fan, but this album is outstanding.
038572179X|2.0|\\"Atonement\\" has two distinct parts: The first, and more successful, covers one summer day in rural England in 1935 where a certain tragedy unfolds. Descriptions of the characters are excellent: Briony, the youngest daughter - a late arrival to her parents, and a combination of spoiled and neglected child inhabiting her own fantasy world; the upper-class English family and its open and hidden frustrations and tensions; Cecilia, the daughter who is returning from college and who becomes a mother surrogate for the Briony.  This part of the book builds up the tension to a crime of which Robbie, the man Cecilia is in love with, is accused.<BR>In the second part, the book begins to drag:  set five years later in World War II, Robbie is at the front in France.  Although this part describes Robbie's shattering and brutal journey to Dunkirk, it is incidental to the plot and rather monotonous.  Meanwhile, Briony, to assuage her guilt for blaming Robbie rather than the real perpetrator in a false testimony, has decided to train as a nurse in London. <BR>An epilogue is set 55 years later in which Briony reflects on her life.  Don't we all?  I found the entire work a difficult read. . .but then, I sit comfortably with my guilt.  In any event, it is too late, I fear, to recapture the readers' interest.
B00005JKC3|3.0|ON THE BAD SIDE:<BR>The story takes long to develop.<BR>You might have to watch it twice to get a few details.<BR>The scene where they make a gross attempt to speak Spanish was embarrasing. It was as close to real Spanish, as the TexMex food is to real Mexican food.<BR>Sometimes you end up wondering whether you're watching Hulk or Superman, 'cause now he can fly.<br />ON THE GOOD SIDE:<BR>-Once the story develops it gets entertaining for a big while<BR>-The scene of the fight with the dogs was great. That by itself makes it worth to rent the movie.<BR>-The main 3 actors do act very well.<br />TO SUMMARIZE:<BR>I did have fun watching this movie. I recommend you rent it, but I really sugest you don't buy it, unless you are collecting all of these &quot;comics&quot; movies.
0679428895|4.0|A fascinating look at the ancient city of Pompeii, but it seemed rather dull at times.  I learned more than I ever wanted to know about Rome's aqueduct system.  One would think the eruption of Vesuvius would merit more than just a glancing treatment.  Somewhat disappointing, but still a good read.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is the best CD on earth! I love the songs on the album, they have beautiful lyrics and melodies. Lena and Yulia's voices are great as well! <br />1. Not gonna get us - great song, great drums and good lyrics 5/5<br />2. All the thing she said - this is a classic, great guitars and catchy melody, i became instantly addicted! 5/5<br />3. Show me love - this song rocks, it's got a fab beat and the girls sound great on this song! 5/5<br />4. 30 minutes - a beautiful ballad, the haunting laughs and the bomb ticking adds a haunting atmosphere to the song. I like! 4/5<br />5. How soon is now? - a song with a great rock-ish sound to it, Yulia stands out in this song! 5/5<br />6. Clowns(can you see me now?) - this is a beautiful song, the lyrics and melody are both brilliant, the piano instrumental bit makes the song something special. 5/5<br />7. Malchik Gay - the acoustic guitars on this songs gives a somewhat relaxed effect. I love it! the lyrics are cool too! 5/5<br />8. Stars - This song is amazingly beautiful, a mix between english and russian. Lena sings in english and yulia raps in russian! It gives a very nice atmosphere to the room u are listening this song in. Lena shines on this song! 5/5<br />9. Ya Shosla S Uma - Russian version of All the things she said, both girls seem to feel more at home singing in their mother tongue. i love both versions! 5/5<br />10. Nas Ne Dagoniat - Russian version of Not gonna get us, the russian verses sound so beautiful! I love this! 5/5<br />11. Show me love (extended verson) - I actually like the extended version better than original, the reason is because of the guitars at the beginning of the song. It gives a rock-ish sound to the song. full of energy! i like! 5/5<br />about their lesbian image, who cares? we're listening to their music not just looking at them! make the right decision and buy this CD!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I think Lucas has lost touch with his fan base. There needs to be a choice between \\"Original\\" or \\"Special\\" included in this release. Like Speilberg did with E.T. - include BOTH versions. DUH!
B00006GFAB|4.0|Awsome, that's all I can really say obout this band.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This movie was made for dvd with the heart pounding musical score to the great sounds of the light saber battles and laser shots. I had a friend who hasn't seen any of the 5 movies and she asked should she see the movies in order, the answer is a resounding NO!!  Star Wars - A new hope is the reason we all wore chewy t-shirts and c3po lunch boxes...A true fantasy of good vs evil with wonderfully developed characters.  I believe the stregnth of this movie is due to our ability to be these characters..that is what is lacking in most movies these days...It was a fantasy that I and You and everyone can relate too...We did relate to these characters so we didn't just watch, we were right along with them for the ride of our lives.
B00003CXCT|4.0|won't be available until Tuesday, 12:00 am, September 21, 2004<br />and will probably be the number one selling DVD of all time and it won't even be the original theatrical release<br />its going to be the revised 'crappy' Special Edition with the 'inserted' new scenes and special effects<br />(...)<br />I wonder how many nuts are going to wait in line Monday night to buy the DVD. (I wonder how many of you are going to wait in line. Don't deny it. We know who you are.)
B0000DD7LB|1.0|In The Zone is a very poor cd indeed with little to no substance. Her voice sounds like mickey mouse on helium !  Britney Spears as a singer has no talent.She has no credibility and I find her image very tired and boring. She isn't bright and her looks have gone down the proverbial drain. She is utterly useless and quite forgettable. In five years from now she will still be trying to find herself but she will no longer have a recording contract.  I for one look forward to that day as do countless others.    See ya Britney, your 15 minutes of fame look to be close at hand!!!!
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is an excellent album and one of its best songs -- &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad -- is featured on a new documentary film &quot;Peaceable Kingdom&quot; by the production company Tribeofheart.org.  This song makes the documentary especially moving; any fan of Moby should see this and be moved. Amazon sells their other film, &quot;The Witness&quot; so I suppose will start selling their new film sometime soon. In the meantime, a preview is available on their webpage.  Check it out.
B000003CMB|5.0|No other band or group of musicians will ever come close to accomplishing what Greg,Duane,Dickey,Johhany,Butch and Berry did at the Fillmore east in 71. These live performances embody what band should sound like, but never does.  They were not a rock or a blues band during these two performances, they were something above and beyond what words can describe.  These two performances placed Duane Allman as one of the greatest guitarist ever.  His slide work is second to none, and his beatifull leads in tracks like &quot;in memory of Elizibeth Reed, Whipping post, Hot'lanta, and Mountain Jam&quot; are melodicly some of the most breathtaking sounds I have ever heard.  Dicky Betts also was at the height of his playing during these sessions.  This was the best guitar duo ever in my book.  These two guitarists were such compliments of each other.  Dicky's leads were wild and melodic, while Duanes were wild and untamed.  Duanes leads always took the song in a new direction, I think that is what made him so great.  Each of them could play rhthym as well.  Listen to Duane's rhthym part in &quot;whipping post,&quot; he is improvising while playing rhthym, it is beautifull.  The harmony between these two guitarists is something that you will never hear again.    <BR>Oakley and the two drummers re-define the meaning of rhthym.  Simpily stunning.  Hot'lanta is a piece that has a structured melody, but the rhthym section freely improvising. This song clearly demonsrates the virtuosity of Berry Oakly, Butch Trucks and Johhany Johnson.  The most appealing song to many people is the rendition of &quot;in memory of elizibeth reed.&quot;  The song in general is beautifull, but at the Fillmore it brought on a completely new sound.  For one, the band does not make a mistake throughout the complete 14 minutes of the song.  NOT ONE!  I have listened to it more times than I can count, and this piece is flawless.  There are more flaws in the studio recording than there are in this one, by far.  On top of that, the solo work is phenomenol and the rhthym section doesn't miss a beat.  To really grasp how great this song is you have to listen to it twice, once listenting to dicky, greg and duane, and a second time listening to berry, johanny and butch.  Berry especially.  This song really displays Dicky Betts' composing ability.  I would pay an arm and a leg just to have this song in my collection, let alone the whole album.  This is the best sounding band I have ever heard.  If you are a jazz fan, this album is the Rock/blues equivilent of Miles Davis' album &quot;Kind of Blue.&quot;  It's a must have
B000002UAU|3.0|The best album of all time?  This wasn't even the best album of 1967.
6301008960|5.0|un film super et j aimerai savoir si on peut trouver le dvd du film cant by me love en francais merci
B000002UZ1|2.0|Probably the worst Beatles compilation ever....compiled.<br />While the red album, focusing on the 1962-66 period is good except for some of the Revolver songs, this album focuses on the manufactured Sgt. Pepper / Magical Mystery Tour studio fare done in 1967, plus some of the bright spots thereafter.  The red album, past masters, and even Beatles 1 are better.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee has an amazingly clear and beautiful voice, and the band backs her up well. It's very rare to find a good rock band who has a female lead singer. The song that compelled me to buy this cd was Bring Me to Life, but once I had listened to the rest of it, I couldn't help but listen to it all of the time. And i mean all of the time: going to bed, waking up, eating breakfast, on the way to school, during school... I had first found Evanescence because I listen to Linkin park, and my friends recommended them. I definitly recommend Evanescence if you like Linkin Park, or even if you don't
B00009P1O0|5.0|&quot;On the Beach&quot; chronicles a long trip gone bad.  It's a moody, reflective album that closes with three songs that prove that even a Canuck can sing the blues.  The playing gives new meaning to the term laid-back.  More like up-ended.  Despite the jaunty opener &quot;Walk On&quot; and the gloriously demented &quot;Revolution Blues,&quot; where Young adopts the persona of old acquaintance Charlie Manson, the overall feel is one of resignation.  &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; features some of Young's finest lyrical turns.  &quot;All along the Navajo Trail,&quot; he wearily sings, &quot;Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails.&quot;  It's a chilling line, a version of American history in a single phrase: one culture displaces another and then leaves its debris, some of it human, to defile sacred ground.  To the death scene of sixties idealism an &quot;ambulance can only go so fast.&quot;  Help may be on the way, but it will arrive too late.  On the cover, a bootless Young turns his back on the wasteland and gazes out to sea, his vintage sled submerged in sand.  Give it up Dorothy, the album seems to say, there's no way home.
0385335482|5.0|I loved reading this book so much, I didn't want it to end.  I really felt like Rebecca Bloomwood was just like me - I couldnt believe it - finally someone else who has a serious shopping addiction!  This book had me laughing out loud at almost every single page.  The writing style sucked me right in and I felt like I was over-spending right along with her.  If you've ever had something that you just had to have, or lied to yourself just a little bit about what you could afford - you will relate to this character so much.  She's real, she's funny, she's passionate and I loved her!!
B000002TQV|5.0|With out a doubt , the best album of their career and the 1990's.   Sorry Courtney, Sorry Kurt, Sorry Polly, Sorry Margot and brother, nothing even comes close to this.  Not even OK Computer
014028009X|5.0|I love her.  Need I say more?  She's the most amazing female heroine in a modern day chick-lit book.  Read it - you'll love her too, how could you not?
B00005JLXE|3.0|First of all, I'm a little disappointed with this movie... Scratch that... I was completely disappointed with it...  The Origin was NOT accurate with the comic book, as Daredevil lost his sight saving an old man from a truck in the comic books.  Additionally, his father's name and boxing nickname was &quot;Battling&quot; Jack Murdock, not &quot;the devil.&quot;  Daredevil's nickname came from the neighborhood kids who used to call him that MOCKINGLY because he was such a frightened, timid little kid.<br />Also, there was little to no mention of Karen Page, Daredevil's secretary and original love interest, Elektra wasn't originally murdered because of her father's involvement with the Kingpin, but really because of her own (Bullseye wanted revenge from her for taking his job as Kingpin's #1 assassin).<br />Now, for the positives.  I hate Ben Affleck movies, in general, but his attempt to portray Daredevil was fantastic.  The lighting and mood of the movie were good, and the subtle little items were good, such as the use of Classic Daredevil (and/or marvel) creators as character names in the movie (bendis, mack, quesada, Kirby, etc), and the cameos of Daredevil writers Kevin Smith, Stan &quot;the Man&quot; Lee, and Frank Miller (watch the scene where Bullseye steals a motorcycle, but don't blink... you'll miss him).<br />The other little details are also great... Foggy was cast perfectly, and I'll admit that Jennifer Garner IS good with the Sais, even though I don't think I like her as Elektra.  <br />Overall, this movie makes me think they treated it with the &quot;second-tier Spiderman&quot; treatment, in that it's a very similar style of adaptation, and less believable then the Spiderman movie.  I'm not completely disappointed by it (I bought it and haven't put it up for sale on Amazon or Ebay), but wasn't as happy as I could have been (I'm just too much of a purist... I didn't like the Spiderman movie all that much either).  If you liked the Spiderman movie and aren't a complete purist, then you should love this movie... the story and plot follow close enough to the comic book to make it a fun little watch.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|This is a spectacular demonstration of what the blues is all about.  I really believe this CD along with other recent releases by Aerosmith &quot;Honkin On Bobo&quot;, and &quot;Hittin' the Note&quot; by the Allman Brothers could spark a new blues revival.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Rivaled only by The Lord of the Rings, and with much of the same elements. It is interesting to note that The Lord of the Rings was influential in the creation of the Star Wars saga and Star Wars in turn influenced Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.<BR>Note that the battle on Hoth in Star Wars against the Imperial Walkers is adapted in Return of the King's battle against the elephants.<br />This edition arrives on Sept. 21 1994 as a 4 disc DVD set of the Special Editions only, with a new Making of Documentary.<BR>It proves that George Lucas is a genius, and the Star Wars series is one of the very best in the history of cinema.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Weez. Out of all their albums this one is probably the best. It's got a good balance of the laid-back (Say it Ain't So, the Sweater Song) and the just plain aggressive rock (Buddy Holly, Only in Dreams) thats kinda got a 50's vibe in there somewhere (or maybe its just me). The b-sides on disk 2 are also pretty good as a whole, very eagerly awaited by a lot of fans who never had the bootleg connections to get them earlier. <BR>All in all this is a great collection of songs, both disks. But why 4 stars? The packaging. For me personally, I bought this CD only for the 2nd disk. I already have the first cd, but because of this, I had to buy it again. For a lot of weezer fans this will be the case, but there's nothing we can really do about that unless they start releasing the b-sides separately. If you are a newcomer to the weezer music, by all means, buy this set instead of the regular blue album, and you will thank yourself later and save youself a few bucks too.
B000002WU9|5.0|Headlined by the production wizardry of the RZA, Wu-Tang Clan transcended the sound of hip-hop in 1993.  After copping &quot;36 Chambers&quot; and &quot;Tical&quot;, next up was &quot;Only built for Cuban Linx.&quot;  This is the album that really put the Wu-Tang as a whole over the top.  Every song on this album is blazing.  Even Nas(not Nasty, but not Escobar either) drops one of my favorite verses on Verbal Intercourse.  Often times, I find myself arguing with friends about which Wu-Tang album is better.  Some say &quot;36 Chambers&quot;, others say &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, but we all know which one it really is.
0452282152|5.0|I loved this book.  It has a  very interesting historical p[eriod as the backround, and a great perspective.  This girl learns so much, from the master of the house about art, but also about life in some families, and the secrets that people keep.  A book I had a hard time putting down, but took some absorbing too aat times.  Very worth the read.  Great author!
B000099T2L|5.0|But not anymore. This CD is a wonderful solo effort. She has grown up alot on this album. I think SPEECHLESS is the biggest example of this. Super-[good] song, as is the tone for a lot of the songs on this CD. She has a nice attitude on songs NASTY GIRL, RATHER BE WITH YOU and HIP HOP STAR. She did a really good job on this one and anyone who doesn't have it need to get it NOW... she won 5 GRAMMY for cryin' out loud.
B00000JLWW|4.0|This movie was beautiful and romantic.  I saw it at the movies, and it was just a bit too long, but all the historically acurate china, and other decorations were very well done to give a sense of what the ship may have looked like originally.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I would buy this set if they included the original versions of the films. The versions included here are filled with overly cute crap, had have been sanitized for your protection (like the stupid change in the confrontation between Han and Greedo).<br />Go to e-bay and buy the videodisc and a videodisk player, and enjoy the original films.<br />BTW: I am not opposed to making some changing and cleaning up the effects, but I am opposed to stupid, pointless changes.
B00005JN02|5.0|Imagine waking up from a coma and realizing that the world around you has irreversibly changed in a radical manner. There is little doubt that this awareness will shock and amaze you. It is exactly this situation that Alex Kerner desires to avoid. After his mother, Hanna, suffers from a heart attack and slips into a coma for eight months the doctors warned her family to avoid any stressful events that can injure her recovery. The problem is that Hanna is a devout believer of the socialist government of East Germany and while she was in her coma the Berlin Wall came down and the two Germanys reunited. Confident that the news will cause harm to his mother Alex is determined that his mother remain ignorant of the obvious changes that dominate East Berlin. As a result he develops some brilliant and resourceful schemes to make his mother believe that time hasn't changed such as filming his own news programs and changing the labels on the food jars. GOOD BYE, LENIN! is a funny yet poignant film that is sure to delight and entertain. Although there are many laugh-out-loud moments included there are also underlying issues and concerns that are on a more serious note. As the plot develops each member of the Kerner family realizes that their particular sense of reality is not as they believe. This particular family has been through a lot emotionally and psychologically, and I felt inspired watching their dramas unfold. The acting was superb, the plot was entertaining, and I walked away with a new perspective of this socio-political event and life in general. Bravo!
0385504209|1.0|As I read this book by Dan Brown, I wanted to be drawn in, to examine and enjoy the puzzles, and to ride the chases to satisfactory conclusions. None of these things occurred. Instead I was plunged headlong into a piece of anti-Christian propaganda not unlike the anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion. What Mr. Brown is selling is nothing more than Gnosticism in the guise of 'history.' In many places his characters reassure us that everything about the Goddess Cult and Mary Magdalene is 'historical fact.' Of course it is no such thing. The Gnostic gospels were written after the synoptic Gospels (upon which the 'Passion of the Christ' was based) and are far more likely to be inaccurate than are the traditional Christian canonical writings.<br />The attempt by Mr. Brown to convince us that the goddess cult and the 'divine feminine' are somehow superior to the Christian and Jewish faiths is pitiful. Think a minute about the pagan cults of old: 1. They were murderous, brutal, and intolerant. Christians were slaughtered for centuries by these enlightened pagans who worshipped the 'goddess.' 2. Human sacrifice (along with cannibalism) was a hallmark of paganism and polytheism (I refer you to the Aztecs, the Incas, and South Sea Islanders to name only a few, and I'm not even talking about mass murdering pagans like Attila and Hitler, himself a worshipper of the Teutonic gods) 3. The ridiculous rituals carried out by the Pagans, described in the book as having this deep meaning and power, come off like stilted, neurotic, sex-obsessed Klan meetings only with people chanting and watching some old geezer have sex with a younger woman to 'unite' the feminine with the masculine and thus complete the human psyche. How can people who are so driven to dress up in party hats and chant and have sex supposed to be superior to anyone let alone Christians and Jews? They're just using their religion to party!<br />As to the style of the book, how many times did anyone else count phrases like, \\"he reeled with this information,\\" \\"The statement was mind-numbing\\" (I must have counted the use of 'mind-numbing' at least six times, 'reeling' another five). This is the worst kind of writing. Instead of letting us make our own conclusions about what is being said, Mr. Brown needs to tell us in case we miss the point. Horribly amateurish and very dull. This is a truly mediocre book. It has garnered far more interest than it deserves. What I worry about is that many people think that they are learning 'real history' here. It's a polemic, a doctrinaire screed dressed up like a thriller. But one thing it is not is history, unless you want to count all the myths and falsehoods concocted by haters of monotheism since Abraham left Ur and traveled to Canaan 2000 years before the birth of Christ. It is certainly a history of *that* if nothing else. On this basis alone - that we get to hear all the anti-Monotheist trash-talk that has been floating around for the past 4000 years - then this is a history. Otherwise, it's pure codswallop.phrases like, \\"he reeled with this information,\\" \\"The statement was mind-numbing\\" (I must have counted the use of 'mind-numbing' at least six times, 'reeling' another five).

B000062YB1|5.0|A very consistant and refined Slayer LP and the last featuring the great Dave Lombardo on drums (probably the best metal drummer of all time). There are some great songs here..Spirit in Black, Dead Skin Mask, etc. The only dud on the record being Skeletons of Society. While no Slayer fan should pass this one up, I must say this isn't my favorite Slayer CD. God Hates Us All, Reign in Blood & South of Heaven are all, IMO, better because they sound fresh and new, while Seasons sounds like \\"part 2\\" of earlier work. Make no mistake about it, Slayer is the \\"real deal\\" when it comes to heavy metal and this CD proves that.
B00008CLOA|5.0|...but not in my home town. Reminiscing about the seventies, advancing years and \\"the English way\\", this album evokes so much of what has gone before yet still remains. It retains a strong, if maudlin, relevance and defines \\"classic\\" when listening to music of that era.
B000059HB7|1.0|i bought \\"rio bravo\\" entirely on the strength of the critical acclaim, and i was awfully disappointed. compared to \\"the searchers,\\" \\"rio bravo\\" is claustrophobic (all the action takes place inside a jail, a saloon or a single street) and pointless.<br /><br />to summarize: a drunk (dean martin) hits a sherif (john wayne) over the head, and while the sherif is unconscious a bad guy shoots a good samaritan. but the drunk is actually friend of the sherif, so he becomes a deputy (?) and the bad guy goes to jail. no matter: the bad guy's gonna git out, because his bad guy brother says so, and so john wayne has to sit around the jail watching over him while the drunk, who's trying to be not drunk anymore, watches the street and makes newcomers take off their guns. and from that flimsy premise comes all the jawin' and worryin' and fightin' until the federal marshal can arrive and take charge of the prisoner.<br /><br />something happened in 50 years to make the idiocy in this film, which may have once seemed stylish or manly, turn out to be flimsy bluster. walter brennan does his gull durn insufferable walter brennan imitation, ricky nelson does a smirking, slacker imitation of a gunfighter, wayne swims around with an uneasy smile on his face and not much to do except fawn over ricky nelson and kiss brennan (!). there's an annoying mexican stereotype and a lunatic turn by angie dickenson as the gold hearted gamblin' girl from over them prairie hills who turns wayne into a sappy blockhead a shuckin' and a shawin' with love. dean martin turns in an affecting performance as the reforming drunk, and even sings a western ditty to wile the time, but his key dramatic solo (\\"look at these hands! jes look at 'em\\") is embarrassing and forced. the scene where the bad guys are thwarted by sticks of dynamite, thrown by brennan and detonated -- on the bounce -- by wayne's gunshots, is simply laughable.<br /><br />this is the western as closet drama, one of the worst evocations of the west i have ever seen, not romantic, not dramatic, not tragic, not comic, and certainly not historical ... it makes tv's \\"bonanza\\" look like a documentary.
0553573403|5.0|I've read countless sci/fi and fantasy novels by various authors, however it is this series, brilliantly written by Martin, that deserves 5 stars and then some. In his story, Martin has reconstructed the era of medieval times while adding clever twists to the plot.  Just when the reader thinks the obvious will occur, Martin really delivers a twist of unexpected happenings, thus leaving the reader enthralled.  I would start reading this novel at evening after work, and find myself still on the couch at dawn turning page after page. A must read and reread.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Myself, being a huge fan of Appetite for Destruction and a big fan of their less hard work as well, feel that this compilation really hits the mark with its purpose: displaying both sides of a great band on a single disc. The rockin' stuff is there (Welcome To The Jungle, Paradise City, Live And Let Die), The slower stuff is there (November Rain, Patience, Sweet Child Of Mine), and, at least in my opinion, is the perfect compilation for this group. The unreleased song (a cover of the Stones' &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;) hits the mark. You'd never believe these guys could do it!<br />A five star compilation indeed<br />Edgehead 1922<br />P.S: Der Kommissar, do your homework next time.
B0000TB014|5.0|Excellent summary of MJ's videos. These videos are cutting edge amongst musicians.

Great album, with a variety of sounds, and the notably rocking &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;. Buy away, and prepare for some great, original music.

B000060P79|1.0|Well...This album is pretty bad, what makes me even more sick is the fact that these guys are capable of so much more. For anyone who's thinking what the hell is this guy talking about, Im here to inform you that before simple plan was formed there was a band called RESET made up from the majority of simple plan. Now reset was a real band, the music was punk but with a metal edge, and the lyrics actually had meaning, not ooooohhh i want to be perfect. So anyone reading this do yourself a huge favour and track down some of reset's music on the net. My fav songs are &quot;let me go&quot; and &quot;united we stand tall'.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is told by a fourteen year old girl already in her own heaven.  Taken early from earth, Susie Salmon¡¯s life ended before it even began.  She watches life going on without her: her family struggling to accept her disappearance, her friends talking about her death, and her killer trying to remain undiscovered.  It consists of loss and hope, adjustment and growth, but most of all, grief accepted by love.  <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It reached into the depths of my heart as I realized Susie went through hell only to end up in her perfect heaven filled with swing-sets and anything she desired to be surrounded with.  Susie¡¯s family reminds me of my own; ready to risk everything to find the one they lost.  Determination set in her father¡¯s eyes, he only thought to find the man that killed her little girl.  This book cleverly teaches healing through grief filled with humor and love.  It captured my full attention as I was transformed into that little girl ripped from life.  Her only wish was to be with her family; something I am grateful that I have.  <br />Lindsey Salmon locked herself inside her heart when she found out that her big sister couldn¡¯t be found.  Her undying love for her sister enabled her to move on and accept the fact that her sister will always be with her.  I realized, now even more after reading this book, how much I appreciate my family.  The sacrifices they make, though sometimes insignificant, shows how much love they can give.  Susie¡¯s family never let her go because she was a part of their love, something that can never be erased.  Because this love still existed, Susie was unable to let go of Earth and accept her heaven.  She witnessed her family grow apart only to realize their love will force them back together.  It becomes a learning experience from heaven to earth.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|BONJOUR TRISTESSE, like many Preminger films, is ripe for reevaluation, and this spiffy new DVD transfer may help spur on that long-overdue second look.  Seberg's performance was much-maligned in its day, but she looks smashing here and acts with considerable wit and poise; our girl's a long way from Marshalltown.  True, vocally she's perhaps not ideal, but certainly sounds as Gallic as co-stars Kerr and Niven.  The material plays with all three stars' images in fascinating ways; Seberg's ingenue is lethal, Kerr, frequently neurotic, was never presented as a creature of such moral ambiguity, and Niven's all suave facade covering inner corruption, in a performance akin to his Oscar-winning turn in SEPARATE TABLES.  Wonderful location photography, and great fun to hear the title tune keep turning up in a variety of arrangements, in best 50's-movie-theme-song tradition.  The comparison others have made on this site to the glorious Sirk melodramas is apt; the picture transcends genre in many of the same ways.  Preminger and company manage to get under your skin.
6302775302|5.0|Mark Knopfler has been described as having the charisma of a soggy head of lettuce.  That's about right.  All he does is stand up and play his guitar and sing.  Once in a while he'll shake a leg.  Some of the other Dire Straits are a little more animated but none of them -- thank God -- is Janet Jackson.  (Pardon me for thinking that the quality of music went all too hell when singers started dancing.)  <br />Knopfler can play that guitar and watching his fingers snake around the frets and strings is entertainment enough.  He makes it look so easy!  And most of his songs are great -- although I wish \\"Sultans of Swing\\" and \\"Telegraph Road\\" were included. The other guys in the band are also seriously good musicians.  The sax and flute, the drums, the keyboards, and an old fashioned country-music pedal steel guitar (is DS the only rock band to have a steel guitar?) all have their moments in the spotlight and all of them are grown-ups.  DS is a classy band.<br />The best songs on this VHS are concerned with love and war: \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (MK plays a weird looking metal guitar) and \\"Brothers in Arms.\\"  \\"Money for Nothing\\" is here, and \\"Private Investigations.\\"  The first three songs on the VHS are all rockers that I don't find outstanding, so fast forward to song number 4, \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" and watch it from then on.  It's mostly mellow.
B00000K31V|3.0|A typical Cronenberg - blurred line between reality and fantasy, strange interaction between biology and technology, themes of addiciton and a psychological thriller plot. Leigh is average at best as a star game designer who is releasing a VR game so potent that people are out to kill her. Jude Law is good as the sidekick dragged into Leigh's alter world. However, as in all Cronenberg movies, he is the star and the actors are basically meaningless. Like &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; the sets and effects are striking and often gross. And also like those movies, Cronenberg injects biology where you would never expect it. In &quot;eXistenz&quot; the game console is a biological creature which must interact with the player via a connection to the spinal cord - weird stuff indeed. Gamers eventually develop a strong addicition to their bio-console in a drug-like way - another common Cronenberg motif. The story is intelligent and the artistic direction is quite interesting, but this film is not for everyone.
B000002J1M|5.0|The 3rd of a string of underrated albums by the great classic lineup of Genesis. Contains classic songs, classic performances, probably classic Genesis at it's best.<br /><br />\\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" is probably one of Tony Banks's best moments on any Genesis record, if not on any record he's ever played on. The combination of string/brass and bass accordian sounds of the Mellotron Mark II, and touches of Hammond Organ, make for a stunning intro to an amazing song, if not an amazing album. The rest of the song starts with an interplexing 6/4 rhythm that follows with Mike Rutherford playing distorted Rickenbacker basslines over Phil Collins's pulsating drumline. Steve Hackett copies Rutherford's part on guitar but provides short stacatto leads a la his volume pedal at other times. The song itself actually could be related to '2001; Space Oddyssey', whereas aliens probably made humans intellegent, and Peter Gabriel's lyrics perfectly illustrate that picture. When this song was performed live, Gabriel wore batwings on his head, with glow-in-the-dark paint around his eyes.<br /><br />\\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" shows an interesting concept story. Genetic control has limited human height to 4 feet, and everybody has to move into smaller, more expensive apartments. Peter Gabriel takes the point-of-view of different protagonists and antagonists affected by this. Features interesting Flute and Mellotron Flute duets in the middle section.<br /><br />\\"Time Table\\" is an interesting song done by Genesis. It's probably the greatest piano feature since \\"Visions of Angels\\", but before \\"Firth Of Fifth\\". It seemed to provid a little comedy and seriousness at the same time.<br /><br />\\"Can-Utility and The Coastliners\\" represents all sides of Genesis at this point in their career. It starts out with Hackett & Rutherford on 12-String Acoustic Guitars, then switches to an interesting Mellotron Solo while Rutherford's bass pedals blow your speakers. During the last section, Banks & Collins play a couple fast moving Fifths and Sevenths to give Hackett & Rutherford time to switch to 6-string electric and bass.<br /><br />\\"Horizons\\" is basically a 'calm-before-the-storm' kind of piece. A nice little 6-string acoustic intro to the masterpiece of this album...<br /><br />\\"Supper's Ready\\" is a true masterpiece on it's own. A tale about the battle between good and evil, intertwined with themes about 2 lovers, Farmers and Firemen, Narcissus, and Winston Churchill in drag (which I believe to be the genesis [pun intended] of \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"Selling England By The Pound\\").<br /><br />It is featured in 7 parts:<br /><br />\\"Lover's Leap\\" starts as 2 lovers recognize something changing in the world, something not for the better. It features a Gabriel and Collins duet, with Hackett, Rutherford, and Banks all playing 12-string guitars. Banks takes off his guitar and switches to Hohner Pianet, which sound almost unmistakably like a Fender Rhodes (an instrument Tony Banks hated).<br /><br />\\"The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man\\" continues the story as the 2 lovers encounter the leaders of evil, which give you false promises. \\"Look into my mouth, he cries...\\". Obviously, he wants to eat you.<br /><br />\\"Itknatod and Iknathon and Their Band Of Merry Men\\" is the start of the battle between Good and Evil. It features Collins providing a Horse-Like Gallop on his snare drum, not dissimilar of The Beatles' \\"Get Back\\", and it's that horse gallop that lets Gabriel and Collins get away with singing \\"Bang Bang Bang!\\".<br /><br />\\"How Dare I Be So Beautiful?\\" is the aftermath of the battle, where the 2 lovers are stuck underground and are trying to get back to the surface. It's a nice short piece of studio wizardry, with the volume slipping up and down on Banks's grand piano like vibrato. Gabriel delivers more unwhimsical Mad-Hatter-esque phrases like \\"Human Bacon\\" & \\"Social Security\\" (political pun intended).<br /><br />\\"Willow Farm\\" has no musical or storyline tie to the rest of the song. But it adds a nice comic relief before the real seriousness of this happens. Gabriel's voice changes from a helium-high to a slowed-down roar during the middle section for some odd reason.<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\" is the beginning of the end basically. It starts out chaotic, gets calm a little bit, and picks up speed. Basically this is where the whole religious theme comes into place, as some events spoken in the lyrics are written in the book of Revelation (ie Gabble Ratchets, Guards of Magog, 666, 7 trumpets, etc). This part is of course known for Tony Banks' well played organ solo, backed by Collins' inconsistent 9/8 drum pattern, and Hackett and Rutherford's dueling 6 & 12-String Electrics and a solid staccato E on the bass pedals. Basically the whole piece gets too scary, and somehow a heavily reverberated Mellotron Brass-String signal (similar to 'Watcher Of The Skies'), what seems to be salvation.<br /><br />\\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs\\" starts with a reprise of the chorus & Bridge of \\"Lover's Leap\\" and a newly revamped and slowed down \\"Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man\\" theme with new lyrics, and Gabriel sings his heart out on this one. This of course is pretty much how the Book Of Revelation ends. Heaven & Earth are reformed and a new Jerusalem comes out of the sky to be put in it's place for humanity. For some odd reason, when they performed this in concert, they always changed the key of this section from A major to G major. Why did they do that? Could Gabriel not handle the high notes? When Collins took over as lead singer in 1976, they still played this and he really couldn't handle the highnotes. But Gabriel definitely could. If anybody finds a copy of this song in concert where they don't change key at the end, I'd like to find out.<br /><br />Well what else can I say, but if you like Genesis, buy this album. It pretty much made them, that's all that there is to it.this happens.

0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is a sci-fi/drama classic that even the most sci-fi adverse crowd will enjoy. The story, though set in the not-so-distant future, is not so much a tecno dazzler like the Matrix rather an exploration into the power of the human spirit. The story digs deep enough into the science to show the biotech driven Big Brother society we could grow into if we are not careful without overloading those who aren't interested in that sort of thing. There is also a good romantic side story involving Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman. The entire cast is excellent with a breakout performance by Jude Law.
6305327041|5.0|\\"Four Rooms\\" is four short films, written & directed by four very different directors. They are Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, <br />and Quentin Tarantino. It also features an all star cast that includes Tim Roth, <br />Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Paul Calderon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, and Quentin Tarantino. This movie is weird, but since four people with four very different styles of film-making wrote and directed it, that's pretty much what you have to expect. The first short is written & directed by Allison Anders <br />and it's called: <br /> <br />The Missing Ingredient: At his first night on the job (and all alone, no less) Ted, the Bellboy stumbles upon a coven of witches who plan to resurrect a fellow witch. The only thing they need is semen...From Ted. This short is pretty stupid, but has some funny moments in it. <br /> <br />The next is by director Alexandre Rockwell and it is: <br /> <br />The Wrong Man: When asked to bring ice to a room, Ted stumbles into the wrong room where a man is holding his wife at gunpoint. The story here is pretty much bare boned, but has some great dialouge and Tim Roth is excellent in this short. <br /> <br />The next is director Robert Rodriguez's: <br /> <br />The Misbehavers: Going out with his wife, a man (Banderas) asks Ted to watch his zany children to make sure they don't misbehave. Ted sees it as a chance to make an easy 500 bucks and goes for it, not realizing just how wild the children are. Banderas is hilarious in the role and everything that happens is hilarious. <br /> <br />And finally we have Quentin Tarantino: <br /> <br />The Man from Hollywood: Before quitting Ted wanders up to the penthouse which is inhabited by actor Chester Rush (Tarantino) and a group of his friend's including Norman (Calderon), the woman from \\"The Wrong Man\\", <br />and Leo (Bruce Willis, who's uncredited). Chester and Norman have a bet; <br />If Norman can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row, he gets Chester's beautiful car. If he can't do it, Chester cuts Norman's pinky off. That's where Ted comes in...Tarantino is great, Bruce Willis scores a couple laughs, and of course...It's written by Tarantino, so it's great. <br /> <br />The two best films here are \\"The Man from Hollywood\\" & \\"The Misbehavers\\", while the other two are just OK. The cast is really good, except I'm not sure why Tim Roth plays the character as if he's got ADHD and is on cocaine. The movie's got a whole array of actors and producer Laurence Bender plays the same character he did in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" credited as Long Haired Yuppie Scum. This moive isn't perfect, but it is funny and strange. So, Thumbs up. <br /> <br />The Missing Ingredient: B- <br />The Wrong Man: B+ <br />The Misbehavers: A <br />The Man From Hollywood: A <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Do not watch the first few minutes of &quot;Requiem&quot; and assume you are in for just another junkie drama - it is so much more! The characters are well developed and the ultimate disintegration of each of them is executed superbly, showing the insane depths to which the human soul can sink. From a filmmaking perspective, not only is the cinematography dazzling but the careful matching of the visual effects to the musical score intensifies the impact of every scene. The film builds in power as would a musical requiem, finally ending in a violent multimedia crescendo. The final 20 minutes of &quot;RFAD&quot; are as edgy as any I've seen and are simply not to be missed. Be forewarned, it is very graphic and may be too much for the faint of heart.
B0000027RL|1.0|PLEASE WHATEVER U DO DONT PURCHASE THIS HORRIBLE RECORD. NIRVANA IS SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN PEARL JAM, IF U DONT BELEIVE ME THEN READ EVERY GOD DAMN REVIEW IN THE WORLD , WATCH EVERY SPECIAL ON TV , EVERY COUNTDOWN LIST OF THE GREATEST SONGS, ALBUMS OR BANDS AND NIRVANA IS ALWAYS NUMBER 1. AND IF YOU LOSER REPUBLICAN PEARL JAM FANS WANNA GO INTO RECORD SALES- YEA THIS ALBUM SOLD A LITTLE MORE THAN NEVERMIND BUT OVERALL NIRVANA SOLD ALOT MORE RECORDS THAN PEARL JAM EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDNT RELEASE AS MANY RECORDS AS THIS UNTALANTED CRAPPY BAND AND IF U DONT BELEIVE ME THEN GO TO RIAA.COM AND YOU WILL SEE IT THERE.
B0000648WZ|1.0|If you hoping for a film that lives up to the quality of the Heinlein novel you'll be greatly disappointed as I was. The entire subtext of the utopian military society of the future is forgone in favor of a high-gloss sci-fi shoot-em-up. If you're looking for a slick sci-fi action film you might like this one and rate it a 3 Stars. I was hoping for a little more.
B000002UW1|5.0|REM truly are the pioneers of alternative music this album came out in 1987 at time when hair metal bands ruled the airwaves. It brought something creative and different than the usual sex innuendo songs on the radio. It is a very political conscious album. The whole CD rocks with stand out tracks like the classic End of the World ( I feel fine). Welcome to the Occupation, Finest Worksong, The One I Love which is one of my fave songs of all time. The whole CD is appealing and essential to anyone who grew up in 80's college radio. This album somewhat brought them into the mainstream  but not in a bad way. In my opinion their best album.
0790729628|5.0|The most influential sci-fi Noir ever made. Bladerunner is heavy on atmosphere and nuance leaving much to the viewer's imagination (as a classic should). Though sparse on action and dialogue this movie is a must for anyone who likes thinking man's sci-fi and especially those who appreciate the film's role in sci-fi history. The movie may not work for the under-20 crowd who are accustomed to faster paced, more obvious modern thrillers.
B000002UW1|5.0|REM without a doubt set a standard for Alternative music. They were Indie before it was hip to be. This album is their best work in my opinion this CD is essential for fans of true  college garage rock music. This record came out in 1987 when hair metal bands ruled the airwaves. This album was something different & unique from the usual sex innuendo songs on the radio at that time very political concious. The whole CD rocks with stand out tracks like the classic It's End of the World <BR>( I feel Fine) showing their early punk influence. The melodic and my personal favorite song on CD \\"The one I Love\\". Finest Worksong is a great opener & catchy tune. This is the album that broke them somewhat into the forefront mainstream. \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" very of the tongue song w/ catchy  hook. This CD a must have for anyone who grew up in the 80's with college radio.
079073639X|2.0|OK, pretend that you want to make a movie just like &quot;Event Horizon&quot; except it takes place underwater. Oh wait, they did. It's called &quot;Sphere&quot;. This is a very uninspired, unoriginal movie with lukewarm performances all around. Big name cast, big money production, big disappoint. Totally unnecessary film - you don't need to see this one.<br />I suggest renting &quot;Event Horizon&quot; first. Pay attention to the dream manifestation sequences. Now watch &quot;Sphere&quot;. Aren't these the same ideas just done in a new setting? Worth a rent maybe, but don't buy this.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I just bought Elephunk and I absolutely love it! After hearing 'Where is the Love' on the radio, I ran out and bought it. It has such positive lyrics, unlike some other songs out today. Fergie (the girl) has such a pretty voice. This is one of the only CDs I don't have to skip tracks on. I listen to it 24/7! They've always had great CDs but they've really outdone themselves this time (maybe because of their new addition, Fergie).
B0000004V2|3.0|Since The Stone Roses' debut has achieved legendary status as the seminal album of the late 80's Madchester movement, you knock it at your own peril.  After all, there is some brilliant stuff here.  The 1-2 punch of \\"She Bangs the Drums\\" and \\"Elephant Stone\\" represent some of the best pop the 80's had to offer.<br />The problem is that the 80's is where most of that pop has stayed.  This is a record that, with the notable exception of \\"Fool's Gold\\", is dated.  The tinny production makes the songs sound distant, as if they're being played in the room next door.  It's exciting to hear the Stone Roses meld guitar riffs with dance textures, but none of it sounds as revolutionary as it all once was.  Leftover studio tricks from 80's stick out here like signposts.  You can occasionally spot riffs that belong on a Duran Duran record.  The drums all sound programmed and pushed well into the background.  The whole album just feels like a product of its era.  <br />This may all sound blasphemous, but consider this record compared to others from its era.  U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\" still sounds fresh when you listen to it today.  The sound is immediate, as if were just recorded.  The Stone Roses suffers mightily by comparison.  It is certainly a good record, and by accounts is was a record that changed music forever in the UK.  But it is not a timeless record, and that's the title many have erroneously bestowed upon it.
B00007GZQI|5.0|Great fun, especially if you're a fan of Monty Python or the old Saturday Night Live.
B0000029GA|2.0|The beats on this cd are WACK! I was expecting so much more from this album since Illmatic was and is one of the best rap albums ever made. Nas' rhymes are SICK! I just hate the fact that the beats/tracks don't hold the same quality. I heard some Illmatic remixes that these NC boys did that was WAAAAY better. I mean lose your mind true hotness! If you can get your hands on those, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Having not seen this movie in theatres I admit to being hesitant about buying it but I'm glad I did because it's an excellent family movie. <br />It's a classic story of a mother and a daughter who don't get along because they don't see eye to eye on almost anything. However, unlike any other mother and daughter, these two wake up one morning after going out to eat Chinese in each others bodies! The result leaves them understanding each other and getting along much easier. <br />This \\"girly movie\\" is quite well done. So well done in fact that my entire family was watching it with me the very next day!
B00005YU1O|4.0|Wow, this was the impression i was left with after watching this movie. &quot;Waking Life&quot; is intensly philosophical, it challenges your perception on life, death, religion, society and reality itself. How much of a role do your dreams play in your waking life? Can you control your dreams or are you controlled? These ideas are a medium for the more philosophical disscusions the lead has with the countless people he talks do while wondering around doing absolutley nothing. <br />The amount of talking in the film could be intimidating but only because it forces you to think about what is being said because it is all very deep stuff. At one stage a woman talks of death as being an extended dream that you can't wake from. The anonimity of the majority of characters lets the ideas take form free of any pre-concieved notions you might have if say the ideas were coming from someone well known. <br />The mass of talking is balanced well with the very innovative animation. The film becomes a living breathing work of art with the characters being represented in watercolour, charcoals, line drawings and in styles reminiscent of surrealists such as magrite or dali and some scenes looking familar to a picasso painting. The animation is used to great effect to emphasize some of the characters points.<br />In short if you want to be challenged, if you want to view life from a new perspective, watch this movie.
0385504209|1.0|Suspiciously so in fact. That this book is *still* on the top of the heap after this long speaks of a publishing industry that preplans its successes as well as American literary culture. As an earlier reviewer stated, it's a shame they decided to make this book a &quot;bestseller.&quot;<br />I found The Da Vinci Code's so called plot boring, the &quot;astounding&quot; revelations preposterous, and the writing amaturish. Mr. Brown presents a veritable smorgasbord of conspiracies and labors mightily to connect them all together. What results though is a mishmash of convolutions with which Sherlock Holmes would have a problem.<br />As far as his awesome research, I knew we were in trouble when he mentioned the &quot;ancient&quot; religion of Wicca. Had Mr. Brown troubled to ask, any follower of Wicca could have told him that it was pretty much invented in 1950 by Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders. That hardly makes it ancient.<br />I read this (from the library, thankfully) based on the tantalizing synopsis. I'm just glad I didn't waste money on it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I won't buy this for two reasons:<br />1) Fox is probably ripping us off again.  After two Alien box sets, three versions of X-men, and many other examples where they released two versions; there is no way I'm going to fall for it again.  I know that if I buy this box set, in four or five years Fox will release a better seven disc version, with both versions of the films and loaded with extras.  Which leads to the other reason I won't buy this.<br />2) I want the original versions of these movies.  I don't want to see Greedo awkwardly shooting the wall before Han fires.  I don't want to see Boba Fett looking into the camera as he walks by.  I don't want to hear the Storm Trooper say \\"oomph\\" as he bumps into the door.  I don't want to see Han walk over jaba's tail.  I don't want to watch the terrible re-edit of the end of Empire.  I don't want to have Luke say \\"You're lucky to be alive\\" rather than \\"You're lucky you don't taste very good.\\"  Worst of all, I don't want Luke to make that goofy scream as he's falling at the end of empire.<br />None of these things were in the original versions of the films.  They are \\"special\\" additions.  They wasted time putting in all those lame things, yet didn't fix the red boxes around the tie fighters and asteroids.  George Lucas, who fought against the colorization of Black and White movies, ruined his own films by adding unnecessary baggage.  I won't buy a Star Wars movie until I can purchase the original theatrical versions.
0061020680|5.0|So you must've heard of Terry Pratchett before somewhere. About his wildly successful Discworld series, his praised, able-to-make-you-laugh-out-loud, humour. So it's finally got you interested, at least to prove everybody wrong about this hack. I mean, can someone British really have a sense of humour? <BR>Then start with this book. Prove us all wrong. It's the fourth in the series but you don't need to read the preceeding novels, nor the ones after. Pick it up, without reading reviews elsewhere as to what it's all about and venture into that mad, magical world like a castaway stranded in seemingly-desolute, uncharted territories, with treasures hidden all over; explore this world on your own; you'd want it to be all yours.<BR>Terry can get to be a silly old man, but he's not dumb. Every Discworld novel makes numerous refrences, a lot of them being historical. Trust me, some things he didn't make up. For example, in the beginning of the novel, Mort's dad takes Mort to the marketplace to try to find a job for him. Mort stands around all day hoping to get hired while people from all over come searching for the best apprentice to hire. This procedure is done something like once a year, although i'm not too sure about that. What I'm sure is that Terry didn't make this up from the back of his head. This used to happen in old England, up until a century ago, i guess. I found that out when i read Thomas Hardy's &quot;Far From The Madding Crowd&quot; a few days ago, so i'm sure this was practiced for some time.<BR>It's a small detail but just goes to show you how much thought Terry puts into his novel.
0743243307|4.0|This book tells of the growth of a simple uneducated Bengali bride of an arranged marriage, thrown into the a confusing and alien culture of London. She is married to a pompous know-all failure of a man. As time goes by in this novel you see this shy, unsure woman learn and grow and become a person in her own right. This story is about the triumph of spirit of women, family love and commitment.
B00009Y2K9|5.0|One of the most startingly beautiful records I've heard in many years.  It's son, flamenco and jazz all rolled into a delicious hybrid.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I also love Sex and the City, but after this season, I know why they decided to only go for one more.  I don't know what happened, but this season failed to spark any interest.  I must have forgot how boring it was when I bought it.  A friend and I sat at home one night, and unfortunately wasted hours of time on this DVD.  My reccomendation is to wait for the 6th season...you aren't missing anything!
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee published a book about racism seen from a child`s view.<BR>The story takes place in a southern state of the USA in the 1930s.<BR> The novel is about a man called Atticus Finch, a lawyer, who lives in a small town and who is considered to be well off.He lives there with his daughter called Scout, his son Jem and their cook Calpurnia, who is black.<BR>Atticus doesnt see any place for prejudice of any kind.He is called to defend the black man Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a white girl.He knew this case would be difficult to win and could totally change his life.The story seems to focus on the representation of the mockingbird as a symbol of innocence.Atticus was portrayed as a man who thought compassion and honesty to his children.He brings himself and his children into a dangerous situation by defending a black man, but he is convinced that it is very important to show the residents of Maycomb that Tom is innocent and that they are stupid not to believe him.<BR>To my mind This novel is really worth reading because this theme is present everyime.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|You pathetic little f@g. You know nothing of what you're talking about. Cannibal Corpse is a sick death meteal band, yes. But the members themselves are normal everyday people just like me and you except you're g@y and they are not. If you had watched the bonus DVD that came along with Wretched Spawn, you would see what kind of guys the Cannibal Corpse members are. Alex Webster said himself, he writes lyrics for the fans, not because he is a &quot;Sick Individual&quot;. And Jack Owen is playing an acoustic country song in the DVD. Corpsegrinder is lifting weights, not killing people in the DVD. How could these guys be sick or evil? You obviously are a worthless Nu f@g metal lover. Just die.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|It is about time music like this is being made again.  I grew up in the 70's and 80's and most music now days just plain sucks.  I love it that this album has many influences. The Beatles, Stones, AC/DC, The Ramones, maybe even a little Skynard?  This isn't your pretty boy band.  I enjoyed this album and so does my teenage son. Loved it. They don't sound like every other band out there.
0446310786|4.0|The novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; from Harper Lee is about Scout, a girl who is the daugther of a man called Atticus who defends an Afro-American. This person is Tom Robinson, who is charged with the rape of a white girl. It is obviously that he has not comitted the crime, but the people in the small town Maycomb are racists and that makes the defend of Tom Robinson very difficult for Atticus.<BR>At the beginning the novel was very difficult for me to read, because the first few chapters are boring, but when i went on reading the book, it became more and more interesting.

Even though this was a `clip' show, it was interesting, exciting and even funny. The ending was in a word `checkmate'.<br />These series reminded me of the earlier series of adventure and excitement. A lot better than season 5 with its soap opera style wishy washy shows.<br />THIS IS A DEFINITE must HAVE. <BR> <BR>When I reached the last episode, I delayed washing it for about 2 weeks...just to savour the final episode and it was well worth it!

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee`s novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a good one. It is about how people deal with major issues of racism during the segregation period. The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama (south of the USA). Atticus Finch, a lawyer ,has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white girl. Atticus`s children struggle with other children at school, because their father is defending this  black man. Atticus has also a problem with the society in Maycomb because the white people can`t accept that a white defends a negro. During the trial Tom Robinson is .....

B000002J20|5.0|In 1973, a double LP from any group was considered a monumental task and sometimes even pretentious.  However, \\"Yes\\" had been producing high quality \\"prog-rock\\" work for several years.  Each prior album had been condensed into tight, well orchestrated pop songs.  When \\"Tales...\\" was released, it showed that the band finally wanted to release an album that showed all of its member individual talents as well.  Throughout the album, each member has their own solo highlight while still contributing to the band as a whole.  The lyrics by Anderson and Howe can sometimes sound overly serious or cumbersome, but that is beside the point.  It is the fluid movement of poetry that combines with the instrumentals that survives so well.  There never seems to be a moment of self-consciousness or forcefulness.  The sounds of the words/sentences just meld with the other instruments.  It was never clear to me exactly what message \\"Yes\\" was trying to convey with this large album, but I enjoyed its variety nonetheless.  Instead of Top Forty songs, the listener is treated to segments of music segued with bridge after bridge, making a seamless series of four \\"songs\\".  Actually, these \\"songs\\" are chapters.  If they had wanted to, \\"Yes\\" could have easily made a 'rock opera', but that would have been considered ridiculous and self-serving.  Instead, \\"Yes\\" has presented chunks and snippets of melodies and songs that wind together for eighty minutes or so.  It is simply a musical experience and nothing more; but an exceptional one at that.  It's not the final package that counts; it's the wild ride that we are allowed to glide along with.
B0000B3B95|1.0|This movie is all special effects and no heart. You'll probably find yourself wondering who to root for since no characters are really likeable. If you really like The Hulk, check it out but otherwise, its not worth your time.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Zero Stars would be appropriate. Many of the folks who have spent their money on this are obviously interested in validating their purchase, which is fine. However, what it comes down to is this: does this CD contain anything worth buying? In my opinion, no.<BR>The size of the voice does not always determine the quality of a singer, as many have noted. If it did, Tom Waits would never have been able to sell anything.<BR>However,to get a satisfying musical experience, other factors absolutely have to be in place: high quality songs, intelligent musicianship, and taste. <BR>This is where Mz Spears (and her collaborators) fall flat on their faces, again. The bare-bones, sampled and looped concoctions that pass for songwriting here are a joke. This is where the size of voice comes in: at least if you have big pipes, you can soar over such junk to make it palatable, but Britney's puny, Vocalizer-enchanced voice just can't do it.<BR>For truly high-quality, empty pop, ABBA set the standard.<BR>Apart from this, her [bad] act is getting a little embarrassing at age 22 (but, evidently, not to her fans.)<BR>Of course, what any of us say here matters little; the Britney machine will roll on, soaking up money, until it runs out of gas.<BR>There are those who say you can't argue about taste. Actually, taste is the one thing that does vary. Junk will always be junk and quality will always be quality, regardless of how many or how few like it.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I am amazed at all the negative reviews for Mona Lisa Smile. This was the best movie I have seen in ages. Julia Roberts as always was terrific. I guess you really can't take these reviews seriously for I go over to School of Rock with Jack Black(probably the worst movie I have ever seen &amp; he is the worst actor)&amp; the movie is almost all positive reviews including Ebert &amp; Roeper.What's with that. Don't miss Mona Lisa Smile.It is a breath of fresh air from what is out there.
0140177396|4.0|The book, Of Mice and Men, was a very exciting book to read. George and Lennie were two nomad men that went from job to job trying to make a life's living. Lennie is a kid trapped in a man's body. Lennie is disabled and acts like a four year old kid. George is a &quot;small and quick and dark of face&quot;.<br />I liked this novel. It showed how life could be hard in many different ways. How they went from job to job trying to make a life's living. Also how George dealt with Lennies problems. Lennie's wouldn't think and get in trouble.  <br />I would recommend this book to kids that love adventure. This had plenty of it. Lennie and George went everywhere to work.
0446310786|4.0|The siblings Jean Louise, called Scout, and Jem Finch grow up in the south states of America during the 30`s in a society with blacks and poor families. In the small town Maycomb where they live, blacks are made scapegoats for everything going wrong there. When their father Atticus , a lawyer, has to defend the black man Tom Robinson, who should have raped a white farmer`s girl Jem and Scout are confronted with hate and prejudices of many white people in Maycomb. During their father`s case they become older and they begin to understand a lot of things. Jem and Scout learn many things and behaviours from their father but the most important thing they learn is that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.<br />The book &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; shows racism in the southern states of America. Through Scout`s eyes and her point of view the reader gets to know how the society was during the 30`s. This book is really worth reading.
0316666343|5.0|The lovely bones by Alice Sebold was told by a fourteen year old girl from heaven. Susie Salmon was raped and murdered by someone very close to the family. She gets to tell the story explaining how she can see her parents after the big tragedy. Susie salmon was very detailed and overall a great book. Although toward the middle of the book the pace slows down it picks right up an dkeeps you guessing all the way till the end. Its a great book and I would recommend it to everyone. I give this book two thumbs and a toe up! Great indepent reading book.
B00003CXCT|1.0|C'mon Children of the 70's, stay away from this set like you would the Plague...why you ask? Like any other kid growing up in the late 70's/ early 80's I lived breathed and dreamt Star Wars. But this box set coming out does not contain the movies we grew up on, but instead Mega Ego, er, I mean Lucas' \\"Special Editions\\" that he came up with 20 years later. If you want to expand on something fine, but leave the original version as it was for the people who remember and more importantly WANT IT THAT WAY!!!! The Who release re-mastered versions of their albums all the time but none of them are so far removed from the original that you can't recognize it. Star Wars from 1977 is a completely different movie from Star Wars the Special Edition 1997...know going in which one you are buying because chances are it's not the one you want...
B0000DCGT0|1.0|I hate this movie! It was so poorly put together, you could <BR>push a whole heard of elephants through it, I'm glad I only <BR>rented it instead of wasting money on this piece of garbage.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I am normally one of these people who cringe at people of a certain age 'making out' or heaven forbid, 'doing it'. I was going to scream if I saw Jack Nicholson naked. Thankfully, we didn't, we just saw his butt, as he mooned everyone in his hospital gown! And the sex scenes were done tastefully, and was quite sweet at the same time. Diane Keaton is also very brave, as she appears naked in this, which is quite a funny scene when Jack sees her naked. It takes a brave woman of her age to appear naked, especially when she's approaching 60!<br />I'm not normally a great fan of Jack Nicholson, ask anyone and they will tell you his eyes totally freak me out! Don't ask me why! But I loved him in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and this too - and there were two other Jack Nicholson movies in the \\"previews\\", Anger Management and that other one with Helen Hunt.<br />There was a great supporting cast in this, including Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky for all you fans out there) and Jon Favreau, both who's roles could have been expanded, to have a bigger part in the movie.<br />I was pretty disappointed with Keanu's role in this. He basically gets messed about by Diane Keaton's character, and his role at the end just gets left hanging.<br />At 2 hours 8 minutes long, this film was about 20 minutes too long. After Diane & Jack 'get it on', the scenes which appear afterwards are just stupid, and the scene where Diane cries is just plain embarrassing.<br />If you're an old romantic at heart, you'll get quite teary by the end of the movie. If you're not - then you'll probably hate it.
055357342X|5.0|If you're reading this I have to assume you've read books 1 and 2 (you'd be crazy to start at this point). Just figure it's another week or two of your life to dedicate to Mr. Martin. I think it's the best of the series so far, and I know that is saying a lot.<br />This book re-introduces some characters you thought you knew. And has some surprises of its own. Most importantly the story never let's up or loses its momentum.<br />If you time it right you could just finish this as book four comes out this summer and not have to ponder the pain, suffering and demise awaiting the remaining cast of characters :-).
B0001ADAVK|3.0|This is basically what is called by guys worldwide a &quot;chickflick&quot;. Apart from that, it's an alright film. It's based in the fifties, with a bunch of girls who are at &quot;finishing school&quot;, and get to take days off just because they're married. And the teachers etc, turn a blind eye!<br />There's a great cast in this, including of course Julia Stiles, mega-watt grin Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Kirsten Dunst playing only what can be described as not a very nice girl. The actresses are great, and really dress, act and sound like they're playing fifties gals.<br />I'm not quite sure who my favourite character was. Maybe Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhaal). She was the one who basically slept around. I really did think she was going to be the one who ended up pregnant, but she never did. (She was also given contraception by a member of staff, who in turn got sacked!) There are quite a few scenes where she looks almost teary, and says to the teacher she had a fling with that they &quot;needed to talk&quot;. But this storyline never seems to go anywhere.<br />The extras are OK on this DVD, there are some fascinating statistics about girls/colleges then and now. The statistics are really mindblowing. Apart from that, you've got an Elton John music video, a couple of standard featurettes, and not much else.<br />This is a good film, despite being a little too long, and tedious. If you can sit through it to actually review guys, you must have liked some aspect of it!
0553579908|5.0|It just gets better and better. George RR Martin is easily the best epic fantasy writer since Tolkein. The series is long, complex and totally enthralling. Unlike too many other author's efforts, this epic nevers lets up.<br />Just read Game of Thrones (Book 1 in the series) first. Then enjoy the action and surprises this book introduces. By the time you finish this book you'll be as addicted to this series as Martin's thousands of avid fans. Book three is even better and book four should be out this summer, so you'll still have lots to look forward to.
B000003CMC|3.0|I know I'll probably be knocked for giving this final Allman Brothers album to feature Duane Alman only three stars; but I must admit that I find it a little uneven.<br />It has a strong opener in Gregg Allman's \\"Ain't Wasting Time No More\\", but Dickey's Betts' long instrumental \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\" sounds a little too loose to keep my interest going.<br />The melodic \\"Sweet Melissa\\" is another strong Gregg Allman effort; one of my favorites.<br />First track to feature Duane Allman is the extremely long live improvisions over Donovan's \\"There is a Mountain\\" called \\"Mountain Jam\\". Today this track may only be interesting to hard-core Allman fans.<br />\\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Trouble No More\\" are two more live-tracks; The latter a great perfomance.<br />Next track \\"Stand Back\\" is the first new studio track to feature Duane Allman and it's good recording.<br />Last two tracks are two more of my personal favorites. Dickey's Betts' \\"Blue Sky\\" is featuring great dual guitar-playing by Duane and Betts. And finally the moving acoustic instrumental \\"Little Martha\\".<br />At any rate a \\"must-buy\\" for fans of Southern Rock!
0553573411|5.0|To be honest, I can't remember where this book started or stopped. The series is so good throughout the three books I basically read it from beginning to end as one story. It's not very often an author can keep readers totally engaged for that long.<br />Fitz matures but keeps learning lessons the hard way. We get to know his mentors better and see the story develope more. But you'd have to be crazy to stop all the way to the finish line. Hobb doesn't let up with gritty action sequences, surprises and the story's momentum.<br />Hobb is now my third favorite fantasy author behind Tolkein and George RR Martin. If you like the latter, I think you'll love this series - and you can finish while you wait for Martin's fourth book to get published!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I  REALLY do like Bill Murray a great deal but, to paraphrase one clever critic of old, his performance in this movie went the whole gamut of A to B.  The problem probably lay in the immature direction of Coppola and a creeping, boring script that perhaps tried to be subtle and &quot;sophisticated&quot; in defining characters, but failed miserably.   I think the reasons why this movie got so many nominations and Oscars were, one, the name Coppola, and two, HAD TO award a woman director.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I first heard Muse back when Absolution was released in the UK and was really interested in them. i was astonished by such music they produce and yet they are barely known in America. Finding out Absolution was finally going to be released in America, I grabbed a copy of it as soon as I could.<br />It is an incredible album, with such full sound with only three people. Matt Bellamy is unbelievably talented in guitar and piano, and has a vast range in his haunting, emotional vocals. Bassist Chris Wolstenholme and drummer Dominic Howard are greatly skilled in their part to complete the trio.<br />The album does not seem to slow down at all, it is an emotional story told, and it should be picked up by anyone who likes quality music. Their live act is top notch stuff too. Check out this album!
0689835604|5.0|I bought this book based on the reviews and gave it to my 5 month-old granddaughter for Christmas.  Everyone promptly forgot about the book until another mother recommended it to my daughter.  Their two babies got very excited when they looked at the pages, their eyes wide, delight showing on their faces. I can't explain why babies seem to get excited over this book, but it's now our granddaughter's favorite book.

0671027387|2.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is schlock and not a very skillful example. Dan Brown clearly knows a thing or two about science (or at least fakes it convincingly), but he appears not to know anything about politics or politicians. In a thriller whose plot depends on political intrigue, this is a major problem.<br />Two examples: (1) A presidential campaign is central to the plot, but the presumptive Republican nominee appears to have exactly one campaign staffer, with whom, of course, he's had an affair. (2) The United States effectively invades Canada to get a meteorite, but apparently nobody notices or minds.<br />Brown's characters are caricatures -- the beautiful young political aide, the nerdy scientist, the surprisingly hunky scientist, the Republican senator in the pocket of big business. Their motivations are stock, their decisions make sense only in thriller-novel world, and it's impossible to care about any of them.<br />Tom Clancy often uses a cheap trick: having his characters come up with cunning plans that they carry out over the next hundred pages without having them explicitly revealed to the reader. In \\"Deception Point,\\" Brown uses the trick repeatedly, on a smaller scale, trying to pull the reader just through a few pages at a time. It works inasmuch as you do want to know what comes next -- but you're conscious of being manipulated. I found myself resenting it.<br />I haven't read \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" I hope, if the bestseller lists mean anything, that it's much better than this.

B00005RHGL|5.0|Okay, for one, this is my favorite movie.  For two the director's cut gives you the coolest deleted scenes and angles.  I can not tell you everything but it is fantastic.  By the way some people like to know how the inside looks.  It is awsome!  Very well done and it will always be at the top of my collection.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Before I picked this up, a friend of mine, who saw the movie in a theatre, warned me that there would be two moments in the film where I'd probably find myself crying. <br />Hell, I cried through this whole thing.<br />I found myself tearing up at the start of darn near every song. I think it's because I simply can not imagine a finer tribute paid to anybody.  George Harrison clearly meant so much to the guys on stage that there was hardly enough room for all that heartfelt emotion.<br />Usually, tribute stuff like this is supposed to have highlights and parts that don't work quite as well, but here, you could say the whole thing is a highlight. <br />Who'da thunk the first GH song you'd hear on a night like this would be &quot;The Inner Light,&quot; the long-forgotten flip side for &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; that most Beatles fans would never recognize? <br />Jeff Lynne's performance of this song is both reverent and well-done, placed amid Ravi and Anoushka Shankar's compositions to their friend. <br />Then there's the Pythons. Hilarious. Check out the documentary on the second disc. DOUBLE Hilarious.<br />Then the boys take over. My favorite songs: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers doing &quot;I Need You.&quot; Joe Brown's take on &quot;That's the Way It Goes,&quot; his daughter Sam's &quot;Horse to Water,&quot; and the big ending jam on &quot;Wah Wah.&quot; <br />And if you can hold in the waterworks when Ringo sings &quot;Photograph&quot; (All I've got is a photograph and I realize you're not coming back anymore), then you are made of stone.<br />I can't put it better than a quote I read in another review of this DVD: &quot;Now they know how many souls it takes to fill the Albert Hall. Just the one.&quot; <br />What better tribute than that could there be?
0451191153|1.0|You can probably refer to the other 755 Amazon reviews to get a sense of this book.  I will explain quickly, however, why it's a pernicious force, based on my own experience.  The Fountainhead takes a very powerful hold on a lot of young people who read it just before or just after arriving at college.  At a time when these young people are going through a lot of upheaval in their lives, and often feeling very alone, this gives them a false sense of security; rather than going through the hard work of making friends and generally being an adult, this book feeds notions that we don't need other people.  That's not a healthy outlook for an 18 year-old striking out in the world.<br />Life is complex and none of us make it alone.  It's true that we need a strong sense of self, but Rand takes it to a sociopathic extreme.    Luckily, I had a respected college comp professor who told me that \\"this is a dangerous book for a young guy,\\" and who suggested that I rethink what a world of complete individualism would look like.  I'm the better for having known him, not Ms. Rand.<br />I hope that those of you who see value in human interaction and feeling, and reject Rand's almost incredible view that any of us can be truly independant, will avoid giving this book as a gift, reading it, or recommending it to anyone.  If you want to give a good gift, choose something that will challenge your loved ones to be more thoughtful, caring individuals, not something that will turn them inward and give them a god complex.<br />PS - This is not philosophy.  Rand wasn't that smart, or if she was, it's not demonstrated in this book.
B0000AFQS0|4.0|If you like watching the bands of your youth in their full glory, it doesn't get much better than this. Jeff Stein's tribute to his favorite band has always been a favorite of mine, even though as a kid I really wasn't much of a Who fan. <br />This movie does what the director wanted it to do--it shows how,regardless of how ripped, how zonked, how crazy these guys were, they never lost the energy, especially when they played live. <br />From a documentary standpoint, if the movie has any downpoint to it, it tends to skip over demons that are clearly at play here, or poke fun at them. Witness the clearly inebriated team of Moon and Ringo, probably the two most famous rock drummers ever, both trying to justify their drinking habits. Stein lets you draw your own conclusions, and we all know what happened to Keith. (Ringo, thank goodness, dried up eventually.)  There are so many points here where you KNOW, from history, that Townshend is hopped up on heroin  that you can't help but wonder if he'd have been just as good without it--or even better.<br />Watching this now, one can marvel at what incredible genius we lost when Keith Moon died. He may well have been the only drummer ever to play the drums as a lead instrument.  But here's the movie, here's a pile of extras (all very cool) and here's a recommendation that you pick this up right away!
B00008DDXC|2.0|The Harry Potter books are so good, which makes writing this review so hard. The whole movie is very sloppy(so was the first one)the problem is that they tried to throw it all together too fast to make as much money as they could off pottermania. They really needed two things to make any of the movies great.<BR>1. They should of waited for all the books to be published before writing the script and filming. For a tighter production.<BR>2. Hire Peter Jackson he obviously knows a thing or two about making a fantastic fantasy film.

B000083C49|1.0|Oh no William Shatner has to save the whales......please!! Come on, this is the worst sci fi movie concept ever. Sending  the crew to do social comentary on pretecting the environment. And then there is the fact that the script was terrible and there were some pretty cheasy acting moments. I would even rather watch Starship Troopers or dare I even say Jar Jar Binks commentary on Star Wars Episode 1!!!<br />I'm sure I'll get negative reviews/votes from Trekies who have no life. But they worship their god (william shatner) with so little regard to the real world, that they can't see that this movie is actually worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space. And that shatner isn't a good enough actor to be on a lame show like days of our lives. <BR>But the real kicker is that this is one of the best Star Trek moves!!!!!
B00005JMNA|5.0|I think that Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is one of the best movies I have ever seen! (I only saw it eight times) It made me feel good every time I saw it! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. The soundtrack is great too! I think everyone should give the movie and the soundtrack a chance!
B00006JDU9|5.0|hello my name is matthew smith.and i feel that this film is so much better than all three films from the original triology. Jar Jar Binks is the greatest creation in the history of filmmaking.I hope we see alot more of him in episode III.
0312319517|3.0|I have been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth for many years.  This book is closer to what I have come to expect from him.  Having been so displeased with The Phantom of Manhattan, I was hesitant to pick up another one of his books.  I was happy to find this book was very entertaining, suspenseful and fast paced.<br />Contrary to Publishers Weekly, I do not think this is one of his best in decades (The Fist of God and Icon were both better).  There isn't a lot in this book you cannot predict well before it is revealed.  Regardless, it is an enjoyable book.  The timeliness of the story and the integration of many people from current headlines blurred the lines between fact and fiction very well (I'm sure most people who read this book prior to March 2004 assumed terrorism expert Richard Clarke was a fictional character in the book).<br />I recommend reading this book; but if you want classic Forsyth, I would suggest some of his earlier novels.
1572810408|4.0|This is a beautiful deck, as a history buff I really appreciate its imagery and style. In my personal readings, I get the best readings of my entire deck collection. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the imagery of the minors, while largely not straying from the Rider Waite Smith system, is from a source that is very obscure, at least here in America we aren't really taught much about the Lutrell Psalter, this is my first exposure to that book specifially. I wish Maggie Kneen would write a more thorough book than the Little White Book included, not only would that mean more business (hint!), but also a deeper understanding for people like me! Other than that, this really is a great deck, but unless a real book surfaces, I can't recommend it to anyone who isn't pretty familiar with the Rider Waite Smith  minors.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I haven't heard a great hip/hop album from beginning to end in years... It produces this magic feeling of new and reminds you of what it was like to be young and optimistic before the world stabs you and lies to you each and every night before you go home. This album is funny, thoughtful, and just downright funky.<br />Bravo Kanye.<BR>Definately one to own.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Clapton sounds perfectly aligned with this music.  He loves it and you love it too.  The playing and production are right like a good house. It's not a museum or chamber job. It cooks. Buy it, put it on and leave it on.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've just read a comment on these pages suggesting that Star Wars is a complete rip-off of Lord Of The Rings, which is probably the most stupid thing I've ever heard. George Lucas was inspired by myths, legends and fairy tales from centuries before Tolkien ever put pen to paper - the very same things which inspired Tolkien, in fact. They both used the central, defining themes and motifs from these to create their respective works. Some people seem to think Tolkien practically invented the written word ( not to mention the wheel and electricity, probably ) but in fact he was an ultra-conservative and mediocre writer with a fairly impressive imagination, THAT'S ALL. However, there is one thing that's certain - the recent, overrated LOTR films wouldn't EXIST had it not been for the original Star Wars trilogy, which paved the way for every other big-budget blockbuster (both good and bad) that has followed it.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Fans have waited and begged for the original trilogy on DVD since the media was introduced. These special edition features are a nicely graphically enhanced product with some very poor plot additions Lucas felt were needed. Think about why now? Why not wait as Lucas said he would until the whole series was finished? With the lackluster releases of Ep1 and Ep2 combined with the long wait to the 3rd installment they need to keep people interested (yes they made money but no staying power). Not to mention the \\"special editions\\" that will come out after the last film hits dvd and boxed sets with whatever silly bonuses. They're planning to con people into ending up with 3 different DVD sets of the movies just like many fans fell into with the VHS releases. Personally, I have no interest in purchasing these. (...). Maybe George should pay attention to what his customers want and not to his flawed vision(...). Let them know you're dissapointed, wait to buy these things for a long while... it's not like there'll be a shortage.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This is a great album. I highly recomend this album to any music fan! The only problem with it is that some of the tracks sound to much like songs that were on Hybrid Theory (like Easier to run &amp; Crawling sound a lot alike, and pushing me away &amp; Numb sound a lot alike), but other than that, this album is perfect, buy it!<BR>Stand out songs:<BR>Faint<BR>Lying from you<BR>From the inside (my personal favorite)<BR>Breaking the Habit
B00006HBCR|4.0|This overall covers quite a bit of Def Leppard's career. It's a great showcase of songs to get any foreigner to Def Leppard obsessed with them. My only complaints are the exclusion of any on through the night material, and a lackluster ammount of high 'n dry and adrenalize material. Oh, and Der Kommissar, for your information, Rick Allen lost his left arm (not a criticism, just a friendly reminder).
B000002NZO|3.0|In July 1970, Genesis released it's second album, &quot;Trespass.&quot;  Like their first album, &quot;From Genesis To Revelation,&quot; it too vanished without a trace.  However, all was not lost.  &quot;Trespass&quot; was important for three reasons:<br />1.  It got the attention of the British Music Scene, especially in London (bands like Yes, Pink Floyd &amp; Humble Pie were taking notice).<br />2.  The album officially put Charisma Records on the map (even though the Nice's fourth album, &quot;The Five Bridges Suite&quot; was before it.<br />3.  'The Knife' was not only a hit but would become a stage favourite for the early years.<br />Just as Genesis was signed on Charisma Recors &amp; before this album was released, Guitarist 'Ant' Phillips was not celebratory at all.  Due to his stage fright, he would later resign.  His lead guitar work on 'Looking For Someone' &amp; 'The Knife' wasn't the greatest but it seem to be perfect in the right spots.  John Mayhew wasn't bad either.  His drumming was okay, more basic &amp; his background vocals was decent.  Mayhew would comment later on some stiff profound statements after he was fired.  Genesis would find the final missing ingredients in Phil Collins (June, 1970) &amp; Steve Hackett (Late December 1970) in their next album.<br />If you look closely at the album itself, you can see all 6 songs on the cover &amp; the back.  Let me describe:  The couple looking out at the scenery, they're 'Looking For Someone.' The mountains in the picture ('White Mountain').  The Angel behind the couple ('Vision Of Angels'),  The scene is in 'Stagnation' &amp; the time of day is 'Dusk.'  'The Knife' in the back of the cover.<br />Trident Studios were kicking out execellent, well-sounding, high quality albums.  Although they were using 16-track (a quantam leap forward since their first album was uning 4-track recording) the sound is very murky &amp; somewhat cloudy.  The editing is very bad on this album.  That's why it gets the 3-Star rating.<br />Now let's go through the songs:<br />LOOKING FOR SOMEONE:  Peter Gabriel's voice sounds more confident then he did on the first album.  Right from jump, it's like he's on a mission.  The song builds up until it crashes into an exciting climax.  <br />WHITE MOUNTAIN:  A pretty song.  Acoustic guitars over Tony Bank's Hammond L122.  Gabriel whistles through the outro while Banks makes his haunting Hammond Organ statements.<br />VISION OF ANGELS:  Another light hearted song w/ Banks using the Mellotron MK II for the first time.<br />STAGNATION:  This song begins w/ quiet acoustic guitars &amp; then builds up to a loud cresendo as Banks' L122 tells the story.  The loudness builds to a complete halt when Gabriel's flute quiets the noise only to build up for another cresendo.  <br />A better version of 'Stagnation' can be heard in the 1998 Box-set, &quot;THE GENESIS ARCHIVES 1967-75&quot; when the 'Class of 1971' line-up were on BBC Live, 1971.  The very last part of the song has the makings of a great late 60's band.<br />DUSK:  A beautiful acoustic piece w/ great background vocals.  Again, the Mellotron creeps up only to add melancholy.  <br />THE KNIFE:  The second most explosive song on the track.  A song about a revolutionist on a power trip.  Michael Rutherford's Fender Precision Bass sounds distorted through the whole song.  As the song breaks in the middle, everyone improvises during the quiet moments, very unusual indeed.  And remember, once the smoke is cleared, you'll be screaming &quot;We are only wanting freedom!&quot;<br />A better version of 'The Knife' is on the 1973 album, &quot;Genesis Live.&quot;     <br />If you're getting into Genesis, I highly recommend this as the starting point.  If you're a regular Genesis fan &amp; only are familiar w/ the 80's stuff, (&quot;Duke,&quot; &quot;Abacab,&quot; &quot;Genesis,&quot; &quot;Invisible Touch,&quot; &quot;We Can't Dance&quot;) this may not be for you unless you feel daring enough to really know what Genesis really was.  I took the plunge when I bought this back in 1996 was I was 18.<br />For the die hard fans, you might like, but for us HARD CORE GENESIS FANS (I fit in this group) this is 'our' Genesis that we know &amp; love, when they went for broke &amp; transformed themselves into Progressive Art Rock before they sold out to pop rock.  <br />&quot;Trespass&quot; was just the beginning.
B00004U28G|5.0|Growing up watching two of Hal Needems best movies &quot;Cannonball 1 &amp; 2&quot; and &quot;smokey and the bandit 1, 2, 3&quot; Ive mayured into realising that they just dont make them like this anymore! As said during the commentary, the script was no &quot;gone with the wind&quot; but who cares? These movies are for fun. And its great to see so many actors get together and have a great time making this fun, funny, action, car race accross the USA from sea to shining sea!<br />With such a great cast, its somthign you dont see too often with the amount of actors that where put into this movie! Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Roger Moore, and so many other great cameos and actors in this film! Including the introduction role to introduce Jackie Chan into the American market! This was Jackies first English speaking movie!<br />This whacky car race accross the states, involves some of the best stunts caught on film! Hal Needham sure knew what he was doing when he put this classic together!<br />Unfortunalty it dosent come with much of a bonus feature selection, theres an Audio Commetry with a couple of insighfull things about the movie. And the usual cast and bio thing. But it would have been great to see deleted scenes, but they probably dont exsist anymore? but that dosent drag this great fun for all action ride!<br />I recomend you buy it with Cannonball 2. As I think Cannonball 2 is one of the rare seaqulls that was just as great as the original! And if they ever release Speed Zone (known as Cannonball Fever in other places) I'd recomedn getting that one too! <br />If you like whacky ,over the top, crazy, action, comedys with alot of great stunts with vehicles, then this is the top of the list for anyones collection!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|ok, lets get started.  EC is guitar virtuoso!--the problem for many of his releases are they are just boring-he seems to just go through the motions with his personal interperetations of his mentors blues songs.  this release is just another in a long standing tradition of his blues GIVING US the blues for listening. If I were to be EC's manager and producer for this record---I would have had EC alone in the studio with no hired help professionals with his acoustic guitar tapping his toes-it also would have been great to have his cd look and sound like it was vinyl(with pops and squeeks)-making it a more pure homage to his great mentor.  EC outlook is positive these daze, but it would have been helpful for him to look waydowndeepinside of himself of his melancholy past(which I am sure RJ did in his day to day life and his enviroment).  good try EC but you should have listened to my advice.  jh
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This was an unusual sequel, it surpassed the original in many ways.  Not that the original was in any ways bad, but it more rushed and didn't get a chance to spend time on a lot of the other characters.<br />Here they did what they obviously wished they had the time and budget for in the first movie.<br />More of the Mutants were showcased.  Though it was still centered on Professor X and Wolverine, it brought a bunch the other characters into the side stage.  To name a few; Iceman, Pyro, Kitty Pride, Collosus, Banshee, Nightcrawler, etc....  Plus they gave more screen time to the sultry butt kicker Mystique, whom was given a bit more depth.<br />The bad guys were again, interesting and possessed depth.  Stryker the driven war vetran that is seemingly obsessed with controlling all mutants.  The reasons why he was given the authority to do what he did and how it was carried out was frefreashing, and believable.  Notice the president was more concerned about how it would look the to public than on any sort of personal morality.  Magneto appeared again as the classic anti-hero, still focusing on his own agenda's.<br />The action sequences were longer and more brutal.  Did you notice that the only person that you see die in the first one was the senator.  True you see Toad get shocked and seem like he dies, but he is a mutant and a rather enjoyable bad guy, who knows.  Sabretooth seemed to die, but in the comics he has survived many seemingly critical wounds, and survived.  This includes having his spine broken, so he could very well show again.  This movie wolverine has an actual body count and goes through special ops like they were children.  What would you expect from a barely under control psychopath with unbreakable bones and claws.<br />All in all this was a great movie, still had some elements that were a bit hard to grasp, but it was a comic book movie and a sci fi, that is part of the game.  It treats the characters and situations with dignity and makes you care about what is going on, for good and bad guys.<br />rent or buy this if you like sci fi or plain and simple action movies, you won't be disappointed.
B00013F35I|5.0|Well it's true that the sound is not as good as we want but I was there and this is the best boss concert that I ever seen, and I see quite a lot, in spain, in france, in italy. well i want to tell you something that can't be felt on the dvd of this fantastic concert, the last night in paris he finish with land of hope and dreams, the last night that he plays in barcelona he finish with land of hope and dreams, so this night he is going to finish with land of hope and dreams but, someone during the concert cryes two times thunderoad, the second one the boss says staring to part from which the cry had come  &quot;ya veremos&quot;, at the finish of land of hope and dreams all the people in the VIP zone was crying thunder road thunder road and he seems no hear us, seen to the wide arena (i now that in other arena parts people cryes bruce bruce!!! but not in front of him) but before he goes we could read in his lips thunder road, and if Jesus walks over the water, the boss walks among us, and says ssssshhhhhhhh', here you have the reason of his ssshhhhhhhhh' and not another one, I be there and was awesome.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|The original was a made for tv movie which included (of course people....come on you know it......) COMMERICALS!!!!  If you people would first read the book then see the movie you would see that the DVD is totally complete and accurate to the book.
0780631684|4.0|Having seen part 2 before i'd seen this one, i have to say, that the seaqull was much better IMO! If you wanna see a refreshign new way to present a horror film? then get both these flicks! Its not that same old boring slasher WHOS next to be killed kind of movie...its HOW are they going to be killed?<br />When whatshisface has a premonition that the plane is about to explode. He retreats taking a few others with him. And of coarse, the plane does explode! But death has a plan, and there not out of the clear. Death is stalking them anyway it can to kill them, and there on the run from a mysterious force!<br />I strongly recomend you get this with part 2 aswell! The seaqull was even better!<br />The bonus features are pretty cool, theres some insights to the movie, and a documentry on phychic ability that might intrest those intrested in that stuff? <br />This is a breath of fresh air for horror movies, as it doesnt evolve around the same old ,done to death type of slayings!
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This is the most enjoyable of the three Getz CD's I own, and of course, Oscar and his playing partners are superb, whether soloing or supporting. This has a great mix of uptempo and ballad tracks, and gives Herb Ellis on guitar and Ray Brown on bass some shining moments as well as the principals. There are ten earlier reviews posted here, and most of those folks agree with me that this is one of best albums to come out of what I consider the golden age of jazz...the second half of the '50's. I'm not sure why the 1955-'60 period produced such music, but rock was good, Broadway was good, classical LP's sold well, comedy records were hot, there still was a &quot;pop&quot; music segment distinct from rock, and rhythm and blues and country had their share of crossover hits as well. It just was a creative time in a fairly affluent culture, and all forms of music benefitted. There is not a minute on this Getz/Peterson outing which is boring. The menu is mostly standards, but played in quite interesting style. I can't imagine any general music lover not enjoying this one---you don't already have to be well-versed in jazz.
B000051VWW|5.0|I NEVER get sick of this album.  Few albums are timeless...This is one that I expect to be listening to in 25 years.
B00005JLET|5.0|This film is just stunning! I first saw it at the cinema when i took my son &amp; could not wait till it was released to buy.<BR>It is a fantastic adventure story for all ages &amp; the vibrant animation will leave you open mouthed.
B000000WJZ|4.0|Smashing Pumpkins` second album is not only one of their best but also one of the key alternative rock records of the early nineties. Combining grunge influences, metal, indie, pop, folk and rock, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; uses diverse ingredients to deliver a strong and peculiar listen. Unlike some of the band`s latest releases, this album is mostly guitar-oriented, and many of the songs are loud and abrasive moments of energy. Highlights include the opener and memorable &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, the noisy and dynamic &quot;Quiet&quot; or the enticing and raw &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot;. These are powerful and alluring songs, full of strenght and dinamism. However, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; also provides a couple of quieter and more calm tracks, such as the melodic classic &quot;Disarm&quot;, the tender and melancholic &quot;Spaceboy&quot; or the terrific and unforgettable &quot;Soma&quot;, probably the best song here. This record is a teen angst masterpiece and an essential work of art for the so-called Generation X, containing a strong collection of heartfelt, honest and innovative songs.  <br />A vital and meaningful effort.
B000002WPI|5.0|GET IT , GET IT NOW , this is what hip-hop is all about
B00006AFUR|5.0|it only takes one word to describe this album...aweinspiring. in a medium that continues to blame their parents for failed relationships, the content of this album is a breath of fresh air. on the same page as great artists as pink floyd and tool (LOOSLEY!!), the prog-rock nature of this album is captivating. the fact that Jared Leto (Requiem for a dream, Panic Room)is a famous actor is irrelevent. the landscape provided by this project is mezmerizing. like tool the lyrics are thought provoking, you think you know what he's saying, but after the second listen you get a new perspective on hte words themselves. the guitar work litterally bleeds through your speakers as if textured seven or eight times to get the thickness of a wall that they're trying to build around their own words. many people got a little taste of these guys on the radio with the single, Capricorn, but to put it modestly, they don't belong on radio. the artistic nature of the music would be lost on anybody not looking for something that would provok them to think and expirience solid emotion. a moving record from the least expected source is my vote for one of the most heart wrenching albums of the year.<br />side note--if you're not intrested in buying the album i URGE you to download \\"Oblivion\\"( the best track on the disc) and then tell me that you don't want to buy the record. that song alone is worth the price.<br />ENJOY!
0802130208|5.0|It's just a shame that he only wrote two books before committing suicide.
0385507755|4.0|Give this book to people who don't think they have a problem. If they don't have a problem now, they will have an image of how bad it can get.  How low one can go. Only one drawback, and perhaps that is a side affect of his drug usage, but Frey has a tic. When he repeats himself, it can be a little unnerving after awhile.<br />Well worth the money.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|An interesting movie with a captivating (although not all that original) premise, &quot;Memento&quot; is a true cult film, one that tries to offer something slightly different and personal. The concept is good, but after the first half the movie gets a bit repetitive and unsurprising, culminating in a mildly disappointing ending. Still, the acting is top notch, since Guy Pearce truly is an excellent choice for the lead role, delivering a subdued and intriguing performance. Directing Christopher Nolan suceeds at creating a gripping and moody atmosphere with enough suspense and interest, grabbing the viewer`s attention. That`s particularly relevant, since in this story every detail counts. Well, the plot per se is hardly anything new, so what sets &quot;Memento&quot; apart from most thrillers is the way its story is told. As a whole, this effort is worthwile and appealing, yet it`s more cerebral, cold and distant than enjoyable, entertaining and warm. It`s also a bit too depressing, since the final revelation makes one look at the characters from a new (and darker) perspective. Still, &quot;Memento&quot; is a remarkable movie about human nature, lies, trust and love, providing a clever (perhaps too clever, by the way), unusual and witty mistery. It`s unfortunate that, at parts, it carries more style than substance, but it`s a solid cinematic experience nonetheless. <br />Worth a look. Or two, to confirm if it all makes sense after all (some details are contrived, yet overall it works).
B000000OSG|5.0|Simply the best GNR album.UYI I is also super but this rocks!<BR>You Could Be Mine,Don't cry,Knocking on heaven's door,Pretty Tied Up,14 years.<BR>This album is a must have
B000063JZQ|4.0|Well, what can I say. The movie itself was well done. The incorporation of the dark and halogenic atmosphere portrayed in the original play was well matched in this production. The acting was very stable and excellently delivered, and the use of the silver screen makes it possible for the average individual to understand Shakespeare more, even though the language is still bloody impossible to figure out... However, the film had setbacks: for instance, the music sounded terrible, much like a quadropolegic monkey was being pushed through a pipe organ. As well as that, many scenes were left on the cutting room floor and not expressed in the film, leaving some innaccuracy to be seen. Nonetheless, it was an excellent film with very high standards for being a quality piece of Shakespearean work.
B000084T18|1.0|50 Cent, P. Diddy, Nelly, Vanila Ice, Ja Rule, Lil' Bow Wow, G Unit, Murpfy Lee, Chingy, St. Lunaticks- reason why today rap is crap.

630398021X|5.0|One of the sci-fi masterpieces of the nineties, &quot;Strange Days&quot; is a movie that has a bit of everything and ends up being a terrific cinematic experience. Set in a near future, the story deals with classic themes like virtual reality, thought control or the share of memory, providing and exciting and engaging cyberpunk adventure.<br />Director Kathryn Bigelow creates a futuristic LA that manages to be both sophisticated and believable, avoiding the over-the-top, utopic and not very realistic depictions of future societies presented in other sci-fi films.<br />Although &quot;Strange Days&quot; is basically a thriller, it is way above many run-of-the-mill movies of its genre, as it suceeds at combining its key elements perfectly. The direction is dynamic, unique and fast-paced, adding style and energy with an excellent sense of rythm, flow and tension.<br />The acting is also a plus, since Ralph Fiennes is unforgettable as the flawed anti-hero Lenny and Angela Basset shines as his sister-in-arms Mace. This duo makes for an odd, yet original and memorable couple, delivering some enticing and moving scenes. It`s also interesting seeing the female character protecting the male for a change, making for a clever reverse of the predictable and typical scenario of most action flicks. Juliette Lewis is also convincing as the dark and feral femme fatale, especially when she sings a P.J. Harvey song to perfection (one of the many excellent and remarkable moments of this movie).<br />&quot;Strange Days&quot; is much more than a futuristic thriller, providing a rich cinematic experience that brings issues such as isolation, trust, friendship, love and life in general. Every scene is compelling and intriguing, and the plot is very well developed, culminating in a tense, dynamic and huge finale with a superb climatic ending. Kudos to the soundtrack, by the way, especially the Skunk Anansie live presence during the last scenes that adds a lot of edge, mood and atmosphere to that peculiar chase sequence.<br />Overall, this movie is definitely an underrated classic and a must-have. Forget overrated stuff like the boring and very flawed &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, since &quot;Strange Days&quot; is a much more compelling and solid sci-fi masterpiece.<br />Highly recommended.e to that peculiar chase sequence. <br />Overall, this movie is definitely an underrated classic and a must-have. Forget overrated stuff like the boring and very flawed &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, since &quot;Strange Days&quot; is a much more compelling and solid sci-fi masterpiece.<br />Highly recommended.

B000006TRV|3.0|in my opinion the walls not on my top 5 Pink Floyd list, like the final cut just stretched out and pointed at slightly different matters it was sometimes very boring.The Final Cut is a little better but not much, they both tend to drag on into Roger Waters sad sarcastic,maybe even opera? sounding lyrics where David Gilmour one filled the gaps in their ealier years.The Album unlike the movie features hey you, I do not understand this.It hassome very good songs and we thank roger for them but i think they were better with Gilmour singing more often.TOP FIVE ALBUMS- <BR>1)Animals- Pink at their prime this is the very best,if you are a real fan you'll appreciate these songs more for some reason<br />2)Darkside of The Moon- this cd is incredible it never had an unperfected moment this is where roger began to step in and be in control more, you can see an example of this in the making of the darkside of the moon.DSOTM marked their newer sound after meddle <br />3)Wish You Were Here - A great cd,follows same sequence as Animals,came out right next to it A protest to the music industry and blues for syd<br />4)Pulse(full live Gilmour/Mason/Wright) Darkside performance) plus many Division Bell gems and other great ones all live!!<br />5)Meddle/Division Bell,- Mddle features 23 minute echoes its worth the price alone,the otehr songs are a nice change from the rest.Division Bell is A GREAT CD aside from what anyone says it was the 90's and he didn't screw it up it sounds like floyd cause it is good job dave a strong cd withour Waters guidance.Division Bell is much better than the Final Cut<br />The Wall was great but it needed to be more focused on music at some points , OK

John cena vs the big show wwe united states championship<BR>   This match was a decent opener and had a cool ending.I liked the way that the big show kicked out of the first fu but the docter of thuganomics walked away representing the usa. Why has da big show not one at a mania? whats up wit dat?<br />2.Fatal 4 way for raw's tag team titles.<BR>  The only reason that this was on the card was so that booker T and rvd could make an aperience.this match was boring<br />3. Chris jehrico vs Christian<BR>   This match was good but took too long in my opinion.I thought christian might win but happened with trish was a shock if u ask me.<br />4.Rock'n sock connection vs Evalution<BR>  This was the best match of the night in my opinion because I think that the rock is the best in the buisness today and it was very entertaining.I thought that the rock and flair had a good chemistry in the ring but I was shocked at the end result. the only reason that the wwe made the the rock'n sock connection lose was because to many goodguys were winning there matches that night.<br />5.

B000002KHH|5.0|This is Black Sabbath's second release and I must say it is a great album. There are no bad songs, and they are all great. True, this is not their best release, but I think their best is Master Of Reality. Still, this album has its words. Now to rate every track on this magnificant album.<br />1. War Pigs/Luke's Wall: Loved the beginning, loved the middle parts, and loved the ending. For me, the ending solo is so great. 5.5/5<br />2. Paranoid: Who doesn't know this song? It is a great short song. As you can see, this is the album title track song, and it is cool. One problem, it is so overplayed, which somehow it made me get bored. 4.5/5<br />3. Planet Caravan: Sounds like someone dreaming that he/she is inside a jungle. It is calm and soft. The solo is kinda bluesy. Still, I like it. 5/5<br />4. Iron Man: Who doesn't like this song? Whenever I listen to this I feel like I want to smash everything. This is like my third favorite song. 5/5<br />5. Electric Funeral: Great riff and great lyrics. The mood is scary, but I like it. Things gets a little bit funky in the middle of the song. 5/5<br />6. Hand Of Doom: Loved the bass in the beginning. It is one of the best songs on the album and it is the unfamous song of the album also. But what the heck! It is great. 5.25/5<br />7. Rat Salad: It is cool, but it has a strange title. It is kind of annoying; don't get me wrong I love instrumentals, but this one is kinda cool in a way. 4/5<br />8. Fairies Wear Boots/Jack The Stripper: Alright, this is my personal favorite on the album. Great beginner and great vocals. From the first time I heard it, I directly fell in love with this song. I kept on repeating it on and on. Amazing! 6/5<br />There you have it. My personal review of one of the best albums in Metal history. It is still better than any nu-metal crap. Just pure and nice!
0688170528|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book. I have read it 3 times now. I can relate to this book in so many ways and it's amazing what Jodi Picoult can write. I think this is her best book by far. I recomend this to everyone who wants a good book to read, but ladies bring a box of tissues with you, the end will get you.
0060589272|5.0|I'm a great fan of this author, I read more than ten  book of him, in several language, in this case read this book in the original language  Portuguese (ONZE MINUTOS), this book relates the history of Maria, one Brazilian escort girl, Maria born in a poor city in the Brazil, when she was child, she fall in love by a boy, but not have courage to declare her love. The book's discourse about her dreams, fears and the search to find the love of her life; treating with a naked way subjects very hard in the night's life, in this travel she discovers a lot thing  very interesting like a business man's behavior,  when they are with a prostitute, the pleasure of the pain, and the endless search of the love, in this search knows herself, your body and your mind, and at  the same time the wonderful and tragic world of the love.     The book have a lot likeness with a other great Brazilian writer Nelson Rodrigues that show in his books the love, sex and death, in its natural state. In nut shell he told  \\"The life like it's \\"About the author is not necessary to say anything  because he sold more than 1000,000 books in fifty idioms, between his books is \\"The alchemist\\", \\"Veronica decide to death\\" and others, recently he was invited to make a part of Brazilian's  letters academy
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Munching on some fine French food in an Air France 777-200 jet at 35,000 feet and travelling at 888kph, I watched this movie, not once, not twice but THREE times. It is that good!I was flying from Paris at the time.<br />Jack Nicholson is excellent in his role as an aging Lothario who despite a pot belly, wrinkles, bad eyesight and balding scalp is still charming and irresistable to young women of 30 and below. He hs a wonderful sense of humour, great charm, wit and repartee plus charisma and Mr. Midnight which is what he calls his manhood. Harry is every old playboy's dream incarnate. Yes, it is true, ladies don't just fall head over heels in love with a guy for only his macho muscles. The character must have been based in part on Hugh Hefner.<br />Enter Marin, a young, nubile, sexy, juicy woman hearing 30 who just happens to be an auctioneer at Christies' New York. They go off for a romantic weekend to her Mom's house in the Hamptons, Southampton to be exact. All the people in this movie are rich and famous, you see. Suddenly, before thay get to make love, Mom in the person of Diane Keaton as Erica appears with her cynical sister Zoe. Zoe pulls a knife on Harry (Nicholson) in his boxer shorts and Erica threatens to have him arrested. Lo and behold, enter the fair Marin in a black bikini that almost gave me a heart attack. I had to calm myself with a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape 2000. Yes, they look after you well in Business Class of Air France. They all calm down after Erica gets over the shock of seeing her daughter in love with an older man, and all 4 spend the weekend in the huge luxurious house. Erica is a divorced, lonely, neurotic, sexually repressed famous writer and playwright.... and abruptly while they hear the sensual sounds of Marvin Gaye music and the oohs and aahs of Harry and Marin fooling around...Marin screams in panic,\\"Mom!!!\\" This is where the fun begins as Harry has had a heart attack while trying to smooch Marin. I don't blame him. The great scene which had me laughing in stitches is where Erica wants to give Harry mouth to mouth resuscitaion and he gesticulates NO NO! She does it anyway and saves his life.<br />Eternal triangles abound in this movie. Keanu Reeves as handsome Dr. Julian has a thing for older women like Erica and falls in love with her while inevitably, the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Erica becomes Love-hate and then Love-Love. The scene where they discuss the birds and the bees in the bedroom is hilariously sexy as Harry gets to remove her white polo neck with her gold scissors on her command, no less. The orgasm scene is so terrifically hilarious too and yet strangely true to life. Erica says much much later, \\"I loove S____\\" and Harry, totally exhausted exclaims, \\"You certainly do!\\" The lines and dialogue are so witty and funny, and they are really smooth, slick actors with perfect timing and super confident delivery of their lines. The final scene in Paris is so romantic. I love Paris in the springtime and most any time, and the scenes of Paris and the lovely river Seine are superb. The food scenes in the restuarant Le Colbert behind the Palais Royale are so perfectly filmed especially where the birthday cake arrives for Erica's birthday in February in Paris. I know a lot about restaurants as I'm The Travelling Gourmet and I write and broadcast on Food, Travel and Wine all over the world. The crying or rather howling scenes where Erica goes hysterical and into a nervous breakdown when she realises that Harry doen't want a long term relationship but just a quick roll in the hay, are sad yet funny, which is incredibly entertaining. She becomes inspired to write a hit Broadway play where she lampoons and lambasts Harry and their relationship to great effect. The scene where her tear drops on to the keyboard of her laptop while she types furiously is very touching. It brought tears to my eyes too.<br />The ending is really cute and I love the cute baby. A superb movie with agreat story and wonderful acting. Filmed on location in New York, Paris and Southhampton, I liked this movie very much and watching it made the long flight so much shorter. Go see it soon and leave the movie theater Happy! By Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmettory and wonderful acting.

B00009TB5G|4.0|I loved this version of The Two Towers.  It included some really good extra sceens in it.  I loved the fact they included the elven rope in it.  Unfortunately they seem to have mixed up a few characters.  Some of the extra sceens were not nessesary but were overall good

Filled with passion, gore, back stabbing and murder Pacino and Pfeiffer deliver the most dramatic tale of a drug lord and a marriage lost.Scarface is not for the faint of hearted, as this cutting edge film has so many controversial scenes that some of them ended up on the cutting room floor as Scarface originally achieved an X-rating. I believe the critics loath the portrayal of `Montana' who kills his way to the pinnacle of the Miami drug rings, because the  scary thing about this movie is that it may well be extremely realistic.<br />i am a big fan of films, especially gangster flicks. I saw a film once, it was the best. Scarface is a film with so much involved in it that it perhaps covers all audiences of the world. The film has been banned or segregated throughout television and media voices insisting it appears to be too violent for any sane mind. I am not one of these voices and believe any film fan must watch it. This is definitely amongst Pacino's best films and I think if you compare his portrayal in this film to films such as the `Godfather', `Carlito's Way', `Dog Day Afternoon', `Serpico' and `Heat', you get a idea that he is a very versatile actor. `Scarface' will challenge your beliefs whether it is on America, on the legalisation of drugs, on morality or on material values. This is what makes this amongst the best in its genre as you will get more out of it than just mere blood and guns.In the end it's all a matter of taste. It isn't perfect, but it's vivid, incredibly outrageous, and invites multiple viewings. It's no Oscar winner because it's far too enjoyable for that!
0446310786|3.0|The novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, in the 1930s. The whole story is told by a little girl called Scout who tells her growing-up and what happened in that time. The novel is about different &quot;Mockingbirds&quot;, for example Boo Radley who is locked in the Radleys house and is a kind of monster or scapegoat for the people. The children invent stories about him, but later he saves their lifes. Another Mockingbird is Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of having raped a white girl. He is innocent but the jury sentence him to death. He dies while trying to escape from prison. Atticus, the father of Scout, defends Tom Robinson, so he is also a Mockingbird because the society is against black people and attacks him and his family.<BR>The first part of the book is very boring but interesting for people who are interested in society and people with their problems. I had to force myself to read the first part because I am not very interested in every detail of the society and the black-white contrast. The first part is necessary for the second part, but it could have been shorter. <BR>The second part is very exciting and interesting because the trial and threats and so on are described. People who are interested in dective stories will like the second part most. <BR>The novel itself is narrated very well and detailed, so you can identify with Scout. Besides, it is very interesting to see how Scout and Jem get older and how their relationship becomes different.
B00004XMS0|5.0|Okay, for all those people who are wanting to know which of the four batman movies are the best. Well here is my two cents.  <BR>Batman#1- staring Michale Keaton as the dark night himself batman, Jack Nicolson as the dark comical feind joker,and Kim Basinger as the sexy Vicki Vale. This was a dark beginning for the series and it explained the troubles of Bruce Waynes two lives Billion Dollar buissness man, and the dark night. Michale Keaton played an awsome batman, his two attitudes as both characters Bruce Wayne and Batman never reveal that they are the same person. Jack Nicolson as the joker was pure brilliance. His facical expressions through out the movie and his remarks make him the number one batman movie villian. This movie was directed by the brilliant mind of Tim Burton.  <BR>Batman#2- Batman returns- staring- Michale Keaton returns as the role of Batman , Michelle Phieffer as the sly sexy Cat Woman, Danny DeVito as the sewer ridden Penguin, and Christopher Walken as the notorious Max Shreck. This movie was again directed by the brilliant mind of Tim Burton. This was the darkest of all four movies. It shows the trials and errors of masterminds against the dark knight. Danny DeVito played a spectacular role as penguin. He was definitly the man for the part. Michelle Phiffer as cat women was a great selection. Props on the skin tight body suite. This was another good movie from a good cast, and a great director. Until #3<BR>Batman#3-Batman Forever- staring- Val Kilmer as Batman, Nichole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, Chris O'Donnelle as the boy wonder Robin, Tommy Lee Jones as the physcotic Two Face, and Jim Carrey as the clever Riddler. This was the worst of the 4. Jim Carrey played an awsome Riddler, Tommy Lee Jones played a fantastic two face. Nicole Kidman played a beautiful role as the sexy physco-therapist. But the other two was the downer. Starting with the least of the worst, Chris O'Donnell as robin. He was good in the beginning but as the movie progressed, his image slowly died out. Drew Barrymore played a quick role as one of two faces girls. But the number 1 reason for the faliure of this movie is the man himself Batman, played by a no personality Val Kilmer. Dont get me wrong Val is an awsome actor, but not for Batman. He had no personality, except when he tried to rival with Edward E. Nigma (The riddler for the non true batman fans) other than that he had no personatlity split between the two Bruce Wayne and Batman. <br />Batman#4-Batman and Robin- staring George Clooney as the role of Batman, Chris O'Donnell as the return role as Robin, Uma Thurman as the sensual Dr. Pamela Isley, also known as Poison Ivy, amd the governator himself Arnold Schwarzenegger as the bone chilling Mr. Freeze. This was an alright movie but not the best. Again the role of batman was trivialized by another actor. George Clooney as batman was good, on paper, but his performance was too wity for some. Again not seperating the lines between batman and Mr. Wayne. <BR>So all in all the batman series is a definite DVD collection to have my ratings on the movies are. <BR>BATMAN#1-*****<BR>BATMAN#2-****<BR>BATMAN#3-**<BR>BATMAN#4-***<BR>TAKE FROM A TRUE BATMAN FAN. ITS A GOOD BUY.

0385504209|5.0|This book was a page turner.  I found the historical and religious information facinating (and I don't normally like too much history in my fiction.).  Even if most don't agree with the information, it was a fantastic read.  Dan Brown is a creative genius!
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Where to begin on this one? If it weren't for Guns And Roses, I would still be listening to the sanitized pop crap that pollutes our airwaves continusly. With that being said, I have major issues with this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; cd. First off, I am kinda against a cd of &quot;Hits&quot; that isn't approved by the band, so there's shot #1 Geffen is just looking for quick cash. The songs sound great re-mastered, but i agree that it'd be better to pop in a remastered &quot;Appitite&quot; I honestly feel that more from Appitite should be present, but agree that because they were personal faves and not &quot;hits&quot; so to speak that they may not fit the critera so to speak. I also think that Spegetti was a terrible album, and nothing from it should be here, but it was an album, so you can't jsut ignore its exsitance as much as we all try. BUT this is still Guns and F*CKIN' Roses, so the album deserves it's due. I jsut think that Geffen missed the boat on things and that (like the Pantera &quot;Best Of..&quot; that was recently releaced) the tracklisting is lacking real GNR content. It's like that beer commercial great taste (GNR is one of the greatest bands EVER) Less filling (My Michelle, Estrnged, You're Crazy nowhere ot be found?) 3 outta 5, but still GNR so nab it and enjoy the music that rips at your head and heart at the same time!
B000002MTR|4.0|This album gets a bad rap because Dave Navarro replaced the amazing John Frusciante and the band didn't seem as complete as on BSSM. Frusciante's beautiful guitar riffs are painfully missing... Navarro isn't bad, but could never replace Frusciante. Clearly this isn't their best, but I enjoyed it. Just skip over 1.Warped (opening too long, song disconnected and slow) and 3.Deep Kick (Kiedis talks in the beginning for what seems like forever - boring). 9.Tearjerker is all right but gets a little repetitive. The rest of the songs are awesome. Listen for 8.Walkabout and 11.Falling Into Grace for some awesome funk sound. 13.Transcending is one of my favorites. 5.Coffee Shop and 7.One Big Mob are fun and crazy.<br />If you are a Chili Peppers fan like myself then this is a must-have!
6304683960|5.0|The footage for this excellent video was filmed during the 1996 Styx tour in Rosemont, IL.  All of the hits which made Styx one of the top bands of the late '70s and 80s are included in this fine video.  Classics such as &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot;, and &quot;The Best of Times&quot; bring this video to life, but the two songs which, in my opinion, are the best of all are Dennis DeYoung's excellent rendition of &quot;Lorelei&quot; and Tommy Shaw's uplifting &quot;Fooling Yourself&quot;.  Jy even gets in some keyboard time on &quot;Lorelei&quot;, while Tommy's unmatched acoustic guitar playing shines through on &quot;Fooling Yourself&quot;.  This video contains the original Styx line-up, minus original drummer John Panozzo, who passed away shortly before this video was released.  However, new drummer Todd Sucherman ably fills John's considerable shoes and doesn't miss a beat.  Fans of the original Styx line up will surely enjoy this look at the band in concert.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|The plot was good, not an incredible knock-out, but good.  It is Halle Berry's ability to draw me in to the storyline.  I think this is her best work to date.<br />While this is one of those \\"you're trapped in a dark world with lots of lights flickering on and off\\" movies, this time it works.  In fact, it works quite well.  Berry's character, Dr. Miranda Grey, has spunk and a likable personality.  She is strong and weak at the same time...a real life person.<br />I have sat through a lot of movies recently with a great deal of \\"boring time\\" saturating the films.  Not this one.  Director Mathieu Kassovitz did a great job of making a \\"just okay\\" plot spark on the screen.<br />I say ignore the bad reviews, give it a try.  If you don't like it, drop me an e-mail telling me I was wrong.  :-)[...]
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Finally we can see the full cut of Das Boot on DVD.  Not only does this new edition have a remastered anamorphic transfer, it finally has the full, original 4 hour 50 minute cut (290 minute)that was cropped into the US theatrical edition (2 1/2 hours) and the Director's Cut (3 1/2 hours), but in a movie where the quiet moments where we learn about the characters are the best, the original cut (it was originally made for TV as a 6 part mini-sieres)has my strongest recommendation.  The movie itself is the BEST submarine movie ever made without question, and also a realistic portrayal of life in a crowded, dirty German U-boat in WWII, filled with people who just want to go home and live normal lives, but due to the war are denied the chance.  You see throughout the movie that the characters are not sympathetic to the German cause and that they aren't really fighting for their country, but their lives. This is one of my favorite war movies for showing the war through a different viewpoint than the one normally seen and an example of great filmmaking (p.s. - aviod the dub at all costs - go for subtitles).
014028009X|4.0|I've been having a difficult time of late finding a book that holds and, more importantly, keeps my attention for any length of time. Am I jaded? Too easily bored? Tempted too easily by the lure of the tv? Probably. Having already seen the movie based upon this novel I knew what I was getting into when I turned the first page. A very funny, somewhat jaded, slightly over-the-top look at the modern girls' search for love. I figured I'd turn a few pages before becoming bored or distracted but was surprised when I quickly polished off 70 pages before nodding away to dreamland (from exhaustion not boredom). I found Bridget's lack of control when it came to nearly everything quite amusing and her constant (but never overwhelming) remorse realistic. She keeps on plugging away despite her setbacks and always maintains a wicked sense of snark that you've gotta love. Yeah, she's more than a little self-absorbed but I still loved her.<br />Some fave bits:<br />When Bridget ponders the weirdness of why one must apply mascara with mouth open, making me feel not-quite-so-odd for doing the same. It's these silly little comments on the mundane that kept me turning the pages.<br />Love Bridget's daily tallying up of her vices. This one is my favorite though:<br />Pg. 77 9st, alcohol units 5 (disgrace: urine of Satan), cigarettes 14 (weed of Satan - will give up on birthday)<br />Another favorite of mine (possible because I don't know the first thing about throwing a successful diner party) was her famous dinner party where she agonized over making the perfect. \\"Realize after all effort and expense have served my guests: blue soup, omelet, marmalade.\\"<br />A great read. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel someday soon.
0140277447|1.0|This book by Iris Chang is indeed mostly chinese propaganda. The Chinese have a vested interest in blaming the Japanese of atrocities so as to 1) hide the atrocities committed during their own civil war and \\"Cultural Revolution\\", and 2) extracting monetary payments from the Japanese government, as they in fact have been doing for the last 30 years. <BR>Note that it is easy to see that the photographs in this book have all clearly been doctored (I have seen the original versions of these photos in war books with different captions, and you can see where they have been edited here).<BR>Now, that does not mean that a massacre did not take place in Nanking in 1937 (although it seems that not only the Japanese but the chinese nationalists were also involved). But if you want the truth, this book is not the best way to find it.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|I can't stand this album.  She needsgreat production like Kanye West and featured guest to try to become the best.  Her Naturual voice never was appelaing to me.  Singers like Whitney Houston beat her in every way.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is the best 2Pac cd i have, i can honestly say i like the songs. The songs all have a mixture of great lyrics and beats 2 make some real hot songs. If you a true fan of hip-hop, this is one cd you need to add to your collection if you dont alreay have it.
0440236738|4.0|This was my first book by Harlan Coben but definitely not my last. If I ever find a moment of peace and quiet I will soon be adding his backlist to my wish list. Gone for Good had me interested from the first page to the last which is quite an accomplishment for me, the all-too-easily bored. I'm not a huge mystery fan and, to be honest, was somewhat dreading having to read this story for my suspense group because it contained so many pages (anything over 300 scares me). But it was terrific! I never knew where the plot was going to take me next and the characters were very well fleshed out and interesting and I truly enjoyed the glimpse into the world of a famous Yoga instructor (Yoga is my second addiction after books). A big draw for me was the heartrending emotionalism weaved within the story; I came close to tears on many occasions. This is a great book if you like some heart along with your suspense.
B000002KDO|4.0|This is a great album, it's one that I grew up on as well.  Listening to Sweet Leaf did not make me want to smoke pot nor do I love Pot after having tried it a couple of times as a dumb kid.  With that being said this is definitely classic Sabbath and maybe a bit more overlooked than Paranoid but in my book better.  Why?  I have heard Paranoid, War Pigs and Iron Man a million times on the radio and I'm tired of these overplayed songs.  Master of Reality doesn't get that kind of attention and it still sounds like great classic Sabbath.  Into the Void is my favorite track with some truly cool riffs and for all of you knotheads who think Black Sabbath is some sort of Satanic band, listen to the lyrics of Into the Void, you'll find quite the opposite is true.<br />Classic Sabbath. How can you go wrong by buying this album? 'Nuff said.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is the best synth-pop type album I have heard since Depeche Mode or Erasure.  Hell, this album even beats some of these guys later albums.  Radiohead's Kid A album delved into this shared territory where pop meets electronic in 2000.  Their album was rough, sharp, and sometimes over the top.  Postal Service has entered this same territory with smooth, flowing beats and soft gentle lyrics.  Thanks for not beating me over the head with it, guys. <br />Ever seen the episode of &quot;That 70's Show&quot; where they show the future and Fez has discovered Flock of Seagulls and is dressing like them and playing the keyboard?  That's how I feel.  It's like I have seen the future and am excited to be part of it.
B00004XMTH|5.0|This musical film was great! The costumes, make up, music, choreography, lyrics, special effets, and the scenery was brilliant. The actors and actresses did such a good job. Elaine Paige (Grizabella) sang Memory so incredible and so awsome, I am now a big fan of this song and also a fan of her. I was shocked to see Sir John Mills (Gus the Theatre Cat) in this production. He has been a lot movies I have enjoyed and I was happy to see him in one of my favorite musicals. Ken Page (Old Deuteronomy) had a powerful singing voice. I thought he did a fantastic job. John Partridge (Rum Tum Tugger) was excellent, he was very energetic, and new how to rock n' roll. This is a great Broadway movie and I suggest that anyone who loves musicals, go to a video store or Blockbuster and get this movie!
006441034X|5.0|This is such a charming little book. I purposely didn't read the back blurb and as such wasn't sure what to expect when I began the book (just had some vague memory of positive comments about the story) and I was continually surprised by the plot twists and turns. It's been far too long since I've read something that was pleasant through and through. I enjoyed Sophie's go with the flow attitude (can't say as I'd be nearly as accepting and pleasant as she initially was with her transformation!) and her quirky sense of humor. Howl, the cad, was a great character. Very selfish and self-centered and almost childishly funny at times, he managed to worm his way into my good graces by giving Michael & Sophie a home without conditions or questions.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|It's easy to say that Rufus is a genius, because he truly is. Unique? Yes. Uplifting? Definately. In a world full of pompous pop idol crap, Rufus Wainwright shines. He is so good, in fact, that I had to take a moment to write this review. I don't understand the negative reviews...I can only say that this music must have somehow inspired these people to log on to Amazon and give their crappy opinions and that certainly sparks a question, doesn't it? Probably all these reviewers are homophobic, as well? &quot;We hate&quot; very often means &quot;we fear&quot;, and then &quot;we love&quot;.<br />Shine on, Rufus !!!!!!!
B0000AK7AA|4.0|\\"The living impaired are known for haunting us,\\" Dr Harvey explains, \\"My question is what's haunting them.\\"  Dr. Harvey and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) are persuaded to leave Santa Fe and come to Friendship, Maine to live at Whipstaff Manor, to help new owner Carrigan Crittendon and her friend Dibs get rid of the ghosts haunting her manor. Casper the Friendly Ghost is very excited when he learns that Dr. Harvey and his pretty young daughter Kat are going to be living in his house (maybe he can finally make a friend!); but his ghostly uncles have other plans...<br />The premise of Casper is that ghosts exist, are \\"spirits with unfinished business\\" (hence they have not yet \\"crossed over\\"), and interact freely with \\"live\\" people at times;  (they haunt houses and wreak havoc on people who trespass there). For those who are worried about content: there is a scene where a man gets drunk in a bar and has an accident, there is a Halloween costume party, there are a few ghosts who are \\"mean\\" and play tricks and scare people, and a few arguments between characters in the film. There is a very sweet and innocent kiss between a girl and boy, but otherwise there is no objectionable content in that respect.  Language: there are a few swear words, so be aware!  <BR> <BR>If you can view this film with the belief that it is just a cute and funny film about \\"ghosts,&quot; which as we know do not exist, it is a most enjoyable film. If you cannot rest easy while watching a film about ghosts, then by all means don't watch it. For those of you who can separate the real from the unreal and the difference between spirits and ghosts, the supernatural world and the real world, this is a cute and endearing film about a friendly ghost named Casper and his new friend Kat.
B0000026UV|4.0|In the style of Chester and Lester the great partnering of Chet Atkins and Les Paul, comes Atkins and Mark Knopfler. It is always great to see to excellent guitarists with different styles sit in with each other and jam, and \\"Neck and Neck\\" is no different. But, it does not quite have the same magic as the old Chester and Lester albums. Here, Knopfler pulls on his Country roots and plays more to the music style of Atkins. It may be hard to recognize Knopfler's playing as it is a departure from his rock, but is in line with his Notting Hillbillies days.<br />The album opens with a country-blues tune, \\"Poor Boy Blues\\" with both men doubling on guitar and vocals. Each takes a turn at soloing, the master and the student, both quick and excellent. The tune is an upbeat toe-taper. The days of Chester and Lester are revisited with \\"There'll Be Some Changes Made\\" where Atkins and Knopfler go back and forth about their playing style...Atkins to start playing rock and roll and wearing leather and makeup like \\"Jackson and Prince\\" while Knopfler tries to keep him where he belongs. The barbs they give each other while they trade solos are fun. \\"Yakety Axe\\" is kinda fun Country ditty. \\"Tahitian Skies\\" sounds like a mix of their versions of \\"Why Worry\\", airy and jazzy.<br />This is a good album from two guitar greats. Nothing to amazing comes out of this, just good songs with some solid guitar work. You'll get a couple of laughs out of this album, and if you like Atkins and Country, this is a good album to have.
B00008J4P5|3.0|The White Stripes - Elephant (2003)<br /><br />This one's a step closer to regular blues-based music and not as good as WHITE BLOOD CELLS, although \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is surely the best song they've done yet. I do appreciate the fact that they shun computers and use only old-school recording equipment even though I tend to like music that pushes technological boundaries.<br /><br />Jack White rocks out quite a bit on ELEPHANT and I wouldn't call him an over-rated guitarist, either. Meg White is a spirited drummer but her vocal contributions just sound like a little girl (and not a very impressive one). \\"In The Cold Cold Night\\" does nothing for me and the \\"we all love each other\\" last track may be cute to some, but I just find it annoying.<br /><br />Otherwise, there's definitely some cool songs on this album, but it never really clicked with me. That's why I decided to give it 3 stars. I'm much more likely to reach for WHITE BLOOD CELLS or DE STIJL than this one.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|ALIEN QUADRILOGY is the most definitive, exhaustingly researched, jam packaged box of ALIEN movies that could ever be assembled.  Hopefully if a fifth one is released, it too can blend right in.  In the box there are four movies and each movie gets two discs.  One with an original theatrical version and the other a \\"directors\\" or \\"special\\" edition with added footage.  The second disc for each movie is jam packed with documenteries, script drafts, screen tests, story boards, photo galleries i.e. THE WORKS.  A ninth disc carries what wouldn't fit on the other discs in terms of content.  All of the movies get a facial treatment in the way of remastered picture and sound quality.  (ALIEN in particular stunned me with its bright and clear picture.  The whites are bright, and the blacks are dark.)<br />ALIEN, my favorite in the series.  Why I like this one the most is it has the best cast, best pacing and the methods that the crew use are more in a mind of science instead of brute force to get rid of the creature.  The 2003 special edition has a few added scenes which are alternate takes for the most part of deleted scenes on the out of print Alien DVD (viewable on the ninth disc).  None of the scenes added really add much save for the infamous \\"lost scene\\" and some original scenes are even taken out.  At the very least Dallas's line \\"I don't trust anybody\\" is gone.  Damn that line is old and boring!  Of all of the non theatrical versions, this one is probably the worst and ranks in \\"Star Wars\\" quality of Special Editions, in other words you'll long for the original after watching it, because not all that much added was all that special.<br />ALIENS is a pure combat movie by James Cameron and is probably the most popular of the 4 movies.  The special ediiton here has been around for awhile and for the first time the original version is here on DVD as well.  The Special Ediiton this time is clearly the better film because it seamlessly adds to the story without compromise or distraction and is a basis for how extended special editions should be done.<br />ALIEN 3 is the [an illegitimate child] child of the four.  Now famous director David Fincher (the skunk wouldn't even do a commentary and reportadly walked out before the movie was done) had problems with changing scripts, changing storys in other words nothing worked the way it should have and turned into a mess.  The Special Edition here is supremely better then the original with a story that makes a little more sense and shows that with some work, bad or underappreciated movies can get a second chance.  You'll never watch the theatrical version again after this one.<br />ALIEN RESURECTION wasn't all that great when I first saw it.  After watching it again, it's improved marginally.  What started out showing the thought and splendor of the first movie unfortunatly turns into \\"more of the same\\" by the end.  The special edition doesn't add a whole lot but what is there is worth seeing.<br />Before there was two great and two lousy ALIEN movies.  There are still two great ones, 3 gets promoted to \\"decent\\" and Reserection, well is less lousy.  Get them all in this great set.<br />By the way in case you were wondering in regards to other viewers on Amazon, none of my discs are scratched and play without a hitch.or distraction and is a basis for how extended special editions should be done.<br />ALIEN 3 is the [an illegitimate child] child of the four.

0312263120|3.0|Not up to Brown's par. To be fair this was written in 1998 and I read it in 3/04. The computer references are dated relative to now. Plus I get the sneaking feeling that Brown is writing about material that he is not entirely comfortable with. Nonetheless a good plot and a good book.

B00003CXCT|5.0|After a long long wait, we get one of motion pictures greatest series in an awsome box set that is worth any price.  As you all know, Star Wars is one of movies best series and is the best Sci-fi series.  The acting in these movies are unbeatable, the special effects are unbelievable and the action is superb.  I don't know what the features will be like in this set, but I'm sure it will be good.  I like R2D2.  He's a cute little robot, that only C3-PO can understand.  I don't know if the first 2 in the star wars saga are really worth buying because there nothing no where near the other 3.  Maybe the 3 star wars will be a good film.  Who knows, we can only wait.  Since the Indiana Jones trilogy was realesed on dvd, it's about time they realesed the star wars trilogy.  The series will be in Widescreen and maybe we will get a Fullscreen box set for the people who like Fullscreen better.  We'll just have to wait and find out.<br />Star Wars Episode 4- This is may second favorite of the series including the first 2.  It has great acting and action mixed in with some slick humor that makes a perfect movie.  Ofcoarse Luke Skywalker isn't a good Jedi yet, because he onlt started.  He gets better in the later sequels.<BR>10/10<br />Star Wars Episode 5: Return Of The Jedi- This is an awsome movie, but some how didn't have the magic of episode 4.  It was still a great movies with good acting skills, but some how it lacked on the action.  That's the wat it seemed for me.  I still loved it.<BR>9/10<br />Star Wars Episode 6: The Empire Strikes Back- This is my favorite out of the whole entire series.  It had awsome acting, lots of action and tons of humor.  Mix all that together and you got Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.  This is an awsome movie and is one of my favorite movies of all time.<BR>10/10<BR>So don't wait, order this set, NOW.
0671027387|4.0|Not as good as Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demon's. Better that Digital Fortress. Nonetheless this is a wonderfully enjoyable and unpredictable book. My only regret is that I have to wait for Brown to write another book. This guy can flat out write. Forgetaboutit.
0446310786|4.0|In Maycomb, a small town in the south of the USA, Jean Louise, her brother Jem and their friend Dill spend their most exciting summer in their young life. While they discover their mysterious neighbourhood, Jean Louise and Jem's father, called Atticus, has to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, who is charged with the rape of a white girl. So Atticus gets into trouble with the society which has prejudices against Blacks.<BR>The book is very recommendable because it shows how young children grow up in a town full of prejudices. After some time they learn how to behave in such a situation and get great civil courage. So they loose their naive view of life and their imagination of justice.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is awesome!  I bought it for the song &quot;This Love&quot; but after the first time putting in my system I can't stop listening to the whole thing!  This is definitely a great deal and you won't be dissapointed!  I sure wasn't!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This title refers NOT to the band but the \\"reviewers\\" of it! Evryone is so quick to join the \\"It's all been done before... blah blah blah\\" bandwagon (which is in itself a MASSIVELY hackneyed cliche now!) The point is: ALL music is in some way derivative. It's hilarious reading the reviews which all too easily belie either the ages of the \\"critics\\"/consumers or their complete lack of understanding about one of music's primary goals or functions; namely to BE FUN and ENTERTAINING both of which this CD is in DROVES! The \\"highly original\\" Beatles and much-lauded Rolling Stones were after all indelibly influenced by the likes of Buddy Holly, The Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, country, latin and even Hawaiian music as well as numerous other artists and genres who/which came before them. Were they \\"retro?\\" Were they unoriginal hacks? The point is that taken in the context of what the rest of the current music scene is (de!)composed of (heinously horriffic karaoke-gone-overboard: American Idol included - talk about UNoriginal... not to mention wholly irrelevant musically-speaking in the context of plaintive organic bands and not pre-fabricated corporate sales and marketing savvy and tactics!) Jet are fun, fresh, and organic. CHOCKABLOCK FULL of enthusiasm and passion. They believe in what they're doing and it shows! Due to ageist discrimination in the music industry - there really aren't any great 70's classic rock bands getting any airplay for their new material OR such once-great bands have simply \\"progressed\\" away from the very thing that once made them great. Furthermore: Are You Gonna Be My Girl resembles Lust For Life as much as Lust For Life resembles You Can't Hurry Love. If rhythm is how one goes about determining that one song sounds the same as another - then one should be tested for tone deafness as the melodies and arrangements of Are You Gonna Be My Girl and Lust For Life are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. If you're not a pretentious wannabe critic stickin the mud who lacks a sense of humour and fun - BUY THIS CD and prepare to find out why SO many young musicians are enamoured with 70's classic rock. These kids do it right and real with a fresh integrity and heart that makes them totally original. In the words of timeless wisdom: \\"It is the emotion and attitude imbued in the performance which renders it once again fresh and original, hauling it from the quagmire of banal triteness and cliched plagerism. It is the contextual backdrop of the times and zeitgeist which determines if a thing is 'different' from that which is happening in the \\"mainstream.\\"
B00008ADPF|5.0|(...)I listen to every type of music, including country, punk, nu-metal. I love the old rock stuff, bad company, bob seger, ZZ top.. all that. But I'm not too set in my ways to admit that I LOVE this Nickelback CD. Its incredible, and Chad Kroeger's voice is hot throughout the entire album. <BR>1-Flat on the floor: 9/10, good in-your-face opener, not what you would be expecting from Nickelback but still it has a great beat which is the case w/most of the songs on this CD. <BR>2-Do this Anymore: 10/10, I love this song... great beat.<BR>3-Someday: 9/10, I give it that based only on the fact that it IS incredibly overplayed on the radio and music channels, but the first time I heard it I fell in love with it! Still a great song, a little worn out though.<BR>4-Believe it or not: 8/10, A little boring and repetitive at the beginning but they tear it up at the chorus which is my favorite part. <BR>5-Feelin way to damn good: 7/10, this song bores me a little, I know it has great reviews and its not bad. I wouldn't skip over it...<BR>6-Because of you: 7/10, I don't really like the beat to this song... not one that I can listen to over and over, but once again I wouldn't skip over it.<BR>7-Figured you out: 9/10, I like the \\"dark\\" lyrics to this one, and the I-don't-care attitude about it.<BR>8-Should've listened: 10/10, one of my favorites on the CD, a great acoustic- shows off Kroeger's sexy voice.<BR>9-Throw yourself away: 9/10, good song, good lyrics... overall its good. <BR>10-Another hole in the head: 9/10, good for the first few listens, wears out pretty easily though. <BR>11-See you at the show: 8/10, same as track 10 but it gets old a little faster.<BR>12-Saturday nights alright: 10/10, An AWESOME remake!! They tear it up... probably my favorite on the CD. <BR>13-Yanking out my heart: 10/10, another of my favorites, great beat. <BR>14-Learn the hard way: 9/10, not bad until the chorus.<br />I know this is a long review but I hope it was a little helpful to potentialbuyers.. this cd isn't a waste of money at all and the first listen through is incredible, just don't expect it to sound like the old Nickelback...
0441172717|5.0|This is one of the finest works of science fiction ever crafted, containing some of the most memorable phrases ever invented.  I will leave it to the reader to enjoy the litany that includes the famous phrase, &quot;Fear is the Mind Killer.&quot;<br />Herbert successfully weaves an epic tale of rebellion and religion.  It is the tale of a man who becomes a messiah, and discovers many things about himself, the Empire he lives in, and the world of Dune.<br />Herbert paints a world in which man can travel between stars, yet no longer uses computers; a place where fencing skills are often more useful than energy weapons; a land of soldiers, assassins, prophets, mystics, nobles, monsters.  It is about love, passion, resistance--and the effect that the appearance of a messiah has on a culture.<br />Sadly, much of Herbert's sequels don't live up to this first book.  However, it is an entirely satisfying epic in its own right--if you never read the other books, this one will still live on in your memory forever.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|What's not to enjoy? The script has Snap!, Crackle!, and Pop! Also several moments of genuine tenderness as well as natural hilarity. As ably directed by Nancy Meyers whose previous work in What Women Want is also first-rate, the cast is excellent and  Diane Keaton's Academy Award nomination for best actress (as Erica Barry) in a leading role was well-deserved. I also expected a nomination for Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn. The supporting cast is also fine, notably Frances McDormand (Zoe Barry) and Keanu Reeves (Julian Mercer). The core situation is that the wealthy and charming Harry is dating (at least for the moment) Erica's daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) and accompanies her for a weekend in the Hamptons where her divorcee mother (a successful playwright) has a lovely oceanside home. Of course, Erica and her sister Zoe appear unexpectedly.<br />As a result of his hedonistic lifestyle, Harry suffers a heart attack unrelated to Erica. After emergency care by Julian, he is released but must reside nearby during the recovery period. Guess where? Of course, he and Erica fall in love. Meanwhile, prior to Harry's appearance in his life, Julian had become strongly attracted to Erica...not to her daughter. Apparently she has had no romance in her life since the divorce and is currently hard at work on a new play which is not going very well. Harry eventually becomes well enough to return to Manhattan. And then....<br />Eventually, both Harry and Erica must make very difficult choices. It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to explain what those decisions prove to be. However, I feel free to say that the decisions are juxtaposed very effectively with various humorous incidents, a few of which are featured in the trailer shown in theaters. Yes, this is a comedy but it also has some attitude. On occasion, an edge. There are implications to the lives which the two seniors have led, prior to their meeting. The resolutions of various conflicts (both major and minor) are entirely plausible, except -- in my opinion -- for one which involves Erica and Julian. See this entertaining, sometimes serious film and then reach your own conclusions.<br />The special features provided with the DVD include a \\"Commentary\\" by director Nancy Meyers, producer Bruce Brock, and actress Diane Keaton, another \\"Commentary\\" by director Nancy Meyers and actor Jack Nicholson, a \\"Hamptons House Set Tour\\" with Amanda Peet, and \\"Harry Sings Karaoke to Erica\\" (a deleted scene).  For whatever reasons, Keaton chose not to contribute much but Nicholson did and, as always, is charming, articulate, and generous. Contrary to his persona in so many films, Nicholson is renowned among his film colleagues for the same endearing qualities which are evident in one of the commentaries.th major and minor) are entirely plausible, except -- in my opinion -- for one which involves Erica and Julian.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|You will love or hate this film - it's not one likely to produce lukewarm impression.  <br />Maybe it should come with a sticker \\"WARNING: THIS IS NOT AN \\"ENTERTAINMENT\\" FLICK\\", because the negative reviews here complain 'nothing happens' in the movie.  That's true - in the car-chase -> hot-sex -> happy ending sense.  Instead, this quiet film relies on beautiful cinematography (not special effects) and the actors' ability to communicate with out speaking, to create a story.  <br />It's not \\"Titanic\\", and wasn't intended to be.  It's more \\"Kundun\\", or \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" - it gives a sense of place, and a visual depiction of the isolation someone can feel, even when they're surrounded by people.  And if you are hesitating because it's \\"another 20 year old girl with 50 year old guy\\" - don't.  It's much better than that. <br />If you are a traveler, I think you'll be hard-pressed not to enjoy it. And for your information, I love Caddy Shack, Stripes, and Rushmore, but this is Bill Murray's absolute finest performance. In any other year, he would have won the Oscar.
B00005NP04|4.0|The song 'Concrete Angel' touched me in a way that few songs have; this is a review of that song.<br />I normally do not listen to country music, but this video was on the TV at the gym one day and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since. 'Concrete Angel' really drives home the horror of child abuse. It has a beautiful melody, but more than that it conveys (as well as a music video can) the situation of so many kids who are in abusive environments.<br />Since I first heard 'Concrete Angel', I've sampled several of Martina's other songs including 'Independence Day' and have been impressed by her clear vocals and straightforward lyrics. Kudos to Martina for using her venerable vocal talents to address real, tough social issues. I am looking forward to purchasing her 'Greatest Hits'.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Not much to be said that hasn't been said before. If you like foreign films in line with Cinema Paradiso, Il Postino, etc., there is no doubt you will enjoy Life is Beautiful. This is NOT a film about the holocaust, but rather the extent of a father-son bond and the lengths a father will go to protect the family that he loves.

B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down's self-titled album is not only the best of their three released albums, but also in my top 5 for greatest albums ever released.  Really, you have to buy it.  It's eclectic, beautiful, harmonious, heavy--everything that can be expected from a metal CD.  It sort of breaks the boundaries and cuts the bonds.  IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY MUSIC OR SYSTEM OF A DOWN FAN!!!!!!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Clapton pays hommage to his lifelong idol, comforter and influence Robert Johnson. He does so in a From The Cradle kind of way, playing with many the same musicians as he did then. So it became a great record based on Johnson's songs. If you like the bluesey Clapton, you'll love this record.<br />Four stars instead of five because the record title suggests this is an intimate musical one-on-one, when, in fact, EC had an entire band to make up for the Delta Bluesman's single-handed. At least one unplugged number should have been on there. So there is a little too much Chicago and way too little Delta on the disc. This being said, I have to emphasize that the songs are beautifully played and sung.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I waited patiently and excitedly for this movie to be released last year, but boy i was i mad when i left the movies. i thought the point of this movie was to tie up the loose ends, but all it did was leave more loose ends. they talked and talked but never said a thing. just a bunch of gibberish. i havent seen it on dvd yet but i at least hope it has some extra stuff to fill in the blanks.<br />p.s. at least the some of the action wasnt too bad.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Yours truly appears an extra in more than one scene of BIG FISH, so my perspective is somewhat skewed or different, but the professionliasm of everyone involved with the on-location effort was impressive. I thought the resulting release was a sweet story, somewhat like a whimsical, extended episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. It's considered the most, er, down-to-earth thing Tim Burton's ever done, and for that reason along, longtime Burton fans will either love BIG FISH or they won't like it at all; i.e., there probably won't be much \\"gray area\\" regarding this movie. Minor annoyances include pseudo-Southern accents from a couple of performers, but that's 'coz I'm from the Deep South myself...y'know whut ah mean, bubba?
0446677450|2.0|This book does a great job teaching the rich and upper middle class people how to make more money. One thing that I think it's missing is how the poor are supposed to climb out of the slums and become rich. The book gives the differences between the rich and the upper middle classes, but not the poor. Poor people, I mean poverty stricken, do not own homes, do not have time to go to college, and for sure do not have time to become more financially intelligent. Becoming rich is a lot easier said then done. The author tells the reader ways to become rich, but of course these ways are a lot easier said then done. It seems as if the author thinks that he can solve everyone's financial situation through this book. I am here to tell you that he for sure cannot and for sure does not. You have to be an extremely lucky person to be able to make a business from scratch, or extremely talented. Personally that is way to hard and way to risky for normal people to do, while supporting a family and paying the bills at the same time. Sure if you have extra money in the bank and want to become richer you should take some risks and invest, or spend some extra time building a business, or buy some real estate. But for the rest of us normal people that is probably not going to happen. The author also makes people that have questions sound idiotic. He repeats himself about how he has to continually answer the same questions. Some of the questions asked to him are: How do u get rich? Or, How do you start off? I still don't think this book has answered these questions fully.  On top of this the book is also very repetitive, explaining simple things over and over.
1401300901|1.0|Not much else you can say.  It's simply not good.<br />The idea of the plot is ok, but it's poorly executed, the writing is awful, the charactors aren't well drawn, and the dialogue actually hurts as you try to read it.<br />If I could give it 0 stars, I would.  Avoid it.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Please, if you're a lover of stunning, subtle and nuanced singing, superb, flawlessly musical piano solos and a combo that is so tight it squeaks, ignore the one-star reviews by the tin-eared didacts who don't comprehend this album and treat yourself to a fine evening of music. You'll listen again and again and again. It goes down like a fine cognac.
0807219908|2.0|I found the writing style interesting and enjoyable, but found the characters to be so stupid that I could not enjoy reading the story aloud to my 6 and 9-year-old children.  I caught myself thinking again and again \\"no one would do that\\" Yet; the book was filled with seemingly real meanness and danger. I can't think of an appropriate age for this book because no one over 9 would find it believable and the creepiness is way too creepy for anyone under 12 in my opinion.
0061015725|4.0|For the record, &quot;Prey&quot; has been only the second Crichton book I was able to actually finish; the first book was &quot;Airframe&quot;.  I have five of Michael's other novels, three of which I tried to get through (&quot;Timeline&quot;, &quot;Congo&quot; and &quot;Disclosure&quot;), two of which I haven't yet started (&quot;Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;A Case Of Need&quot;, which had been written under the alias of Jeff Hudson).<BR>Crichton's latest, &quot;Prey&quot;, was good and kept me entertained.  Michael is, obviously, very intellegent (he graduated from Harvard and from Harvard Medical School, then traded the opportunity to be an MD to be an author, though he didn't exactly lose much in the way of being successful), but &quot;Prey&quot; seemed, at least to me, that Michael is just smart enough to convey a halfway decent story.  He puts in so much fact--there's a bibliography at the end--that his fiction comes across almost like non-fiction.  It seems like Michael tackles issues and topics that only he can fully comprehend, then tries to present them fictitiously.<BR>The narrative of &quot;Prey&quot; is divided into four parts: &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Desert&quot;, &quot;Nest&quot; and the title ending &quot;Prey&quot;.  The main character, Jack Forman, is the first-person narrator.  The story, from the perspective of fiction, was neat; the story's premise, being non-fiction, was what was weird, as the story didn't allow me to fully grasp the issues of genetics, nanotechnology and distributed intelligence, which is why Crichton included the bibliography--so I myself could do the required research.  Therefore, I, for the most part, ignored the story's premise and enjoyed it as fiction.<BR>The narrative, in terms of langauge, was surprisingly simplistic; but this was, perhaps, due to the first-person POV.  Part One was a little long and drawn-out, puts forth a bit too much back-story, but Part Two, Part Three and Part Four kept me turning the pages.  However, what could've been done differently was the ending of Part Four.  The story's conclusion wasn't the conclusion of the novel--the last few pages (before the bibliography) convey paragraphs of explanation, almost like an indirect epilogue--and at the start there is an indirect prologue.  Though the prologue had its purpose, it's too bad that Michael couldn't have integrated such afterward explanation into the story, as in more show and less tell.<BR>Though I deem the premise as &quot;weird&quot;, the novel can be understood if it's not taken too seriously.  Other readers' reviews claim that the story has factual errors and glaring holes in its plot; well then, evidently, several readers took the novel more seriously than I.  Overall, &quot;Prey&quot;, I feel, is a worthwhile read.  The First-Edition hardcover copy I have is well worth the price I paid--one dollar--and the book's condition is like-new, too.<BR>I give &quot;Prey&quot; a rating of 4 stars, though, because, even if its premise isn't taken too seriously, the book isn't perfect.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Don't get me wrong.  I'm one of the original dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fanatics.  I was eight years old when I saw Star Wars in the theater for the first time, and, like millions of other people, became an overnight lifelong fan.  Bought all the action figures and toys-had the posters on my walls-the whole nine yards.  Looked at another way, I'm part of the considerable fan base that elevated George Lucas to the lofty position he's in today as the head of Lucasfilm Ltd.  A position that affords him complete control over these releases.<br />That said, I won't be buying these DVD's.  <br />Yes, Star Wars is one of the greatest trilogies of all time.  Yes, it's one of the most important cinematic milestones in the history of the medium in terms of its box office success and its influence.  So, why am I calling 'no joy?'  I see no need to lay down my money for what are, arguably, remakes of the classic movies I fell in love with as a child.  <br />Not that I mind the new special effects additions.  I can understand why Lucas might want to pump up the FX to make these films more visually appealing to newer generations of moviegoers who are far more jaded than I was in the late 70's.  But these so-called enhanced versions aren't the versions I care about.  What adds to the disappointment is the fact that the DVD medium is capable of containing both the 'enhanced' versions and the classic versions, allowing viewers to choose whichever they want.  But do we get that luxury?  No.  Instead, we're asked to placate ourselves with the remade versions now and then spend even more money down the road to buy the classic versions in some Ultimate Edition-the version these DVD's should have contained from the very beginning.  (At least I'm assuming the classic versions will be released at a later date.  I don't know that for sure.)  People-even devout fans-don't like being jerked around that way.<br />Lucas has already made his fans wait a 'long, long time...' for this DVD release.I'm very disappointed to see that the thanks we get for our patience is to be told he expects us to buy this on DVD not once but twice(?).  Sorry, but no.  I own these movies on VHS, and will continue to watch them in that format for an equally long time to come.  Lessons to Lucas and the rest of Hollywood: 1) Don't mess with a cultural icon.  2) If you can't follow lesson 1, at least don't deny true fans the classic version of a film.
B00005JL1C|4.0|What is it that makes the 80s so special? It is almost like these beautiful years are the ultimate result of youth fighting through a rapidly changing world where things speed up, and where fighting for independance, emotions and love has become an art. Nothing captures this art better than movies. And there are few who can do this as great as John Hughes.<BR>Yes, ofcourse the 80s are my youthful years and everyone romances his youth, but I am certain that the 60s, 70s were great years, and the 80s is the sum of all that.<BR>Some kind of wonderful takes you right into the 80s rollercoaster with the cool drum scene opening of Mary Steward Masterson , the typical interactions between the teenagers and the punk and wave influences apparent in the clothing. Also the social groups becom clear. The punk-wave guy, the pretty popular girl, the alternative girl, the average normal neighbour boy (Stolz), the spoiled popular macho bratt, etc.<BR>This combination was even enlarged in the best 80s picture ever, the breakfast club. It beautifully captures the different social groups on a highschool.<BR>Some kind of wonderful, makes you happy, gives you that warm, first love feeling in which you would wrap yourself in as in a warm blanket. Just like the breakfast club, secret admirer, pretty in pink or st. Elmos fire....its makes you feel young....like the teenager you are of the 80s
0201633612|3.0|Design Patterns was originally published in 1995 and is now on its 27th reprint.    It is the seminal work in Object Oriented programming.  The authors have collectively made major contributions to every aspect of computer science and software development.  Heck, the book is still not available in soft cover.    It is well organized and greatly informative.  The writing style is clear and all but novice programmers should have no problem getting through the book.    But if you are buying the book to learn Java or C#, work mostly on database and web applications or are only going to buy one book on the subject, this may not be the best choice.    We really need a second edition from these leaders of OO programming.    The book is still 100% accurate and correct.  But its contemporary audience was probably other computer scientists and experienced programmers who wanted to learn the emerging model.  Accordingly, the book's code samples are in C++ and Smalltalk.  The authors usually show the application of each pattern by solving problems from the GUI application development world.  In 1995, designing portable windowing systems was probably the hottest project around (the Wintel world was still on 3.11 remember).      Thanks in no small part to Design Patterns, developers have tackled the challenges of windowing.  Now, developers are probably more focused on the Internet, database portability and web services.  They are using new OO languages like Java and C# (and C++).      An audience trying to work through those problems with those languages may find the book just slightly out of reach.  Or at least somewhat indirect: you have to make up your own Java code samples and figure out how some of the patterns that solve GUI portability might facilitate database portability.      Of course the point of the pattern is that it can be reused to solve all kinds of problems.  But it's easier to learn the patterns if the book covers the problems you are trying to solve.    Depending on your goal, this feedback on Design Patterns may not be a problem.  The book is clearly written, informative and accurate.  And if you have the budget for a great reference work, Design Patterns is still the seminal text on the subject.  As a hardcover, it looks impressive on the bookshelf.    Other shoppers might look for another title more applicable to their specific needs.      A great introduction to OO design is Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design [...] Hope this helps.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I enjoyed this film, but I would have enjoyed it more if all these reviewers hadn't given away the ending and told me the ship sinks!
0060977264|1.0|&quot;By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept&quot; by Paolo Coelho deals with two childhood friends who were extremely fond of each other but were separated when the boy leaves the village to explore the world and to find himself. Years later, they met again at a conference and realized that they never got over each other. The love that they felt for each other when they were children were still very much alive now that they both reached adulthood. Both characters had inner conflicts that they need to deal with. For Pilar, the main character in the book, was one who never did leave her village and who sought to lead a peaceful and predictable life was drawn to childhood friend. She was torn between leaving something that she is familiar with (returning to her village, get a husband, etc) and following this man to new places and learn new things. For him, he was torn between the love he felt for Pilar and the fact that he believed he has the ability to perform miracles and therefore heal the sick. <br />The story started out nicely enough until the author decided to concentrate mostly on Catholicism. For those of us who are not Catholics, it is difficult to understand the Catholics' heavy emphasis on Virgin Mary. At some point, Coelho seems to place equal importance between Mary and Jesus. I agree with one reviewer who said that the book cover of this book totally neglected any mention of Catholicism and gave the impression that it was a love story. I honestly did not enjoy this book, and feel that there are much better books out there. However, if you are a die hard fan of Coelho, this may appeal to you as his unique writing and poetic expression is very much visible in this book.
0446310786|4.0|The novel &quot;To kill a mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee is about the narrator Scout who is a little girl and grows up in this novel. she lives with her father Atticus, her brother Jem and their cook Calpurnia in a little town called Maycomb.<BR>Atticus is a lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of raping a white girl. Equality and honesty are very important for Atticus and he teaches his children to live according to his principles.<BR>At the beginning of the novel the author tells too much about Scout, Jem and her friend Dill who bother the mystery man next door. The author also write too much about the citizens in Maycomb, especially about Scout neighbours. <BR>The society has many prejudices against blacks and the great injustice is shown during the trial of Tom Robinson.<BR>All in all it is an interesting book because the reader is well informed about the situation in the Southern States of America in the 1930s and the society and their way of life at that time.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This movie is awesome. It has a good story line plus some of the best special effects I have ever seen. The blood and gore was top notch. I can watch this over and over again. Pick this up today.
B000008H1W|5.0|Jethro Tull's music is so complex and indiosyncratic that 1) it is impossible to classify or even characterize; 2) it is rather an \\"acquired taste;\\" and 3) at its best, not only do you never get tired of it, but it gets better with every hearing. This disc is all of those things in spades. This is one of the 7 or so Tull albums I owned and played incessantly back in the mid-70s. Recently, when my turntable finaly reached the point that I couldn't patch it up any more, there were very few albums of that vintage that I bothered to replace with CDs, but this one was at the very top of the list. As much as I love Tull, on reflection I realize that many of the other albums were mixtures of some real gems and quite a few clunkers. This one is uniformly superb, and not just because it is a fairly coherent \\"concept album.\\" In particular, the mixture and balance of the various contrapuntal sounds, including the string section as well as the famous quirky flute and the usual rock instruments, is outstanding, and this stage in the evolution of the lineup surrounding Anderson and Barre (Barlow, Hammond-Hammond, Evan) was the one with the best synergy. Anderson's vocals and nonsensical-yet-profound lyrics were never better, the quality of the flute playing is by far the best, and the flute is integrated into the overall flow of the songs as it rarely was elsewhere. While the title track and One White Duck probably got the most semi-popular play back when it was released, to me it might be Cold Wind to Valhalla and Black Satin Dancer that wear the best now. Baker Street Muse remains an amazing example (even better than the epic Thick as a Brick) of an extended, medley-type assemblage that somehow clearly hangs together. My only regret is that I am somewhat reluctant to introduce these gems to my nearly-teenage daughters because they might listen a bit too closely to the words! They also might well, like most people, have to have the patience to listen about 10 times before getting over the quirky rhythms and the not-always-hummable melodies and beginning to appreciate how great this stuff really is. In my middle age I recently had the same experience with the Shostakovich string quartet #8, so I know how it feels.
B00005JMEW|5.0|kill bill is an amazing movie, just as pulp fiction is.  the swift and dramatic change in chapters, and the uniqeness that lies in each chapter, only added to the action and excitement of the movie.  tarantino is by far one of my favorite directors, and him casting uma therman (a favorite actress of mine) only made the movie THAT much better.  i cannot wait for it to be released on april 13, and to be followed only three days later for volume two to be set in theaters....finally!!!
B000000OSG|5.0|The foul-mouthed Guns 'N Roses really get raunchy with this set. Some of these songs like on this album's twin USE YOUR ILLUSION 1,would be prohibited from radio airplay by the Federal Communications Comission. I did hear CIVIL WAR on the radio once back in '91 shortly after the release of UYI1 and UYI2. The band covers Bob Dylan's KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR which first appeared on the DAYS OF THUNDER movie soundtrack album in 1990. In addition to KOHD,hits from this album include YESTERDAYS,ESTRANGED,DON'T CRY with alternate lyrics and YOU COULD BE MINE first released as a single from the movie TERMINATOR 2. The film's star Arnold Schwarzenegger appears with the band in the video. &quot;alternate lyrics&quot; appears in parentheses following the listing of DON'T CRY just like &quot;original&quot; on UYI1. Awesome album just like UYI1.
0446310786|4.0|The story of the book &quot;To kill a mockingbird&quot; is told by the maincharacter Scout Finch. Her father is a lawyer who defends a black who is accused of raping a white girl.Theres just one big problem: Nearly the whole town is full of racism and treats blacks unfairly.<BR>You do not really know what to expect when reading the titel &quot;To kill a mockingbird&quot;. What you may associate with this titel is death, murder etc. Its not wrong. Harper Lees novel is about racism in the 1950s.<BR>This has always been a striking topic throughout American History. Therefore it often has been presented in many films and other books. But to kill a mockingbird is one of the most interesting ones; <BR>- many exciting conflicts and events between ethic groups<BR>-detailed presentation of persons etc.<BR>But the best is to get your own imagination by reading this novel!
B000000OSE|5.0|Isn't that cool that Guns 'n Roses released two albums at once in September 1991? Bruce Springsteen would do the same the following year. APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION sold over thirty million copies so it should have been nominated for a platinum Grammy. G 'N R LIES was a megahit also. This album and its twin,USE YOUR ILLUSION II would go platinum as well. This is another profanity-filled album. Every Guns 'n Roses member is a trashmouth,undoubtedly. LIVE AND LET DIE is a cover of Paul McCartney's 1973 hit that was written by him and his late first wife Linda Eastman McCartney. DON'T CRY was a hit also. There's a different set of lyrics for that song on the twin. The word &quot;original&quot; appears in parentheses following the title. NOVEMBER RAIN is another hit. In the video,frontman W. Axl Rose weds his supermodel girlfriend Stephanie Seymour. Other profanity-filled tunes are DON'T DAMN ME,BAD APPLES,RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HELL,DUST 'N BONES and the 10 minute and 6 second COMA. All the other songs are great.
0446310786|5.0|By reading Harper Lee's over 30.000.000 sold novel, which also won the Pulizer Prize, the reader can explore the prejudices against the unknown and the racism of a province in the 1930`s trough the eyes of the young girl Scout, a laywyer's daughter. Scout and her brother Jem are frightened of Boo Radley, who isn't known by the people in Maycomb, although there are a lot of rumors about him. The lawyer Atticus Finch defends the afro-american man Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping the poor white girl Mayella Ewells. <br />This book fascinates me, because it shows the racism and hate of this world from another perspective than the most other novels do. It shows that it is wrong to judge people only because they are different from you.
B000000P17|4.0|I believe the title of this album is a parody of a movie entitled &quot;The Linguini Incident&quot;. This album contains songs previously recorded by other artists. One of them is SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU which was a hit. I don't know the name of the artist who first recorded the song back in the fifties,but I do know it was previously covered by Art Garfunkel. DOWN ON THE FARM tells about boring life on the farm. W. Axl Rose sings &quot;I feel just like a vegetable&quot;,&quot;I feel like a fish out of water&quot;, and &quot;Everything smells like horse----!&quot; on that song. There are other profanity-filled favorites like ATTITUDE,I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU,BUICK MAKANE and AIN'T IT FUN. This album sold far less than Guns 'n Roses previous albums. Also the group disbanded after this album. All the other songs are cool.
0446310786|4.0|The novel \\" To Kill a Mockingbird \\" by Harper Lee is about a girl called Scout. She grows up in this novel in the 1930`s. Her father Atticus is a widowed lawyer and defends the Afrian American Tom Robinson. Scouts brother is called Jem. Their cook Calpurnia is a black women. She is like a mother for Scout. Scout and Jem are very modern educated. Atticus teaches them to treat everybody equally. He is a very important model for both. <BR>To my mind the first chapters are very boring and difficult to read, because Harper Lee tells too much about the children Scout, Jem and their friend Dill. Even the account of the citizens and their relationship could be shorter.<BR>Wighing the pros and cons one comes to the conclusion that this book informes the reader very well about the situation in America in the 1930`s. It tells a lot about the society and the living at this time.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Loved the first movie, seemed the most original thing I had ever seen.Really liked the second one. The third..well I left the theater after it was over and just said to myself. \\" What the hell did I just see? \\" ..Lord of the Rings it ain't! But I'm compelled to buy it to complete the series. And yeah, at least the battle for Zion was fun..but that's the two stars.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|a good album.  well worth the money.  definitely better than her previous one.  if you're into pop, you're going to like this one and has to be in your collection.  if you're a middle aged guy jealous of her success (like carmarthen is) then you probably won't like this album.  if you're anyone else, you might want to give this a try.  sure the vocals aren't top knotch, but it's pop people.  it's not about the vocals.  it's about the overall music and how it makes you feel.  test drive it.  listen to the tracks and then decide for yourself if you want it.  i can almost guarantee that you will want it.  songs are catchy.  good mix of different feels.  track listing isn't bad either.  at only 13 tracks, not great, but passable.<br />enjoyment: A<BR>longevity: A<BR>track listing: B (get the import for more tracks)<BR>price: B
B0000DYJM6|4.0|As far as B-sides and rarities go, this collection by the seminal Seattle true to the roots of rock bands PJ, stacks up as one of the finest.  It ranks right up there with other greats in B-side collections, like R.E.M's &quot;Dead Letter Office.&quot;  If put to a &quot;must&quot; I'd have to say PJ's &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; tops out.  And let me tell ya why my friend.<br />For the PJ faithfull, &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; reveals some things about the band.  First it lets PJ lay it down on vinyl as is...letting it all hang out, quirks, gems, shoulda never beens.  It's a wonderful thing for PJ fans and even makes for a good listen to those un-initiated.  I think B-side collections maybe reveals more about a band than their produced released albums do.  What does &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; say about PJ?  It reveals that there more multi-dimensional eclectic than they let on to be from other albums.  Granted &quot;No Code,&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy,&quot; were great horizon-stretching experimental stand-outs in the PJ catalogue, but &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; puts out stuff PJ probably originally wished would have never seen the light of day.  Jack Irons' &quot;Whale Song,&quot; O'Brien's &quot;Gremmie&quot;, and Vedder and Ament's Rockline broadcast, &quot;Bee Girl,&quot; all might fall in that category.  But that's what makes &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; great, it's all here, the good, the bad, the ugly.<br />Another very interesting thing &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; reveals can be found in the liner notes.  They are worth the price of admission of &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; just to reach some enlightenment on PJ's albums.  One thing that stands out is:  Binaural really had the potential to be one of PJ's stronger albums instead of their perhaps weakest release.  There are no less than 6 out takes from the Binaural recordings.  The rolling tribal swing of &quot;Education,&quot; and the whispered hush life-pondering folk of &quot;Fatal,&quot; stand out as some of PJ's finer songs.  My, my...replace Binaural's first three tracks with those + maybe Cameron's 1-2 punch of &quot;In the Moonlight,&quot; and a fine fine album would have been made.  To me it reveals something was lacking in the chemistry between Binaural's producer Tschad Blake and the band.  Thank god for the return of PJ mainstay Brendan O'Brien...stick with him for future releases.<br />Another interesting thing revealed is just what a phenomenal catalogue the band had when releasing their first album &quot;Ten.&quot;  Out takes from Ten are pretty phenomenal on &quot;Lost Dogs.&quot;  &quot;Alone,&quot; has a very ten-ish sound to it...but what a song.  It has that throw-off punk-funk arena rock mesh that was PJ's signature in those days.  This seems like it would have made for a live show staple for PJ over the years...every bit as good and muchly better than &quot;Porch.&quot;  &quot;Wash,&quot; is pretty well-known to the PJ faithfull but plays much better live than the version that made &quot;Dogs.&quot;  And &quot;Brother,&quot; oh brother rocks harder than just about the whole PJ discography.  It has this wonderful driving groove with break-out solos that show off McCready's guitar axe-slinging wizardry.  I've heard there's a version that exist with lyrics...maybe &quot;Lost Dogs 2&quot; will bless us with that...call the dogcatcher boys.<br />The cover &quot;Leaving Here,&quot; is wonderful to have studio-version.  It really is a perfect vehicle for PJ and nice to have vs. some of the butchered live versions.  &quot;Undone,&quot; has radio-friendly hit (in a good way) written all over it and I think could have surpassed similar ultimately catchy PJ tunes like &quot;Yield's&quot; &quot;Wishlist.&quot;<br />I maybe a rabid drooling dog for not giving this one 5-stars, but it includes some of PJ's best along some of their not-so-best, so conscientiously I could not recommend it for the general audience.  PJ fans...&quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; is a must have.  Soon to be PJ fans, work yourself up with &quot;No Code,&quot; &quot;Riot Act,&quot; &quot;Yield,&quot; &quot;Ten,&quot; some live albums and then you too will be completely hooked like moi and you'll be ready for the big lost dogs.<br />--MMWith &quot;No Code,&quot; &quot;Riot Act,&quot; &quot;Yield,&quot; &quot;Ten,&quot; some live albums and then you too will be completely hooked like moi and you'll be ready for the big lost dogs.<BR>--MMW
B000062YAZ|5.0|i got this cd just today,and it rocks,great guitar solos and drums are really good as well.it has 12 tracks on it,all are very good songs,my favorites are angel of death,raining blood,piece by piece,and post mortem.so if your big on 80s thrash metal,or just started getting into slayer i would suggest u get this cd and seasons in the abyss.
B0000U5RNU|1.0|I found this movie very offensive, they wrote in &quot;Jesus is coming, look busy&quot; with black marker over the dirty buttcrack of some guy.  I couldn't watch this movie after that, and I turned it off.  I wouldn't recommend it for any Christian to watch.

B00012QM8G|2.0|I was REALLY REALLY thrilled when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD and placed order instantaneously. However, I was REALLY REALLY disappointed when I received it because the movie is split into 2 on a 2-side disc!!!<br />This is clearly an insult to the customers. I wish Amazon could've indicated earlier, so that I could avoid buying it. I'd rather wait until they release a more decent version with the whole movie on 1 disc and the extras on another disc! Shame on you, Universal Studios, for doing this kind of &quot;unethical&quot; thing!
B00003CXCT|4.0|While I jumped at the chance to see episodes 4-6 in the theaters like everyone else, I really disagree with Mr. Lucas' whole philosophy behind 'fixing up' these movies. The added scenes and new effects do not mesh with the feeling of the original movies. I think it to be a grievous mistake to take movies from our past and change them to such a degree as Mr. Lucas has here. He might think he has the right since he made them originally, but they have long since become public property, and we, the fans, want our originals back. Please, Mr. Lucas, let us have them!
B00005MP58|5.0|This rendition of Jane Austen's novel superb, simply amazing! When I first read the novel, I was so taken by it that I immediately started reading it once more after reaching the last page. And so began hopeless addiction to the story. This screen adaptation is probably the closest a movie/series will ever get to capturing the essence of the book or what the author had in mind. The story was retold to perfection and the actors played their roles so well that Jane Austen's characters will be forever immortalized in their faces. Mrs. Bennet was superb, Elizabeth outstanding, and who could forget the annoying Mr. Collins? And ladies be warned! you will fall in love with Mr. Darcy! I watched the tape version countless times but I must admit the DVD set takes the tediousness out of the whole process. All in all this is quite the collector's item and well worth having. Viva Pride and Prejudice!
B000002KM6|4.0|The album is a little progressive if you call it that and after a listen or two it sticks on you.  In a nut shell, the album is worth purchasing.  I like this album as well as VH II / and Woman and Children First.  In an era where disco was king, VH continued to rock and roll.
B00018TI5E|5.0|See other reviews for opinions on the album - I thought I would mention (particularly to the person who doesn't like the production) that there is a spot on [...] for demos - John has given them accoustic versions of the songs from Shadows, as well as a few studio demos.
B0000029GA|5.0|1994 was a HOT year in hip hop and this album shows why. My favorite MC of all time, Nas, set the hip hop world on fire with his debut album Illmatic. This album has ALWAYS been a favorite of mine and it will continue to be as long as I live. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: The entire album. There is NO fast forward material on this album.<br />Production: Thumbs Up<BR>Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs Up<BR>Originality: Thumbs Up<br />The Last Word: THIS album is a landmark in hip hop history, a true masterpiece. If albums like this were released today, hip hop would be SO much better. Overall, this album IS EXCELLENT, and I strongly recommend that you have this in your collection.
B000002I2M|5.0|L.A. Woman, the last of the Doors studio albums is perhaps their best.  The songs are rad, yeah.  Whatever, it gets me off.  However, fans should know this: if you go into the bathroom and chant 'Mr. Mojo Risin' five times Jimmy will appear and stab all of your enemies.  Now, go buy this album and exact your revenge.
B000002B1M|4.0|In 1996, Nas RULED hip hop. It was his. But in my opinion, his second album, It Was Written, was NOT a failure. Many people heavily criticized this album, saying that Nas had fell off and he was going pop. WRONG. Nas STILL managed to make an excellent album that has classic material to boot. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: The Message, Street Dreams, I Gave You Power, Take It In Blood, Nas Is Coming, and If I Ruled The World<br />Production: Thumbs in the middle: Even though it's tight at times, the production could have been a little better.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs Up. Nas gets a LITTLE more gangsta on this album.<br />Originality. Thumbs Up.<br />The Last Word: While certainly NOT better than his first album Illmatic, this album is a STRONG follow up to his first album. Nas proved the doubters wrong and this album shows why. I recommend this album to anyone.

1577311523|5.0|Eckhart has written a book of such directness, simplicity &amp; practicality that I feel masters of the past like the Buddha had not or had not been able to do so.  By simply reading the book, you will experience much more than just reading (info) - a natural meditation happens as you read, and you can feel a sense of well-being throughout your body.<br />To me, this is the most important book of our time.
B00016POFE|5.0|I heard about Porcupine Tree because of Steven Wilson's work with Opeth. I have been meaning to check them out for some time but never did for various reasons. When I saw their album was coming out on DVD-Audio I decided to buy it because there isn't much good stuff on DVD-A yet. This is an amazing DVD-A, it makes good use of all the speakers without sounding gimmicky. The sonic quality is great, some people have complained that it is only a 24-48 disc, but from what I read the album was recorded in 24-48 so what you get on the dvd-audio is basically the same quality as the studio masters. I would recommend this album to anyone.
B00005JMEW|5.0|KILL BILL VOL.1 WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED AND EVEN MORE OF WHAT I HAD NO IDEA THAT I WANTED.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM IS AMAZING.  AND HOW  CHILLING IS NANCY SINATRI'S \\"BANG BANG\\" IN THE OPENING, THE WAY THE R-ZA FLIPPED THE BEAT WAS PERFECT ALMOST SCARY!!!
B00009RAJH|5.0|This CD is a great buy! It's got all the great songs from the original and then some. Plus, it has great rare pictures and liner notes. I never really appreciated this album until I bought this CD and listened to the wonderful music on it! Great songs from this album include &quot;Blue Letter&quot;, Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;Landslide&quot; (though they are all great!) I would highly recommend purchasing this album! It's a classic!
B000002LRX|5.0|I remember when I first bought this album, back in '93, I just started listening to &quot;The Real Thing&quot; and I couldn't stop listening to that, so I decided to pick up &quot;Angel dust&quot;,  I bought a used cassette, and it was on side 2, so the first song I heard was &quot;Kindergarten&quot;,(which is now one of my favorite FNM songs) and I was like &quot;who the hell is this&quot;, I was expecting to hear &quot;The Real thing&quot; part 2. And I was in for a big suprise, so Kindergarten got over and &quot;Be Agressive&quot; started up, and again I was like &quot;What the hell, This sounds like some disco stuff, this is horrible&quot;  especially when the Cheerleaders started in.<BR>So I was very dissapointed,  I thought the band had a new singer or something, because then I didn't know how good and versitile of a singer Mike patton was,  So I listened to the whole album once, and hated it, and listened to it again, and thought it was alright.  After listening to it a few times it just hit me, That this was the best stuff I've ever heard.<br />There is not one bad second on this album, it threw me off at first but after I &quot;got it&quot;, it all came together, I think I was listening to the break in &quot;Malpractice&quot; when I realized just how amazing this album is.  I don't even know how to describe each song.  They are all 100% great,  seriously, <BR>This Album Changed my whole outlook on music and opened my mind so much. for about 2 years I listened to &quot;Angel dust&quot; almost every day (along with all the other FNM albums),  and Faith no more became and have been one of My Favorite bands, Angel dust has it all. <BR>It is not one of, it is THE most underrated album of all time. <BR>These guys are amazing,  the music industry disregarded Angel dust because it didn't sound like &quot;Epic&quot; part. 2, they couldn't handle what they were hearing. SOMETHING DIFFERENT!<BR>If you don't own this album, then you're missing out big time.<BR>I have been listening to it for 10 years now and it never gets old.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am 26 and have heard songs from Christina's first album on the radio and liked them, but I used to think she was just another Britney.  I am not a huge pop fan, but her music has really grown on me and I finally purchased Stripped.  I was very impressed with it and appreciate that she actually writes her own songs, cannot say that for Britney and the rest of her peers.  I feel she is very misjudged by the public because of her initial image, but it is her inner beauty and talent that really counts, just look back at Prince in the 80's.  I feel that her success will have far more staying power than any of her current peers and that you should definitely pick up her latest album, you will not be dissapointed and I will be looking to hear more from her in the future.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Hurrah for this DVD, but from the packaging I can tell it will be a throw away when/if the (ultimate editions) of the 6 films come out.<BR>For starters it isn't a trilogy it is 6 films (for now) and I wish people including Lucasfilm would quit calling it such.<BR>I disapprove of the packaging like the Indiana Jones set. These movies should be marketed separetly (as Lucas probably wanted but the studio won out) I will toss the cover box as I did Indy's real fast and add the special features disc to the first in with a 2-disc slim box.<BR>And studios quit making Fullscreen! 5 years ago!<BR>And George hurry up with the (ultimate editions).<BR>I want to see Vader and Sidious in a sabre duel at the end of Episode VI.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|I did not rush to view this movie, but I wish that I had because it was a good thriller.  It stars Halle Berry, Charles Dutton, Robert Downy Jr. and Penelope Cruz.  It kept me glued to the screen, which was a good thing because a potty or snack break will cause you to have to rewind/replay some footage.  Quick flashes of little things will prove crucial toward the end of the movie...so you don't want to miss a single thing.<br />Berry plays Dr. Grey, who is a shrink that tends to patients at a women's prison facility.  Dutton plays her husband and boss (the pairing of them as a married couple was a stretch of my imagination), Downy is a co-worker (you will sense some romantic attraction between them which will prove to be key and may help to confuse you on your attempt to predict part of the outcome) and Cruz is a patient that doesn't seem as crazy as the good doctor thinks, but has a sixth sense.(...)  The thrilling ghostly moments and special effects will hold your attention as you try to figure out why Dr. Grey ended up here.  Other ingredients that help the story bake are a murder, a sex crime and voices from beyond the grave seeking revenge and trying to save the life of a potential victim.<br />Berry provides a very electrified performance.  Downy holds his own and so does Cruz.  You won't be disappointed.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I found this film to be very good. It had humor, great characters, and a mysteriously fun story. It involves an old man's tall tales that he supposedly went through, and his son doesn't believe him. So the son goes and actually researches the stories to find out what his dad really went through. He expects to find that his father's tall tales aren't so tall, but...<br />...I can't give away what really happens. But it's a satisfying story that I could watch again and again. Can't wait to own it on DVD!<br />Great movie.
0792846338|5.0|In this really engaging story (movie), a popular novelist gets in a car accident and is rescued and privately nursed by--you guessed it--his &quot;#1 fan&quot; Annie at her remote home in the woods. Of course, what he doesn't realize is that Annie is a little, shall we say... mentally disturbed! She doesn't like the manuscript to his new novel, and forces him to start a new one from scratch. It soon becomes evident that this madwoman will do anything, including cripple him, to keep him all to herself. So, ironically, his rescuer turns out to be his captor! The rest of this suspenseful story involves his desperate attempts to free himself. But of course I won't spoil it for you by giving anything away, sorry! :)<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I had recently seen the matrix, and then the matrix reloaded. i fell in love. i was utterly hooked on these movies. they combine Awesome special effects with neat sci-fi thrills to create the ultimate trilogy.<BR>i was hooked on the movies, and i totally had to see the third one. i went with my entire family, and i dont think i said one word the entire movie. i was caught in the film. it rox!! the ending is perfect: it provides enough info to NOT leave you hanging but hinting that just MAYBE another one will come along. if you are a major sci-fi freak, then these movies are for you. but this one is the best of the three. ive seen the first one over 10 times, and it still doesnt even come close to the last one. its like an entire thrill ride packed into two hours of movie going madness. its awesome!!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Science Fiction has a hold on our collective imaginations because of what might be- whether it is a \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" or the Matrix works. We live our lives as a series of decisions that ultimately determine our fate. Combine that with our birthrights and who we become based on our teachers and parents, and you have values that we cannot control and frustrate us with their elusiveness.<br />The three Matrix movies are powerful reminders of our powerless humanlives, and by the sad end of the third film, memento mori messages about our ultimate goal. To die. Neo fulfills whatever prophecy he is given simply by asking the questions. He will die, but his choice is to mark the time, place and mission that will take him to his end. The film is an eloquent reminder that after you die, the sun rises the next day.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|There were times during the movie when I felt I was watching a travel show sponsored by the Japanese tourism board. The \\"wowing\\" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.<br />To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking nothing but Japanese to an American patient; a translator who doesn't know enough English to translate to Bob (Bill Murray) properly; a prostitute who loses all her sex appeal by mis-pronouncing the word \\"rip.\\"  (...)P>To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the movie's exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.<br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while one can feel their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.<br />However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes might easily bore the audience, especially if the director lacks confidence. But also partly because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because themood often hinges on and is brought out by the location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. As just mentioned, however, these things wear thin. (If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in the mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).)<br />Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and forgettable. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I`m loving it, the songs are great, I can`t believe the best beat ever, Her voice is so beautiful, she can sing, not in a big way , but in a beautiful way.<br />I`m not a Fan, and i hate them, Just i love Music, You Hava to believe me, It`s a Great Album
B00009V7T2|5.0|I've listened to this CD nonstop and there's no doubt about it, it is a masterpiece. Omar and Cedric rock my world. I actually had to buy this CD because it was so good. It takes about 2 or 3 listens through the whole CD to appreciate it to the max. Indie music at its best. If you want to listen to more of their works, try De Facto, which is the Mars Volta without lyrics, just latin progressive salsa. I also recommend their Tremulant EP because it is so good and has classic rock feels to it.<br />1. 9/10 Son Et Lumiere - Good Introduction flows well<BR>2. 9.5/10 Inertiatic - Transitions well into this song and different but good.<BR>3. 11/10 Roulette Dares - One of my favorite songs in the whole album.<BR>4. --<BR>5. 11/10 Drunkship of Lanterns - Awesome song! Salsa Progressive sounds with Cedric at his best in singing. Has a Santana sounding guitar solo at the end which sounds really good. Good transitions and fades back into the song well. Great Build ups.<BR>6. 8.5/10 Eriatarka - Not bad. The song has its moments.<BR>7. 11/10 Cicatriz ESP - Probably everyones favorite. Its very intense and touching. The only thing that bugs me is the ambience in the song that takes forever. But you get use to it.<BR>8. 10/10 This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed - I love this song, his voice has this passion in it that makes you fall in love with him and takes your breath away.<BR>9. 10/10 Televators - Very good.<BR>10. 10.5/10 Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt - Amazing. This whole Album is amazing. Listen to it all the way through. It is definately worth the 9 bucks.

B000063UR1|1.0|this movie was a big let down. first off is the bad acting by the lead character that kills the crew and is left alone on a star ship. the poor attempt at conveying the lonlyness and cabin fever by interaction with the drone droids leaves you without the real grip of this state of mind. <br />a movie that could have had alot more potential really flops with a boaring plot and mind numbing acting.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee`s novel &quot;To kill a Mockingbird&quot;, which he won the Pulitzer Prize for, is written through the eyes of a young girl called Scout. She lives with her older brother Jem and her father Atticus Finch, whose profession is to be a lawyer in a small village, Maycomb in Alabama (south of the USA). As her father has to defend a black man, who is accused to have raped a white girl, whose father is often drunk and violent, the children Jem, Scout and a little boy called Dill, who visits his aunt in Maycomb only in the summer-holidays, get involved into the real life of prejudices against minorities, especially blacks and irrationality of adult opinions about social classes and social differences.<BR>This very authentic novel by a very talented author with such a lovely sense of humour, sarcasm and excitement shows the real life of the 1930s in the south of the USA, where equality of black and white people was an unreachable aim. To get more information, read the whole novel, which is really worth reading.
B000002UAO|5.0|Better than anything they recorded before (all of which was excellent), The Beatles went from being a pop sensation, to being truly respected musicains, as they had now been comming up with the goods for several years and showed no signs of a demise both in commerical success and artistic output. This -their 5th album- kicks off with the fun &quot;Drive my car&quot;, sung by Paul McCartney. John Lennon then follows with &quot;Norwegian wood&quot; and Paul is welcomed back with &quot;You won't see me&quot;. This is followed by one of the albums finest moments with &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, which was later featured in the box office smash &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (the title track to this film appears on both the later soundtrack LP and &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;'s follow-up &quot;Revolver&quot;. The track &quot;Nowhere man&quot; is sung beautifull by John and Paul and George supply equally beautiful harmony vocals. George then takes the lead for &quot;Think for yourself&quot; and this is followed by McCartney's fun light pop groove of &quot;The Word&quot;. Again Paul McCarntey comes back with &quot;Michelle&quot;, a song which was coverd by another pop group the Overlanders around the same time of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and was a #1 hit for them (like most Beatles albums, &quot;Rubber soul&quot; contains no singles by The Band). The groups Drummer, Ringo Starr then takes to the mic for &quot;What goes on&quot;, a track he co-wrote with John and Paul, this is a countryfied tune. &quot;Girl&quot;, sung by John Lennon, is possibly my least favorite track on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, but it's still great. &quot;I'm looking through you&quot; is fabulous and features more country influence, sung by Paul. My favorite song on the CD is probably &quot;In my life&quot;, which is sung by John. John and Paul then both take the mic for &quot;Wait&quot;, another one of the albums finest moments. &quot;If I needed someone&quot; is one of the weaker moments on the album, but even theBeatles weak moments were splendid. &quot;Run for you life&quot;, sung by John, is the perfect end to a perfect album by the greatest band ever ... The Beatles!
0446310786|4.0|The book &quot;To kill a mockingbird&quot; which was written by Harper Lee is about a black man who is blamed for raping a white girl.<BR>The whole story is told by a girl called Scout and in the cause the story the reader gets to know how the girl is growing up and he gets to know some important things of Scouts childhood.<BR>The story takes place in a quiet old town called Maycomb which is full of racism.<BR>Scouts father Atticus is a lawyer and he defends the black man called Tom Robinson who is blamed for raping a white girl and that is why Atticus and his family get into trouble.<BR>The first part of the book is difficult to understand, because you don't really get &quot;into&quot; the story and because of this the story seems not to be very interesting on the first view.<BR>But if you go on reading, the book is getting more and more interesting and you can see that it's worth reading this book.<BR>The whole story seems to be realistic and the reader could think that the story really took place and that's perhaps a reason why Harper Lee's book was sold more than 30.000.000 times and won the Pulitzer Prize.

6304696515|5.0|All the actors in this movie are at some of their bests. The scenery and costuming if a awe inspiring. This movie will have you thinking about it for days after you have seen it, you will want to see it again and again, and each time you will love it more then the previous time.
B00011RPB0|5.0|I find it very interesting that this film seems to provoke such potent and disparate reactions from people. I think to say that the reactions can be divided into the \\"car-chase loving neanderthal\\" and \\"beret-wearing art-film snob\\" camps may be oversimplifying things a bit. I can definitely say I understand why people would dislike this film. However, I loved everything about it, from the stunning cinematography to the soundtrack (I'm a big Kevin Shields fan and have been waiting forever for him to do ANYTHING of consequence) to the multi-faceted performances of the actors. This is the defining role of Bill Murray's career, and those who dismiss it as simply \\"Bill looking hang-dog and bored\\" are missing volumes in my estimation, as are those who dismiss the story as too minimalist. <BR>The thing I liked best, though, was the fact that there were various points in the movie where I expected a cheesy cliche Hollywoodesque turn to occur, and it never happened. That, to me, is the mark of a great film. See it, and keep an open mind.

0385504209|1.0|I actually had to force myself to slog through this book.  The writing style is similar to &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; - a flowery style filled with gratuitous adjectives and ridiculously over-stated descriptions.  The plot was alternately absurd and boring.  I read this book based on all of the hype and I really expected something interesting.  Except for a few brief moments, I found this book to be very easy to put down.  The entire experience was an insult to my brain cells.
B000001ES9|3.0|This is my favorite Rush LP for pure guitar power. I don't think that Alex Lifeson has ever played as hard as he did on Rush's self-titled debut. Geddy Lee's bass lines are very prominent as well. This LP is far from perfect. No Neil Peart, thus no talented drumming and the lyrics are kind of corny. But man o' man THAT guitar of Big Al's! I'm listening to \\"Rush\\" as I write this review. It is true that Rush's music got more refined and sophisticated over the years, especially with the entrance of the professor, however, for a then 14 year old boy that heard this LP for the first time in 1978, this thing rocked! It has great sentimental appeal for me.
0312995423|2.0|DIGITAL FORTRESS involves an NSA cryptographer and a professor, also lovers, serparately looking for the key to an &quot;unbreakable code&quot;. The book is loaded with action and twists, and while some may find it perfect beach fare, it's full of holes and improbabilites. Part of the plot involves an untrained professor being sent on a secret mission by the NSA, and some of the mistakes made by NSA staff seem ridiculous. <BR>     The book is full of paranoia about the government tapping into our email and other communications. Many people's views on these things have changed since DIGITAL FORTRESS came out in 1998, which lends the book an unfortunate dated quality, as f it had been written in the '60s..... not as good as DA VINCI
B000002J1L|4.0|Nursery Cryme came at perhaps the most interesting time in the band's career. They had just picked up much needed muscle with Hackett and Collins, but were still trying to find their voice as a band. The result is some of the oddest, most original music they have ever composed, played at a new level of competency. For me the most fascinating progressive rock can be the strangest, and--make no mistake--Nursery Cryme is Genesis at their strangest. Here they move away from the folky tendencies of the albums that preceeded it, but are not yet producing music as streamlined and professional as that which would soon come. This is one of the most unique albums in prog rock history.<br />One of the best things about this album is that the ego jostling has yet to set in. Steve Hackett plays a large role and Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford sing background prominently in some places. Banks even delivers the \\"Mighty Hogweed\\" line in \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed,\\" which is, by the way, a good example of a song with the bizarreness I alluded to earlier.<br />There are others. \\"Harold the Barrel\\" is a off-center but moving mini-opera that takes place in about three minutes, and \\"Seven Stones\\" reveals the influence that the first King Crimson album must have had on the band, especially Hackett's guitar solo in the middle and the Mellotronic thunder at the end. Kind of a creepy song in its own way. And speaking of creepy, while \\"The Musical Box\\" is an acknowledged epic masterpiece, its theme of a reincarnated (...)fixated villain is so disturbingly obscure that they had to explain the story on the liner notes of the remastered CD (whose sound IS much better than the original vinyl pressing).<br />The oddness of the music of this record is certainly reflected in the band's colorful stage persona at the time, all infused with a wonderful sense of artistic discovery. We know the three albums to come are the five star classics, but there is something singularly exciting about this recordthat you won't find anywhere else.

He establishes a way of undermining the little people and making money off them.  For example,<BR>he opens a comic book library under a comic book store where he charges children in the<br />neighborhood ten cents for two hours of unlimited reading.  This only works because he is<BR>obstructing the sale of comic books in the store.  Instead of buying the books from the store clerk,<BR>they can read them for a lower costs and not have to purchase them---in other words: piracy.  He<BR>says this is the kind of thing you need to do to develop pure income.  He also mentions one of the<BR>things his \\"rich dad\\" did to become rich.  He took a $20,000 house during a depression in Phoenix<BR>when everyone was giving stuff away, and saving the most money they could for the future, and<BR>he sold it for $60,000 (saying it was worth $75,000).  This is the kind of thing that creates the<BR>huge gap between upper and lower classes.  He shows the reader how to be a capitalist fat cat, and<BR>rise above the little people.   <BR> The only problem with this is that he explains how to get even richer, not how to get rich. <BR>His theory about getting rich only works if you have money to start off with, and are willing to<BR>step on everyone!  With people like this it's no surprise that the rich are mistrusted.  If the \\"only\\"<BR>way to get rich is to swindle, scam, and cheat others out of their hard work and time and just<BR>completely become a crook then I don't want to be rich.  I would rather retain my dignity, thank<BR>you.  I don't need a spot on the community country club to feel rich.  In fact, another thing he<BR>brings up is that rich people are usually those who fear being broke so they continue to earn more<BR>and more.  But I think it's that they can't get enough and they must steal more and more.  But, of<BR>course, one can only get rich if other get poorer so Kiyosaki is only showing the reader how to<BR>make others poorer.  I think it's sick.

Anyone who has read this book knows it cannot possibly deserve a ONE STAR rating.<br />I just want to say, do not rate the book based on your opinion of what the truth is. Rate the book AS A BOOK. The definition of a good book is a book that gets hold of you and keeps you reading til the end and The Da Vinci Code is certainly one of those books. Trust me, this book will boggle your mind.

B00018D44U|3.0|I give this CD 3 stars only because it's hard NOT to compare it to her debut.  The songs aren't as solid, and the album isn't as consistent.  But, with that voice and musicanship -- who cares?  The duet with Dolly Parton is fun -- and a number of the songs grow on you. But you won't pop it in and say &quot;That's an incredible song&quot; as you did time and time again with her first CD.
0446310786|4.0|The novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee is about the narrator Scout who grows up. She lives with her father, her brother und the family's cook Calpurnia in a little town called Maycomb in the southern states of the USA. Her father Atticus is a lawyer who defends Tom Robinson, a black man, who is accused of having raped a white girl.<BR>Atticus tries to show his children the importance of equality and honesty. For him all men are equal and that is why he defends Tom Robinson to give him a fair trial.<BR>A negative aspect of this novel is the describtion of the first part where Scout and Jem try to understand the living conditions of a mysteric man in the neighbourhood.<BR>But on the whole the novel is well-done because it informs the reader about the situation in the south of America in the 1930's. The society and its way of life are described very interstingly. People are very conservative and have many prejudices against blacks. For them money and reputation are more important than one's character. So the great injustfice of this time becomes clear.
B00009W0U4|5.0|However, time will not distroy the excellence of this movie. It takes two viewings to fully grasp the concept, but it's worth it. Every scene provides more information on the one before. At first, I was going to give it only 4 stars, due to the homophobic content (...) But upon a second viewing, I realized that the epithets were justified by previous occurences. ex. the gay-bashing doesn't start until Marcus realizes a gay [prostitite] raped his girlfriend, Alex. And the ending provides a faint glimmer of hope that the viewer knows is futile, as they have had the privalege of seeing the ending first. I especially liked the flashing at the end in which everything seemed to come together. (if you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean.) All in all, this is an excellent movie and is sure to be a classic piece of European cinema.
0446310786|4.0|The novel &quot;TO Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee is a drama that takes place in a southern state of the USA, Alabama, in the 1930's. The protagonist and also the narrator is a young girl named Scout. Her brother Jem also belongs to the round characters because he plays an important role throughout the story and he is the one Scout starts to talk about at the beginning of the novel. <BR>The two children develop during the story. They learn about the coexistence of good and evil, justice and injustice. They have to experience that not all principles Atticuc has taught them as acceptance and tolerance is followed by all people in town.<BR>Living according to Atticus's advice &quot;putting oneself in one's shoes&quot; Scout and jem discover that sometimes you have to change your opinion about a person when you get to know this person, for example the fact that Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley is not the dangerous monster but a man who rescues two children.<BR>In my view it was an intersting and detailed written novel. Especially the chapters where Atticus defends the innocent black man Tom Robinson are very exiting. I think it is good to tell teh story by a first-person narrator because you learn about the feelings and emotions. Another aspect of this is that you can also see the changes in the narrotor's behaviour because he is part of the story.
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lees &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a novel that deals with the problem of racial prejudice in southern parts of the United States in the 1930s. The main character, Atticus Finch, is a liberal and open-minded lawyer in his self-righteous white community in Maycomb, Alabama. He takes up the defence of Tom Robinson, a black farm worker who innocently stands accused of raping a white woman. Robinson is found guilty and killed while attempting to escape, and Finch is confronted with the hate and injustice of the community he lives in. The novel is told from the perspective of Finchs 9-year-old daughter, Jean Louise (&quot;Scout&quot;).<BR>I enjoyed reading this book very much. It gives an insight into how life must have been (and, perhaps, still is) in a racist community like Maycomb (which, of course, is a fictional location). The novels plot is well-elaborated, its characters are complex and realistic. I especially liked the second part of the novel, dealing with Tom Robinsons trial and the effects Atticus stand against his racist community by defending him in that trial has on his life and his family. It is also quite interesting to see how Scout seems to &quot;mentally grow up&quot; when becoming aware of the &quot;ugly face&quot; behind the nice and clean facades of the town. The first part before the communnity starts to show its true attitude could have been a little bit shorter,it is more interesting for people who are interested in society and the relationships between the people. Nevertheless, this book is fascinating and worth reading.
B00006RU5B|1.0|this album is pure 100% crap. i'm not just comparing it to RATM but just as an album. the guitar is horrible, drums are painfully dead, vocals annoying, and the lyrics are shallow and just plain stupid. &quot;i am a highway&quot;. doesn't that mean he has construction workers and roadkill all over him? plz don't buy this piece.
1567400957|1.0|Just a warning to all the audiobook listeners out there. The unabridged cassette tapes are multi-track stereo meaning that the cheap publisher uses the left and right channels to record separate chapters. So unless you have a headphone splitter the tape will not work correctly. I fail to understand why in this day and age, the publishers can't spend a few more pennies and put the 4 additional tapes in the box. If AOL can send out about a bizillion CD's a year for free, why can't this publibsher spring for some old fashon cassettes! <br />I listened to about 5 minutes of it and couldn't stand it any longer. I would have returned it had it not been past the 30 days for Amazon's return policy.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I had seen 'Dr. Strangelove' several times prior to purchasing the Special Edition DVD, but have never enjoyed it as much. The film is the standout satire from the 1960's and is still a viable cautionary tale of human foibles. Many other reviewers have gone into great detail summarizing the plot, so I will only mention that it concerns a crazy General (Sterling Hayden) who sends his bombers to Russia in an attempt to destroy the Communists, and the pandemonium that ensues.<br />The film is unbelievably tightly edited and is probably Kubrick's greatest work. The single largest contribution to the success of the film is the superior casting, led by Peter Sellers in a virtuoso performance as Lionel Mandrake, an honorable British military officer, as the US President, and as the ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove, the half crazy scientific advisor to the President in his most over the top performance ever. Supporting Sellers are Sterling Hayden, who plays the best dark lunatic ever on film, and the brilliant George C. Scott, playing a juvenile General Buck Turgidson proving without doubt that he was capable of comedic roles. My favorite of the smaller roles has to be that of the rather dense Colonel 'Bat' Guano, played so effectively by Keenan Wynn. Also contributing to the realism of the film were the brilliant sets which, though not based in reality, are very effective at conveying the time period and mood.<br />While I think the film is the best satire made in the 1960s, and possibly in film history, and doubtless deserves of the five stars that I have given it for succeeding in telling the cautionary tale that Kubrick intended, Kubrick did take some liberties in the name of satire to reinforce his decidedly leftist point of view about military leadership. Having said that, Murphy's Law is always lurking, so I am not directly criticizing Kubrick's premise as much as I am the fundamental disregard that he had for the stability and maturity of American military personnel (it has now been 41 years since this film was released now and the precautions taken by the US government and military have thus far worked admirably.) My point is not to berate Kubrick, it is to partially address and assuage some complaints which have suggested that this film shows the ineptitude of the military: if this film was a documentary, I would already be in New Zealand. That is the point that is so often missed, this movie is a brilliant black satire about what Kubrick was personally afraid of: it is fiction, just like 'Fail Safe', released later was a more realistic fictional account of accidental nuclear weapons release. I am not implying that a release of nuclear weapons couldn't happen (although I would be more suspect of a rogue state like North Korea or a terrorist organization today), what I am saying that reality is somewhat contrary to the satirical vision Kubrick portrays here.<br />The DVD has several excellent extras, including a documentary of Kubrick, and a wonderful documentary on the making of 'Dr. Strangelove', which revealed some fascinating details about the film. Most interesting to me was that Peter Sellers was originally supposed to play a fourth role, that of Major Kong, but after breaking his leg during filming, which rendered him unable to get around the B-52 set, Slim Pickens was brought in. I wish it had included some raw footage that had been shot of Sellers as Kong. There are also some odd split-screen interviews, and typical features like biographies, trailers (a must see!), and subtitles.<br />This movie is one of the greatest films ever made, and I can't endorse it highly enough to anyone with an eye to black comedy and satire. As for me, I am off for a nice drink of distilled grain alcohol and rainwater.now been 41 years since this film was released now and the precautions taken by the US government and military have thus far worked admirably.)

B0001HAHXW|3.0|Clapton plays it safe here with some very laid back blues  playing reminiscent of his late 70's early 80's recordings.  The production is slick and commercial with no rough edges to the sound, almost &quot;overproduced&quot; (hardly a quality for anyone who is a blues &quot;purist&quot;).    All the instruments are mixed equally with no particular musician upfront in the mix; consequently this is not a &quot;Clapton guitar&quot; album.  If anything Clapton's vocals are the most prominent feature here.  I give Eric credit, he has become an above average singer and it shows on this release.  His vocals are very smooth and soulful.    Billy Preston contributes some fine piano, too bad Billy couldn't have taken over the vocal chores on a song or two.  If you've been a Clapton fan since his Yardbirds &amp; Bluesbreakers days, chances are you'll be more than a little disappointed here (you gotta get John Mayall's 70th Birthday Concert with both Clapton &amp; Mick Taylor).  If &quot;Unplugged&quot; is your favorite (and first) Clapton album, chances are you'll really enjoy this recording.  <BR>   <BR>  Personally, I find it a bit too &quot;commercial&quot; for my blood.  The music is better suited for an elevator ride rather than a Southside Chicago Blues Club.  The blues is  emotion &amp; passion.   This album comes off a little too &quot;blues-by-numbers&quot;,  lacking in the above to qualities.  Clapton's   vocals on  &quot;Ramblin' On My Mind&quot; from the Bluesbreaker's album  have  10 times the emotion shown here.  I would not use the term &quot;restraint&quot; in reference to this release as much as the term &quot;record sales&quot;.   It reminds me of the story about a young British Blues Guitarist who left his band back in the mid-60's because he thought they were getting too commmercial.
0066620996|5.0|This is one of the best business books I have read in the past couple years.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in business.  <br />Jim Collins shares a great deal of well-thought-out research in a readable, easy-to-understand way.  I was particularly fascinated by his concept of Level Five Leadership, which seems to run counter to the idea that the best CEO is brash, arrogant, famous and egotistical - all traits our society seems to favor in top managers today (hello Enron, Tyco, et al.). <br />There were several other concepts I particularly liked -- his ideas of the &quot;fly wheel,&quot; &quot;the stop doing list&quot; and &quot;finding what drives your economic engine,&quot; which I have spent some time actually doing in my own small business.  One downside to the book - I found at times that Collins' values and ideas about effective leadership color his interpretation of the data presented, even though he explicitly states in the first few pages that pains were taken to present only objective evidence.  However, this never prevented me from truly enjoying the book.<br />In fact, I liked this book so much that I recommended it to a number of friends and colleagues . . . they loved it too.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I wasn't all that crazy about Sandinista when it was first released, and would have agreed with those who said that there was less wheat than chaff. But relistening to my Clash collection again after quite awhile I'm surprised how strong this album sounds.  Some of the cuts (mentioned by previous reviewers) really are among the best the Clash every recorded.  Some of them I will listen to half way before hitting the skip button, but I'm still glad it's all there.  Sandinista is like an ocean of music, embracing a big swath of the 20th century's musical styles as filtered through the sensibility of one of rock's most talented ensembles, at a moment when globalization was just beginning to broaden a generation's cultural/political horizons.  As an effort to imagine and convey human stories in a wide variety of musical idioms it succeeds more often than not, and the total effect is definitely greater than the sum of the parts.

I'll skip man vs. man because....well read the book, it's a plot give away.<br />Man vs. the environment Pi's struggle to survive in the boat is great reading.  I turned each page with excitement.  His strategies to survive our fascinating.  His encounters on the Ocean, each one, feel like modern day encounters from the Odyssey.  His encounters with the tiger.  Equally interesting.  You finish the book ready to learn Zoology. <br />Man vs. himself  Well, until you get to the end, does Pi struggle against himself?  No, not really.  In fact Pi is just too good.  Too bright.  Too self-enlightened.  Just not human enough, but wait until the end.  Then ----- who knows.<br />Man vs. God.  Well sort of.  It's sort of like reviewing the Bible as a written work.  The struggle really isn't against god but a struggle to learn what is god. This part of the book is also very interesting.<br />In short, this book deserves the Booker prize and is the kind of classic that probably should be read in a high school English classes.  Bravo Mr. Martel.
B000002I25|5.0|A great album, and only beaten out by Sgt. Peppers as the most popular album in 1967. Not to mention that it was the Door's debut album to boot. A pretty damn good start. I prefer listening to this, and it's certainly chocked full of little gems.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The thing that I found ho-hum was that most of the movie had this feeling as if Coppola told Bill Murray to just get in front of the camera and try to act bored while being funny.  They even admitted in the DVD extras that alot of the non-core dialogue was unscripted for Bill Murray.  AND that was exactly why I felt the movie seemed so drawn out and senseless.  Some great things about the movie though,(and this is why I cannot give it a 1 star) is the great, expressive film work.  The photography really captured Japan through the eyes of a Foreign American. It is very reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai's film work...who incidently helped in making this film.  Coppola wants us to feel the boredom experienced by the two characters in the movie...unfortunately, we did.  If you love independent films and want a brilliant story that shows the ins and outs of an industrial asian city...PLEASE GO WATCH Wong Kar Wai's CHUNGKING EXPRESS.  It is the film that influenced Lost In Translation, but all in all a much better movie!
0446310786|4.0|The novel &quot;To kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee is about a young girl Scout, who tells the story and grows up during the novel. Important persons in the novel are her father Atticus, her brother Jem, Calpurnia, who is the cook of the family and a substitute mother for Scout, and Tom Robinson. For Atticus, equality and honesty is very important. He defends Tom Robinson a black man because he`s accused of raping a white girl. Blacks aren`t very respected and it`s difficult for Atticus to defend him. They all live in a small town in South America called Maycomb. The book is divided into two parts. Part one tells about Scout and her family and life in Maycomb. This part isn`t very interesting to read. Often it seems a little boring because there are some parts which are told very detailed. Part two is the part where the main part begins and where the real action is shown. On the cover of the book you got the information that the book is about rape. When you read the first part you look forward to it and in part two it begins, eventually. It is very interesting to read this part and you get to know a lot of information about a trial in this time. <BR>The book shows the life of the 1930`s and the segregation between whites and blacks. <BR>All in all you can say that it is interesting to read the book. The book gives you information  about the 1930`s and the life at this time. When you read it you understand many things better you`ve heard of before.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I am not a big Jack Nicholson fan and I think that Diane Keaton over plays some emotions in most of her other roles.   But I enjoyed this movie so much.  I'm one of those over 50 and I saw myself in many scenes.  This was just a fun movie and there is no need to analyze everything about it.  I am buying a copy for my parents as well.  They also enjoyed it and we all laughed until we cried.  However I do think that she should have stayed with Keanu at the end, but that's just my preferance.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Two essential Beach Boys CD's are out - the &quot;Sounds Of Summer&quot; greatest hits package, the best Beach Boys compilation ever, and the majestic &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Brian Wilson's masterpiece.  Wilson didn't tour while preparing this opus, and used session players with the exception of the vocals.  After all, nobody could harmonize better than his own band.<br />  What he delivered was a collection of the most beautiful pop music ever assembled on one album.  Studio effects add ambience and a slight touch of the avant garde, but the songs themselves are the true gems.<br />  &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; with its impeccable harmonies and melody is one of the greatest songs ever, and Wilson tops that with one of the saddest but gorgeous songs ever with &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.&quot;  The whole album is so good that it should go on forever.  Reaching the ballad &quot;Caroline, No&quot; is a musical journey that does not last nearly long enough, thus guaranteeing this album's playability for a long long time after buying it.<br />  If another civilization were to ask me to give them one reason why this planet with all its hatred shouldn't be charred to a cinder, I'd play them &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  Maybe they'd let us off the hook for a while.
0385504209|5.0|I will refrain from gushing, but I have to say very few books have the effect that this book had on me while reading it!  In fact, I'm sure it's happened before, but I can't remember with what book(s)!  I would describe this author's talent for writing as brilliant.  I think very few authors have the gift of organizing their words in such a way to captivate the reader and make them read every single word.  I am notorious for skimming descriptive paragraphs because often they are not written well or they don't hold my attention long enough; I find myself wanting to skip to the dialogue.  Not so with this book!  This is the first novel I've read by Dan Brown, but it definitely will not be the last.

B0000057CL|5.0|For the last year and a half, I have been checking out a lot of Medieval and Renaissance polyphony, and this has turned out to be one of the recordings that I play constantly.  The London Early Music Consort performs these pieces with great depth and a wide range of expression and drama.<br />I sometimes wonder if the groups that originally performed these pieces some 800 years ago were as good as the London Early Music Consort.  We will never know, but we are fortunate to have recordings of this group.  The liner notes are interesting too; you get a perspective of some of the contentious social issues of the day.<br />To those listeners who never heard much polyphony and yet have over-listened to all the other genres and need something different to expand your horizon, give this a look.  It is among the best of its genre, and if you can get caught in it, you will be blown away.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|This collection of Robert Johnson songs is OK, but ... that's all it is.  Clapton's approach to the material is reverent; perhaps too reverent to be enjoyable.  If you're familiar with Robert Johnson, you know that the blues isn't all about being miserable and sad.  Often, it's about having fun (perhaps in spite of being miserable and sad).  These are all competent covers, but there's no sense of exuberance or excitement.<br />Comparing these versions to Johnson's originals is beside the point.  However, it's only fair to compare Clapton's contemporary interpretations with those of the Peter Green/Nigel Watson Splinter Group, whose superb, award-winning &quot;Robert Johnson Songbook&quot; is warm, seductive, delightful, smooth, and yes, exuberant in places.<br />True-blue Clapton fans will want to pick this one up, but most listeners will have more fun with the Splinter Group disc.  (Also highly recommended:  &quot;Hot Foot Powder&quot;, Splinter Group's equally fine second collection of Robert Johnson songs.)
B00005B4GU|5.0|I have to admit, I was never a big fan of Radiohead. Finally, I gave in to the hype surrounding the release of Amnesiac and went out and got it. WOW. Amazing. Since this was my first CD from them, I had nothing to compare it to. The music seems to drift into your ears in sort of a haphazard way at first. However, once I sat back and let it seep in, I discovered one of the most amazing CD's I have ever heard.<BR>  The emotion coming thru in just a few spoken words, the repetitions that burrow into your psyche. &quot;Sardines&quot;, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, &quot;I may be wrong&quot; and finally &quot;Life in a Glass house&quot; to end the album, (As the horn section plays farewell I am transported.) these are just a couple of my favorite tracks.<BR>  However, after buying the earlier albums as well as &quot;Thieves&quot; I find I still like Amnesiac the best. It seems to be the most personal album. I am not a fan of any political messages or preachiness that seems to find it's way into some of the other releases.<br />None of that on Amnesiac, just pure introspection. It is timeless. No matter who the president is, no matter what laws need to be passed or how the environment is doing, the human condition remains the same. That's probably why I love Amnesiac the most.<BR>  So, if you are ready for Radiohead being a bit personal, this, I believe, is the album for you.
B000006PYU|5.0|I admit I was disappointed when this CD came out.  Since Peter Green had returned to performing and recording in 1996, I was hoping for new songs from him.  A whole album of Robert Johnson covers?  Why?<br />After listening to this, however, I began to appreciate it more and more.  Nigel Watson and Peter Green manage to be respectful without being overly reverent, well aware that they're updating Johnson's classic songs for contemporary audiences.  (It's worth noting that the only Peter Green compositions to appear on any Splinter Group CD are re-arrangements of ... old Peter Green songs.)  Peter's voice is getting pretty creaky, but on this record it's warm and husky, just hoarse enough to give you the feeling of someone who's lived the blues.  The piano and rhythm work are excellent, as are Nigel Watson's singing.  And a special word for the Street Angels backup singers, whose performance on some tracks gives them a gospel feel that's entirely appropriate to the material.<br />There's no point in comparing this to Robert Johnson's originals.  However, you can compare it to Eric Clapton's new release, by contrast a rather dry, lifeless exercise that goes in one ear and out the other.  If you're a Clapton fan, you can string me up and call for the executioner, but first... listen to this CD.  It's a must for any blues fan.<br />(And don't forget to buy &quot;Hot Foot Powder&quot;, the follow-up album with more delicious blues!)
B00003CXCT|4.0|Though the original trilogy would be an excellent addition to any DVD collection, I personally am waiting for the inevitable 6 disk set with Episodes I - VI all in one.
1892065290|5.0|I am simply amazed.  First, I will say that this is the best fantasy series I have ever read.  The characters are fully fleshed out and highly believable.  I read one complaint saying that without black and white characters who were you supposed to root for.  He said if everyone were grey then they were all equally bad. This is not true. Martin skillfully writes in such a way that you can understand the characters motivations even if you don't always agree with their actions.  I found myself loving many characters while hating others fiercely or even loving and hating the same character.  It isn't about rooting for some hero archetype, it is about the raw emotions that the characters evoke in you. In most of the fantasy books I read you can see the direction the author is going to take you a hundred miles away.  I still enjoy the ride, but I know what is coming and sometimes it all just starts to feel the same and I have to muddle my way through the crap to get to the climactic ending.  Martin's books are more like a roller coaster ride.  You never know EXACTLY what will happen next. He will run you through a gamut of emotions and the end result is the best piece of epic fantasy ever.
B00005JMSE|4.0|I'll admit up front, I never read Hellboy comics. Still, when I saw it today, I was immersed in the story & characters. Beyond all the fighting (too much CGI, as always, Del Toro!), and the \\"All I want is to fit in\\" schlock that actually works, there is some character development that has lacked in other comic crossovers (X-Men, Spider-Man, etc...)<br />Major positive points: WOW! Ron Perlman was fantastic! Perfect blend of \\"tough-guy\\" along with the uncertainty of an over-protected adolescent. The backstory was EXTENSIVE, but worth it. Great solid supporting cast. Del Toro's fascination with horror and the almighty BOO! pay off a few times, though of course there is lots of goop (a la Blade 2).<br />Overall, I have to sum this up by saying:<br />I am going back to see it again within the next 3 days!

0156027321|4.0|I read this book for my world literature class. As an international student, it was pretty tough to keep up with others; I needed to look up dictionary more than ten times per page, also this book has relatively slow start. However, this book kept dragging me in more and more. I couldn't let it go after I started part two. This book contains author's deep thoughts about religion, zoology, and characterizations. Smart kid named Piscine who survived in the ocean for 227 with Bengal tiger, Interesting explanation of various animals in the zoo, and appealing conversation about religion between author and main character. In my opinion, author \\"Yann Martle\\" did a really good job mixing elements and blended out an interesting story.<br />\\"I would guess that most books come from the same mix of three elements: influence, inspiration and hard work. Let me detail how each one came into play in the writing of Life of Pi.\\"  - [...]
B000063JZQ|2.0|Overall i thougth that the movie was decent. Considering the movie was made in the 70's it was poorly put together and i felt that some of the scens ruined my images form actual play macbeth. the final fight scen was not very good in the book it was potrayed as very powerful proud fight but in the movie the fight was chessy and not very powerfull i mean people where kicking eachother that is not the way a huge fighty should be. However i liked how the movie mad ross the thired murderer It was a very good idea that just seemd to fit and i also liked how in the final scen Donaild Bain whent to see the witchs it tied history in nicly and left the ending a littel more open and i liked that. Over all the movie was not really my idea of a great movie but those of you who are into old movies with fighting and gore its probably a good movie for you.
B000060P79|5.0|I got this CD like about last year and when I read the people's review, I was so suprised and said to myself, what the hell is with these people. Simple Plan is the best rock band EVER!!! Their songs are awesome. Get to the point Simple Plan ROX!!!<br />I love you Jeff Stinco^-^
B00012QM8G|5.0|What a wonderful world we live in! You know, the one where people give an excellent film poor reviews because during the course of 3 hours and a bit, they have to actually GET UP once AND walk five paces to flip over a DVD... Poor things, how could the movie studio do this to them! And this while they have to endure watching so much real-life, heart-wrenching suffering caused by probably the most horrendous event in modern history.<br />Lazy slobs... If this is an issue for you, don't waste your obviously dangerously low energy reserves to clutter this review board with nonsense. <br />Great film, one of the classics of our time. Not suitable for young children, obviously, but almost required viewing for adults. The cheap packaging is disappointing, but I'll just treat it more carefully.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is one of the best rappers ever. And this is his greatest album. This is the shortest rap album I ever heard, but there is no bad song and Nas's lyrics are simply amaezing. <BR>Nas vs Jay-Z?<BR>Nas of course. Because Nas is the best east side rapper (with Big Pun). And that is it.<br />Best tracks:<BR>Memory Lane<BR>It Aint't hard To Tell<BR>Represent
B00008H2LB|5.0|Dosen't anyone ever judge songs or bands by their own merits anymore? No...all I ever see is people saying: 'compared to them or this...this SUCKS!' or 'if you want *real* music try so and so'. Please, just stop. Judge the band by their OWN talents, not by the talents of another band! Someone on here said, if you want good music, try Tool instead. Well, you know what? I like Tool AND Linkin Park. So what if rap/rock combos are nothing new? That's what this band likes to do. It's their music and they can do whatever they please with it. They didn't force you to buy it. It's alright to not like it, but I hate it when people totally insult people for making *ART* of their choice.
B00012QM8G|4.0|Manufacturing defects? Hey, my scratched up library rental copy played flawlessly on my $30 DVD player, so I can't relate to those reports. One reviewer said he would keep his laserdisc copy because at least his laserdisc player will switch sides without having to get up to flip the disc. Yes, but at a maximum of two hours capacity on one laserdisc, that reviewer will have to get up anyway to CHANGE his laserdisc to disc two in order to watch the remainder of the 3 hour 17 minute film! As far as the complaints concerning where the break point was chosen, I think one would be hard-pressed to find a point anywhere in this film where a break wouldn't upset the mood of the moment. Break points are something laserdisc fans had to endure for every film, and the break point chosen in this film isn't nearly as interruptive as some movies on laserdisc! Those who argue that a 3hr 17 minute film can be put on one side of a dual-layer disc are correct. But, a greater amount of compression would be required which would affect picture quality, since they already are also including not only Dolby Digital but DTS soundtrack. The only thing that personally bothers me about this release is the absence of any commentary track.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Some people unfortunately just don't understand that sometimes war is inevitable and, dare I say it, right. The message that you take away from Band of Brothers is that every single soldier would rather be somewhere else doing anything else, but that it is the duty of freedom-loving citizens to confront evil and sometimes that means making war against those that are evil. I would say that there's a painful but outstanding message for future generations in this movie: If you allow evil to fester (and that's what it did in Europe before America's involvement in that theatre) the consequences may indeed be greater than had it been put down sooner, when it would have been more easily achieved.<br />It is very clear that the reviewer from LA actually didn't watch Band of Brothers but is rather a knee-jerk goofball pacifist that probably can't make it through the day because they're always contorted into not making \\"moral judgments\\" about others. In the real world there is right and wrong, good and evil and good people that overlook others doing evil deeds (the German people during WWII) and the sooner you figure that out the better we'll all be. War does solve things when there is complete and utter victory on one side. These people that say it never solved anything are ignorant of the facts.<br />I liked that as the story unfolded that the soldiers were not ever held up as role models in that they were spotless in their personal lives and that they suffered from the same human flaws that we all do and how terrible the consequences of those shortcomings could be.<br />Band of Brothers was an extraordinary piece of work by Spielberg and Hanks and I applaud them for the attention to detail that made it a special experience. I enjoyed the interviews with the men of Easy Company almost as much as the story that the producers laid out. These men are/were truly remarkable for what they did to save Europe from itself and to cement our close relationship with the UK. I know thatI am grateful for the sacrifices they made and those who survived just think of it as doing their duty when America called on them. They were so selfless in the ways that matter.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I have born witness to some travesties to film many times over, and this is another one to add to the list. Cold, sterile, and so fake and cheesy looking. The Hulk himself was ridiculous and the script had as many holes as cheese. Pass this turkey up. A root canal would be better.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this film.  Jack &amp; Diane are excellent as mature, successful, yet playful, middle-aged people.  Throw in Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet for eye candy and Francis McDormand for character and you have a GREAT movie.  I laughed, I cried, I got starry eyed from the romance.  The plot is a little predictable, but manages to pull off scenes that you are not expecting.  Let's just say, IT PUTS IT ALL UP FRONT.  Deal with it or not.  Again...EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT movie!
038533348X|5.0|Wow, I must say it has now become one of my fav. books. In just the opening page I was hooked. This is the second book by Vonnegut I have read and just his style and the words he uses.I dont want to give to much away.<br />Listen: <BR> when I was a younger man - Two wives ago,250,000 cigarettes ago,3,000 quarts of booze ago....<br />But I will say this the book is about a man, John who is writing a book about the Father of the Atom bomb, and thats where the story or shall I say the adventure begins. Very funny stuff..but allow me if you will to take a line from the Books of Bokonon,  &quot;All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.&quot;
B0001ENYKS|4.0|Franz Ferdinand are, without doubt, the most talked about new British band of the moment. Almost a synthesis of the coolest music of the last few years, with some late Britpop crossed with punk-funk and a dash of Coral/-ish madness, their two first singles are almost stunningly great. Great concern, then, that the album might not live up to it. Opener 'Jacqueline' sets worries at rest from the first moment: it begins acoustically before exploding into a rumbling, dramatic song with two brilliant riffs that sounds like The Libertines if they had musical brains about them. Like that band, The Jam is a keen reference point, but there's a dash of The Fall in there too.<br />Poppier offerings like the disco-ish 'Tell Her Tonight', 'Come On Home' and of course the brilliantly shoutable surprise mega-hit 'Take Me Out' (with at least 3 distinctive brilliant sections, at least 3 brilliant riffs, and a impossible swaggering groove), strike a blow for arthouse indie-disco, referencing Talking Heads and reviving a genre that had become inextricably linked with the hopeless Reef and the slightly less hopeless Charlatans. 'Auf Achse' represents the other side of the album, sitting closer to the crop of 80s revivalists such as Interpol and Stellastarr* than the punk-funk of The Strokes or Hot Hot Heat, and referencing, further back, The Smiths, The Fall and of course Joy Division.<br />'Cheating On You' is reminiscent of the art-punk of Sonic Youth at their poppiest, except with more British vocals more reminiscent of Robert Smith of The Cure. Blur, too, are a reference point - there are huge numbers of reference points for this album - its not the most original ever - but it is a great synthesis of fantastic styles that perhaps have never been brought together before. The album is also carried by a stunning array of tunes and riffs that convince every time, bleeding cool, sex and brilliance. 'Darts of Pleasure' is just as brilliant as it was the first time you heard it; 'Come OnHome' is, and eerie, shuffling closer '40 Ft' rounds things up in inimitable style. This is a classic British album and one to seriously treasure. Its array of songs is incredible and it strikes a blow against the increasingly Americanised world of the 'in' music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I saw the &quot;pilot&quot; episode on Fox a year and a half ago, I thought it was incoherent, indulgent, and I wrote the series off as a waste of time.  As it turns out, Fox apparently maimed the series with out-of-order airings and horrific editing.<br />Honestly, this series reminded me of Cowboy Bebop (with each episode treated like a short film), Trigun (spaceships, pistols, and frontier life), and Outlaw Star more than of any of its live action counterparts like Babylon 5 or Farscape (there were also specific scenes that were obviously inspired by these anime).  I really hope Sci-Fi resurrects this series, like they did for Farscape (or perhaps, more like TNT did for Babylon 5).  It is awesome!

B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is a great movie with wonderful actors and actresses. It is the highest grossing movie ever, with the highest groosing soundtrack of all time! Due to Celine Dion's &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. Kate Winslet is just stunning as her role as Rose. Katy Bates and Billy Zane are awsome also! Highly reccommended, alothough I doubt you havent seen this movie yet! 10 stars!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Outstanding debut, what more can I say. Kanye West has skills that blow most other MCs completely out of the water, simply because his kaleidoscope of an imagination combines with his rhyme skills and takes the listeners on such an amazing ride. Not since (the artist formerly and now known as) Prince have I heard an artist that can mention societal struggles (...) and Jesus in the same voice on the same album and not come off as just plain offensive. Kanye West is the future of hip-hop (along with The Roots, OutKast, and Talib Kweli).
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I'm a late 60's early 70's rock fan. Never really got into most of George Harrison's later music, after The Beatles.  Liked several but avoided lots.  This concert blew me away.  The artists are all masters of rock and roll.  The masterfull rendition of &quot;Horse to Water&quot; by Ms. Sam Brown lifted me out of my chair.  It was incredible.  Clapton and all the rest paid a beautiful tribute, in George's own style, to a master and a wonderful man.  This DVD opened my eyes and lifted my spirit.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|While not as enchanting (to me at least) as some of her earlier work, it is still a fabulous piece of art.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|I saw this movie opening night. I had allready read about 3 reviews from different newspapers, and none of them were too kind. I hate to admit this, but I truly am the type of guy that waits to get a general concensus from all different reviews before I go and see a movie. If the concensus  agrees that it's the biggest bomb out there, then I'm renting a movie that night. You get the idea. But, what happens when the concensus shows mixed reviews all across the boards?? I always look at the 2 main stars. Nicholson and Keaton. I mean how bad could it really be. If only I had stuck to my own rule with this, the epitomy of an abysmal movie. Jack has played this part so many times, he could do it in his sleep, which in many scenes was exactly how I felt about the performance coming from this 3 time Oscar winner! Dianne Keaton is real easy to sum up. Annie Hall 26 years later. Only, Jack is no Woody Allen, and the director Nancy Meyers isn't even in the same class with the powerhouse cast that she managed to suck in to this awful mess. What was with that ridiculously over the top 15 minute crying garbage that Keaton was going through. I get that the point was to be over the top, but she fell so hard for a guy that she had known for all of 3 or 4 days. and now she's having a meltdown of near epic proportions over the guy. I know that with this movie, the press and even the stars were hyping the point that finally Jack will get a leading lady thats a bit closer to his age. I've got no problem with that if in fact Jack and Dianne had anything rezembling any kind of chemistry, but maybe I was in the bathroom during the &quot;chemisty&quot; part? Then theres' Keanu, who I won't even waste my time or the readers time by putting down on paper what I think about him. Ok, I'll say one thing. I'd rather see a foreigner get any of the roles that you get in any movie that you do. Here's why. I'd acually prefer to read those hideous subtitles, rather than listen to you read your linesas if you're reading them off cue cards. Gutwrenching. There was one really good thing about this film, but she wasn't around long enough. Frances Mcdormand. She's one of the best in the biz and she should actually have 2 oscars as opposed to the just one for Fargo. Mississippi Burning anyone?:) She was the brief life of the party for SGG, but just as soon as she appeared, she was gone just as quickly and with her she took the life, the heart, the pulse and the fun out of what could have been a great movie instead of a wake up call for 2 ageing actors.
1401300901|3.0|It was a fun, easy read and it made me feel nostalgic for my own youthful days.
0393057658|5.0|I was very surprised when I read this book. I knew that the Oakland A's had a low payroll and an excellent team. I figured that it all had to do with management and thier decisions on players. But I had no idea of the elaborate system that the A's used to find players and how they were able to land them so cheaply. It is truely facinating. The tactics of getting good players for less money than they were worth was eye-opening. Some of the players on the A's were people who no one else wanted because they were not the &quot;typical looking player.&quot; The A's took player who were sometimes too fat, too short, and too slow. Everyone continually writes them off becuase they don't do things the conventional way. The thing is, they can't do things the conventional way because they don't have the money.<BR>They have come up with a system that is widely based on the use of statistics and computers and a very strict philosophy on the type of player to draft. This might sound strange now but it is so well explained that at the end you should become a ravid Billy Beane and Oakland A's fan. You will suddenly wish to follow everything that they do.You will understand that thier record 20 game winning streak was deserved and that all the critics were wrong. Moneyball shows that a small market team, when run in a unique way, can be incredibly sucsessful and can give its high priced oppentents all that they can handle.
0375707972|1.0|I never found myself fully engaged in this book, I did finish it hoping that something more would develop.  This book is divided into three parts, the first is when Michael is a teenager, the second covers the trial of Hannah, the third section has Michael as an adult &amp; Hannah in jail.<br />The book started out ok, although I found myself annoyed with Hannah &amp; her childlike attitude &amp; tantrums.  The first section ends abruptly with Hannah disappearing and not returning until her trial 10 years later.  The trial drags on, it never pulls you into what's happening.  By the time the third section came around I was completely uninterested with Hannah in jail.<br />By the time the &quot;big&quot; revelation comes about in the third section, it's too late for you to feel compassion or sympathy for Hannah.  I have to say I was very disappointed in what was an attempt to tie the entire story together &amp; make you understand Hannah &amp; her behavior.<br />Don't waste your time with this book, there are certainly better choices out there.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I just want to let you know that Rammstein created an English version of Du Hast for the United States with the name &quot;You Hate&quot;  I fluently speak German and 'Hate' In German is spelled hasst. The song is spelled hast. The correct translation for the song is 'You Have', so whoever wrote the review on this dvd is stupid to talk about Rammstein making kids do crap, if all you critics got what you wanted, we'd have some pretty lame ass bands..

0140187537|4.0|A powerful novel, with a plot that most can relate to.  Ethan Hawley, the main character struggles to provide for his family. Comes from a family of successful business men, until The Great Depression hits his family hard and he must start from the bottom, working as a produce market clerk. He feels that he must own up to his name that has been made by his predecessors. He is confronted by opportunities that question his integrity and common sense.<br /> What I like about this novel is that present day situations arise which grabs my attention and makes me think. Ethan, married with two children, thinks of his family first, because all he wants is to give them what he feels they deserve. He would sacrifice his own happiness to make his family happy.<br /> I also can relate to how he sometimes feels disappointed by how his life is panning out, but doesn't forget all the things he should be grateful for. I strongly recommend this novel to all who love to read. Whether you can relate to it or not, it will make you think, and help you appreciate some things that are taken for granted.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Terminator2 is the best movie that I was moved. Though I love Terminator1 too, love 2 more. More than 10 years passed sinse this movie was roadshowed, but I don't feel that the work is out of day. One of the reasons will be what the work was used computer grafic, for instance the newest terminator, Requid Metal was burn and got to requid by heat, the scene was real and wonderful scene used so great computer grafic that I can not believe more than 10 years ago.  <br />Off course in Japan too the movie was big hit movie.<BR>The battle of T800 and T1000 was scenes that was moved me, the reality, exciting, the scene broken wall by their attacking, by shot-gun the scene that penetrate T1000....<BR>Now even, this work will be not inferior to other movies. <br />[AD2029, in the earth after atomic bomb war, the war of Mathine and Human have started, Mathine sent the Terminator into the childhood of the Human director Konar and tried to kill her.<BR>Against that, Konar sent her Terminator into the age....]<BR>This was the sub writing of title the other day.<BR>Whan we read upon writing, there is not person that don't feel anything. That was the story that was moved.<br />Thank you for reading poor English.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've been listening to Lateralus for a year now. Originally, I decided to buy the album for a change in style. I'm glad I did. Not only is this CD amazing, I think that Tool is the greatest band ever.<br />The band members are superb at what they do. Maynard probably has the best voice ever, going from mellow to all out screams without ever losing it. Justin Chancellor is definitely better than all those other bassists you get; his bass lines are actually audible and catchy...unlike other bassists who just play the same rhythm and notes. Tool fans would probably say that Danny Carey, the drummer, is the talent of the band: and they'd be right. Not that he does anything flashy, he does just what the song needs, while playing offtime to the guitarist without loosing a single beat among other things. My personal favourite from the band would definitely be Adam Jones. Though he takes a backseat to the rest of the band talent-wise, guitarists can truly appreciate his riffs. Never predictable or 'commercial',  they're all different.<br />I'd like to say, at first, Lateralus is not an easy album. With songs ranging from 6 - 22 mins, you need to wait to understand music. Listen to the album like you watch a movie. The songs will have a greater effect, unlike listening to 2 mins randomly of each song. The sequencing on the album kicks, the opuses just flow on from each other.<br />1. The Grudge - Awesome intro. Introduces Tool's `tribal' side. Very heavy, and there's a very impressive 1/2 minute scream from Maynard towards the end. 9/10<BR>2. Eon Blue Apocalypse - Filler, though probably the best. Sets a futuristic theme that the album explores.<BR>3. The Patient - Good song. Starts with electronic noises and a cool riff. Alternates between soft and heavy a lot. Metallica fans might like the heavier parts. Good outro. 6/10<BR>4. Mantra - Last filler. It's Maynard squeezing his Siamese cat. Sounds like whales.<BR>5. Schism - First single off the album. Many people liked thistrack; personally, I don't see what's so accessible about it. Sweet bass line to begin with. Good outro again. Lyrics are linked with The Grudge: about two lovers falling apart. Overall, a good song, but like The Patient, slightly above average for Lateralus.<BR>6. Parabol and 7. Parabola. Another single, though a double track set. More radio-friendly than Schism, with very harmonised choruses. First real hard-rock song off the album and instantly likeable. Parabol is a 3 minute acoustic version of Parabola with good lyrics about not throwing away your life, then feedback and goes into the heavier Parabola. Has to be listened to all the way through for full effect. Amazing video. 9/10<BR>8. Ticks and Leeches - Like Parabol/Parabola, this is another hard-rocking song, lots of screaming, that's why it's never played live. Good drumming. The heaviest and most angriest song off the album...quite strange since the rest is all positive. Though it's good where it is. It's about the music industry taking a lot out of the band and getting them sidetracked. Maybe not, the lyrics are way over my head. 8/10<BR>9. Lateralus - Wow, by the way, it's lateralus not lateralis...spelling mistake. The spiral song as I like to call it, reason? It's in 9/8, 8/8, 7/8, all the way through. Originally called 987, that number is the 12th step in the Fibonnaci number sequence (1+1=2, 1+2=3,2+3=5 etc.) Even the lyrics follow this pattern. It's the formula that dandies and snail shells are made out of. Also creates a spiral. Proves Tool are an intelligent band. Anyway, listen to the last few minutes of the song, has a somewhat spirally effect. Truly uplifting and amazing. Definitely the best Tool song ever. The guitar riff and the way it's built up in the beginning also kicks. Amazingly heavy ending with Maynard singing 'Spiral out/Keep going'. 10/10<BR>10. Disposition - First part of a three song suite to end Lateralus. Highly influenced by Maynard's work on APC. Good song to follow the self-titled. Has a minimalist feel to it, with only 3 (very) moving lyrical verses ('Watch the weather change/Mention this to me/Mention anything') and just as many instrumental verses. The first song to introduce tàblas.<BR>11. Reflection - Continues where Disposition left off. Has Arab instrumentation at the beginning and quite accessible as well, with Maynard singing 'Before I pine away'. At 11 mins, it's the longest song on the album, but definitely doesn't feel like it. 10/10<BR>12. Triad - The name sums it up, last of the trilogy and an instrumental. Probably the BEST OUTRO EVER. Extremely heavy with a kick-@$$ and equally simple guitar riff, amazing cymbal work from Danny and ethereal female vocals, slightly techno/futuristic feel to it. At the end of Lateralus, I play this song 6 or 7 more times before I'm satisfied. I listen to it more than than the s/titled. Maybe I'm overrating it because of my heavy tastes. 11/10<BR>13. Faaip De Oaid - Hidden track. A radio excerpt of some guy talking about Area 51. Quite creepy. Has Danny doing some stickwork over the talking. Don't know why it's here; probably to emphasise the theme.<br />Overall Lateralus gets a 10/10. The best parts are the 9 minute epic Lateralus, and the trippy 22 minute overture to end the album. At 80 mins with 7 masterpieces, it's the best CD they've made, I don't know how Tool will surpass it. I heard that the new album's going to be like Lateralus and Undertow. Expect it around 2005 if we're lucky. Other albums to check out: Tool - Ænima and Mudvayne - L.D. 50 (I know it's nu-metal, but the closest thing to Tool song structure and format. No verse/chorus formula. Has musical time changes, as well as a rhythm section that is equally as good as Danny and Justin).<br />Don't hesitate to buy this album, the artwork is amazing.
055321277X|4.0|This book had its ups and downs it was also short. The intoduction put everything into sense like when it was said the trues meaning of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's names. They are both of Scandinavian origin as Hyde comes from the Anglo-Saxon hyd which is Danish hide &quot;a haven&quot;, and Jekyll comes from the Danish name Jokulle, which means &quot;an icicle&quot;, and by not knowing the backround of the names some might think that Hyde means a place for hiding. I liked this book because it was exciting except for the begining of the novel when it was just talking about the characters and what they do. My favorite chapter was Search for Mr. Hyde because thats when we first get to see Mr. Hyde because they would only say little thing that would keep you guessing, and once I found out what he looked like I was excited to read more.<BR>    I would have to say that the best character was Dr. Henry Jekyll. I liked how he was sneaky and in the end of the book he tryed to be the good guy and stop taking the potion. It was also interesting when it was kind of throught the end of the novel when you find out that Jekyll and Hyde were very close. I would recondmend this book to almost anyone because I'm not much of a reader, but I really enjoyed this book.
0156027321|4.0|Hundreds of reviews have already been written about Yann Martel`s, the Life of Pi.  I also feel that this is a story where the review should not spoil the plot for those people who have yet to read it.  So I will keep this short.  But I will say that the reader will fall in love with Pi Patel-the 16 year old son of a zookeeper, whose family is attempting to move from India to Canada.  You will love Pi's intelligence, his innocence, his quick thinking, and especially his faith.  You will also marvel at the relationship Pi achieves with an unlikely character, and how they help each other to survive an amazing ordeal.  You will also be amazed at what Pi has to do to survive.  The Life of Pi is definitely a book that ends with more questions than answers, and it will haunt you long after you've finished reading.  My only criticism is that I feel the religious theme could have been played throughout the book a little more than it did.  But despite this, The Life of Pi is a great effort by the author, and I found that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out the ending.
0553260111|4.0|I read the book by Robert Ludlum.  It is about a guy who is lost and gets found in the Mediterranean Sea.  He had been shot six times in the back.  When he wakes up he does not remember anything, not where he lives, not even where he lives.  But one that he does remember is how to read, write, and he knew everything that he got taught in school.  Well when he gets back to shore he goes to the bank, because he remembered his bank account number. When he got everything out of the account it was all in a small brief case, there was a gun with 8 million dollars in cash, along with a passport that said his name, which was Jason Bourne.  Later he leans that he was part of the CIA best man.<br /> The reason that I liked this book is because it was very mysterious.  For example, He was in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea and he didn't know he how he got there and who he was, such as his birthday, or even his name.  Another thing is that he didn't know his name but he knew how to read, write, and do all the stuff people learn in school.  <br /> The second reason why I like this book is because it is very funny.  For example, while all of this stuff is happening to him he is still having fun and cracking jokes.  Like when he just got done killing a man he saw some gum and a candy bar and he said, \\"This is my favorite stuff!\\"  and then he ate it.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|This cd sucks. don't waste your money on it. The only thing that made me even give this cd 3 stars is Kelly's The Trouble With Love IS, and Maroon 5. Kelly is probaly the BEST pop female singer right now, because the shanky ones lip sync at their own concerts. And Maroon 5, other than Kelly are my favorite performers. The songs that Maroon 5 sings, one isn't even full-length. DO NOT WATSE YOUR MONEY! heck just go buy \\"Thankful\\" and \\"Songs About Jane\\" for actual good music! this cd was an extreme let down :(
076790592X|5.0|I like what Morrie said in the book,   \\"Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently\\"    \\"What if today is my last day on earth?\\" (Somehow, We are trained not to face this kind of question, but we all know this day inevitably would arrive, just when)      These Questions \\"trigger\\" me to think more deeply about my life. Personally I benefit alot from Learning the lessons mentioned in the book.
0739313126|5.0|STOP wondering ... U should read this book ... (or listen to it... i'm an audiobook junkie)...there are over 3000 reviews of this book just here on Amazon... IMAGINE... a fiction book spawning such a controversy!!! what's not to read...<br /><br />LOOK, we all form our own opinions about how well the story is told, how well the characters are developed, how the story flows, is the information historically (or otherwise accurate)?<br /><br />WHO CARES!!!!!!!!! Anything about any of that... any fiction book that has generated as much discussion, comment, controversey, suspense... etc. etc. etc.... deserves at least one read (listen).<br /><br />I my opinion, this is a GREAT STORY... whether it is a great \\"book\\" or not is not for me to say... but it is A GREAT story... well told, with (at least 4 me) .. vivid characters, lots of action, mystery, suspense, some romance, and BEST of all ... a spellbinding presentation of otherwise unknown, ignored, or purposefully hidden? ... facts about some of history's most well known intellectuals .... AND YES, about the Cathloic Church's history ..... IS IT still going on today????<br /><br />In short, I'm not going to claim I am any great book critic... BUT, I KNOW A GOOD STORY WHEN I HEAR ONE ... (read one)... this book is so popular, criticized, maligned, praised, .... WIDELY READ (KEY POINT)... because it DESERVES to be........ like all the innuendo or not..... it's a GREAT BOOK... READ or LISTEN to it or you will have missed out on the best book of the early 2000s....... maybe for many years to come....
0142004235|5.0|This is one of Steinbeck's best, eclipsed only by The Grapes of Wrath.  I first read it at about age 12, and fell in love with his descriptions of the Salinas valley.  I went to California in 1984 just to see how Salinas looked 30 years after the book, and it was just that beautiful with the miles and miles of cultivated fields.  The characters are real, the plot is pure Steinbeck.  You know what is going to happen, yet you continue to hope for human behavior to change.  I have never forgotten the way Lee's group of Chinese scholars worked to decipher that one word which meant \\"thou mayest\\".  Those kinds of details make John Stenbeck unforgettable.
0515127485|4.0|The search for Stalin's secret notebook brings a British historian, who is definitely not politically correct, to a modern-day Russia struggling to come to terms with its Capitalistic reforms.  There the historian finds something more shocking than even he could have imagined hidden away in a far-flung northern outpost of Russia.  Perhaps Stalinism is not dead after all.  This tightly-written novel will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the end of the book; I highly recommend it.

0783229526|4.0|In the book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas there is a reporter and his lawyer that go to Las Vegas to cover a coupe stories.  While they are in Las Vegas they experiment with a lot of different drugs.  In the course of doing all these drugs they get paranoid about getting caught by the cops or other people around them.  In some cases they even think that people are out to kill them so they carry a gun with them and in other cases they even turn on each other accusing each other of being cops ready to bust them for all the drugs they have.<BR> Some of the characteristics of the reporter are that he is a drugy and that he is always strung out.  He is a very complicated person and you could never predict what his next move will be.  The reason why I like this character is because he is an individual and he doesn't care about what anybody thinks of him.  Anything and everything he does, he does because he wants to and he doesn't think about what anybody would think.<BR> A very interesting topic about this book is that it is all about drugs.  When people do drugs it makes reading or hearing about there lives more interesting.  If this book was the same in every aspect except the drugs there would be nothing interesting about it.  There would be nothing to grab you into reading this book.
B00005JM02|4.0|Animation is superb, but the story did not work in some places even with the necessary suspension of disbelief.
B00001OH7O|5.0|After going through a somewhat 'glam rock' phase, I had acquired Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane before I ever purchased it. As a recommendation from another Bowie fan, I picked this one. As much as I do adore the 2 above said albums, they do not surpass Hunky Dory by any means. <br />The music may be a bit simple, but it's enthralling no less. After listening to the simple lyrics of Frank Sinatra [the other most frequented artist in my collection, go figure...], this is quite a change. Changes, likely the most infamed track off the album, is rather catchy and I never hesitate to skip it when in rotation, but doesn't seem to strike me as the best piece. Eight Line Poem + Life on Mars are both creepy, alluding ballads, both excellent. The reminiscent blues sound in Song for Bob Dylan makes it worth the listen; Andy Warhol, for whatever reason [that i cannot name], I find myself constintly listening to. However...<br />Quicksand holds the test of time, atleast my cd collection, as one of my favourite songs. Hands down. It's not the most particularly poppy songs, no sugary lyrics that repeat in your brain until you're at the cliff of insanity...the mood of the piece itself isn't my typical dish, either. But what seperates itself is the lyrics. Quite frankly, it makes me a bit uncomfortable--Crowley, Himmler, Bardot, Garbo, Churchill, etc. 'Tis uneasy + a tad bit creepy, yet equally enthralling. <br />The album is different, a perfected blending of genres--artsy even, and defintely one of my most preferred. 70s Bowie was always the greatest and in my opinion, this is his greatest album from the period. Not a song I skip over. Only have Ziggy Stardust? No fear. Your opinion on the man could very well differ whether what album you possess. And if your collection is nulled, get this one. Worth every penny.
B00000HZFH|5.0|as a person who generally finds indie rock to be really whiny and crappy, I cannot believe how amazing this cd is.  I don't even really like this band's other cds at all, i think they are much too slow and sludgy, and despite their obvious talent I find it hard to avoid passing out from the sheer overwhelming sleepiness of the songs.  Either that or the production is just awful, as on older albums.  This album must be the magic one, since they conquer everything I find annoying about indie rock and make an album that actually rocks.  So, if you are like me, and your friends keep pushing various indie cds on you and this happens to be one of them, give in and get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I saw a lot of action movies in 2003, from \\"Daredevil,\\" \\"X-Men 2,\\" \\"The Hulk\\" to \\"The Matrix\\" sequels and \\"Terminator 3\\" -- but \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" was the single best movie I saw all year.<br />Some people refused to see the movie because they didn't want to pay twice to see both parts.  Well, even if you just see the first part, it's worth the money.<br />Tarantino brings together all the elements: Action, suspence, acting, dialogue, and of course music. Most movies are filmed and the music is added on later, but Tarantino sets up each scene to last as long as each song on the soundtrack, making the movie into a series of music videos.<br />And the over-the-top martial arts sequences blow \\"The Matrix\\" out of the water. Any fan of Tarantino, or martial arts movies, or good movie soundtracks, needs to own this movie.<br />(Of course, I'm holding out to get Vol. 1 and 2 together in one box -- but if you missed Vol. 1 in the theater, you should definitely get the DVD, then see Vol. 2 in the theater.)
B0001MDPV8|5.0|I don't even need to write a review for this cuz, we all know Illmatiac is one of the greatest albums of all time.  His remixes are bangin.  You could have Life's a B*%ch over a country beat and it would still be fire.  For a matter of fact these songs don't even need beats.  It would still be a classic acapella. His 2 new tracks are fire.  For a matter of fact if you don't have this stop reading this review and go to your nearest record store and cop it.  GO!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My husband and I being Bill Murray fan's couldn't wait to watch this movie.  What a disappointment.  Most of the movie is spent watching people in bars drink and smoke out of boredom.  We WALKED OUT halfway through.  Want a good Bill Murray experience go rent STRIPES or GROUNDHOG'S DAY, pop some popcorn and be entertained.
0066620996|5.0|This is a great biz book: it is eminently practical, beautifully written, and in my own investigations I have seen exactly what the author is talking about.  Stories are also interwoven in the book is a useful and interesting, indeed fascinating, way and greatly add to the text rather act as filler.  Indeed, this is one of the few biz books I know that is worth reading all the way through, whereas most can be digested solely from reading the cover blurbs or at most the first chapter.<br />Simply put, Collins et al advocate putting the right people in the right place (&quot;on the bus&quot;), then carefully developing a simple and utterly clear vision of where to go (&quot;hedgehog concept&quot;), and finally to make incremental steps that add up into major breakthroughs (&quot;moving the flywheel&quot;).  Time and again, I have seen this pattern in the great companies that I have been in, from China and Italy to the US:  you get a great leader who is tough yet fair and self-effacing, who develops a common vision through trial and error, and then people join in of their own accord and work extremely hard to realize their common vision.  This book offers a framework to analyse these ideas systematically and I will use it for years to come.<br />Highly recommended.  However common-sensical this all may sound, everyone can learn from this, particularly in the detailed stories, but also in the lists of ideas.

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence' album &quot;Fallen&quot; is one of the best alternative CDs released in a long time.  You know how one or two songs get airplay, even when the music's special?  And you buy the CD for those songs?  That's what I did.  But I like EVERY track.  Amy Lee and Company have a very good thing here.  I can't wait for their next CD.
0064407667|5.0|This is a sad story about three Baudelaire children named Klaus, Sunny, and Violet. And their distant relative, named Count Olaf that is trying to steal their fortune. Good thing these three little kids are very smart. And there is this lady that always there to help them. That person is Justice Strauss. <br />Count Olaf has to take care of these Baudelaire kids. Then he thinks of trying to steal the Baudelaire fortune with his associates. He thinks of trying to steal it by trying to marry the oldest child, Violet Baudelaire legally. Then Klaus goes to Justice Strauss's library to figure out everything he could about marriage. <br />Then it is the day when they have to perform the play where everyone is invited. But Sunny couldn't make it because she was hanging at the rooftop of Count Olaf's house. But his plan all goes wrong when Violet doesn't sign the paper with her correct hand. The Count Olaf escapes with his associates and everything is fine. But where are the Baudelaire children going to live?<br />I liked this book because it is exciting and kind of has some adventure. I also liked this book because the kids are brilliant and like to work as hard as they could. Violet is good at mechanics or inventing things. Klaus likes to read a lot and is good at looking for information and also understanding difficult words. He can also solve puzzles that are difficult. Sunny is creative by using her four sharp teeth. This was a really great book and I recommend every one of fifth to eighth graders to read this book.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|If for no other reason, buy this album for the hits in Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller, The Girl Is Mine, Wanna Be Starting Something, and P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)! 7 of the 9 tracks on this album went on to be top 10 singles.<br />Michael Jackson was bigger than big during this period. I am just disappointed that I was in my mother's womb when it was all taking place!
0800179501|5.0|I love this movie but what's with the lousy transfer? Hello?! McFly?!? Haven't they heard of &quot;16 X 9&quot;? I wish the studio clowns would remaster this thing and do the movie justice. Hey, they did it correctly with the rest of the movies in this series, the least they can do is to remaster this classic.
0385504209|1.0|I am constantly amazed at the assertions I hear people make regarding the excellent story contained in the DaVinci code.  It was embarrassingly weak and the characters were very one-dimensional.  The Bourne Identity it wasn't.  I took solace in the fact that the derth of religious information, Brown claims to be fact, was really quite interesting.  Unfortunately I wasn't allowed to enjoy even that for very long as I have read or heard most of his assertions debunked by those far more in the know in their particular fields than Brown. I wish I could have the time spent reading The DaVinci Code back so I could substitute a read of real entertainment or intellectual value.  In the past I have avoided reading fads.  It was a mistake to deviate from that rule; I won't again.
B000002ADT|5.0|About 6 months ago, I was a newcomer into the ridiculously large realm of Jazz music, and I needed a place to start. So I bought this album hearing from many that it was a classic. Needless to say, they were right!<br />Miles Davis is a truly amazing trumpet player, and his jazz ensemble doesn't fall short of him either. With people like John Coltrane wailing on sax and Bill Evans' great piano (the first piano break on Freddie Freeloader is my favorite part of the album), its truly a masterpiece. I'll break it down track-by-track.<br />So What- A good slow piano-bass intro, that eventually moves into an improv section with a catchy tune.<br />Freddie Freeloader- Almost 12-bar, but jazzed up quite a bit. Just a good swinging song to sit back and relax listening to.<br />Blue in Green- beautiful horn on this one, whatever it is (I'm not exactly the horn master myself), and good piano playing from Evans. A slow one.<br />All Blues- A lengthy intro before the improv begins, but nevertheless very good, with a dynamic horn part, sounds like it had a little bit of classical influence.<br />Flamenco Sketches- A nice closing track, soothing yet articulate, one to fall asleep to.<br />All in all, this CD has a great song for every kind of mood. And hey, for 10 bucks, its a good price for a classic album you'll treasure for a long time.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This album proves that iron maiden are still a great band and have stood the test of time. It has great new songs like &quot;dance of death&quot; and &quot;paschendeale&quot;. Its a great album and a must buy for any maiden fan like myself.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I enjoyed every single minute of this superb dvd. It's a documentary styled view of the life and times of Bubl at work and at play. <BR>To be able to see and hear him sing at sold out concert halls throughout the world  is something to behold - and this superbly produced and edited dvd gives you that. The performances are impeccable - what an amazing vocalist and song stylist - reminicent of all the late greats put together - yet accomplished with the undeniable Bubl stamp - personality, charisma, showmanship - the list could (should) go on and on. <BR>Great idea Mr. Bubl, you must be commended for allowing us to see what you go through - it's no small wonder that you are taking the world by storm! Continued success!!

B000002KY8|5.0|Words really can't describe this CD.  Prince is a great talent and he can basically do whatever he wants when it comes to great music and lyrics, but he reached his climax with 1999.  This is the greatest CD he ever recorded by far in his entire career.  I know alot of people think that &quot;Purple Rain&quot; would be ranked as his best, but if you really listen to both CD's you will hear a big difference from one to the other.  &quot;1999&quot; is and will always be the corner stone of Prince's career.  You have &quot; Red Corvette&quot;, &quot;DMSR&quot;, Automatic&quot;, &quot;Something In The Water Does Not Compute&quot;, &quot;Lady Cab Driver&quot;, &quot;International Lover&quot; and &quot;1999&quot;.  Just take the time out to listen to this CD and then compare it to any of his other CD's, and I bet you will agree that this was the ONE!!!!!!!  Doesn't get any better than &quot;1999&quot;
0553274503|5.0|Flowers For Algernon<BR>By: Daniel Keyes<BR>Reviewed by K. Wong<BR>P.6<br />This book is about a 32 year old man named Charlie.  He worked at a bakery.  He wasn't like other people.  Charlie wanted to learn how to read, write, and go to college.  He would write in a journal everyday about what he's thinking.  One day Charlie took a test to see if he can be operated on to be smarter.  He did the operation and he tried doing some mazes with a mouse that had the same operation done to him.  It took a long time to see if he was getting smarter.  He still had to write in the journal everyday.  Before the operation was done, his writing was weird but a few weeks after the operation was finished, his writing got better.  <BR> I like this book because it's about a person who really wants to learn something.  He wanted to get smart and go to college.  There was an operation done to him so he would get smarter.  Everyday that he writes in his journal you can see he is getting smart because his spelling and grammar is improving.  That was the first time that experiment has been done to a person.  <BR> \\"He sed sit down Charlie and make yourself cunfortible and relax.\\"  This is what Charlie wrote in his second entry before he was operated on.  \\"As far as I can tell, in the daysbefore the operation, I never really understood what planes were.\\"  That was a quote after the operation was done.  <BR> My favorite part in the book is when they start doing the operation on him.  A few days after he has to listen to a TV that helps you learn.  It teaches you in your sleep too.  I also like the part where his co-workers try to get Charlie in trouble with the boss.  They try getting him in trouble by telling him to make dough when he isn't suppose to touch that machine to make dough.  Charlie starts making the dough then Charlie's boss walks in and Charlie did a good job in making dough.
B000002LE6|5.0|I have got to be one of Prince's greatest fans I own every recorded by Prince that was available to the public.  Lovesexy was and still is a great cd starting out with the slamming right out of the gates with \\" I No\\" and then cruising into \\"Alphabet Street\\".  When love calls you gotta go... So I guess Prince had to go and start up the New Power Generation.  This is the first CD when he started the NPG. \\"Anna Stesia\\" has got to be one of the greatest under rated songs ever recorded by Prince.  I recommend this CD to all fans, but especially a die hard Prince fan.  Rock this CD up loud and enjoy!!!!!!!!

B0000AQVCL|4.0|This is one of those bands that I probably shouldn't like, because they have no identity of their own - rather, their identity comes from the pilfering of sounds from other established bands.  It almost becomes a game as you listen to each track: Spot The Influence.  You can hear elements of the Kinks (&quot;Last Chance&quot;), Iggy Pop (&quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;), Rolling Stones (&quot;Rollover DJ&quot;), the Beatles (&quot;Look What You've Done&quot;), AC/DC (&quot;Cold Hard B--ch&quot;), and the list goes on.  I notice that they garner a lot of comparisons to bands like the Strokes and the White Stripes, but I hear more of a '60s-'70s hard rock influence than I do the late '70s NYC Greenwich Village garage rock sound in Jet.<br />While these guys don't really offer anything that makes them stand out from the lot of retro-minded rock bands these days, they are still young and have put together a very solid group of songs - they are catchy and executed so well that you would never guess that it was a debut from a band whose members are all in their early to mid-20s.  That this is such a solid fully-realized debut indicates that Jet has quite a future ahead of them.<br />In summary: A formulaic but solid collection of songs from the young Australians of Jet.  Maybe they're blatantly duplicating some of the sounds that inspired them, but they do it with such skill and aplomb that you don't really mind.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Everything about this film was quite wonderful.  The acting, cast, location, setting, story.  It was all quite charming.  Plus, I could not stop smiling at Johnny Depp.  He is extremely handsome in this film; the sexiest he has ever looked.<br />Chocolat is delightful and has a way of saying \\"Sometimes, you shouldn't follow what your heart originally tells you.\\"
B000063DFN|5.0|I have about half of maiden's albums and out of the ones I've got/heard this is easily my favoiurite. Dance of Death is almost as good, but this has so many maiden classics on it. This was also my 1st maiden album and i bought it after hearing 2 minutes to midnight on GTA Vice City lol. <br />The opening track, Aces High is a great fast rocker and I'd give it a 5/5.<br />As i said, this song was my introduction to iron maiden its one of their best 6/5<br />Losfer Words (Big Orra) I've never been a big fan of instrumental songs (exept The call of ktulu by metallica) so I'm not sure how to rate this song, it sounds pretty good but i don't listen to it much so you can decide if you like it or not.<br />Flash of the Blade - Another classic, I don't like this one as much as the first 2 songs but it's still reaL good. 4/5<br />The Duellists- I personally don't ;like how high bruce's voice goes in the chorus of this song but the verses are really good and it has a great instrumental bit in the middle. 4/5<br />Back in the Village - I was reading other reviews and i saw that this song didnt get any particularly good comments. Well<BR> i think it is another stand-out track on this masterpeice of an album. The chorus can get a bit repeditive at times but its still a great song 4.5/5<br />Powerslave-  this is my personal favourite track on the album. I can still remember the 1st time i heard it.  i love the way that its got the coffin  opening n evil laughing etc at the end of back in the vcillage then some drums that go crashing into the start of this song. buy the cd and you'll see what i mean.<BR>7/5<br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner - Here we come to the last track on the cd. a 13 minute super- epic. This is another great monster of a song that'll stay stuck in your head for days on end. I would give this a 6 but the only thing that ruins it is the long narrative bit in the middle with just the bassline. I know it's supposed to like give you the fell of the story etc. but its too long and i always fast forward through it.   5.5/5<br />Well to wrap things up, this is Iron Maiden at their finest and if you don't have it you don't know what you're missing out on.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Wow! The music is outstanding! What more can I say? I do believe it is essential to watch the movie first to really understand and appreciate the soundtrack. I heard the soundtrack before watching the movie and was actually uncertain about watching the film. I didn't understand the lyrics or in the context they were being sung. After watching the movie I bought the soundtrack immediately. Highly recommended!
B0001HAHXW|1.0|eric, you've assured yourself a spot as one of the great rockers, bluesmen, guitarists et al...  your place in history is assured.  Please stop this regression blues genre!!  you're killin' me!!<br />when an 'unplugged' layla came out i just about gagged!!  noted for it's listless slopey slow dulled cadence with all of it's urgency, GONE!! what was the point?  Elberta?  couldn't recognize it!!!  syrupy crap!!  yes, i think you sold a ton of it but there's no accounting for taste out there.  look at jerry springer's popularity.  you can also play acoustic?  big deal, enough already.  <br />i am a crumby guitarist who is in love with music...all kinds, including blues.  grew up in chicago and saw all the great electric ones.  also have all the acoustic ones on lp or cd.   this thing sounds like me at my most hoped for achievement...a white boy from the suburbs playing for my mates at the local!!  &quot;that's what i'm talkin' bout&quot;?  oy vay!!  i thought i almost heard van morrison jump in with his mates from his skiffle album!!!  YUK!  <br />i made a serious dash through it because i found nowhere to stop and listen....all the same with too much harp (great for a little riff here and there but...) and loads too much piano.  i know, i know...the tinkering on piano goes along with the acoustic &quot;that's all we had way back then&quot; idea.  IT'S BORING!!!  but worse, it can be reproduced by anyone with a small bit of talent, beneath you actually.<br />please eric, break out brownie? blackie? oh, you sold em for charity...  but something with a pickup?  bring back a sense of urgency?  take over a song again?  we know you can sing.  let's not run through ALL the old songs...STOP!!!
0156027321|2.0|I read this book along with the rest of my World Litterature class.  I did not enjoy it very much, being that I am an action book reader.  I enjoy reading military non-fiction, and Star Wars novels, so this is most likely my reason for not enjoying Life of Pi.  Had Pi landed on an island with a bunch of war lords or some sort of other armed persons, perhaps this book would have been enjoyable for me. I find the far fetched storyline extremely troublesome.  If a book is supposed to be fiction say so and treat it that way.
6302787297|5.0|Great film, excellent cast and performances, most notably Gerard Depardieu's part as Christopher Columbus, he brings a presence to the role in both emotional and physical form which fits the film perfectly. A real treat is that this is Ridley Scott's best looking movie to date, there is something about it that puts you at a lost for words. It's score by Vangelis is so gripping, that the film and the score hold hands, if they had em'. The politics aside, this film serves up an adventure for the viewer like no other. Kick back, and wonder what it may have all been like. 1492: Conquest Of Paradise, is a beautifully realized film about the experiences of Christopher Columbus seen through the eye of a camera. Quite an accomplishment for all involved in this project.
0156027321|4.0|Well, given all the hype and talk about this book, I'd say it was...fine. I liked it well enough. It started a little slow, but then picked up. I really liked the bits about the animals in the zoos. If it had been 300 pages about zoo animals, I would have loved it.<br />     Considering the tone of the reviews and blurbs, I was afraid it was going to be too, well, dreamscapey, for lack of a better word, for my taste. There was, however, plenty of action and not many delirious dreaming sequences at all. I have no patience for those in any book.<br />     I think my favorite chapter in the whole book was one of the last italicized chapters, which I assumed were intended to portray an author's interview with Pi, presumably to get the story and write it down (it took me a long time to figure that out!). It was the one when he meets Pi's little daughter. The love between the two is apparent, which I took to mean that Pi wasn't damaged by his ordeal and was still a happy person, and the narrator says, &quot;I knew this story would have a happy ending.&quot; That bit made me smile and warmed my heart.<br />   I have one comment about Pi's relationship with Richard Parker. I thought the author did well by writing that as realistically as possible. I kept waiting for Pi and RP to become good friends and snuggle buddies, but that's not real. And Pi's disappointment in Richard Parker's sudden departure upon landfall was quite insightful. He did a good job projecting what might actually happen, and what Pi would have expected and the feelings he would have had. I never would have thought of it, but after I read it, I thought to myself, 'He's absolutely right.<br />     The ending was really interesting. It made me a little sad because after reading Pi's second version of events, I began to doubt, just a tiny bit, what actually happened. But it was a clever idea by the author. And I DO believe!
0062515675|3.0|Author has tried to use a different approach of presenting India's age old principles of happy living. He has constructed a Fable to say the same often repeated principles of Himalayan sages. The &quot;Fable&quot; aproach may appear fabulous. But the principles are the same old ones which many of us have heard umpteem number of times. However, no new method or technique is given for weaving these principles into the fabric of our fast paced life.I am an Indian and I know from my experience that even people in India where the life has a little less speed than in the West, find it very difficult to implement these principles in their lives. A direct communion with an enlightend sage is the best way to really learn these principles.<BR>All said, one can not deny the fact that the book could be  inspiring to many readers who can not immediately leave their earthly lives to go to Himalaya. In a way the book is a first step towards higher learnings. With the limited intention of getting some inspiration for understanding of higher principles of life, one can surely read this book.
0385504209|3.0|I found that this book was not as good and thrilling as Angels &amp; Demons. I also felt that some of the &quot;truth&quot; sound a bit stretched. It was not as good as the hype. I hope his next novel will be much better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Granted, Bill Murray can generally make me laugh with just his facial expressions. However, this movie was still looking for a plot when they ran the credits.  I have no clue as to how this movie got the nominations and awards it did. I have a friend who LEFT THE THEATER half way through.  Glad I didn't pay a cent to see it; a friend rented it then loaned it to me.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Alright, well this is a great cd for those of you who are true Weezer fans. In my case, both cds were a great buy because my old blue album has gotten scratched to the point of not working. I'm sure it has happened to some of you, too. Anyhow, the second cd is great and full of songs you'd wish they had put into a cd earlier. However some of you, people who probably liked the green album a lot, may complain it's not their 'good stuff'. Well, like I said above, this collection is for true Weezer fans; the fans that liked what Cuomo did in the beginning and wished that he did more of it.
0446530891|3.0|I liked the book.  I liked Mr. Baldacci's previous efforts better.  Let's face it success in some ways is a curse.  For a writer, there suddenly is the pressure of creating the next best seller.  Granted it is the type of problem we would all like to face, but never the less, Mr. Baldacci would like to spend some of that money he has made and frankly it is hard to blame him.  So he cuts a few corners and rushes a book to market to make his editors and public happy.  This is not a unique story and certainly not the first time it has occured.<br />Give him a break, the book is still better than most things on the market, a great plot, believable characters, an element of sexual tension that move things along to a conclussion that is a bit tough to believe, but works.  I must say that I didn't even pick up on the dialogue problems, that many reviewers complained about.  Perhaps I was just enjoying a pleasurable read!
B00005JMSE|5.0|I just got back from the midnight showing of Hellboy and (not going into great detail) it was sure great. It had great acting, action, and it was hilarious! This is a great movie and very funny. Buy the comics, watch the movie...or vice versa.
0452282152|4.0|Ms. Chevalier has done it again taking a historic work of art and creating a believable story to how this painting came about.<br />Ms. Chevalier has a very lyrical way of writing that is not only vividly descriptive, but also draws you into 17th century Delft.  I managed to read this book in one sitting since the story of Griet and her sensual awakening which is triggered by her going to work as a maid for an artist and his family was totally captivating.<br />For a fast read that is truly a work of art in it's own write you can't go wrong with anything written by Ms. Chevalier!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolution is Muse's best album, narrowly edging out Origin of Symmetry. The songs have all got kind of a prog rock sensibilty, but never get to bogged down in being pretentious. When this album hits the hights of its achievment (Sing for Absolution, Endlessly, Stockholm Syndrome for example) it really hits, and Muse take you off into another (usually sadder, or angrier) world. There is seriously transendance happening here folks, somthing that very few bands can achieve.<BR>There is a real range of music styles on this album as well, Time is Running Out and Thoughts of a Dying Atheist are pretty much radio genius, Stockholm Syndrome is almost pure rock fury, and Endlessly ventures into distinctly 'euro-pop' territory. Butterflies and Hurricanes is the most unabashedly prog peice on the album - it breaks into a classical piano peice in the middle! Falling Away from You and Blackout are also very good songs, but they suffer somewhat becuase they are wedged between really incredible songs. <BR>Muse offer some of the best and most dynamic songwriting in music today, and it's foolish not to pick up this CD when it is so incredibly cheap. (Consider that I paid $25 to import it from the UK!) Try this CD out and you will not be dissapointed.<br />That, said...Let's clear something up:<BR>Muse do not sound like Radiohead. While Matt Bellamy and Thom Yorke do have similar vocal ranges, they are used for completly different purposes. Even in the Bends era, Yorke sings with a kind of restrained unconfidence, and even when he gets down to 'rockin' there is a feeling of hesitation - check Creep or 2+2=5 if you want some evidence. <BR>With Muse, there is never hesitation. Muse are a band that are truly sure of their abilites, and they attack each song with an abandon and confidence that spills over into their music.  When Muse play, a certain kind of powerchord abandon is felt, something that Radiohead do not (and do not want to) pull off.  Simply put, Muse rock out. Radiohead never forgets to be measured, intelligently removed and restrained. <BR>Bellamy's vocals channel Freddie Mercury, or in slower songs, David Sylvian, far more often than they will remind one of Yorke's. The Radiohead comparisons are really a measure of degree - the degree being if you think that because both of them have high voices, they must sound alike. <BR>This argument doesn't even cover the actual music, which is painfully different, and readily apparent to the ear. Why? Muse are not Radiohead diciples - they listened to Nirvana, and Pearl Jam, and this early American influence, along with classic rock bands like Queen shows through. ex: Radiohead = little guitar, more bipping and booping. Muse = powerchords and classical styled piano peices.
0553582445|5.0|Hobb really knows how to hit my sweet spot for escapist fantasy. I've been consistently impressed with her Six Duchies novels and I find myself seeking her books out more aggressively than other writers. I meant to take my time over this one, but I read it compulsively-- staying awake long past the point where I should have in order to finish it.<br />I *roundly* dislike emotional manipulation in novels, but I'm happy to let my tears be jerked by these books. They play *shamelessly* on poor liddle animal sentiment and somehow it doesn't bother me. They're interesting, mysterious, sad, and compelling-- nearly perfect escapist fantasy.<br />This new series begins with FitzChivalry being forced to take a renewed role in the affairs of the Six Duchies. Not only is there a new threat, there's also the need to face up to his responsibilities and begin to heal from his self-imposed isolation.<br />Great stuff!
B0000542D2|5.0|As important as it is to rebut the spiceworld comment, it's more important to realize that it was probably a joke. A Hard Day's Night contains actual, funny jokes. And great music. It's a great film.
0066620996|4.0|This was my first foray into the world of Jim Collins and his insightful look at trends in the marketplace.  It was a great first read!  Collins lets the data speak for itself and finds that leadership matters, and innovation is essential.  I grew up thinking CEO's needed to be bombastic and celebrities in order to be successful.  Little did I know that the most successful CEO's were keeping a low profile and returning the most money to their stockholders.<br />In an era of corporate failure - this book points out what did work in the last twenty years.  The data and conclusions that Collins draws about Level 5 leaders is excellent.  This is a very solid work and is entertaining as well.<br />Joseph Dworak
B000002U9K|5.0|EVERY song on this album is a classic-it easily transcends<BR>the murky pot of mid-80's dance-pop.The boy's lyrics are interesting and mildly humorous,the hits have a hooky forboding<BR>to them and &quot;West End Girls&quot; is a flat-out pop CLASSIC!!In the<BR>meantime they changed pace on the solo piano ballad &quot;Later Tonight&quot; and the droning &quot;Violence&quot;.Has withstood the tragic<BR>1980's music backlash with alot of grace and will ALWAYS be in<BR>my list of Top 10 best albums and you'll find it to your liking<BR>as well!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Reading others' comments I realize how little most writers (reviewers) understand either Clapton or Robert Johnson. This album achieves something rare - humble, modest music. Compare it to whatever you want to, it is authentic, heart felt and genuine. Clapton isn't playing flashy guitar here: he is playing his most soulful in many years. This is about Robert Johnson and not about record charts or radio stations. Clapton had only one goal here and that was to be true to the music. You get it or you don't Get it, listen, and it will come to you. Few, if any, releases this year will match this for its integrity, sincerity and sheer truth.
B0000025H0|4.0|This album is pretty hard rocking by Santana standards and<BR>what isn't it produced in an equally dence,weighty manner.Mostl<BR>a showcase for Carlos's patented riff-o-rama's the pleasant R&amp;B<BR>of &quot;Stay Beside Me&quot; is the closest thing the album has to pop,<BR>even though it's equally as likely to punch you out as the rest is.An aquired but rewarding taste.
B000001EL3|4.0|As if you didn't already know, this is probably Kiss' most famous studio album......and for a good reason.  Though not my personal favorite Kiss album, this is very good and it made me wish they would have continued with this direction.  It doesn't really deviate much from the pure rock and roll of the previous albums, it just ups the theatrical aspect.  And this is due in no small part to Bob Ezrin, who was on board for this one.  For a band as theatrical as Kiss, what better producer than the guy who made Alice Cooper-the king of rock theatrics-a household name?  Though Kiss would probably never admit it, they owe their entire existence to Alice.  So, with Bob producing, you get one of the coolest rock albums of the 70s.  Yeah, it's got it's trademark sleaze songs, but Kiss tackles new subject matter here which is cool.  Sure it's corny as well, but this is Kiss here!  I'd certainly recommend this as a starter album if you don't have any Kiss.  It's basically Kiss' Dark Side Of The Moon, and will probably be given out with birth certificates in the upcoming years.
B00005J9M0|5.0|In the golden age of the #12 inch single the Pet Shop Boys deliver an album consisting of six house/disco grooves-always excellent,often extatic!&quot;Left To My Own Devices&quot; and &quot;Domino Dancing&quot; manage to be great extended mixes AND great tunes while<BR>&quot;I Want A Dog&quot; pulses and gooses along nicely.The Pet Shop Boys<BR>continue to give dance music a good name with their classy writing,witty lyricism and clever arrangments so even the mechanical nature of the synthesized music sounds pretty cool.<BR>Highly recommended!
B00005JLF5|4.0|This is the only season of this show I have seen. It was quite good and I am planning to purchase additional season-in fact I almost gave it five stars. The season premiere was really excellent, easily shouldering the burden of introducing us to  the characters and environment without losing focus on its own story.<BR><br />The rest of the season was generally good, with a few standout episodes and no particular bloopers. My biggest complaint was that the closest thing to a season theme (tension between the Bajorans and Starfleet) never got the consistant attention it needed. Also the final episode of this brief package (only 19 episodes), although quite good as a stand-alone episode, was completely unable to balance out the overall experience and left everything feeling truncated.<BR><br />That said, the episodes were engaging and occasionally thought-provoking. Although DS9 lacks the commanding presence of Patrick Stewart and is thus more of an ensemble piece than TNG, the characters were interesting and worked well together. Recommended!
0871137380|5.0|The story of Black Hawk Down is mainly about modern war. The story took place in Somalia, Mogadishu. The author of this book is Mark Bowden.  The Rangers mission was to extract the target building and capture the two Somali warlords. The mission was supposed to last an hour, but something tragic happened. Two enemy RPG's hit the Black Hawk Super Six Four helicopter. After the battle 18 American soldiers died and 70 more were wounded. The bloody battle took place in October 1993.<br />I liked this novel because it is interesting. I also like this novel because it made me sad for those soldiers who died in that battle. This novel made me feel a lot of emotions like sadness because of the corps of the died American soldiers being dragged on the streets of Mogadishu. This novel is very entertaining. This novel has full of action, which is why I spend an hour and fifteen minutes every night reading it.<br />Another thing that I liked about this novel that it changed the way I look at modern wars and battles. It made me respect people who fight for our country. This novel tells the story of the soldier in that battle like Matt Eversman and Mike Durant. This novel also showed the point of views of the American soldiers and the Somali soldiers. This novel is very enjoyable and interesting I would be happy to recommend this novel for those people who like to read war stories
B00000F7DF|5.0|I recently found a used copy of the 15th Anniversary VHS of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.  I must say that I absolutely love it.  The prologue and music video are very interesting and entertaining.  As for the film itself, well, it's a classic.  No video collection can be without this film.  The 25th Anniversary two-disc DVD is, without a doubt, the best DVD I have ever seen.  The quality of it and the features on it are amazing.  &quot;Don't dream it, be it.&quot;
B000002LRX|5.0|Faith No More's 4th (I belive it was the 4th.) album, while I heard it did not sell as much as their previous album &quot;The Real Thing&quot; I must say if you like good music purchase this CD, for it has a great price, and can keep you listening over and over.<br />The CD opens with &quot;The Land of Sunshine&quot; an interesting track, the vocalist not only can do various voices and  an insane laughter, this song is a rather nice song that just encourages toe tapping. Caffine is a preety good song, but does not top the next track &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; which contains the chorus &quot;You'r perfect, yes its true, but without me, your only you.&quot; which is a great qoute from a great song. RV is by far a very interesting track, in fact the song is more of a joke, its a light piano tune, with the first person narative of a middle agged trailer park trash. Smaller and Smaller is a good song too, a bit more heavy (If my memory serves me right, I have not listened to this album in ONE whole day.) then the others, Everythings ruined is also a good song, same with Malpractice, but the mellow but pleasent Kindergarden over shadows the last three,  but I will not kid you, I love the song Be Agressive, because the chorus actually features a group of cheer leaders, well cheer leading. A small Victory is another nice pleasent song, the last three were all good to, but not as good as some of the others.<br />In my opinions the songs that you will keep skipping back and forth too are: Land of Sunshine, Midlfie Crisis, RV, Kindergarden, Be agressive, and Small Victory.<BR>How ever the other songs are good also. Overall I strongly suguest this to all.
B00004W52U|5.0|I'm not a &quot;punk&quot;, and guess that my life is actuially made up of some of the things Operation Ivy rails against most fervently, but I wanted to testify on behalf of this album, which is one of the best, most vital, and inspiring records I own.  I listen to it probably two or three times a day at work while poring over financial data, after work at the gym, and at home on headphones.  <br />The music itself is much more sophisticated than most of the stuff that passes for punk, but what really blows me away are the lyrics, which are poetic and insightful--especially mind-blowing considering the band members, and Jesse Michaels, were like nineteen years old when they wrote the album--and tackle real life issues and choices at street level, such as the phoniness of the 9 to 5, the phoniness of a macho, &quot;tough guy&quot; attitude, the inhumanity of violence and insensitivity,  the crassness of overconsumption, and the need to break through destructive, self-imposed, conformist patterns in your life.  <BR>All of this, plus an obvious joy and reverence for music-making and music-listening as paths to freedom, and identifiable, skeptical, well-formed politics.  And sung in such a way that it's all intelligible, so you don't have to read the lyrics to know what the songs are driving at.<br />To me, it's one of few, rare albums that mix politics, catchiness, and the positivity that people need to feed off of to change their lives, live ethically, honestly, and thoughtfully.  Not a lot of other bands/groups spring to mind when I say that: the Clash, Blackalicious, Anti-Flag, Bright Eyes, Minor Threat, Neil Young, Nas (Illmatic) a few others.  Anyway...<br />Have also heard a few Common Rider songs on some the Plea for Peace compilations, and am anxious to check them out more in-depth.  Now's the time, at least in my life, that I want conscience, consciousness, and positivity in the music I pump into my head twelve hours a day, and Operation Ivy delivers all of that and more.
B0000025P9|5.0|Toto's fourth album in 1982 that saw both commercial and artistic success is my third favorite Toto album following The Seventh One, Tambu. Toto in previous albums tried to show themselves as progressive hard rockers just like Kansas, Styx, Boston, and Journey. Hydra in 1979 in particular is such a stuff. In Toto IV, jazz element has given more space than the predecessors. Their modification was paid off, putting Porcaros' outstanding rhythm section maximum use. ROSANNA and AFRICA are such jazzy gems that endowed them with crossover appeal. It must be noted, however, they actually didn't give up on melodic hard rock sound as seen in latter part of the album such as AFRAID OF LOVE and LOVERS IN THE NIGHT.<br />To sum up, they jazzed up their sound while retaining melodic pop appeal rivalling Foreigner, Kansas, Styx and Journey. To Toto fans surprise, however, commercial success cost the band the key members such as Bobby Kimballs and David Hungate. The band could go on with the new lead singer that was credited as the background vocalist of their 1982 Grammy condender album \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\" by Survivor. Yeah, that's Fergie Frederiksen, high-toned vocalist of Trillion and Le Roux.<br />Recommended for wide variety of pop music fans.
B00009RAJH|5.0|Released in 1975, Fleetwood Mac's self titled album was a complete change for the british blues rock group. With the addition of singer/songwriters Lindsey Buckingham and his girlfriend Stevie Nicks, Fleetwood Mac had their most successful album in years. No longer a blues rock group, they were now pop rock and the album &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; spawned three major hits in &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Over My Haed&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;. The album as a whole featured some excellent well written songs such as &quot;Monday Morning&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;, &quot;Blue Letter&quot;, &quot;World Turning&quot; and the above mentioned hits. Also, included on this newly remastered cd are five bonus tracks &quot;Jam #2&quot; (a five and a half minute instrumental which features Christine McVie's keyboards and Lindsey Buckingham's guitars), &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; (Single Version) (This version is harder rocking than it's album version), &quot;Rhiannon&quot; (Single Version), &quot;Over My Head&quot; (Single Version), and &quot;Blue Letter&quot; (Single Version). The sound quality is excellent due to remastering and far surpasses the older version. If you enjoy listening to seventy's rock then you'll love this cd.
6305878323|5.0|A film by Robert Stevenson<br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" is one of the most beloved movies of all time, and for good reason.  This truly is a magical film.  It is a mixture of live action and animation and is a wonderful musical and is quite possibly the perfect family film.  Nominated for 13 Academy Awards and it was the winner of 5, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews in her feature film debut.<br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" is the story of, well, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).  Mary Poppins is the new nanny for Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Matthew (Michael Garber) Banks.  As a nanny, Mary Poppins is \\"practically perfect\\".  She floats down from the sky holding on to an umbrella and convinces George Banks (David Tomlinson) to give her the job as the nanny.  George is flustered by Mary and of course he gives her the job.  The lives and experiences of the children are about to change because there is something magical about Mary.  With a song and a dance amazing things happen around Mary.  She can clean up a room with nothing more than a snap of the fingers and can take a journey into a picture drawn with chalk on a sidewalk.<br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" perfectly mixes animation (the penguin waiters!) and live action to create a magical world that is an incredible change from the London that Jane and Matthew think they know.  There are excellent acting performances and the over the top Dick Van Dyke is charming in how sweet he is.  The whole movie is sweet, charming, funny, and fantastic.  This is a highly recommended musical for the whole family
B00008PX8P|5.0|Being a total Zephead since the 9th grade (mid 80s), this DVD is what I've been waiting for all these years. A perfect compliment to The Song Remains the Same, we finally get to SEE Zep before and after '73 in all their rock-n-roll glory. I admit to being slightly partial to the 1st DVD which features an entire performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970. Before the excesses of superstardom set-in, the young band has a certain magical aura about them as their music touches on the avant-garde. Some of the highlights for me are Dazed-n-Confused, White Summer, and Moby Dick. This DVD alone is worth the price of the set but, nevertheless, I'm very glad there is a 2nd DVD chronicling the later years. Between the accoustic set at Earls Court '75 and Achillies Last Stand at Knebworth '79, there are a lot of great performances that are not to be missed. Actually, I could have done without the synced version of the Immigrant Song (should have been an extra) and The Song Remains the Same stuff in favor of some footage from '77 which is missing altogether. Regardless, this DVD set is a must have for all fans of rock-n-roll. Thank you Page, Plant, and Jones for releasing this musical treasure; and as we wind on down the road, I can only hope there is more footage to come.
1869504917|3.0|This excellent and indispensable guide is thoroughly researched, richly illustrated with photographs, and well written. But while it is an essential book for anyone planning a visit to Middle Earth, it is handicapped by one glaring omission: though several maps are provided, none adequately indicate the locations of Middle Earth's features. This is frustrating for anyone who wishes to use the book as a travel guide (though it is always possible to sort out locations by using the text and the limited maps provided) and a serious drawback for the armchair traveler who just wants to get a sense of how Middle Earth maps onto New Zealand.<br />Be sure to get the &quot;Revised Edition&quot;.

B00003OSTV|5.0|One of the greatest epic movies ever made, Quo Vardis? tells the thrilling story of the formative years of christianity in ancient Rome. Quo Vardis? is an excellent and down right entertaining film.<br />The now late Peter Ustinov put's in a superb performance as a manic emperor Nero that has to be seen to be believed! Robert Taylor makes a dashing, if thuggish, Roman who falls under the charms of virtuous Deborah Kerr, (who wouldn't!!). <br />A beautifully told tale based on fact. This is a film that deserves to be on dvd.
0385510438|5.0|Grisham is back and in top form.  I really enjoyed this book--its a quick, interesting read.  Like most Grisham novels, The Last Juror is set in the south.  But unlink most other Grisham novels, this isn't in the viewpoint of a lawyer, judge or client--despite the title.  The view from the editor/jouralist looking at a grisley rape/murder over many years is unique.<br />The one criticism I have is some of the plot twists (away from the rape/murder case which is the focus of the book) you could see a mile a way.  Grisham is at his best when dealing with crime and the law.  Not so much with everyday human life and relationships.
0385504209|1.0|The book centers around this secret society of Sion which is supposedly tasked with keeping a secret of great power, a secret which has given power, wealth, and success to those who possess it.  The story falls apart once the secret is revealed.<br />The author makes no attempt to show how the secret actually resulted in power, wealth, or success, nor can one reasonably postulate how it could, if your goal is to keep the information secret. What would anyone in such a secret society have to gain by keeping such information secret, if it did not really lead to wealth or power?  The story would have at least made sense and would have been far more interesting if the secret were how to greatly prolong life, or how to generate wealth, or something that would reasonably explain the connection of wealth and power  with possessing the secret, and why someone would want to maintain the secret.  The reason for the society possessing so much power is totally absent.  The author also fails to support why someone would be motivated to murder to possess the secret.
0345440900|1.0|This isn't a great book. Perhaps some of the techniques will help a few mothers whose children are receptive to them but they didn't work at our house. This was the first and last childcare book I've purchased. I did learn something important by reading it: I know what's best for my baby and I don't need books and overrated authors telling me otherwise. My son is now 16-months old and I think we've done well without the help of child &quot;experts.&quot; My mom, the pediatrician and my instincts are the best resources I have and the only ones I need.
0765348780|5.0|Steven Erikson's Malazan series is the series that I've been looking for for the past ten years. Having read and re-read Tolkien (and his high-fantasy clones), I was ready to give up on the genre that seemed to be going nowhere. Why did everything have to revolve around Tolkien's early twentieth century themes? We live in a current political climate where governments practice fear campaigns designed to demonstrate the ability to protect the frightened individual against an unseen enemy. Religious and ethical issues are endlessly debated. Countries go to war to make money. 'Man' is only concerned with himself and is encouraged to get ahead of his neighbour in any way possible. This is a world away from the early twentieth century. Finally, a novelist has embraced the themes of our current world and placed them into a fantasy context. Erikson questions the morality of war and occupation, the essence of being individual, and the use and abuse of power.  <br /> <br />The series is set on at least three continents: Genabackis (the setting for the first book \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" and the third \\"Memories of Ice\\"); Seven Cities (the setting for second book \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" and the fourth \\"House of Chains\\") and, Quon Tali; the capital of the Malazan people. \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" mainly follows the story of a famous squad of soldiers in the Malazan army called the Bridgeburners who would become outlawed by their empress after leading the campaign on Genabackis. <br /> <br />Why has \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" received some poor reviews?  <br /> <br />1) Erikson's world is very complex - the most complex I've read. I much prefer this type of series over a superficial one that I would just skim through (unfortunately the bulk of fantasy). With the substantial appendix and maps, names can be followed without too much trouble. I love this level of complexity as it allows the reader to discover much more with subsequent readings. Don't even attempt to read this series if you are not prepared to fully immerse yourself. This is not a novel which you can just pick up off the shelf for some light reading (like Jordan or Fiest); it requires your full attention. <br /> <br />2) I was initially taken aback by no central character or group of characters. Erikson's world consists of many gods, ascendants, races and peoples of various classes; some seeking solitude, some power, some following orders, some rebelling, some seeking answers. Erikson does not focus on heroes, kings or courtiers as main characters, but demonstrates the abilities of the individuals and factions underneath the nobility - the real players: soldiers, assassins, mages, warlords, spies. The Malazan series does not follow one or two key characters, more like 20 key characters with intertwining destinies, each with a distinct personality (very impressive), along with a cast of hundreds. I was also suprised to find only four characters from 'Gardens of the Moon' in the sequel \\"Deadhouse Gates\\" which serves to highlight the scope of this series as all events on all continents are important.  <br /> <br />3) Military fantasy. Yes, the series essentially covers the campaign of the Malazans, but it is an insult to suggest this series is just a military fantasy. The subsequent novels highlight this. <br /> <br />4) Characterisation. The level of characterisation in this series is second to none in fantasy. I found the most intriguing aspect of \\"Gardens...\\" was the ambiguity of the characters. Never had I read a Fantasy novel which blurred the lines between good and evil so well - the characters are not your typical good guy battling the typical bad guy. Erikson writes from all persectives: the invading army soldiers who are ordered to complete their missions without question. For example, the officers in the invading force not neccessarily agreeing with the job they had to do, but completing it nonetheless. We read the perspectives of various political factions in the targeted land; both forand against the conquest, and also the persectives of civilians caught up in the struggle to save their city. What makes this book interesting is that I can now really envision war through similar perspectives. Reading this the second time, I was able to detect differences in the language patterns of individuals (especially the nobility versus the lower classes, and the separate races) which serves to highlight the length Erikson has gone to to create individual characters. The character of Kruppe is a marvel that not many writers would even attempt to write. See also Iskaral Pust in \\"Deadhouse Gates\\". Despite the large cast, I feel I know each of the characters in this series. Erikson has triumphed.  <br /> <br />Erikson is a clever writer. His handling of characters is second to none in fantasy. His themes are contemporary and his worlds are vast. The aspect of his writing that impresses me most is his ability to reach a climax that builds and builds for the last few hundred pages.  <br /> <br />I had been told a number of times that if I like George RR Martin, then I would also enjoy Steven Erikson as their style and subject matter are similar. This is true. They both have an excellent technical grasp of the English language; not poetic, like Kay or Wolfe, but like Donaldson, they always seem to write the correct word when needed every time. Having said this, they have their differences. <br /> <br />You must read this series if you are a fan of serious fantasy. Don't make up your mind after having just read it once. It is initially difficult to follow but once you understand the world and its rules you will be rewarded. It demands muiltiple readings. Not only is the world complex, but the characters are brilliant and the stories first rate. Steven Erikson, along with George R R Martin and R Scott Bakker, are the future of fantasy.

I absolutely refused to own a Britney CD, but I broke under the pressure of my foot ALWAYS tapping to Toxic when it played on the radio.  I talked a good friend into making the buy for me, so I could save face.

0446677450|5.0|While Robert wrote a book previous to Rich Dad, Poor Dad; this is the one that most people have seen or heard about. It was the start of the purple, black and gold books seen at numerous bookstores around the world. I had a friend in Japan get very excited because she played CASHFLOW 101 and finally GOT IT. This book was an epiphany to me. I was at work one day and this guy came in and he said I should read this book.  So I put it off for a month and then got around to borrowing a coopy. As soon as I had finished, I understood whyI was getting nowhere with my finances. Now, I know many people say this book is not coherant and does not make any sense, but to me and many of my friends it did and still does. It started me down a path toward financial independence. Although I have reached it yet, the way is clear and I can see my destination. Mahalo Robert. And Aloha!
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Finally, some of the greatest movies ever are collected in one huge set, getting the special DVD treatment that they deserve.  2 Discs per movie, with a final special features disc, making up 9 discs in all...what more could you ask for?<br />Alien gets a great treatment, remastered and extended with some of the scenes originally left on the cutting room floor.  Its the same edition that was played on the big screen in November of 2003.  It kind of slows down the movie just a bit, but its nice to see some more of the plot elements and extra shots of the alien that were left out.  The original movie is also included, and looks great.  The commentary sheds alot of insight into the film and the extras are well worth it.  This is one of the best special treatments in the set.<br />Aliens is still awesome.  The Special Edition, which has been out for many years, looks better than ever.  Also included is the original theatrical version, though I much prefer the extended edition now.  The commentary and extras are all well worth it, and Aliens still stands out as the best movie in the series, though the debate still rages between Alien and Aliens.<br />Of all the movies however, I found Alien 3 to be the most intriguing in the set.  After so many years of hearing about it, the 'Workprint Edition' is FINALLY shown.  Adding an extra half hour to the film, Alien 3 takes on a whole new face.  Bloodier, darker, and with completely new plot elements, Workprint edition was definitely an interesting spin on the Alien 3 plot.  The death of Hicks is shown in more unnecessarily gruesome detail(to this day I don't know why they opted to murder him so horribly).  The birth of the alien and prisoner Golic's obsession with it are two of the most notable differences.  There is ALOT of things that they could have left in, but at the same time, I see why they cut alot of it out.  The workprint edition was restored to the best of their ability, but some sound is muffled.  They provided sub-titles for the scenes were the audio is too low to hear, or is being drowned out by background sound.  I would've liked to have seen more of the alien shots that were included in the workprint edition, but the original movie is ok the way it is.  Not all of the workprint material was included either...some brief shots were still cut out.  Overall, this was the most interesting aspect of the set.<br />Alien: Resurrection is still utter garbage...it's just another 8 minutes of utter garbage, complete with the director rather arrogantly explaining how he thought his movie was a masterpiece and he didn't feel the need to add the deleted footage.  Depiste this, Resurrection is still one of the worst movies ever conceived, and definitely the movie that ruined this series.  I watched it once, and never had a desire to pop it in again.<br />The discs were all in pristine working condition and nicely decorate.  The extras disc is ok...its mostly promotional material from all the films.  Most of the best stuff is one the individual movie discs themselves.  <br />There is one thing wrong with this set...and as many people pointed out, it is the unbeleivably ridiculous packaging.  You practically need a dining room table to stretch out the entire box and pick which movie you want.  I don't know who the genious was who came up with the packaging, but he/she needs to be smacked about 2 dozen times.  Some of the movies could have had a bit more extras, and maybe cleared up just a bit more, but otherwise everything else is fine.  As for the other criticism I see about this set...the word 'Quadrilogy' not being a real world...who really cares?  I think its more ridiculous to complain about that...you're buying the set for the movies, you aren't buying it to grade it on grammar or turn it in for your doctorate thesis. <br />Overall, if you're an Alien fan, then you must own this set.  However, I recommend buying each DVD individually and save yourself the trouble of dealing with the ridiculous packaging on this box set.  Each 2 disc movie and the special materials disc can all be bought seperately, so you won't be missing anything. Regardless, get this set!  Alien fans won't regret it!
B0001AP158|5.0|This DVD and CD are totally &quot;off the chain&quot;! If you are a true Bon Jovi Fan and have been with them from the beginning, or just getting introduced, then this a an excellant choice. The way they have totally remade these chart busting songs that were absolutley awesome first off and then reinvented them all over from the start is just unbelieveable! <BR>The music is sooo good and Jon has never sounded better!! While listening to this, one can close their eyes and just imagine Jon, crooning over you as you and him dance the night away. (that is if your a girl)A definite keeper!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Imagine the quirky premise: It's 1986 and a young man starts having disturbing visions of a six foot bunny rabbit who tells him that the world will end in 28 days, on Halloween. That is just the beginning. This darkly comic and touching independent gem was worthy of nominations for director, screenplay, and actor.<br />I don't understand why some Amazon reviewers did not love it. This movie is rich with details that you miss upon first viewing it. It is a refreshing change from the typical box office no-brainer movies that are always replete with explosions, car chases, and predictable plots.<br />For sheer originality and quirkiness, Donnie Darko is highly recommended.
B000002I2G|4.0|Oh wait, this isn't Chicago.  Oh well, there are some smellers on this one.  But I throw in a big (and I mean big) but.  The title track, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; is sheer genious!  &quot;Easy Ride&quot; and &quot;Wild Child&quot; are also great.  The rest of the album would have been the best material that Chicago has ever released.  :-)

0780626966|5.0|Not only is the Nightmare on Elm Street movies great, but the DVD collection is 100% better!  Why?  Because you have better sound, picture, and access to the movies that we all crave to see again and again.  These are easily on of the best horror movies ever created.  Freddy Krueger was, and still is, very dark and evil.  Whenever you finish a movie, you want more.  These movies achieve something that other movies cannot always get.  These have, &quot;The perfect ending&quot;.<br />I still watch these movies over and over, and I still want more.  I enjoy these because it's a blend of mystery, horror, and all kinds of good things!  It is a very enjoyable set of movies.<br />The only bad movie in this collection is A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, which has always been rated as the worst of the group.  But, if you enjoy horror, then you will enjoy The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection.
B00005A1PR|4.0|This is one of the best debut albums I have in my collection.  India had the disadvantage of debuting along with Alicia Keys who had a phenomenal advertising campaign which saw her appearing on all major shows prior to her album release date while India debuted with much less fanfare. However, rightfully she received 7 grammy nominations and devastatingly did not receive one - she was robbed blind in my opinion.  As much as I love &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is a superior album as a whole and should've won at least 2 grammies (one for r&amp;b song, and one for album of the year).<br />India has a deep contralto voice that I find fit beautifully with the songs on this album. If you enjoy neo-soul music, this would be an excellent album to add to your collection.<br />The standout songs are:<br />Video - a strong anthem with a catchy hook<br />Brown Skin - a beautiful song that celebrates &quot;brown skin&quot;<br />Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom - uptempo catchy song<br />Ready for Love - beautiful ballad<br />Simple - catchy, upbeat love song
B00007L4MJ|3.0|It's really unfortunate that this film is so well known, because director Fritz Lang made better movies than this - and he knew it. (He thought this movie was stupid.) The special effects are fabulous, and really weren't surpassed until the digital age. It helps that this restoration makes it all look fresh and new. But the story is total crap. It's sad because anyone coming to this film new won't be inclined to check out other, far better Lang films: like his first sound film M, with Peter Lorre, or his silent films Spies, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, or Der Nibelungen.
B00008EY9G|3.0|'Identity' is a competent and hard thrilling suspense movie which has two great points when compared with the other films of the same kind, especially the more recent ones: originality and a good (although not original) finale. Director James Mangold know his office and give to us a solid suspense which, sometimes (especially the scenario, an old and decayed motel) resembles the classic 'Psycho' of the master Alfred Hithcock. The solution of the mystery - that I'll not tell here - was used in some other movies, as you will find afterwards. Good performances all around, with a special consideration to Pruitt Taylor Vince, as the accused serial killer and John Hawkes, as the nervous motel manager.
0553382179|5.0|This is great book for people who are clueless about cleaning or would rather pay someone else to do it. I am kindof both, but after someone that I paid to clean my house decided to do my laundry and ruined one of my husband's suit jackets, I decided I needed to be the one cleaning. At least that way I would feel less guilty if I ruined something in the wash. Marla wrote an excellent book on how to go from clueless to clean in just a month. But this book goes beyond cleaning. It also helps you learn to declutter and focus on what is important in your life. And I have learned that there are truely other women out there who suffer from CHAOS(Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome). I have been thinking for five years I was the only one in the world with this problem. Thank you for releasing me from all that guilt. I am a happier, cleaner, more organized mother. Plus check out her great website at flylady.net while you wait for the book to get to you. It is great!
B0000AQS0F|3.0|When this series aired, it showed instant promise.<BR>Based on the premise that outlaying planets would have a rudimentary technology while those that plied the paths between them would necessarily need something more advanced the show blends the old frontier with the last frontier.<BR>The cast was interesting and diverse.  The interrelationships had the promise of developing fully.  The writing was ecclectic and shied away from the formulaic preachy writing that too often characterizes (imperils?) popular science fiction.  (Science Fiction serves best as a way of getting people to think in new ways, rather than as a propagandistic tool for the right or left.)  It also shied away from the blaster-blazing non-stop string of explosions that undermines most low-budget sci-fi.<BR>It should have been a bullseye or at least in the first ring.<BR>And it wasnt.<BR>The writers couldn't seem to keep themselves from interrupting the plot lines to snipe at religion by characterizing it as something to make others feel bad, hate crazed witch burners, and hypocritical phonies.  If the show had been about the struggle against a religious oligarchy this would have been fitting and appropriate.  As it was, it interrupted what might have been good writing with propagandistic sophomoric interpretations.  The prejudices of the writers undermined the show with an irrelevancy.<BR>A show might survive if the networks are convinced of its appeal (even if it has none).  It might survive if the viewership ratings are high enough to overcome the network convictions.  But it won't survive when it goes counter to the grain of the network while alienating the viewers and by doing this the arrow hit two rings off center.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins and his team have done a tremendous service to business by publishing this book. Not simple a droning serious take on how to manage, this book shows that some times it really is hard work, consistent performance, and ethical behavior that leads to success. And surprisingly, it's not celebrity, or crankiness, or &quot;willingness to take risks&quot; (read that as: &quot;willingness to break the law&quot;) that wins the long term race for success. It seems jaded to say &quot;everything you've heard about business leadership is wrong&quot;, but Jim has the data to support that supposition. Every executive should read (and listen to the audio version of) this book... So should the people who work for them. If you've already suffered through the cartoonish &quot;Who moved my Cheese?&quot; or scary near-fascism of &quot;Execution: The Art of Getting Things Done&quot;, this book is a breath of fresh air! Well-worth it's best-selling ranking!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The first sci-fi trilogy to cater to hyper-teenage, geeks who have severe attention deficit disorder, The Matrix Trilogy goes out with a wimper instead of a bang, in this foolish and stupid-ass third and final (thank God) installment.<br />  The war between man and machine takes ahead as the machines reach the human underground base. Meanwhile, Neo is stuck between the real world and the Matrix itself, while Agent Smith walks through the Matrix taking over everything in his path and cloning it in his image (even the Oracle can't stop him). Its up to the human resistance and Neo to stop the machines and Agent Smith from destroying both worlds.<br />  O.K. people, enough is enough. \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" rips off, just like \\"Matrix Reloaded\\", other films. This time out its \\"Aliens\\" (the scene in which the remaining captains plan a suicide run to the dock is practically right from \\"Aliens\\" right down to the huge map and the \\"Lets move like we got a purpose, people.\\", line), \\"Robocop 2\\" (the loaders the humans use to defend themselves look similar to the machine of the same name), \\"Thelma and Louise\\" (the sunrise scene and the line \\"Its beautiful.\\" (I laughed so hard, I got some nasty stares from Matrix fans a.k.a. LOSERS!)), \\"Superman II\\" (the final fight between Neo and Smith is reminiscent to the duel between The Man of Steel and the three Kryptonian criminals), and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (the subplot of the young infantry man who has to reload the big loaders while in combat). The movie just seems to sag along. There were no characters that I really cared about. I get the whole metaphysical meaning and I just don't care, folks. The ending sucks with no clear winner at all between man and machine. The winner, I guess, is Warner Bros. who made quite a pretty huge chunk of change off this below average trilogy. You can be a winner too, by avoiding this piece of mind spam like a chafing case of V.D.

B000000OQF|5.0|Ive played this record so many times and it never gets old.I love Axl's voice and I love the rhythm and lead guitar solos just as much.To have any real effect though you have to play it pretty loud it just doesnt sound very good if you have the volume at 3 or 4 instead of 5.Welcome To The Jungle is a cool song a little overrated but still a classic and Its So Easy is classic axl.Nighrain is one of the best songs on the album although they are all great this one is in my top 5 or 6.Out Ta Get Me is perfect punk and the vocals are killer.Mr Brownstone is groovy but doesnt do much for me otherwise.Paradise City is one of the best songs of all time and My Michelle is awesome.Think About You is almost a ballad but not quite and Sweet Child O Mine is one of my favorite ballads next to November Rain and has a great guitar solo.Youre Crazy and Anything Goes Tonight are classic punk metal and Rocket Queen is my favorite song on the album.You should definitely buy this album its not as good as the Use Your Illusion set(which is a masterpiece) but it is still one of my favorites.Buy this now.
0385504209|2.0|My boyfriend reccomended this book to me and I expected to enjoy it.  But, being a third year art history major I was incapable of doing so.  I think that Dan Brown owes it to the world to note somewhere in his novel that the &quot;facts&quot; in his book are not facts at all.  The use of the name &quot;Da Vinci&quot; for Leonardo makes any medievalist cringe.  Nobody would have ever(and still almost never does)address him by this name cause all it does is indicate his location.  Even the &quot;Ninja Turtles&quot; cartoon got that one right.  Also, that could not have been Mary in the Last Supper.  That is definitely John who was often dressed in a feminine manner in paintings.  There is no such thing as a symbologist as far as I know and others have told me.  The rose window was not based on a rose.  The name rose comes from the Latin rota that refers to a wheel.  This is because Romanesque churches would sometimes depict this circular windows as a wheel of fortune.  I could go on and on.<br />  Anyway, I thought it was a fun read.  I could not stand the elementary writing style but the exciting story let me mostly ignore that.  But, it is apalling that Dan Brown does not tell his readers that this is not fact at all and really much of it is not even theory.  He should have noted in his novel that the &quot;facts&quot; are mostly creations of his mind.

My business partner and co-founder said that they nailed me!<br />I would strongly recommend this book to any manager or aspiring manager.
B00004U28G|4.0|Langue : ''FRANCAIS'' ???<BR>  Mme/Mrs Bonjour,<BR>    En regardant la fiche tech. de ces DVD je me suis rendu compte qu'ils ne sont pas disponible en version Française!!<BR>   J'ai d'excellents souvenirs d'enfance en visionant ces films,<BR> ( Canonball Run 1 &amp; 2 , Smockey &amp; the Bandit) mais le problème est que lorsque je les écoutaients, enfant ils passaient à la télé en français .<BR> <br />                  Pas tous bilingue :(
B0000A98ZP|4.0|This is  a great movie.Its still one of my favorites because throughout the whole movie there are a wide range of emotions.There are times when it is funny(like John,Andy,Claire and Brian smoking pot together),times when its sad(like when Andy reveals one of the darkest secrets anyone can have and confesses why he did it), times when its rebellious and angry(that would be the scene where John tells of what his home life is like), and times when its happy(like when Allison gets her gorgeous new makeover and John and Claire finally get along with each other).One of the saddest parts of the movie is when Claire reveals how they wont still be friends when they go back to school(Ive seen this movie about 15 times and that part still makes me cry). Judd Nelson is absolutely great as the rebellious John Bender who wears grungy clothes and is angry at the injustices his in  his life at home as well as school,Anthony Michael Hall is perfect for the role of the slightly nerdy good guy character , Molly Ringwald's best acting is in this movie though I believe some of the parts in this movie played by her are more than just acting(those are real tears she cries believe me),Ally Sheedy is beautiful both as the irresistible basket case character and as her evolution into the princess image that Claire has and Emilio Esteves is an excellent actor and plays his &quot;sporto&quot; character very convincingly.Even though I could relate to the movie more when I was in high school (especially to the criminal and basket case characters), I still like it a lot.Overall this is a great movie and is never stuck just in one place.I higly recommend it.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I've been a lifelong EC fan...it's because of him that I bought \\"King Of The Delta Blues Singers\\" way back when I was 13 years old and have been obsessed with Robert Johnson's music ever since.  The story of his life is fascinating and tragic.  If this CD causes just one listener unfamiliar with Johnson to get \\"The Complete Recordings\\" then it's worth every note played.  <br />Of course this loving tribute is wonderful.  And as far as the previous reviewer who posted, \\"Robert Johnson is good and all...\\"(???)  PLEASE!!  There's no sense in that.  EC would be the first to shake his head at such an outrageous statement that he \\"wiped the floor\\" with him!  It's not about comparing, it's about honoring a master.  There are LEGIONS of guitarists who will tell you without hesitation that there is NO WAY they could ever even approach Johnson's inimitable style.  Hell, most thought there were TWO guitarists on the original recordings when they first heard them!<br />Ranting aside, buy the album and feed your soul.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have been waiting for this for years.  Any self respecting movie fan knows these movies and how good they are. Our fan would know how much they have influence the movie industry and the fantasy/adventure genre in general.  This fan would also know the advantages to having them on DVD.<br />I won't go into the long description other reviews have.  Needless to say, you HAVE to own this as part of a complete DVD collection.  These films are timeless!  Without this triology, Lord of the Rings might not have been done.  Buy it, but wait around for a good deal.  You've waited so long already, a little longer won't kill you.  \\"May the force be with you.....\\"
B00005JMFI|5.0|I see a fair number of movies, but it is only rarely that I leave the theatre feeling I truly got my nine dollars' worth. The last six months have been exceptional for me in that there have been three films which have been more than worth my time and money. The first was \\"Lost in Translation\\"; the third was \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\"; and the one in the middle was none other than \\"Elf\\"!<br />Oh yes, I kid you not. I am usually not the biggest fan of Christmas movies, but \\"Elf\\" kept me smiling for two straight hours. This is no small achievement, especially during the holiday season. James Caan is perfectly cast as Will Ferrell's father, and I was really impressed with Ferrell himself. I always thought he was funny on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" but this really is classic stuff. There is no danger of him going the way of Rob Schneider or David Spade, \\"Old School\\" notwithstanding. Throw Bob Newhart into the mix and how can you lose?<br />Roger Ebert said it best: \\"I thought it would be clunky, stupid and obvious...foisting upon us a chaste romance involving the only girl in America who doesn't know that a man who thinks he is an elf is by definition a pervert.... It took me about 10 seconds of seeing Will Ferrell in the elf costume to realize how very wrong I was.... He convinced me that this was a good movie, and that's a miracle on 34th Street right there.\\"
B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid is getting a lot of heat about their new album that shows their lighter side. But lets go back a little, this album is raw, fast, and powerful. The old Rancid, this album reminds us why we love them.....This is Punk, not sell out music.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Not sure if anyone's mentioned this yet, but this is a double-sided, double-layer DVD. It shouldn't be compared to other &quot;flippers&quot; out there because it contains roughly twice the information.<br />In other words, this is the equivalent of a 2-disc edition like the LOTR Extended Editions. You can't fit a film that goes well over 3 hours into a single-sided DVD without seriously sacrificing quality.

0312995423|5.0|Codes, ciphers, Enigma, American Black Chamber.....If any of these words intrigue you then Digital Fortress by Dan Brown might just be a book for you. For many years I have been interested in all facets of intelligence, from David Kahn's book, The Codebreakers to James Bamford's, The Puzzle Palace. <br />These works described the processes from breaking codes and ciphers to how one of America's most secret organizations orchestrates the massive responsibility of gathering and interpreting all type and matter of intelligence. Dan Brown has done his research well in the creation of this novel. He has created characters that are very down to earth and very believable. <br />The story itself is centered around the NSA, National Security Agency, how it operates, what it does and what it would like to do. Susan Fletcher a very intelligent and beautiful intellectual who is the head of the Crypto Group and her boyfriend David Becker, a university professor with a proclivity for languages, get entangled in some very interesting and dangerous situations. The action comes very fast and is well written. Brown puts several twists into this tale of the intelligence world and how it totally revolves around high powered computers and unbreakable algorithms. <br />If you are a fan of techno fiction than you will find this a great and entertaining read. Beware ! The book is reminiscent of the movie &quot;The Sting&quot;. You'll know what I mean when you get there.<br />If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also:  I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over.  Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban, and always read the Amazon reviews.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I AM GLAD SHE IS BACK AND THIS ALBUM IS GREAT...NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE'S BEFORE BUT GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've always been one for historically-based nonfiction dramas, along with documentaries with a total hour running length that reached into the double digits.<br />In the early 1990's, I was completetly absorbed into Ken Burn's \\"Civil War\\" when it first aired on PBS.  A few years later, I purchased that series on VHS.  Last year, I was thrilled to see it being re-released on DVD and pre-ordered it.  I've been very pleased with the DVD set.<br />In many ways, \\"Band of Brothers\\" follows the same pattern as the \\"Civil War\\".  I was absorbed into \\"Band of Brothers\\" when it aired on HBO and anxiously awaited the DVD release.<br />I found \\"Band of Brothers\\" to be even more absorbing than the \\"Civil War\\" for several reasons.<br />First, I have always had an interest in WW2 -- especially the European theater.  My girlfriend keeps telling me that the \\"H\\" logo (continuously on the screen while tuned to the \\"History Channel\\") is going to be rasta burned into our televisions since I'm always watching it.  My obsession with the \\"History Channel\\", \\"A&E\\", and the other channels she refers to as the \\"Hitler Channels\\" have been the topic of many discussions between her and I.  :-)<br />Secondly, I served as an infantryman in the 82nd Airborne for four years during the early 1990's.  Now, of course, peacetime service can not be even remotetly compared to wartime service, however during this time I had the opportunity to meet the WW2 veterans of our unit during our annual brigade picnics.  The actions, endurances, and sacrifices of these men during WW2 are beyond description.<br />My favorite \\"Band of Brothers\\" episode?  No, it wouldn't be episode two (Normandy jump) but episode seven (Breakthrough).<BR>Episode seven seem to truely capture the heart, spirit, and will of these extraordinary soldiers.<br />It takes total perfection for me to warrant five stars.  I can only give Ken Burn's \\"Civil War\\" four stars as I felt that it didn't include enough of the western campaign.  This DVD set, however, truely is perfection.<br />If you enjoyed the episodes, you should read the book.  The book is even more absorbing.  Stephen Ambrose's writing style makes for very easy reading and he is an excellent story teller.  I consider him the \\"Shelby Foote\\" (Civil War novelist) for WW2.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I saw this film with high hopes, having loved all of Tarantino's earlier works.  I kept waiting and waiting for things to work... but they never did.  The film has absolutely NO tension (in fact because the movie is told in Tarantino style out of order, we know that Lucy Liu's character has already been killed previous to that segment's beginning).  The main character is herself an assassin who murders a Vivica Fox's character, and then threatens her young daughter over the body... which is to say that The Bride is shown as a complete moral vacuum, who has NO standing for judgement of others.  (...)
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I'll tell you the truth, I'm not normally a girl that likes the kind of rock music that Jet plays.  But once I heard &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; on the radio, I just fell in love.  I went out and bought the cd the day after I heard their first single.  I listen to it all the time now!  It just lifts your mood.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was born in 1977, the same year Star Wars first hit the theatres, while I was in the theatre when it was first released, I of course do not remember any of the movie.  The first time I actually remember seeing the movie was in 1982.  Since then I have been hooked.  As far as this DVD package is concerned, I probally will wait until Lucas releases a box set with all episodes 1 - 6.  There is really no need to rush and get this since this package does not contain the original movies that alot of us remember from the 80's (or even 70's for the older folks :-)). I don't think the original movies can be purchased anymore, and the only way I would purchase this set when it is released in September is if Lucas decided to put the original movies on the DVD as well as the \\"remastered\\" ones.  As it stands though, I will wait for all 6 to be released before I purchase.<br />With that out the way, I think it goes without saying that episodes IV - VI comprise the best trilogy ever to make it to the big screen.
B00000295A|1.0|Jamiroquai`s debut was a critically aclaimed record when it came out in the early nineties, yet I fail to understand why. This is hardly innovative and original stuff, just a rehash of some sounds from the seventies with a couple of more contemporany and recent production details. &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot; mixes funk, lounge, soul, pop and even a bit of jazz, trying to sound fresh, hip and subtle yet it ends up being unmemorable, slow and tiresome for the most part. The first songs are somewhat promising, but as the record unfolds it only gets boring and drags for way too long, becoming useless elevator music. Ok, so the environmental message &quot;love mother nature&quot; is mildly interesting, still that doesn`t make this effort any better.<br />Overall weak.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I was watching TV one day and saw an advertisement for the new edition of \\"Peter Pan\\". I thought it was really neat-looking, and ironic because at that same time, I was in the middle of doing a Peter Pan play myself, and I played Wendy Darling. Since I was stuck on my weekends with that play, which was finally performed on January 16 - 17, I asked my Mom to drop me off at the movies that same weekend I got done with my play. I thought it was AMAZING. I loved the music, and most of all, I loved the fairy dance. I think, without that scene, I probably wouldn't like it as much as I do now these days.<br />One part that is dragged out is the \\"I do believe in fairies\\" part. But my being 15, I guess that's just a little kids scene thing to get them into the movie.<br />The movie is so beyond cute, Jeremy Sumpter is an awesome actor, I'm now twice the fan I was before I saw this movie of his. Rachel Hurd-Wood only acted in a school play and you'd barely know it. She's got a gorgeous smile and I think that she'll make it big as an \\"English Rose.\\"<br />I ended up seeing this movie 5 times! I never got bored or tired of it, I wanted it to be longer. That was the problem, it ended SO quickly. When I saw it for the 5th time I had memorized most of it, and realized how fast an hour and 45 minutes can go. Jason Isaacs plays a scary (and good!) Hook, and I couldn't imagine any other actor playing Hook. <br />Well done, PJ!
0375758992|4.0|I bought this book at the airport in Atlanta GA for a non-stop  flight to ONT CA.  I wasn't sure if the book was going dwell upon the oppressions of the Evil White Man in Africa; or the political, social and economic disaster of post-colonial Africa that continues to today.  It was about both, yet neither.  It is a rare book about pre- and post-colonial Africa as seen through the eyes of a child growing up in what was once Rhodesia; a book that refreshingly tries not to preach to the reader.  I simply could not stop reading it, finishing it moments before landing in Calfornia.  The author paints a startlingly vivid picture of Africa: the sights, the sounds, the smells.  The good times and the bad, the sane and insane; the corruption and oppression of new regines that followed the corruption and oppression of the old regimes.  It is the story of a family, dealing with extreme hardship, the joy of life, and the pain of death.  Want to justify colonialism in Africa?  Read this book.  Want to justfy the demise of colonialism in Africa?  Read this book.  Want to read about the joy and horror of growing up in Africa?  Well.... you know what do to.

B00012QM9K|5.0|My copy of this superb movie is in the post so I have still to recieve it and to my horror the price has reduced from $55.99 to $24.49! Rating it with 5 stars because I have already viewed a friends copy.<br />Anyway, the issue of splitting the film across two sides is a no-brainer.  The compression required to accommodate a film of this size, with the soundtracks would be somewhat more disturbing than turning over the disk once during the entire movie.  When the next video format is released it will provide ample space for this type of movie, on one side of a disk, so we can all go to Amazon and order it again!<br />Just enjoy the movie, there are bigger things to get upset about.
B000069CWE|5.0|It is pointless to pick this amazing release from Linkin Park apart on a song by song basis, because the whole album holds together as a single, throbbing unit!!  While Hybrid Theory was an exciting effort from this band, Reanimation is an entirely new and much more powerful experience.  The songs flow together seamlessly and take the listener on an emotionally challenging journey.  Crank it up and take off!!
B0000C8AVR|1.0|After reading most of the customer reviews for this SACD, I have to ask:<BR>Has anybody who DOES own the compatible multi-channel SACD player and amplifier noticed that the music is playing through only the front left &amp; right speakers? I have only a couple of other SACDs and I played them to be sure everything was working correctly. Sure enough, the equipment was correct. <br />Maybe the disc I have is faulty. A friend loaned it to me. He doesn't have SACD compatible equipment but loves Dylan, so bought the new discs just because.<br />Many of the reviews on Amazon state &quot;I don't even have a SACD player, but this new release sounds amazing!&quot; I just want to ask if anybody else is NOT getting any multi-channel experience on this particular disc.<br />For the record, the songs themselves are essential Dylan. I'm interested in reviews of this disc from those who are qualified to review it in its SACD format.
B0001MDPV8|3.0|Let me preface my review by saying that the original Illmatic album (Disc One of this edition) is an undeniable classic, five stars, without a doubt. But as a whole, this 10 Year Anniversary Edition only gets three stars (I really wanted to give it two), and the primary reason is Disc Two.<br />The bottom line: this is so much LESS than it could have been.<br />I love remixes, but the four remixes included here...they just don't work. I don't want to hear Illmatic-era lyrics over 2004-radio-rapper beats. The best of the four is the &quot;It Ain't Hard To Tell&quot; remix, which does have a hardcore, yet updated feel to it. Nas spits some different lyrics (perhaps he re-recorded them for this edition), which is cool. The worst is the &quot;One Love&quot; remix; it inexplicably features censored lyrics, which completely ruins the song, especially when they edit words like &quot;nine&quot; and &quot;L's.&quot; Come on. What a waste.<br />Perhaps the biggest problem I have with including these subpar remixes is the fact that there are already some great remixes of these songs THAT WEREN'T INCLUDED! I'm referring to the remixes done back in '94 and '95 when these songs were released as singles. The Q-Tip remix of &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; and the Arsenal Mix of &quot;Life's a B****&quot; are outstanding. &quot;One Love,&quot; &quot;It Ain't Hard To Tell,&quot; and &quot;Halftime&quot; were all remixed back in the day, and quite well too. I would argue that these remixes make up a large part of the Illmatic mystique, and they should have been included in this celebratory anniversary collection. I mean, why not? OPEN UP THE VAULTS!<br />Another thought: if you are going to create some new remixes of these songs, why not bring in the original producers to do the job? Get Primo, Extra P, Tip, Pete Rock and Big LES and have them either remix their own songs or let them swap. It would be pretty cool to get those legends to give us an updated version of their classic tracks. <br />The two new songs on Disc Two (produced by Marley Marl and Extra P) are pretty good, worthy of inclusion here. Although, again, I would have liked to hear something from 10 years ago...weren't there any unreleased tracks that were scrapped when the 10-song Illmatic sequencing was finalized?<br />My other complaint about this collection is the lack of liner notes. A small thing, perhaps, but when I buy a greatest hits disc, anthology, or anniversary edition, I expect to get liner notes--and I am disappointed when I don't.<br />It basically all boils down to this: this collection doesn't live up to the greatness of the very album it was created to celebrate. Quite a disappointment.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is an amazing album. There are only 2 songs on here that i occasionally skip, those being &quot;six shooter&quot; and &quot;hanging tree&quot;. The rest are awesome and i give them all a 10. I like this album better than their previous album, &quot;Rated R&quot;. I dont much else to say, exept, dont buy any rap or hip hop or sappy junk(like britney, justin, hillary) or anything like that: BUY THIS...IT'S GOOD FOR YOU. peace out
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This film was so much more than I expected. I would have settled for a good swashbuckler and I got a lot more. This is a film where the characters are alive, they are real, complex people, with often contradictory feelings. The action advances the story, it impacts what the characters feel and do. I particularly loved the friendship between the captain and the ship's surgeon: one is an action man, the other an intellectual. Often they differ in their views, but the affection they have for each other is palpable. And they play the cello and the violin together, which results in some memorable moments. My favourite scene in the movie: the arrival to the Galapagos Islands and the doctor's awe at the new species. The DVD is perfect in its quality and the many extras are all super-interesting.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am a huge fan of Bill, and think he is funny in everything he does, but even he couldn't help me get through one of the most boring movies EVER.  There was so much potential for a great show: Bill in Japan, not understanding a word being said to him.  Instead there were numerous blown opportunities to captivate the audience, and some of the lamest conversations that seem like they will never end.  I don't know why there is so much hype about it, its a pictural version of a sleeping pill, with the most enteresting thing being some of the beautiful scenes of Tokyo.
B000002H97|5.0|Love it.  They have not done one decent thing since it though.  Metallica is a sell out!!!!   Look at them.  they cut their hair and did covers of Thin Lizzy and Bob Seger.  Enough said.

B00004WLXZ|1.0|I sat down to watch this movie completly objectivly. I don't let personal disagreements get in the way of appreciating good music and movies, but this was just a boring movie. It's just another propaganda film made by a beginning director. I almost turned it off after the first 15 minutes, but i decided i would give it the benefit of the doubt and sit through the entire 2 hours which ended up just being a waste of my time. I could have just watched the music video for depeche mode's 'people are people' 22 times, but then again, i would have missed out on the pudgy housewives throwing gang signs and the homoerotic scenes with Hitler's youth.<BR>I consider myself to be a film snob, but i just don't understand this one.
B0000931QA|5.0|An immense pleasure I am now experiencing while listening to Queensryche's stunning &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot;, coupled with the surprisingly small number of reviews here have urged me to put digit to keyboard and wax poetic about this incredibly emotive sonic masterpiece.  Sadly, this masterwork may have been overshadowed on one side by the predictable poses of the popular &quot;80's hair metal bands&quot;, and the technically brilliant yet sometimes emotionally chilly &quot;thrash&quot; of the late 80's; yet Queensryche nevertheless garnered much critical praise and expansion of their core following with a cohesive work that delights on many levels of lyric, melody, and emotional resonance.  And today, nearly 15 years after its original release, Mindcrime continues to evoke a passionate listening experience through its well-written compositions of sheer power and emotional catharsis.<br />The core Queensryche \\"sound\\" finds its influence in a diverse blend of rock idioms, from the expertly performed art and progressive rock circles to the edgy and incisive sounds of punk rock rebellion.  Blend in a pinch of theatrical classic rock in the vein of The Who's \\"Quadrophenia\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", and the listener has transcended the run of the mill, stagnant musical forms that occupy a good deal of the record store bins and radio station playlists.  Yet Queensryche manages to defy the conveniences of category, presenting an arsenal of sounds and moods that frankly put many of their contemporaries to shame.  The vocals of Geoff Tate are inspired and sincere, unlocking the deepest emotional meaning in the passionate lyrics -- If Nero carelessly played his fiddle while Rome burned, Geoff Tate is employing his stunningly melodic vocal gift to inspire the fiery insurgency!  And what an insurgency it is, with Mr. Tate relating how the mechanized culture of greed and media manipulation \\"spread the disease\\" during Mindcrime's socio-political themed first half, while exposing deepest torment of the soul and it's heart-wrenching sadness on the album's latter half, affording us a look through the eyes of a lost stranger who through tragedy no longer believes in love.  Noteworthy songs such as \\"Speak\\", \\"Spreading The Disease\\" (with a heart-stopping middle break that positively tears asunder the greed and hypocrisy of the dominant 1980's political culture), \\"The Mission\\" and \\"Eyes Of A Stranger\\" showcase Tate's limitless vocal range and keen ability to locate the melodic heart of a lyric through his vocals.  <br /> Suffice it to say that Operation Mindcrime features brilliance not only in the technque of Geoff Tate's voice, but also in the songwriting of the &quot;Tri-Ryche&quot; trio of Tate and guitarists extraordinaire Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton. Virtuosos Wilton and DeGarmo unleash pummeling power chords, lilting arpeggios, and soaring solos as if their very lives depended on it, forging a sound that grips the listener and fits like a silken hand inside the velvet glove of Tate's vocals. The fullness and clarity of sound on this 22-bit remaster reveals the excellent rhythm guitar tracks that form the bedrock for technically and melodically gifted solos galore (a common complaint about 80's metal &quot;shredders&quot; is that they lacked in the rhythm department -- definitely not so with the 'Ryche!)  The depth of the layers of melody here are cemented by a persistently rumbling bass courtesy of Eddie Jackson (brilliantly exemplified in the album's title track), an ever-audible bass that adds a rhythmic foundation to the symphony of guitars (how many 80's rock albums are marred by a nearly invisible bass?  Again, not on Operation:  Mindcrime!).   Rounding out the rhythm section is drummer Scott Rockenfield's cymbal crashes and fiery snare work, a combined assault that not only provides a rhythmic pulse but also a melodic compliment with a fine employment of the ride and hi-hat cymbals.<br />Nearly 16 years after it's initial release (and about 15 since I first listened), Operation: Mindcrime continues to fascinate, perhaps more than ever on this sonically enhanced, remastered edition.  Countless trends have come and gone, but art in its most sincere form is able to defy the fickle tastes of those who listen merely for the \\"hot new sound\\" or the latest fashion trend shrewdly marketed through the vehicle of a \\"musical\\" group.  An album that inspires on so many levels (I find myself concurrently singing, air drumming and strumming, and dancing about in sheer abandon in my living room as I listen ... not to mention pondering the deeper lyrical meanings!), I offer the highest recommendation possible to Operation: Mindcrime, an album that any lover of music can appreciate for it's thought-provoking sound, charging forward through the centuries to bare it's fierce and fiery musical soul to all who venture to listen.

B00000JGEH|5.0|NOTE: The movie I watched was a cleaned-up version that deleted swear words, sex scene, and any of the very gory violence without compromising the story line, so I cannot vouch for the content of the actual film--I would strongly advise looking into the content before seeing it. As a Christian I would advise against watching an unedited version.<br />Now for the actual review:<br />  Few people haven't heard of the Terminator, and with the 3rd of its series having hit theatres several months back, the cyborg thing is in fashion once again.<br />  And it's famous for good reason. From the first chilling images of a charred and ruined Los Angeles to the same metropolis some 45 years earlier, this film is thoroughly excellent.<br />  The plot is intrisically simple, and therefore chilling and effective for that very reason. Computers had developed artificial intelligence and, in the year 1997, caused a nuclear holocaust that destroyed 3 billion human lives. Those humans who survived became locked in an epic battle for survival against nearly indestructible enemies, led by one man: John Connor. Eventually they get into a position where the defeat of the machines is imminent, and mankind will be restored to its proper place.<br />  In a bid to reverse the tide of the war, Skynet, the computer system responsible for the war, sends a machine back in time--a Terminator, a computer system with a metal skeleton and surrounded by human tissue created for one thing--death. It's mission is to kill John Connor's mother, Sarah, at all costs, and thereby indirectly depriving the human resistance of its leader. Lacking human emotion or remorse, this terminator, perfectly played by monotonal Arnold Scharzenneger, sets out on its mission with relentless purpose.<br />  The humans, knowing of the machine's plans, manage to send one of their own back through time--a human soldier named Kyle Reese, who has been ordered to defend Sarah from the terminator.<br />  They both reach the year 1984 at approximately the same time, and from there begins an epic struggle for Sarah's survival.<br />  The plot is helped immensely by the directing of James Cameron, which is quite superb. He uses slow motion extensively, but for such a film this is no problem, and it turns out to be quite effective.<br />  Everything about the terminator itself is done quite realistically--it has no sudden relapses into remorse. The only time is spares people is when its purposes are foiled by external circumstances. And, of course, Schwarzenneger is the perfect choice for such a role. It would be hard to make the case that he is a good actor--but he doesn't need to be for this role, and he can exude such a sense of cold, thoughtless machinery that few if any other actors could have taken his part and equalled or improved it.<br />  The terminator is the center of attention, but Sarah Connor is the lynch-pin of the film, for her death would, at least in the confines of the movie plot, spell the end (or termination) of the human race. A good actress is important for such a key role, and Linda Hamilton certainly does a good job, even though she, at about 28, was playing a 19 year-old. It is completely natural for Sarah to be incredulous and disbelieving at the notion of a machine like a terminator, and Hamilton protrays this well.<br />  The digital effects obviously are not completely up-to-date, since the movie was made in 1984, but no movie can be expected to upgrade itself for the changing times, and for the time they were quite good. The only part that comes across as fairly corny is when the terminator loses his outer skin to show himself as he is underneath--a creepy looking metal skeleton. However this was done on the film, its movement comes across as rather shaky--the the sheer effect of a skeletal terminator still pursuing his mission even after being in the middle of a semi explosion is good enough, and the failings of the special effects can be overlooked.<br />  Andcertainly the action sequences are tremendous. Reese's desperate defense against the blazing guns of the terminator--who, caring not a whit for human life, kills whoever stands in his way--makes for a wide array of tense and suspensful scenes.<br />  All-in-all a superb film, except for the fact that Reese and Connor end up producing John illegitimately. I didn't see it in the cleaned-up version, obviously, but even knowing it's there doesn't please me. I can't prevent anyone from seeing it as it is, of course, but I do give them my word of caution that there is a good deal of bad content.<br />  But if you see it edited, it's an superb film!erlooked. <BR>     And certainly the action sequences are tremendous.

B00003003R|4.0|its got alot great gnr songs live but heres my problem the sound quality sucks this has to be one of the worst sounding live cds ever made u get around that u get a glimpse at what guns n roses once were  the rolling stones of this generation not just an 80s band they continued on and had thier biggest hits in the 90s like november rain they grew as a band into legends and until they finally release the new cd this will wet your taste buds  a time that seems like yesterday but is almost 20 years ago
B0000TB01Y|4.0|overall a great show live, the majority of the music is memorable but some weak spots in the score that i didn't think twice about skipping over on the cd<br />highlights: overture and no one mourns the wicked, the wizard and i, what is this feeling?, dancing through life, popular, defying gravity, i'm not that girl, thank goodness ( i couldn't be happier,) i'm not that girl:reprise (i loved the role reversal here,) as long as you're mine, no good deed, for good, finale<BR>everything else is worth skipping over

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Oscar? People actually think this deserves an OSCAR??????? I admit, there are some fun moments in this movie, but for the most part i found it boring. I also happen to like movies that make you think (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive), and this is just boring straight through. The acting is decent, but the plot falls short of capturing the attention of the audience. Interesting to see once, but never again.
B000002J09|5.0|the record that changed zepplin and rock forever the albulm were they went from rockers to psychadelic rock gods forever songs like stairway to heaven black dog goin to california when the leve breaks are some of the greatest rock songs alltime when i play this cd i get fond memorys of southern indiana in the fall the smell of fresh fruit the beautiful countryside zepplin will never die because these songs are the seasons themselves
0451169514|5.0|this books is awesome. it may be a little long (1090 pgs) but i read it in a little over a month. after reading, i could swear the characters were real people. not scary, but very entertaining. if you are a King fan, read it. if not, read it. just one thing, dont watch the movie. dont judge the book on how the movie was. i would have given this book 60 stars

B0001AP12G|5.0|The album was good, i expect to see alot of hot ryhmes come out of Kanye. He represents a soulful/real sence that hip hop needs to feel. All the tracks were good. <BR>Go Get get it!<BR>J$M-
B0000CEB4V|5.0|george harrison was 1 of my guitar heroes for many reasons no he wasnt the fastest but he wrote beautiful happy songs and had well thought out solos and i like his voice as much as pauls this dvd performed by his friends a few days after he died captures his magic hearing his former rival eric clapton with mcartney playing my guitar gently weeps is easily the highlight of this beautiful dvd 5 stars rip george you were a cool beautiful soul
B00018D44U|3.0|Although there are only three songs (Don't Know Why, Come Away With Me, Turn Me On) that I like from Norah's debut album \\"Come away with me\\", I've decided to give her 2nd album a try.<BR>I have been listening to both CDs and I can't help but to think that Norah's debut album is much better than her latest album. I was disappointed with the \\"Feels like home\\" album since it has more country like songs. Some of my friends also pointed out that all her songs sounded the same.
0792164903|5.0|tim burton and my fav director francis ford copola teamed up to do thier version of the legend of sleepy hollow  and its stunning from the tim burton settings to coppolas mastery of slowlymoving credits and building of suspense through music this films a great movie to watch on an october night and johny depp and christini ricci both do wonderful acting jobs look for christopher lee as the judge in the beggining this is the first johny depp film i truly liked
B00005YW4H|3.0|These are the only three songs I like from this album: Don't Know Why, Come Away With Me, Turn Me On. Other than that, the rest are just ok.
B00018D44U|4.0|This cd is brilliant.  Maybe it is in contrast to just how bad the \\"music\\" is these days that has taken over pop radio stations.  Most of the popular music today sounds more like the crap that was out the year before...just slightly more [bad] lyrics.  Anyway, Norah brings her talent to the forefront on this disc.  The songs are deep yet simple, and Norah's hushed voice fits the mood perfectly.  I like the fact that she doesn't chase trends yet sells lots of albums.  The only reason this album didn't get the perfect 5 stars is b/c of the dolly parton duet.  She scares me, sorry.
0739313126|2.0|I'm reviewing the unabridged CD set narrated by Paul Michael. I won't review the book here except to say I enjoyed it. I'll focus on the CD version.<br />The book is narrated on 13 CDs in standard CDA format. Each CD contains about 25 tracks, each containing 3 to 4 minutes of narrative. This is more time than most CDs contain and it causes problems. I have four CD players in my house and not one of them could read the last five or six tracks from each CD without pausing, skipping, or crackling. I even returned the first set but had exactly the same problems with the second set.<br />I downloaded some software specifically designed to recover bad CDs but even when I turned all the error correction options on, it still couldn't read some of the tracks. I have to conclude the CDs are not correctly burned. Who ever produced these CDs did a very poor job and really let Dan Brown, Paul Michael, and Random House down.<br />Although it wouldn't bother most people, I noticed that the track information between CDs is inconsistent with track and album names being different formats between CDs. As I was trying to rip the CDs so I could listen to them on my iPod, I found myself taking a lot of time to re-enter the information in a consistent manner so the tracks would play in the correct order.<br />I would have given this four stars if the CDs had been burned correctly. Perhaps Costco had a bad batch.
0385504209|5.0|If you are in search of a captivating book I have no better suggestion for you than the Da Vinci code.  As an art history/history major this book was like a review of everything I learned in college - quite an education!  But if you are not intereseted in history or art, don't pass it up. This is one of the most suspenseful, masterfully written books I've read in a long time, possibly ever.  While critics might call his quick chapters that end in a way that you just have to read the next chapter &quot;formulaic&quot;, it works.  There are many unpredictable plot twists that will keep you guessing til the end. I began the book on a plane ride and finished it at 3 in the morning that night, barely being able to put it down in between.<br />This book entertwines so much history with the religious hypotheses that it just seems so believable.  It will give you something to think about and talk about for months after you finish. In fact, you will be so interested in what you read that you will want to find out more about everything from the Knights Templar and Mary Magdalene to Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion.
B000005RU2|5.0|Deep purple live in Japan , I think this title will be obligated reference from here to the eternity. The others albums in my personal view are: Led Zepellin II, Uriah Heep live, How the west was won (Led Zepellin too) , Captain beyond (Capricorne), Allman brothers live from Fillmore, and Jimmy Hendrix`s experience.<br /><br />What else can one say after listening?. I've gathered with young people, a nephew and several friends of him, and others friends not necessarily rock`s lovers to listen that record (I'm 49) the facial expression is the same:  amazing, unbelievable, and other similar adjectives.<br /><br />This is posible, because there are certain moments in a  very special ocassions where you seem sign a kind of statement with yourself and your bliss; a commitment and clarity who goes beyond your own limits. And this thought applies for all the arts.<br /><br />Bresson , a french filmaker (died in 1999) told once: \\"When you don`t know what to do , and what you do is the best, that is inspiration\\".And those days of August 1972  Deep purple was inspired, without any shadow of doubt.<br /><br />Only I can add this sentence: Deep purple is a rock band inscribed in the inmortality.  When you consider rhe sum of these gifted musicians like  Ian Gillan,Ian Lord ,Ritchie Blackmore, it`s logical to think that the throne of the rock is  for a few. And Deep purple is one of them.<br /><br />Forever purple !

B000063JZQ|3.0|so umm, this movie was.... Interesting, the acting was unique, and the fighting, well thats beond words! the witches were kinda nasty but something that u would expect because of the Play Boy production. i love how the dagger was floating it was amazing, it blew my mind. Thanks For Your Time!
B00005LQ04|5.0|Suspiria is able to overcome a plot that makes little sense, bad dialogue, questionable acting, and bad dubbing and still be one of the best horror films you may ever see.  That is a true testament to Argento's talent at creating an overwhelming atmosphere.<br />This film is difficult to describe.  I can say: go and see it.  Heck, go and buy it.  It's really one of a kind.  (Okay, maybe other Argento films approach it.)<br />The key word is atmosphere, which is a key element in a good horror film.  Since the film is about witches, and the supernatural, etc, you know it's fantasy, so it needs another factor: atmosphere.<br />The film is literally bleeding with color.  It's a real, expressionistic horror film.  The lighting is the first thing to hit you, and it stays.  I've never seen a film use lighting like this since.  The composition of the shots, the insane music of Goblin, and the overall weirdness catapult this flick into legendary status.<br />A young American ballet dancer visits a prestigious German dance academy.  She soon realizes something very strange is going on, and sure enough, it's some kind of witch haven.  Several students and a staff member die bizarre (but stylish) deaths.  The opening is truly macabre and sets the tone.<br />Argento hasn't matched this film yet.  It's part one of a supposed trilogy, the sequel being the inferior but still creepy Inferno.  After some of his recent work though, it doesn't seem like investors are flocking to Argento's door.<br />Highly recommended, this film looks and sounds gorgeous on DVD.  There's also a special set with a disc of extras as well as the demented soundtrack CD included.
B00003CXCT|4.0|There aren't any real words that I can say that can explain just how much the original Star Wars movies mean to me. Being able to see Star Wars in the theaters in 1977 as a 6-year old was one of the greatest and happiest times in my life. I am not one of the types that attend conventions or wait in lines to see the latest Star Wars films, but it made an impact on me, and I cherish the original Trilogy.<br />With that being said, I am saddened that the original format of the Star Wars trilogy will not be released with the \\"special\\" editions that we will be getting. This is why I am only giving 4 stars.<br />Why not? I wasn't that impressed with the special editions. So they cleaned up the screen and added some new effects and explosions. That's where the tinkering should have ended. The scene in the \\"Special Edition\\" of Star Wars where Han Solo shoots Greedo under the table in the Cantina was changed to where Greedo shoots first. Why? That was one of the funniest scenes in the original. It also looks TERRIBLE! It didn't add to the story at all.<br />I went to each Special Edition back in 1997, and I did enjoy seeing Star Wars on the big screen again. It was fun. But as nitpicky as I might be, there is something about the originals that shouldn't be messed with. So what if there wasn't any computer animation? That's one of the best things about it. Good old fashioned models and puppets. At the time, it was state-of-the-art. When Ted Turner bought the rights to old black and white movie classics back in the 80's, he colorized them. That looked terrible, and there was no reason to do it. There are some things that do not require changing.<br />I know that I will still buy the DVD trilogy coming out, and its not as if the original stories aren't still in place. But I just wish that we had the ability to CHOOSE what we want to see. Hopefully they will make a last minute decision and add the treasures we saw so long ago in their original versions.
0767818040|5.0|&quot;Body Double&quot; is, in every way shape and form, a modern masterpiece, the same way &quot;Vertigo&quot; was and is.  Our lead man suffers a similar phobia and is enveloped by the same paranoia of a murder consipracy invloving the victim switch. Point of view shots are used in a simialr vein and our leading man constantly speaks in his best James Stewart drawl.  Other than lacking the customary Deplama split screen (which would have made the most sense in this of all Depalma films) &quot;Body Double&quot; is spectacular.  Low budget elements are a deliberate mesh with the story of making a low budget horror, dated music is well represented.  The plot, on the other hand, is filmed with the brilliant conventions we come to expect from depalma. dennis franz is not as raw as he was in &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;.  Any NYPD Blue fan has got to check out &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot; to see the real detective at work.  Here, you actually never know what is real and what is set-up making &quot;Body Double&quot; a quintessential thiller for all lovers of the genre.
B000002MTR|5.0|1st of all you should by an album because you like it, not because it goes platinum like it seems alot of these \\"new\\" RHCP fans did when they bought \\"Californication\\" and the worst sounding RHCP album to date- \\"By The Way\\". I'm surprised \\"By The Way\\" even went gold, let alone platinum. \\"One Hot Minute\\", however, did go platinum and it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2nd album to get that little platinum sticker put on the cover, but now record stores only put the sticker on \\"Blood Sugar Sex Majik,\\" their 1st platinum album. OHM was my 1st RHCP cd and I got it for Christmas the first year it came out. When I first heard it, I hated it. I assumed this was the RHCP sound because this was the 1st time I heard them. After awhile of listening to this album though, it began to grow on me and it's now one of my favorite RHCP albums. It's different than any of their others, but definately very original and the music sounds awesome. Dave Navarro (also known for his guitar playing in his band \\"Jane's Addiction\\") was an amazing addition to the band. You can also find him performing with the chili peppers on \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" off of the \\"Beavis And Butt-head Do America\\" soundtrack and performing at probably their most famous concert-Woodstock '94 in the lightbulb suits. His version of \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Majik\\" on that album is awesome and makes the song alot heavier than the studio version. This version of BSSM on Woodstock '94 really shows that Dave was probably their best live guitarist they ever had and will probably ever have. In pop music, an album like OHM had never really been released before. It's their most inventive album to date. My favorite RHCP is their 1980's songs off their 1st 4 albums. They were their funkiest back then. BSSM is also unbelievable as well, obviously. \\"Californication\\" was the beginning of their downfall. Although a great album, it was overly publisized and only the alternative songs really became the hits off the album. There was alot of goodfunky songs on that album that people seem to ignore because the radio only plays the alternative songs off that album. The funk is what people look for in this band, not alternative. \\"By The Way\\" was the worst RHCP album to date and their greatest hits compilation in 2003 was just as bad. I will probably not like a new RHCP cd because their direction their going in now sucks. Although people say \\"One Hot Minute\\" sucks, people need to remember that it was RHCP's 2nd most successful album up until \\"Californication\\" was released, in terms of record sales. The hit songs off the album were \\"Warped\\", \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"My Friends\\", \\"Coffee Shop\\" and \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\". I highly recommend this album and it should be an essential album to have in any RHCP fan's cd collection.
B000002WU9|5.0|1995 was a HOT year in hip hop music, and this album shows why. With Wu-Tang still in their primes and dominating the scene, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah hooked up to drop one of my favorite albums of all time, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. This album is EXCELLENT, from start to finish. This is the Wu-Tang at it's finest, and no other album (solo that is) will EVER take this as far as Wu-Tang solos go. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: The entire album. There's NO fast forward material here.<br />Production: Thumbs up. Quite possibly the BEST production The Rza has been responsible for.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs up. No other MCs had \\"guest starring\\" in their albums before this one.<br />The Last Word: Hip hop today would be SO much better if albums like this were released. It's too bad that hip hop right now is being dominated by such wackness (Lil Jon, Chingy, etc). But Raekwon and Ghostface dropped a GEM on hip hop that will always be remembered. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this album to you, die hard Wu fans or not. You MUST own this. A TRUE masterpiece.
6302886228|5.0|I am a Dylan fan and I absolutely LOVED this video.  But I also taped it from TV, and am not gonna pay so much to get another video!  If it were on DVD, I would definitely buy it!  I just bought the recent DVD Tribute to George Harrison, which was done much more recently.  Surely, Sony, you could get with it!  DVD!!!
B00001IVOR|4.0|This double CD was met with some criticism, from fans and critics alike. But the Wu-Tang Clan dropped a serious fem in 97 with this album. Wu-Tang Forever is one of the best double albums ever released, along with the double albums from 2-Pac and Biggie. The Wu was still in their prime with this one, and what resulted was one EXCELLENT album. Here's the review:<br />Disc One<br />Album Highlights: The entire album EXCEPT the intro, and Maria.<br />Production: Thumbs up<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up<br />Originality: Thumbs up.<br />Disc Two<br />Album Highlights: Triumph, Impossible, Deadly Melody, Projects, Bells of War, The M.G.M., Duck Seazon, and Hellz Wind Staff<br />Lyrics, Subject Matter, and Originality: The same as above<br />The Last Word: This album is AWESOME. ALthough some of the songs should have been left off, this is still a tight effort from the Wu. Strongly recommended.
0784010501|5.0|As with everything Madonna does, it sets out to be thought-provoking and honest. This documentary is an insight into the world of Madonna on the road and in between, looking at other aspects of her life and personality. <BR>It shows her as a brazen and self absorbed personality, as with all great performers, but you also get to see a very vunerable human behind this exterior.<BR>It's a great idea, especially for an artist such as Madonna, because she's a very interesting artist and performer. <BR>She may come across as self-indulgent and narcisstic, but she's every bit a stunning and talented performer. <BR>Madonna is often complex and often contradictory, I think she had a lot of irony in mind when the concept of this documentary was thought up, but it shows Madonna at her very peak as an artist, a decade where she wasn't afraid to say and do what she pleased. It's essential for every Madonna fan and for any casual fan interested in knowing more and observing her as a performer and personality.
B000002WPI|5.0|1993 was a fantastic year in hip hop, and this album was one of those gems that were dropped that year. The nine-man team of Wu-Tang Clan hit the music scene in 93, and hip hop hasn't been the same since. This album is what the Wu should sound like when they are together, and they produced one AWESOME album. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: The entire album<br />Production: Thumbs up. The very first of Rza's classic production.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs up. Who else came off like the Wu around this time?<br />The Last Word: A classic in every sense of the word. When the Wu came together after this album and their second album, they weren't that catchy again. But this album is one of the greatest of all time, and it's one of my favorites. Purchase this album NOW if you don't own it. You won't be disappointed.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Because sales of this album proved to be disppointing compared to her previous albums, this effected the way it was percieved. <BR>Initially reviews for this album were extremely positive until the backlash set in which overally affected the album's performance mainly due to the controversial video being pulled, I feel it has earned a reputation it does not deserve. <BR>There were very simular reactions to the Erotica album in 1992, but I generally find her most underrated projects are her true gems.<BR> <BR>It is an intelligent album even though Madonna stumbles a bit throughout it, it has an intimate, stark aspect to it with electronic overtones and although not her very best material, it still springs surprises and it's still very original and unique compared to what is out there. <br />Ignore everything else you have heard about it and any other negative reaction towards it and listen for yourself.
B000000OUJ|5.0|The GZA is a lyrical swordsman. This guy says things that make you go back and think. This album, Liquid Swords, truly defines the classic Wu-Tang sound, just like the first Wu-Tang Clan album and the first Raekwon album before it. The GZA was at his absolute best on this album, and it shows in his lyrics. Here's the review:<br />Album Highlights: The entire album.<br />Production: Thumbs up. Once again, The Rza cooks up another production masterpiece.<br />Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.<br />Originality: Thumbs up.<br />The Last Word: Other GZA albums after this have not lived up to this release. GZA released this at a good time in hip hop. Hip Hop music right now needs releases like this. Overall, this album is BRILLIANT. It's the classic Wu-Tang sound in all of its glory, and for that I strongly recommend that you purchase this album.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I love this CD!! Its awsome!!
B00005NOOH|4.0|A magnificent compilation of film footage from the era, coupled with interviews with the people who lived the war and shaped its outcome.  Sir Laurence Olivier narrates with a drama only he could provide.  With timelines and the DVD technology which allows you to jump to any chapter, it is a gem.<BR>  The only criticism I have is that the narrative is too short, limiting itself to well known information without delving into much desired details.  It was, after all, made for general viewing and not the serious historian.  As well, the knowing viewer may distinguish a slight historical bias which reflects its creation in the Britain of the seventies.<BR>  Despite these limitations however, there has only been one rival to this great work in WWII documentaries; that was &quot;The War Years&quot;, also a British production, slightly older and suffering from the absence of colour footage, (and of course it did not have Olivier). I'm waiting for Amazon to offer this title eventually,(cross your fingers!).<BR>  The &quot;World at War&quot; may not be a definitive history of WWII in the literal sense, but no other documentary has come closer.

B00005JMX4|3.0|THE GIRL NEXT DOOR follows in a long line of recent teen [adult content] flicks that focuses more on the bodies and less on the storylines.  However, that's exactly why many of the men were in the audience in the first place.  After an incredibly slow start, some laughs do eventually transpire (none of which are generated by the actual \\"girl next door\\").  Actually, her character is used more to connect the other essential players and is almost forgotten at the end of the movie.  This film barely passed the 2 star mark, but considering how bad many of the other films have been this year, it feels about average.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a book which when first picked up is not all that interesting. My name is Vince and I was required to read Life of Pi for my world literature course. When i first began that book i was very skeptical, but the more that i read the book it became harder to put down. Although the book has a relatively slow start, it quickly draws you in. If you are willing to put in the time and continue to read the book you will be very satisfied. The ending of the book was looked upon very differently by people in my class. I personally loved the ending, but some people hated it. The author ends the book in a way that i have never experienced before. It is both satisfying and frustrating. I personally recommend this book for everyone. If you like books that will take you to far away places and teach you about the human spirit then you will love the Life of Pi.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|hype is fine, i like a good bit of excitiment about going to see a movie, but gothika started with your typical cello/heartbeat/asmatic wheezing, and never really recovers from that terrible cliched start.<BR>  a good movie, by present horror-flick standards, but not the deeply chilling or intelligent flim i was led to believe.<BR>  also, i have a grudge against 'mad people' sterotypes, of which this flim abuses excessively.<BR>  the style borrows from nakata (director of the origdional ring and dark water), but without his subtle atmospheric flare.<BR>  rent if you have to, but don't buy.
B00008G9JN|5.0|I saw Jethro Tull in concert when this ablum was released. I still consider this to have been my All-Time best rock concert ever! Best performance, sound, showmanship. Ian Anderson was awesome.  They played 4 or 5 songs off this masterpiece. I ran out and bought the album the next day. I love Aqualung and Benefit, but this will always be my favorite Tull Album. I have the original CD, but now I need to get this remastered version. I work with a lot of gen-x-er's who just don't &quot;get' Tull. Too bad, their loss. PS: This is a &quot;must&quot; have for any Tull fan.
0385504209|5.0|The DaVinci Code is another great adventure for Dan Brown's character, Robert Langdon. Dan Brown writes a great thriller that contains a lot historical facts. He keeps you turning the pages until you have finished the book. You are either intrigued with what you may learn next or what is going to happen next. After reading the book you understand why the book has been such a huge success.
0515123447|4.0|KILLING FLOOR is a real page turner and Jack Reacher is a man's man. It has a lot of action and great fight passages...Reacher whupped 5 guys at once in chapter 7 alone! The plot twists and turns and leads you away only to bring you back in a totally surprising way. Mr. Childs is an excellent writer and knows how to keep the reader interested. OK I noticed a few things which bugged me, the excessive use of the word \\"shrug.\\" I started to count the shrugs and gave up after about the thirtieth time Jack or Finlay or Roscoe shrugged before, or instead of speaking. The other thing that bugged me was something Jack mentioned about his background, his youth. He and his older brother Joe were Army Brats. They traveled around the globe from base to base wherever their Dad was stationed. Mostly Europe, Asia, and the US. I assumed they were army posts. On page 188 of the paperback, he says the Marine Corps took care of his father's funeral arrangements. As far as I know there are no Marine Corps units stationed in Europe, since we have no US Navy ports in Europe. The 6th Fleet does something called a \\"Med Cruise,\\" which means the fleet goes to the Mediterranean for a few months. They are not based there, hence no US Marines stationed in Europe. Both Jack and Joe served in the US Army as officers. Where did the Marine Corps come from? Just a few flaws, but nothing that ruined the excitement for me.<br /><br />I am updating this review (10/25/2013) for a couple of reasons: First, A friend recommended I read it, so I downloaded KILLING FLOOR to my Kindle, and after a few pages remembered I had read this book; and second, I was reminded of something that irritated me the first time I read it, too many \\"shrugs\\" by three of the main characters Reacher, Finlay, and Roscoe). So, using my Kindle, I looked up how many times the author had a character shrug in the book. There are 123 shrugs in a 407 page book. It still irritates me after all those years.
B00005KARK|5.0|I know that people will sit at the compter screen and write the stereotypes of movies. For what ever purpose they do it for, they are in every movie. I have watched Dumbo every single day when I was little. I didn't sit there and analyze every little detail about it. It's a great movie for kids to watch because it is entertaining. I am 18 now and I still watch it. Does it mean I need to grow up? No,because I know that every person has a favorite things that go over board on every once in a while and they go crazy. Just enjoy the movie for what it is,not what things stand for throughout the movie. When you do that,you loose the whole concept of it.
0452282152|5.0|I read &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; because I was so enthralled by the 2003 film adaptation directed by Peter Webber from a script by Olivia Hetreed.  When I saw the movie I was impressed by its visual elements but now that I have real Tracy Chevalier's novel I am really impressed by Hetreed's screenplay.  Usually when I am inspired to read a novel after I see a film it is to get more of the story, thinking that less than half of what is in the book has made it to the screen.  That is most decidedly not the case with &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring.&quot;<br />Johannes Vermeer's 1665 oil on canvas painting, which hangs in The Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis in The Hague, is considered one of his masterworks.  It is a portrait of a young girl, wearing a turban and a pearl earring, looking over her shoulder, her lips parted slightly, set against a black background.  But if you are familiar with Vermeer's body of work, most of which represented the corner of his studio in which he worked, then clearly &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is an atypical work.  This painting has raised a series of questions ever since it was rediscovered in 1882: Was the pearl real?  What is she wearing a turban?  Was the painting intended to be a portrait?  Nothing is known about whom Vermeer used as his model, so the biggest question of all is Who was the girl in the painting?<br />Chevalier answers all of these questions, and more, by creating a young girl named Griet.  After her father, a tile maker, is blinded in a kiln accident Griet is sent to work cleaning in the house of Vermeer in the Dutch city of Delft.  She is Protestant and the Vermeers are Catholic, which adds another element of strangeness to the young girl when she moves into the house.  Vermeer's wife, Catharina, is about to deliver another baby, and Griet is to help with the household work.  But she is also given the job of cleaning the master's studio, where she faces the daunting task of cleaning the objects on display without moving them from their position.<br />Griet is a smart girl, which for some may well be the Achilles heel in the conceit spun by Chevalier since they may well conclude that neither Greit's education nor her experiences would allow her to come up with the deep thoughts she has at critical points in the narrative.  But that intelligence is necessary to the story Chevalier wants to tell and the foundation for everything that follows is Griet's common sense conclusion that cleaning the widow's in Vermeer's studio will change the light that falls on his subjects.<br />&quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is about the art of painting and we learn, through Griet's eyes, something of Vermeer's technique, especially with his use of the camera obscura.  But it is also something of a love story, in that Griet cannot help but be smitten with the man who ends up painting her portrait, even if the thought that something might actually happen between them never really enters her mind.  For a time, in Chevalier's story, Griet serves as a muse of inspiration for a great painter who produced a true masterpiece.<br /><br />This is not a true story.  Most of the characters really lived and you can travel to the Netherlands and see the actual painting, but Chevalier's answer to all of the questions swirling around Vermeer's &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; are only creative speculations.  Yet in the final analysis Chevalier achieves the ultimate level that author's aspire to when they tell such tales in that we wish that this was indeed a true story.  Chevalier makes Griet as memorable as the painting she inspires in this 2000 novel.<br />On the back of the my copy of this novel author Deborah Moggach, author of &quot;Tulip Fever,&quot; says that she read Chevalier's story with a book of Vermeer's paintings beside me.  I read &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; after not only seeing the movie but after checking out all of Vermeer's paintings online, so that when Chevalier talks about the paintings &quot;Woman with a Pearl Necklace&quot; and &quot;The Concert&quot; I was able to visualize them.  I wish that reproductions of those paintings had been included in this novel as well as the cover picture of the titular artwork, the same way I wish that I could see the paintings and architecture that matter in Dan Brown's novels.  Since you can easily find a couple of excellent websites with Vermeer's artwork I would strong recommend that even if you have also seen the movie, that you be able to have the same advantage as Griet and be able to study these great paintings.e, so that when Chevalier talks about the paintings &quot;Woman with a Pearl Necklace&quot; and &quot;The Concert&quot; I was able to visualize them.
