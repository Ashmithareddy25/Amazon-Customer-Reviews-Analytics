B002ZG98ZA|1.0|This is coming from a male who actually enjoyed the first movie, I am not a hater I am not against female empowerment, I am not being ageist because the ladies are older and I think it gets silly when people like to excessively cruel to Sarah Jessica Parker.  But this movie was just downright juvenile, offensive and insensitive to people's everyday plight.  The great thing about the sex and the city series was that the viewer was able to relate to the characters and care about them, in this movie they just come across completely stuck up and out of touch women who you just want nothing to do with.  If you liked the series or you enjoyed the first movie this sequel will only take 2 hours of your life away, that is if you enjoy seeing Liza Minnelli singing in a ridiculous insulting wedding where the characters claim to be tolerant but are completely intolerant and making grade school jokes than go for it.....
B0089LOKHG|4.0|What I liked the most about this book was the alternating chapters. The author switches back and forth between the point of view of Lena and that of Hana. I feel like this was really well done, and I say this as someone who typically doesn't care for multiple narrations within a single story. It gave me the sense that the author was really in control of the plot, especially as the book neared its conclusion and the alternating chapters became shorter and shorter to compensate for the fast-paced nature of the final event and the (minor spoiler) convergence of the two characters' storylines (end minor spoiler).<br /><br />As far as the characters themselves go, I found myself the most interested in Hana and her story. I have not read the author's novella that focuses on Hana, but reading this book makes me want to. I had a bit of trouble keeping up with or caring about most of the members of the resistance, perhaps in part because it had been so long since I had read the second book. But I think, as well, there is not much time spent on their development, with the exception of Coral. I got the impression that the author expected their impact to carry over from the second book...but for me, it didn't work. I had dim memories, at best, of people like Raven and Tack, and there was nothing in this book to rekindle any feelings I had about them after reading Pandemonium. This is forgivable with relatively minor characters, but a real shortcoming of the book when it comes to an important character like Julian. As another reader has commented, his character in this book is flat, which is such a shame, as he was a really interesting character in Pandemonium. I think that, overall, there is so much action in this book (particularly in Lena's chapters) that there is little room left for character development.<br /><br />Regarding the ending, I think that whether or not you like it just comes down to personal taste. I can understand why some readers desired a more conclusive ending. As for me, I was fine with the open nature of it, as I thought it was very much in keeping with the series (that is, it's more about the journey, and the right to make one's own choices, than it is about the choices that are actually made). So, yes, there is a distinct lack of resolution at the end of the book, and if you are expecting all of your questions to be answered, you will be disappointed. Perhaps this is the kind of series that merits a &#34;Gratuitous Epilogue&#34; (in the tradition of Andrea K. Host's Touchstone series). Failing that, I am content to draw my own conclusions about the ultimate fates of the characters and their world.ing.

B00BEJL3IY|5.0|Yes that was cheesy pun on words.  Yes this is 2013's John Carter a poorly marketed mistitled film that was a enjoyable Saturday matinee popcorn movie.  When you go into a movie like this that is a fairy tale you should throw away any notion of realism because it is not suppose to be realistic if that was the case terrifyingly huge talking giants would be real and so would be a magical beanstalk that is a porthole between the two worlds would exist.  I loved the action in this movie, seeing the giants was awesome they looked intimidating which was awesome for a movie like this, and much has been said about the CG job on the giants, what did you want the filmmakers to do to create giants?!  Seriously some complaints are downright stupid.  Nothing can save this movie now from being a box office disaster but Warner Brothers I doubt it is much consolation, I for one loved this movie and I will surely be picking it up on blu ray!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great game really fun with friends I love it fun to change your name but boring to wat I play with friends all the time
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am not going to go into a tangent on my feelings about all six movies because the merits of the films have been discussed to death already, for me their are no movies I enjoy watching more than a Star Wars movie.  This set is a must have if you are a fan of the saga, I would discourage someone from buying the trilogies separate because you are missing out on 3 discs of bonus features which include deleted scenes from the original and prequel movies, and than you get a last disc of well worth watching documentaries.  If you have the DVD sets of the prequels and the original films HOLD ON TO THEM, many of the special features on the DVD's are not on the blu rays these are mostly new features so I am for sure going to hold on to my DVD's of the films. That all being said I was somewhat disappointed that the theatrical cuts were not included even though the changes don't bother me at all and I feel they were good, I would prefer to have the option of which version of the films I would watch.  In conclusion this should not deter any fan in the least bit from buying this set and enjoying the movies at home in full 1080HD this set is a must buy for any Star Wars fan!
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|The movie did a nice follow up on the original, and i did like it cause it didn't muddle thru the story line to much.<br />would have like to seen more of the either world but maybe they can do a more creepier story line like the mother and sons  like in the earlier games, that was super creepy
B005LAIH3G|5.0|First off if you are not a science fiction or fantasy fan why bother watching this movie and writing a review?!  It annoys me when people watch movie out of their area of interest and publish stupid reviews.  Yes the marketing by Disney for this film was a disaster from the title which should have been \\"John Carter of Mars\\" and the awful trailer they put out.  That being said being a science fiction fan I gave this movie a chance and was I glad I ignored the mass general public on this one, what a enjoyable old school Saturday matinee, I really grew attached to the characters and I especially liked Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris, my favorite parts of the movie involved the therns and their twisted philosophy of control they were imparting on John Carter.  The special effects are top notch, the action is great if you are a fan of science fiction give it a try and watch with it a open mind ignore the idiot masses who think Identity thief is a great movie, I think you will be glad when you are done as I was.
B007REV4YI|5.0|best bond so far, need to watch it to the end to know how bond began.<br />It really is .......
B008JFUMT2|1.0|In my opinion this was easily the worst entry in the Die Hard series, and yes I found Live Free or Die Hard far more enjoyable than this mess.  I find myself to be a very forgiving movie viewer, with silly action movies I am not looking for plausibility and detailed realism, but this was way over the top and it wasn't even tongue and cheek over the top, some of the action scenes were just insulting unrealistic e.g. when McClane jumps from a helicopter and comes out fine less than a minute afterwards, the plot was idiotic just having John McClane come to Russia and put on his cape and come to the rescue of his son.  Again this is just my take on the movie I preferred the older Die Hard movies, but that's just me......
0385535147|1.0|Quite frankly, I was stunned at the 1,900+ five-star reviews, hailing this book as a \\"page-turner\\".  I wondered if maybe I missed out on the \\"Page-Turner Special Edition\\" and instead accidentally picked up the \\"Slow, Plodding, Wish You Could Get Your Money Back Edition\\".<br /><br />But what exactly makes a page-turner?<br /><br />For me, I need someone to root for.  I have to have some sort of emotional investment in the character and his or her fate.  I have read nearly all of Grisham's novels, and I've always had this connection with his protagonists - even those who were terribly, deeply flawed.<br /><br />My relationship with Malcolm Bannister started off just fine.  In the early pages, Malcolm is reminiscent of Stephen King's Andy Dufresne from \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" - professional, unfairly convicted, plying his former trade in the jailhouse to pass the time.<br /><br />But Malcolm began to lose me when two murders set into motion a sequence of events that he has clearly been anticipating for some time.<br /><br />The second murder was particularly horrific.  As I continued reading, I found it hard to stomach that Malcolm was willing to leverage this tragedy for his own personal gain.  And the less interest that I had in Malcolm's well-being, the less interest I had in turning pages.<br /><br />Had Grisham left out the more gratuitous murder, I might have maintained a little more sympathy and respect for Malcolm.  But as it turned out, I did finally find someone in this book to root for:  The Feds.

0345803507|4.0|The author's word pictures of the emotions of the characters were vivid to the point exaggeration. Fiction does not have to portrait reality in creating a character or how that character felt and behaved in the particular moment of the narrative.  The trilogy  was an entertaining read.
0385344333|2.0|If this was my first book by Lee Child, I likely wouldn't read another.<br /><br />Jack Reacher and his supporting characters have become wooden. The conversation is glib and repetitive, rather Dragnet-like in nature.  In some cases we get the same paragraph three times.<br /><br />Given the huge rush that normally comes with a Reacher novel, this was more akin to overhearing a very long conversation.
0345803493|4.0|During the read I realized that  the lead characters were drawn to their fullest potential. No doubts, no deviation, just go for it  with no question of their ability to do as expected. .

B005LAII94|3.0|Checked it out from the library and have tried to watch it twice all the way through, but could not stomach it.  The torture scenes are highly distressing, so I've decided to skip through them on my next attempt to view the movie - they seem very realistic to me.  Didn't understand the relationship between the leads, understood that they liked each other, but not why, didn't get enough information about them; they are all beautiful, but didn't understand them.  The drug business was presented in a terrifying way, and I didn't understand why the leads were in it; apparently they had been discussing quitting before the hostile takeover attempt by the more violent competitor, the story shows the two owners disagreeing about the timing to quit the business, but the kidnap of O happened all too quickly for them to get out at their own pace.  Money seemed to be the reason everyone was involved in the business, from the leads, to their competitors, to the crooked DEA agent - no one seemed that concerned about breaking the law, which I guess makes sense if a character is in the business.  Drug films distress me because they seem to concentrate the ugliest aspects of human nature into a 90 minute production, which is hard to take, so I think I'm already biased against them, which is why I gave the film an extra half star, to counter-weigh my bias.  The actors were good, the competitors were frighteningly violent, and the leads, in kidnapping the competitors child, showed that they have similar business tactics as their competitor when push comes to shove.  I did not know why I should sympathize with the leads, they are criminals knowingly working in a violent, illegal business; instead of getting out when they were pressured by their competitors, they dug in their heels - I don't care why they dug in their heels, they were stupid to remain in such a high risk, violent, illegal, venture.  Hard to sympathize with stupidity.  I found it believable that the competitor, a woman,had her business stolen from her by her lieutenants.  Story doesn't really give new information about the drug business, just another take on it from the point of view of the sex/love interest of one of the players.  I'll attempt to watch it again, but as I couldn't understand the leads' relationship, and I find the violent drug business terrifying, I think this is just not a story to my taste. 2 and a half stars for eye candy provided by the leads, their locales, and for the filmmakers efforts.

B004RWYNT6|4.0|Great album to excite and strut your way down the road. Very easy to find yourself playing it on loop. I just love songs where the vocalist is just singing his lungs out. To draw comparisons to other artists I am familiar with, the album feels like The Black Angels, but more upbeat, and Comets on Fire but with a more comprehensive speed and delivery.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|I purchased a new laptop last December - one with a 17 inch screen - and needed a bag that would allow me to bring my laptop everywhere while still providing protection and room for my work/personal items.  Boy, does this backpack deliver!  The backpack is well made and provides great protection for my laptop - but the best part of the backpack is the room!  I can easily fit any work that I need to take with me in the three storage sections.  I am amazed how I have room for everything I need to carry.  I also have pockets for all of my pens, office supplies, and flash drives.  I used to be disorganized and lose everything but that has changed since I purchased the Ibex backpack.  The Amazon price was also great - over $50 cheaper than the price that Staples was selling it for in the store.  Do yourself a favor by purchasing this backpack - you will not be disappointed.

B001TCHDPS|1.0|I bought the first Rodriquez CD &#34;Cold Fact&#34; and it is amazing....out of the 12 songs on that CD I'd give 10 of them 5 stars. This CD just did not do it for me. The music on Cold Fact had a real edge to it and and I am just speculating now but because Cold Fact was not a commercial success when it was released I'm guessing everyone who was involved with making Coming From Reality thought that they had to softened it up and try to make the music more commercial sounding because I thought the music was too over produced and kind of like elevator music especially compared to Cold Fact which was very original and I love that CD.  Sorry if I have offended anyone here with my negative review of Coming From Reality but I love music and I was extremely disappointed with this CD.

It is fascinating to examine the way Jiro lives his life and the habits that have enabled him to achieve such a high degree of excellence. It seems that he makes everyone around him strive for that excellence too. The film is definitely well-made with skillful editing, engaging footage, etc. However, as a disclaimer, the whole thing is in Japanese with English subtitles.

0307950654|2.0|P. D. James channeling Jane Austen? Could the creator of the dour Scotland Yard detective Adam Dalgliesh capture the vibrant Lizzie Bennett's shimmering wit? To find out the answers to those questions was the only reason I overcame my disinclination for Austen spinoffs and bought this novel, which was published in P. D. James' 91st year. Alas, the answer to both is no: James does not succeed in channeling Austen or capturing any part of her most beloved character, Elizabeth Bennett of Pride of And Prejudice. As to why an iconic mystery writer who created a beloved character of her own and is a bestselling author on every continent would run the risk of her (potentially) final novel being this very bad book, the answer seems obvious to me: She's a huge Austen fan. And in honor of that fact, let me point out the single charm I found in her take on Pemberley six years after Lizzie's marriage to Darcy: bulletins for Austenland on the doings of other characters. For example, James brings us up to date on Anne Eliot, the heroine of Persuasion, and Emma Woodhouse and other characters from Emma play minor roles in her novel. Imagining ties, however tenuous, between these Austen characters was a real delight. But that was the only one to be had in her story because James consistently violates the basic tenet of good fiction: show, don't tell. Just about the entire book is told -- by an omnisicent narrator filling in backstory, by more backstory mused over in the thoughts of key characters, by characters telling what happened to them to other characters -- with almost every important scene occurring off the stage. The only sustained passage of an actual scene unfolded on the page for the viewer to see in real time turns out to be telling as well since it consists mostly of trial witnesses telling a courtroom what they saw. In addition, James fails to capture Lizzie Bennett because this is Darcy's book, not Elizabeth's, and the fundamental attribute of James' Darcy -- and her Elizabeth to judge by the little we get to see of her -- is correctness: an overarching obsession with appearing correct and doing the correct thing -- as a master, as a husband, as a brother, etc. Correctness is an admirable attribute but boring in the extreme, especially when combined with humorlessness. Austen's Darcy was a bit of a stiff cipher who we felt would be redeemed by Lizzie's wit, love of the human comedy, and passion for her man. James' Darcy has stiffened and so has his wife into yet another benevolent and boring lady of the manor.Elizabeth to judge by the little we get to see of her -- is correctness: an overarching obsession with appearing correct and doing the correct thing -- as a master, as a husband, as a brother, etc. Correctness is an admirable attribute but boring in the extreme, especially when combined with humorlessness.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Became obsessed with this series and totally love it! Get so into it I have to watch several episodes at a time ...really makes you wish you lived in those times in England
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I feel bad about myself because Slendy doesn't want to be my friend. OK. Serious time. Forest appears to be much harder than road. Also, playing Bob Marley while playing this makes it less scary, but Slendy still manages to surprise me sometimes.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I love his voice! Every song touches my heart and soul! I have already told all my friends about this CD.
0307010856|5.0|Kids just love this book, it is such a cute story and the book is nicely price, kids want to read this often.
1616550414|5.0|perfect in great conditions, I was hopeless just thinking that I'll never get it but is great. Just for fans.
031617615X|5.0|This only matters if you love Twilight. I love the books and thought they were well written.  I really felt like I could be Bella due to the detail in the stories.
0307346617|5.0|I just start reading it, and I can let it go, is absorbing and absolutely entertaining, even though is fiction you can feel how things happen.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I really enjoyed supernatural (the guys are gorgeous! - who wouldn't want one of them to come save you) anyways, the DVD season I feel is spiraling to its end. I don't like ruining anything if you haven't seen it.  It is cheaper to buy the season than it is to rent them episode by episode or disc by disc at the video store. You can always resell if you hate it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I like to go back and see the conflicts in a changing world.  Besides, the acting is superb.
B003UESJ9M|2.0|Gwyneth, Gwyneth, what are you thinking here??  This melodramatic mess offers a lot of promise: Gwyneth Paltrow singing, Tim McGraw singing... hey, maybe some duets, some characters we care about, a moving romantic story.  It delivers very little.<br /><br />The cover is about as enjoyable as this movie gets: singing, smiling, dancing.  Right, Gwyneth barely cracks a smile and barely sings until near the end and then, the cheering crowd noise covers much of it up and the goofy choreography and outfits really distracts from it.  And why not let Tim McGraw loose to really sing(actually his acting is surprisely good but the script is not).<br /><br />I'm sorry.  I'm sorry; I'm unloading here, and I'm going to get blasted for my downer review, but what a disappointment.  I really like the actors, and I don't necessarily expect a happy ending **Spoiler alert** Goodness, if you're going to kill off Gwyneth's character and really soap it up, at least give her a decent death scene.**End Alert**<br /><br />The story remains me of the old country western joke-Q. what do you get if you play country western music backwards?<br />A. You get your job back, your girl back, your man back, your dog back, etc... I wish I could get my time back from watching this movie.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|The author demonstrates an intimate understanding of the characters we have come to love over the years. The story sticks to the same themes that have defined Star Trek: what does it mean to be human, and furthermore, what does it mean to be conscious?
B003K16PAU|5.0|This is a superb book.  It describes poverty and life on the streets in Paris and London.  What's it feel like to be hungry -- really hungry?  You'll get an insight into that question when you read this book.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part to me was the detailed description of the operations of a restaurant in Paris  (the main character in the book finally gets a job washing dishes).  The description of the kitchen, the &#34;pecking-order&#34; of the restaurant staff and how the food was prepared is a memorable part of this book.<br /><br />The book is relatively short and if you're like me you'll get through it in a couple of days.  I recommend it unreservedly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can not wait to read the last book. Great trilogy. Will not be able to wait to get it. Have to buy it now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a great series. Only wish it could have gone more seasons. So many quotable lines. If you like Nathan Fillion. Check out Castle and then you tube all the references they make to Firefly.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Recently, I had heard a lot of people talking about Downton Abbey so I decided to watch an episode. I quickly discovered I needed to see the past seasons in order to understand everything. I downloaded Downton Abbey Season 1 from Amazon and watched the entire season in one day!!  I was hooked and started downloading and watching Season 2. I have 1 more episode to watch and then I can start watching Season 3 which I have on Tivo. Great show, characters, history, storyline, etc. etc. Love it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Love this :) A pretty good way to wrap up a series that should have run much longer. Love Nathan Fillion. Now hooked on Castle.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Love this series from beginning to end! It engaged my interest quickly and never let go.<br />One of those series I was disappointed to finish.
B00AZ0Y7BI|4.0|'Dead Medium' is the story of May, an unsociable elderly woman who dies suddenly and then finds out she is a medium.<br /><br />This was something different for me, it was a bit slower paced than my usual reads and a couple of times I wasn't sure where the story was going but it all tied together in the end and was an enjoyable read overall.<br /><br />There's a bit of humour in some of the situations as May who isn't used to dealing with people gets a bit annoyed with them at times. I liked the characters, particularly May, and that's what kept me reading.<br /><br />The plot was fairly simple but the ending was unexpected and I really liked where the story ended up. It's a nice read with some interesting ideas through it.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|How can someone take such odd lyrics and make them sound so spiritual?  Great music and an outstanding voice.  Awesome album!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Strongly recommend! If not offended by drugs, alcohol, and sex.<br />Which then just look past it.<br /><br />Good book, extremely strange though. As a senior in high school I felt it accurately portrayed events that are likely to happen in our teenage years. And it is a true fact that teenagers drink and smoke and have sex and party. (BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK IS WHAT EVERY TEENAGER DOES)<br /><br />But absolutely everything that can go wrong for a teenager happens to this one boy. Just seemed to be one thing after another. Just intense!!<br />Still the book gave a great message, everyone has their own struggles and challenges, no struggle is worse or better than any other, and \\"life goes on\\"
B00A4L8CCS|5.0|Mr. McCullough is truly the last great American historian.  These was an awesome report by 60 minutes about a great man.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I didn't realize this was a foreign film and wouldn't have rented would i have known, however, i am glad i messed up.  When it first started i grunted and wondered what amazon's return policy on digital rentals was.  After watching im glad i didn't.  kept me intrigued the entire time.  I think the black guy(not sure of his name) really made this movie!  Wish we had moree actors like that here.  He will go far!!!!!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I did not enjoy the film as much as I enjoyed the music...  Still, these is a great CD and I keep on enjoying it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Amazing book for introverts like me and extroverts such as my wife. I have such a better understanding of why I'm the way I am, and there is nothing wrong with it.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I just finished Eban Alexander's book Power of Heaven. Do yourselves a favor and do not buy it. I had heard him interviewed on Terry Gross's Fresh Air Program about his Near Death Experience, surviving a coma for 7 days after flat-lining medically. His brain died. He is an MD and a neurosurgeon who has taught at Harvard, among other places, so he seemed legitimate. Poor Terry Gross never got around to or mentioned the malpractice suits against Dr. Alexander, so we were never told about his checkered background. The interview led me to believe that Alexander is serious about researching NDE experiences now that more people than ever survive heart attacks, comas, lightning strikes, etc, where the brain has died. In fact, he went on at length about how he is designing experiments to test commonalities of these experiences. In the interview, Dr. Alexander was most impressive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, aside from the description of his experiences while brain dead (?), there is nothing else to be found in this book except a lot of maudlin sentimentality and narcissism. The book is all about the author's \\"unique\\" knowledge of the afterlife, and how very fortunate we are to have him alive to show us the way. The author has such a bump on himself it is hard to read his book. I kept waiting for him to describe his scientific research, but there is nothing there! Shirley Maclaine was writing the same stuff 30 years ago, but she never pretended to be a scientist!<br /><br />Don't buy this book. It is being hyped as the missing link to scientific validation of the spiritual realm, but truly, as they say in Texas, this book is all hat and no cattle.
0061537969|5.0|Read the other 5 Star views.<br />Believe them.<br />I was listening to this in my car and halfway through I realized that this was not a good idea. I finished the last 3 discs in the privacy of my home where I could sob like a baby at the end.
0399160450|4.0|. . . I've read most of Tom Clancy's novels, and have enjoyed them.  Yes, the plots are a bit formulaic -- but it's an entertaining formula -- and the reader is aware of this going in.<br /><br />I also appreciate that while I was reading this work of fiction -- cyber attacks from China were actually occurring.  Clancy has a knack for current events; his &#34;what might happen&#34; does seem to sometimes happen!<br /><br />I am deducting a star however as there were some significant continuity issues from the previous novel with regard to the &#34;Melanie Kraft&#34; sub-plot.  From this reader's perspective, the entire sub-plot could have been handled much better -- through both novels.<br /><br />But I enjoyed the read and certainly didn't think that I'd wasted my time.<br /><br />A solid four stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has been good for when Ive been bored or if your on your kindle for long periods of time
111846446X|3.0|Don't know what would make this outstanding, but it's a nice reference book.  I am fairly experienced with Linux, the OS used on most Raspberry Pis.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This is a good application to view and edit your Linkedin profile.  Interface is clean, and the application is easy to navigate.  Works very well on my 1st Gen Kindle Fire.
B001LPWGE6|2.0|I am a fan of all three of the Bourne movies ( I have not seen the fourth) so when I saw the trilogy I grabbed it. When I received them I immediately popped the first one in to watch. A half hour in my entire unit froze, not just the movie. I unplugged it then started it back up and it froze after only ten minutes. I unplugged it again and restarted and if froze again. The other two movies have no issues with playback. But for some reason, the first movie will not play.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I know people have a lot of different preferences when it comes to Twitter apps, but I feel this app works the best.  The interface is clean, and itbis easy to use.  Never had any issues on my 1st Gen Fire.
B0083GCK5G|5.0|If you like the &#34;old&#34; Beach Boys you should enjoy this. Was pleasantly surprised and am enjoying it thoroughly. For $2.99, how can you possibly go wrong?
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I took advantage of the $0.99 sale for this application with my Kindle Fire (1st Gen).  For my uses, this application helps in a pinch when I am away from my work computer.  Sure the Kindle has a stock Office-lite app, but this one enables me to make edits to my documents.  I wouldn't pay full price as I didn't think it was worth it function-wise, but if you find it at a bargain, it can be a helpful application.
B0018STVHQ|1.0|If you're a Tudor freak, this movie will offend you.  The beginning and end are nonsensical (if you're on the scaffold, don't expect a last minute phone call from Hal).  Although it purports (I believe) to make use of Retha Warnicke's scholarship, the conclusions that this movie reaches are cringe-inducing.  I'm pretty flexible with my Tudor fiction (I loved The Tudors with Jonathan Rhys Meyers), this movie is beyond the pale.<br /><br />As much as I love Natalie Portman in other things, she really missed the mark in this movie.  Eric Bana was a non-entity.  Scarlett Johansen was probably my favorite part, but of course you could characterize Mary Boleyn Carey Stafford in just about any way since so little is known about her.<br /><br />Skip it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great story. Being a victim's of a physically abusive boyfriend once, I understand why she stayed 4 years  and how scared and strong you have to be to escape. I also know there can be a happy ending.  To any readers who are in this world of abuse, believe in your self and you have to make happiness happen. Nothing in life comes easy. Good luck, be safe and God Bless.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|the elevation of damaged people to normal lives is always interesting. given the use of flowers as a language that transcends words that can not be spoken was a stroke of genius.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like it because you cannot unlock new levels and new characters. There are interesting challenges and the birds offer a fun new twist to the game.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was typical Nicolas Sparks.  It had a decent story line and nice romantic them - better than the  romance novel approach.  It also had a nice thread of suspense throughout.  I like Sparks descriptions.  He is able to create pictures in the mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|reallt fun especially for daily usage. iw ould reccomenf this to anyone who wants to kill some time and juat have some fun :P.
B001OSIV62|4.0|I recommend the movie, its  a very good documentary on a unique situation that arises in the 70's with the World Trade Center-twin Towers.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This series is still fresh. The sets, props, costumes are for the most part still up to date. There are some scenes in some episodes that have aspects which are a little dated, but when you consider that these films are 47 years old its amazing. Gene Roddenberry was light years ahead of his time. The &#34;new&#34; versions are not horrible. I have enjoyed them as well. They just don't have enough of Gene's passion, genius, and foresight, which season 1, 2, and 3 all have.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turns, I simply couldn't  put it down. Completely unbelievable but so fun to read! Amy is \\"amazing!\\"

B005I6EU7U|4.0|I really love the look of the case. It holds up great as well! It also fits kindle fire great!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My granddaughter just had to get this game, she loves anything that has to do with angry birds so when she saw this she just had to have it. My granddaugter is 4 and I think this game is well beyond her age, but I've learn more about how to play this game from her than from anyone my age and this is not an easy game to play.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Boring and pointless sums it up for me.  The difficult controls just make it even more exasperating.  My guess is that the good reviews were either insiders, or people who just want to validate having wasted their money on a truly awful &quot;game.&quot;
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|The story in this book is a compelling read, and the pages fly by (no pun intended).  I've worked with veterans and oral histories before, and Germans always have some of the best stories.  My only complaint is that there are occasional &#34;spell check&#34; errors that the editor should have caught (spec/speck, aide/aid, marshal/martial).
B005XBKXV2|5.0|No more looking for cases to keep the CD's in!!!  My grandson loves this movie.  So easy to watch anywhere - on my phone - anywhere I can log into my Amazon account!
B002DJSBMA|5.0|It's rare that I discover a film like Meet Joe Black.<br /><br />The first thing that anyone needs to know is that this film actually tests you. It tests your cynicism, it forces you to unplug from a Hollywood and Facebook driven world and actually think about your life. It asks you to simply take three hours and think about who you are, what you've done, and where you want to go.<br /><br />Yes, it's long, yes, it moves at its own pace. But that is the point. It is a film about moments, preparation, and a rare opportunity that few people ever take the time to do, which is to look inside oneself and realize what is important.<br /><br />There is naturally some confusion about the subplot of Pitt's relationship with Hopkins' daughter... it seems surreal the first time you see it, but that again is the point. There are underlying themes and stories about her life and about what he wants for his daughter, and once she finds it, it isn't meant to be.<br /><br />The scene of Hopkins dancing with his daughter as \\"What a Wonderful World\\" plays is one of the most incredible exchanges I've ever seen in film, an a constant reminder of what is actually important in this world. It is a shame that so few people are willing to shed their cynacism for just 30 seconds and watch someone embrace life and tell his child that everything is going to be okay. To be able to look at his life and say \\"I have everything.\\"<br /><br />We are a jealous and cynical species... we need to look around more and see that there's something incredible happening around us at all times: Life.<br /><br />And one day, something we can't explain (and apparently no longer fear) is going to take us from it...
B009S33I68|5.0|Recounting a battle.  Few of us have experienced war as is described in this book.  The comradeship shown among the troops and the loving use of every soldiers name and perhaps his home town or a little piece of information about his life made it all the personal realm of the writer.  I would have been proud for a son of mine to have fought with this man just as he was fiercely proud and caring of his troops.  Read it!..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the most Awsome game ever. so addictive. I'm addicted to it. love it.great game. it's a must- have game. did I mention it's great?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sub way surfers is the best game ever and you can change the theme of it and change your character and you can earn fun prizes and you earn coins this a really great entertainment
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing everything about it juss seems so real and I recommend it to all the horse  lovers
B002ZG99QS|3.0|Nothing great. The young CGI version of Flynn looks spooky to say the least and the plot is thin and predictable. But then I guess that's all you can expect for a 200 mio $ budget these days.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I guess the most important thing to notice, even empires fall, because they get rotten with in.<br />I hope the continue the series so I can watch it, and eventually collect it
B005LAIHYU|1.0|Seriously, how else can you describe this. Hollywood seems to produce either sequels, remakes or utter crap these days, and this movie falls in the last category. No character development, no motivation, just shallow &#34;I saw my mother being killed by a vampire and that's why I become a vampire hunting president&#34; crap. Stay away
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I love the special effects, it is not violent It also has a atory line, very important. Great series, very entertaining.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|Old John Carter fan here, ever since I was 12 or 13. I was thrilled to hear they made a movie, but disappointed by the result. The actor is totally mis-cast, he tries desperately to speak in a manly voice which doesnt fit his boyish face and the long hair look more like Chingatchcook (however you sell that) than John Carter. The tricks are good, but then all CGI is good these days. they tried to mix various books together here and cramped too much into the movie so there's no plot development just a number of scenes strung together.<br />Dejah Thoris is kinda OK but based ont he book she should be way more sexy, but of course this is America and Disney, so sexy is out of the question, but you know what? If you're not willing to commit to the spirit of the book, don't make the film. So the result is: One star for &#34;It's John Carter after all&#34; other than that: Thumbs Down
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun and easy to pick up on. Perfect for the fantasy lover and leisure gamer. I have all much fun breeding my dragons to create new exotic ones!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Tom Sawyer. Is a good book because it tells about a young, troublesome boy like my brother it is awesome. 10 stars it's the best
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm sad to say I waited until he was murdered to finally download this book. We all owe Chris our gratitude for he was truly a brave and courageous &#34;Warrior&#34;. A REAL AMERICAN. This book should be in the home of every American.
B001TODCII|5.0|Pulse pounding action from start to end. A mama bear protecting her cub isn't as ferocious as this retired agent is in this movie. The body count is very impressive and the action is relentless. You'll be drenched in sweat by the end!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|The best movie I ever saw...fantastic story!!!  Heartwarming yet real....shows a true depiction of a great friendship, and how we can impact the lives around us.
1250008409|5.0|What a treat to hear from such an expert that is so generous with his experiences and wisdom.  Many great stories, explanations, and griping animations that you can link into at Andy Puddicombe's website.  Compared to other books I have read about mindfulness/meditation this book takes the mystery away and jumps right into life.  There isn't anything I didn't like about this book.  It's all good!  OK - it ended too quickly.  Is there a volume 2?
1250006341|5.0|Book really helped put things together.  Great reference that will also be there later.  I highly recommend this for anyone who loves the show!!
B0016AJG30|4.0|This is a nice LP if you want 10 of Janis Joplin's  greatest hits, but this album leaves of one important one, Mercedez Benz<br />Even so, it contains: Me and Bobby McGee, Cry baby, Piece of My Heart, Ball and Chain, Summertime, Down on Me and a few others.<br /><br />To get the full Janis Joplin experience, I recommend picking up the individual Big Brother and The Holing Company and Janis solo LPs, as well as the steller double album, In Concert.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This app is a complete calculator app, basic --&#62; programmer and EVERYTHING in between.  It even has RPN capabilities.  Highly recommended.
B005LAII80|4.0|If you're looking for a gritty action flick then look no further. The plot is pretty simple (you can gather most of it just form the trailer): there's a new popular drug in town, Dredd and his trainee must go through all levels of a building to make it to the antagonist, explosions, and roll credits.<br /><br />There's no real character development or in depth plot. As stated, it a pretty simple action flick; explosions and lots of shooting.<br /><br />Based on the comic, I believe it to be a great adaptation. Great visuals and good acting on Karl Urban's part (hey it's hard to express different types of sneers while always wearing a helmet). When watching this movie, just enjoy the ride.
0307352153|5.0|I had read some reviews of the book. It sounded like I could gain some insight from it. I was not disappointed. The author, although admittedly biased, did a great job of presenting evidence and testimony that opened my eyes to why being a thoughtful, quiet person is really a good thing. I opened the book and read my story.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|Great movie!  This was the first time I used your service that allowed me to immediately watch a movie on my computer.  I had no problems.  I probably will purchase this dvd from your site in the future.  Thank you.

B00AHSGNJM|5.0|I like this movie although I do not prefer Ellen as Dori. That personal opinion aside, I feel like Finding Nemo is a good family movie. I have a 3 year old daughter and a 18 month old boy who both enjoy watching what my daughter calls &#34; the scary fish story&#34;. There are some parts we fast forward thru to reduce the chance of nightmares ( i.e. the beginning where the barracuda eats Marlin's wife, the glow fish chasing Marlin and Dori trying to find the mask.).
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|the character, Rebus, just keeps getting more and more interesting. Keeps you involved right until the last page.Hope he'll stick around for a while.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is AMAZING! I could not put down this thriller. The story kept my interest and suspense with plenty of twists and turns, all along with a great storyline. I really enjoyed each chapter alternating between Nick's perspective and Amy's - it even added to the suspense. This is a must read!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Best WWII Movie. It is a bit slow at first but it get interesting. My only issue is that it is a 3 hr movie.
B00BESM14U|2.0|Emma Watson is the only reason I watched this movie and I'm sorry I did. It was so depressing! There's 2 hours of my life that I'm not getting back.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I play this game every day. Since the last update, however, it hasn't been as much. Entire families I had previously purchased have disappeared. I feel like the creators of the game stole from me. My friends keep disappearing, I'm getting goals that are impossible to complete, and I'm being asked to repurchase families. The game is still fun, but not nearly as fun as it used to be. I think it would be good if the families/objects you bought using acorns paid you back in acorns, since those are extremely difficult to come by. Before the last update, I would have given a higher star rating.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not being much of a fan of period dramas, I was suprised to find myself loving the series.  I would have watched it just for Maggie Smith, who has the best and most witty lines, however the other characters are wonderful and make you either hate or love them. Can't wait for next season.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I started to read this book a few weeks ago and found it so boring I had to stop reading it and start a new book. Last night i finished reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34;. The ending was as bad as the body of the book. I cannot understand how this book is on the best seller list for so many weeks.
B008JFUN8C|1.0|I saw this movie on opening night, March 8th, 2013.  Geeeeez !  This was the worst movie I have paid to see in 5-years by FAR !  The acting was just absolutely PATHETIC !!!  The guy who played \\"Oz\\" (James Franco) was absolutely terrible !!  Seriously, do not waste a dime or your time on this flop...I only wish I could have ran through the \\"Poppy Field\\" in order to fall asleep during this yawner !  AUGHHHHH !  JUST SIMPLY HORRIBLE !!  This movie was certainly not made for adults...just small children, at best.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Absolutely and awesome book. It keeps you wanting to keep read tell your done. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|Regarding this particular superb, Super Deluxe Edition, I shied away from this at first, because I haven't owned a turntable in a couple of decades. Just some of the \\"Super Deluxe\\" part of this boxed set is a 7\\" vinyl EP of a rare 1964 live BBC broadcast that's truly fantastic material:<br />1. Route 66<br />2. Cops And Robbers (my very favorite early Stones track!)<br />3. You Better Move On <br />4. Mona<br />So I wondered how the hell to get these four tracks as mp3s. HERE'S THE SOLUTION: I searched the four titles, and the full, original broadcast, identical to the vinyl EP, and almost thirteen minutes long, is on YouTube. Problem solved. Amen. Those songs alone make this version of GRRR! worth every extra cent.<br />Oh, but this being the Super Deluxe Edition, there's more ear candy. A bonus CD of The Rolling Stones' very first recordings, the 1963 IBC live, in-studio demos, namely:<br />1. Diddley Daddy<br />2. Road Runner<br />3. Bright Lights Big City<br />4. Honey What's Wrong<br />5. I Want To Be Loved <br /><br />There's also a h-u-g-e book of rare photos and stories, as well as copies of old tour posters in varying sizes. Of course there's 4 CDs (80 tracks) of hit songs and fan favorites, including two brand-new tracks. FYI: Several of the longer hits, such as, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" are included, but in the shorter, edited-for-hit-radio length. Annoying, but pardonable. Heck, I own the longer versions anyhow on other store-bought Stones' discs, so when I make my own copies of these tunes for my car's CD player, I'll just put in the longer versions myself, and add some songs that didn't make this collection, such as the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" album gem, \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\".<br />All in all, I'm glad this was my birthday present, and I hope you find this info helpful. Anyone who can't figure out how to rip the audio from the four public-domain YouTube video tracks that I mentioned, comment and I'll explain. It's easy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very entertaining. There are a lot of different games to play within the game &amp; challenges.  Automatically upgrades &amp; gets more difficult as you play.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Pretty good story,but it ended too quickly. It also had a Twilight Zone ending, where things aren't explained, but I like that.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game its the absolute best. every one should get it. be careful its addicting.totally wogh the space.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|The summary for this book really intrigued me. For some reason I really like the stalkers type for a book idea. And this book had some really good parts and some I weren't fond  of.<br />The book is about a woman Catherine that falls for a guy, Lee, who turns out to be abusive. 4 years later and now she is trying to make it day to day with a pretty severe case of OCD she developed from Lee. She gets a new neighbor, Stuart, and he begins to help her with the OCD.<br />One of the reasons for me giving 3.5 was that Haynes did get my attention, however, as soon as she had it the chapter was over and it was a new day. Frustrating. Another is I really like Stuart. He was very patient (I know he's a psychologist and that's what he does all day but...) with her and believed her which is what she needed. Something I found completely unbelievable were Catherine's friends. All of them. They knew her for years and she had definitely changed after meeting Lee in a bad way but they never thought Lee was anything but a great guy. Really? Maybe that's my opinion but it really bothered me.<br />Anyway I did think the book was good. Very well written, hardly any errors. The location is in Lancaster and London so the language was a bit difficult at times but interesting as well. As other reviewers said it is very slow moving.<br />Overall a 3.5
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my favorite out all my Kindle Fire games, even though I lose sometimes it does not bother me because I can always play again.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love, love, love! Why don't episodes come out faster, I've been waiting for like 3 weeks now! Please, I'm having withdrawls!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I begin and end everyday with a peaceful session.  You can enjoy the already &#34;mixed&#34; segments or select your own sounds for a unique and personalized experience.  The sound quality and choices are great.  Love the time option.  Highly recommend!
B006OE7XM4|4.0|I must have slept on this cat but he kills. &#34;On my way to Harlem&#34; is an instant classic. The musicians are not big names but they make the entire project feel good. I am a fan for life!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. I think that it looks very different then the first one. It took me a while to get used to the looks of the game. Rather than that I love this game!!!!:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Bekanntes Spielkonzept in einem neuen Erscheinungsbild, Reaktionszeit und Geschick sind gefordert . Macht Spaß und ist ein großartiger Zeitvertreib.<br />5 Sterne von mir.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because it's so realistic and its fun to feed and care for your horse. I just wish the company that makes this would make more realistic free games, maybe caring for another type of animal? I love this game though!!!!!
B000TU16GS|4.0|Awesomely cool books .dhdbxhdjxjxsjfxjjenjj /  j j b h h b b b b b b b b b b n v
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book I love diary of a wimpy kid I chose this rating because I thought it was a good book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I liked the concept Of this game.  Having to do additional steps when searching for pictures for hidden items makes it much more interesting and difficult.  I like being able to choose the difficulty level based on my mood.  Great graphics
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down. I finished this book fast and went right on to the last book. I can not wait to see what happens.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Wasn't sure how this would work on my Fire, but have become addicted!  Have minimal space in my home to work jigsaw puzzles &quot;for real&quot; plus have arthritic hands.  Using a stylus with this app has been a real gift for me :)  Now am able to again enjoy an old favorite passtime!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Thought it was a great season 7.<br /><br />Loved the Hannah character.<br /><br />Dexter is definitely one of my favorite TV shows of all time.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Great scripts, awesome production design, and phenomenal acting.  I would've given it 5 stars except I'm starting to see some of the 'cheap' plot tricks found in US soap operas from the 1980s are bleeding into the overall storyline.  I'm more interested in the subplots that illustrate how the various historical events shake the societal norms of the day.
0374533571|5.0|Before writing this, I checked out the one and two star reviews. I just don't get it. Silver Linings Playbook is a work of art. The poignancy of Pat Peoples' belief in a silver lining despite all the odds against it is heartbreaking.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Trust me do not get either thing false advertising your not able to type or write anything it was a huge disappointment because I was going to use them to write a midterm essay an was not able to do so with this app
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show! Slow pace but intriguing story lines. Many of my friends had recommended it-- once I started watching, each episode drew me in so that I wanted to watch the next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is awesome but know that it takes a looooong time to load and does not respond to your touch but it is way better than the old temple run
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|Did not see it in the theatre.  Love to see any computer animated movie especially as an artist and for the little boy in me I like to endulge still.  I was also a big fan of arcades when they were around.  Visually, this movie is great.  You can even appreciate the little tug at your heart it does (however, not til half way through the movie).  Disney over hyped the references to all the other video game characters in the movie who you only really got to see in the very beginning and some only had their names mentioned.  They made it seem like this was going to be like an all-star cast film of video game characters with Ralph being the star.  Not.  Ultimately, the overshadowing aspect that lets you down is the story/script.  This is the first computer animated movie that I sat quietly the whole time.  It made me smile but not laugh.  Children will love this movie but I feel this one lacks the humor that will have adults lol as well.  Even MOST of the story takes place in a game world that looks like the old school board game Candyland.  The visual details are what stood out the most for me in this one.  This is not a bad movie.  It is a great concept that could have and should have been a better story both the children and the adults could have loved.  Max potential not reached.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the entire thing.  Would read again.<br />First Nicholas sparks novel that I read, but fast becoming a favorite author.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Quality TV drama with excellent characters, beautiful scenery, and a peek into a sliver of life shared by only the elite.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love a challenging game. This game is so addictive. I can't manage to play any others because I'm trying to beat this one. Everyone should try it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The use of a youthful idealist protagonist from another culture to &#34;out source&#34; aging to a decrepit hotel in India was a wonderful twist. The characters were well-acted and chosen, for that matter, and the cast was simply outstanding with Judy Dench and Maggie Smith leading the way.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Living and working overseas makes it hard to enjoy radio and podcasts easily. This app does it all. The record feature is the best!
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Great musician, great album! Lungs by Florence and the Machine is a great album from first to last track. Her voice is beautifully haunting.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I love the hunger games its a really good book. I recommend this to every one that like action books.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Happy to have finally read it! I remember my parents reading it when I was a kid and now I've close the loop!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One man's struggle against a hostile environment and unbelievable odds, equipped with his scientific knowledge, and his sense of humor, he meeets one challenge after another.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Worked well on my kindle H.D. fire.  You have to really think through this mystery. Took me a few hours each day for a few days to complete. Worth the cost for stimulating entertainment. Look forward to the next one.
1606865617|5.0|I love this book - it's one of my all time favourites. I often come back it it and read parts of it again, particularly the last chapter. It is so sad and beautiful and very haunting. One of my top 5 books ever. I love novels set in India and this is the very best one I have read.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a really good James Bond movie. On our TV with a Samsung sound bar it was almost as good as being in the theater. Blu-ray is something else! I recommend this movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|engaging, suspense-driven, and overall an enjoyable experience! We ordered it online around midnight and were not only able to watch it that night, but finish it the next day due to the 48hr rental policy.
B00A1C17EK|5.0|I have seen a number of productions of Henry V, and the performance that is part of this series is perhaps the best I have seen on DVD.  It conveys the sense of honor and patriotism that motivates the English, without falling into the jingoism that seems to infect so many recent productions.  The Richard II is great as well.  Here's hoping this excellent British series finds its way to our shores in an easy to access format.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Good mix of old and new tech. Both of the main character are enjoyable to watch also the inspector is good for the part.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A great read for understanding the science of habits and human behavior. This book was inspiring for how I can develop good working habits
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I really couldn't put it down.  The characters felt human and the premise not too far-fetched.  It felt like reading an amazingly wonderful dream, and the worst part was waking up at the end and realizing that the world we live in was not the one described in this book.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What an amazing voice!  He is such an consistent artist.  So smooth and passionate. What a wonderful experience every time.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|It is a fun and entertaining game....following the prompts was easy....not a very challenging game...finished this game in record time
B00AREIAI8|4.0|not bad for a free game, and I'm sure ill be interested in playing it for about a week at least. don't be fooled by all the reviews.... you have to review to get gems.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is my Favorite Sparks book yet. Interesting character writing, and a good story. I would definitely recommend this read.  I also enjoyed the way he wrote the Kevin character. It was an Interesting peek into an alcoholics brain.
B001EN71CW|5.0|AS so many have said--umpteen hours of pure enjoyment...a lifetime of withdrawal. This series is incredible with its snappy/witty dialogue and the memorable characters.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not as crude as I thought it was gonna be...but was a read that took me me aback on some of the descriptive parts. I enjoyed the book read it faster than I realized....and can't wait to get should of book two!!!!!!! I love the slight hint of Grey's transformation to a better place...I just can't wait to read more!!!!!!
B004HAEGP4|5.0|I enjoyed it, good graphics, running around shooting stuff and well made monsters.  Amazing the plot could be further developed
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cute game but i dont like that you have to use social media for some of their missions.  also, the guidance could be improved.
0679805273|5.0|I seem to appreciate this book more and more the older that I get.  Kids enjoy the silly pictures and I enjoy the ideas it presents.
1843913720|1.0|Persevered through 40%of this book as chosen by book club. I really can't bear any more. Silly drivel. No sympathy with characters, lack of credulity in plot. Whilst I realise this book is not intended to be taken seriously, The humour failed for me.
0792163710|5.0|Some of the acting is hokey, but still a good story and over all good movie... if you like westerns.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Shindler's List is not for the faint of heart yet it is a movie everyone should see.  Whether Mr. Speilburg makes a commentary on his work or not doesn't make any difference to me.  What he has done is tell a story of one man who although a scoundrel in his ways, was a man who was not afraid of his inner heart.  A man who with the world around him standing by watching people being murdered, people being shipped off to be murdered, was brave enough to do all he possibly could to save human lives.  A real hero, if I may say.  The film is graphic certainly but it is truthfully graphic...the way it should be.  Openly honest.  Sadly there are still people who claim the Holocaust never happened.  How or why they can say that is beyond me.  Millions died...because they were Jewish...or Russian...or Polish...or Gypsies...of French....or Dutch....or Hungarian....yet non beleivers still say it never happened.  I see a little child in a red coat walking along among the crowds being forced to their deaths and know it happened...over and over again.  This movie is a masterpiece of epic proportions!  Thank you Mr. Spielburg and all the actors who worked on this greatest story ever told!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|If you download anything to read on your device, you will likely end up needing to download a PDF reader - you need this.
B00846REIS|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I was skeptical and hesitant to purchase. I had alread read and completed the 50 shades trilogy and I didn't want to read a book that was exactly like it. I had read the reviews and a lot of people were comparing this book to 50 shades. I bought it anyway.<br /><br />After reading the first couple of pages I was hooked. You can definately see similarities between this book and 50 shades but Bared to You is so much better. This book makes sense. The story line is much more believable and the relationship seems like they would actually be together. Bared to You does have some comparable scenes with 50 shades but this book is much better written and a better story line.<br /><br />Gideon and Christian are both controlling however Eva and Ana vary greatly.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and hooks you from the very beginning. I stayed up reading this book all night because I wanted to know how it finished. I have read the second book and I cannot wait for the third (and more than likely a fourth novel). Although this book is about the two's \\"obsession and possession\\" it's a love story where the two of them complete the other and they help each other work through their problems and their past that made them who they are today.<br /><br />All in all, I LOVED this book. I have already recommended this book to many people and will keep recommending it.
B000GOY3I0|5.0|Its entertaining and a lot better than some of the cartoon/ \\"children\\" movies that are made these days.  I would recommend this.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I got this to record some skate videos and to get some video while cruising on my board.<br /><br />I was surprised by the size. Its big enough to use with pretty much any camera. Its very light weight and the soft grip handle feels very comfortable in your hand.<br /><br /> It has a hotshoe attachment on top to add on any extras you might need such as lights or mic. You can also rmove it if you need to.<br /><br />The screw mount on the bottom snugs your camera on very well. The knob is easy to grip and has a metal threaded socket in it. You can attach this whole rig onto. Tripod if need be. The threaded piece that screws into your camera works well and will not slip out of the rig when not in use.<br /><br />You can however get it out in case you ever need to replace/remove it. It also has many positions on the base plate so that you can securely get your specific camera onto it wherever your screw mount may be.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I was hoping for a fun and scary game and all I got was a game where you wander around aimlessly and some dude just randomly shows up. I don't understand what's scary about it... I'm just glad the game was free. If you are paying I would stay away.
B001AGDI7U|5.0|Scarpa comoda e molto bella da indossare, un prodotto che cosiglio a chiunque, un po' grande il numero che ho scelto, ma del resto tutto ok!
B00AYJBT66|5.0|While this is my least favorite JHE album the re-release is top notch. Sound was perfect and the gate fold cover was great.
B008XG1X18|1.0|it wont let me sign in or even register.  It allowed it once and now it wont.  But that is OK because the time I was able to get in I didn't find the information that useful.
B00AA0U046|4.0|I have this on double vinyl. For most part it sounds good. Heavy on blues numbers and few if any overdubs. I like this much better than the stuff on First Rays disc because the First Rays(like Ladyland) had a lot of overdubs and was going in a more jazz sound.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it too fun<br />you can do everything in this game and the horse is super cute no problems so fat
B003JTHXOK|2.0|All I've heard is that she didn't like it. It was the February selection of her book club bu, unfortunately, the general consensus seems to have been negative. Keep in mind that, in general, most of the group aren't into romance novels.
B000001FY5|5.0|Every single song is five stars plus with the song Exodus being the best and possibly the greatest reggae song ever recorded. Enough said...
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Just watched the first episode of this show on a whim the other day, and now I am hooked! I am almost finished with season 1 and will definitely continue to watch. It is definitely enjoyable.
B000B8QG22|3.0|Movie contains great comedy and drama, almost at the same time.  A realistic depiction of what Nam was REALLY like.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book... until I got to the ending haha. The story was good and I was pretty hooked, I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen. I'm pretty sure one of the major &#34;twists&#34; in the story literally made me gasp out loud. So the read was really enjoyable, but the ending of the book disappointed me. I guess it's because the book didn't end the way I wanted it to end, but I've realized that this is really part of reading, you may not always agree with the authors decisions and directions. So I'm glad I gave this book a try, it was a very entertaining read.
B00871C09S|5.0|A very rare movie in that the entire movie is filmed in just two locations.  The apartment room plus the outside apartment complex's garden area.
0062238868|5.0|I ordered it for my son. He loved the book! So sorry Mr. Kyle is no longer alive. Such a tragedy! My heart goes out to his family.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is the best building game ever. There is nothing better since Sims. I recommended this game for everyone. It is very simple to get started and keep going.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This was a fantastic movie and the CD is just as good.  I would recommend it to anyone especially if you like Christine.
B0029QDFO6|5.0|This Army of Darkness DVD from Hong Kong is the director's cut-and more. All the footage looks great, not most, but all. All the scenes that looked murky are now clear as day, and the soundtrack(which is in English without burned-in subtitles) is also the best AOD soundtrack there is. The reason the picture quality is so far ahead of all previous director's cuts is because the master was a 35mm film negative, not a VHS tape, which the Anchor Bay DVDs had to utilize.  Another thing to take note of, the video quality is also dramatically better than the THX theatrical cut.<br /><br />Elsewhere online you may read that this version is exactly the same as the other versions, save for a short 2 second scene between Shelia and Bad Ash, but another difference is that this version includes the shot of good Ash leveling the chainsaw down towards Bad Ash(who is tied up) before the shot of Bad Ash crying out in the windmill. For whatever reason, the Anchor Bay versions (at least on DVD) omit that shot and instead go straight to Bad Ash yelling with the previous shot being Ash raising the chainsaw in the air.  I have read that some American Universal VHS tapes of the director's cut does in fact include that chainsaw shot, and I don't doubt it.<br /><br />For those of you AOD fans, you need to get this version; just be sure you own a region-free DVD player or a region 3 player since this version is on a region 3 disc, so it will *not* play in any American DVD player. Other options exist too.<br /><br />I am so happy to finally see clearly everything that is going on in the 96 minute version. [note the DVD and package erroneously states that it is 93 minutes, but worry not, fellow screwheads)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|As all Adele music this is a very good CD.  I would recommend it to anyone that like her music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than Temple Run and Temple Run 2. This game is awesome. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|My son was so excited to get this Lego set  but found that 30 corner pieces were missing from the kit.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app. I can choose any songs from my music to use as an alarm and can set multiple alarms. It also lets you choose which days to have the alarm, so I never have to try to remember to turn my alarm on on Sunday night, it does it automatically. I also like that you can write a note with each alarm too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.  it works really well. It even tells me how long I can play games or read before it dies.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|Super smooth, 80's Miami nights or aimless Brooklyn musings. It's nice, buy and ride and study and listen to yourself.
B009O2XY12|3.0|its an ok game but its a little hard to get the 3 star rating so I don't.like that and its not great but its just ok
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I think everyone knows about this movie. It's a classic Disney movie. The transition to bluray was done very well. I like the intermission (pause) feature so if you have to pause the movie other children will have something to keep their attention. Whether or not you have kids you should get this movie simply because of the vault. This movie will perpetually be out so you will want to get it before they lock it away again.
B001HBWY8M|4.0|A good watch for the teens and girls. Everyone else might be able to watch it although not great. Hope this helps.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|One of the better drama series you can watch.  The character development is outstanding.  Once you start though, you will not be able to stop.
0525953728|4.0|As key participant in raid that resulted in Bin Laden's end, Owen's book is absorbing.  Predictable preliminaries describing intensity of Seals' general training may be of interest to those who have not read similar accounts, but seems an overly long filler.  The description of the raid per se is fascinating and demonstrates the amazing professionalism, adaptability, and discipline of these exceptionally trained teams.  Although this raid was special, most impressive is that they had experienced similar assignments almost as routine - so that this was not especially remarkable to them! I was an Army D.I. in WWII, but these Seals'courage, coolness, competence arouses deepest admiration and pride in us all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book so touches the heart in so many ways, in spite of the horrors...and proves how God makes good out of evil...
0446554995|5.0|Have thoroughly enjoyed all of Preston and Child's individual and collaborative, absorbing, intricately plotted novels so would quickly recommend all.  Pendergast typically cool, detached, superhuman in elusiveness, insight, resourcefulness and survivability.  Have never been disappointed in either/both of these authors as they continue to maintain expected quality, novel settings, suspense.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|Sherlock Holmes seems to be forever popular and has had many incarnations.  For Holmes fans this series provides a different take with an eccentric and flawed Holmes and a pretty feminine Watson.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I am just starting to take my photography more seriously and have started to acumulate more gear because of it.  This pack is perfect.  It holds a lot of gear! I also have shot gun mics and such for recording HD video when I feel like it.  The pack is comfortable to wear.  I have gone on hikes with it and so far its holding up well.  The inside has some water proof pouches which I thought was a nice touch.  The only thing I'm on the fence about is the extra straps its has.  It has a padded waist strap and a cross chest strap that I find pointless.  I could see the chest strap possible by there is no reason I would ever need a waist strap with this pack.  It is slightly smaller then a regular size back pack.  There is no frame internal or external which basically makes the waist strap useless. Plus I cant imagine having that heavy of gear that I would be having in this small pack for any long period of time.  I have large framed packs for that...<br /><br />Overall I would recomend it to the beginer or intermediate level photographer/videographer on a budget.  You will get great use out of it for a long time i'm sure.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Seriously, how hard CAN it be to update and put these in?!? The whole reason I even got this for my tablet was because my favorite thing to do in the evenings is to sit and play vasebreaker endless on my phone or my computer. I thought, Yay, I can play it on my tablet now! WRONG!! Seriously, this is a disgusting lack of caring what we customers and players want or think. I hope the updates come sometime SOON! Until then, I would give it ZERO stars. Way to fail and drop the ball on this one, PopCap. My faith in you has gone WAY DOWN! EPIC FAIL.
B009AMAJVO|2.0|Produced by WWE Studios and directed by Niels Arden Oplev (The `original' Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Dead Man Down stars Colin Farrell as Victor, an up-and-coming member of the mob that secretly infiltrates the organization for one specific reason:  revenge on its leader, Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard).  While implementing his master plan, Victor is approached by Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), a recent car accident victim with scars on her face, who is also seeking revenge against the random drunk driver that caused her car accident.  Now, Victor must balance executing his master plan with helping Beatice with her revenge - all while trying to keep his mobster friend, Darcy (Dominic Cooper) from uncovering his plot.  Isabelle Huppert, F. Murray Abraham, and WWE superstar, Wade Barrett, also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Even though this is Colin Farrell's best film in the last few years, that's not really all that great of a compliment - it's more of a knock on the poor roles he's been taking, including the leading spot in Seven Psychopaths and the Total Recall remake.  In his role as Victor, Farrell plays the silent assassin, making for very few lines - but it works out well as he does the majority of his talking with his eyes and guns.  The serious tone of this character is very similar to the roles Farrell portrayed in S.W.A.T and The Recruit, which are just a few of the most notable roles in his career.  And, while this role in Dead Man Down is silently entertaining, at some point Farrell needs to start attempting roles that are far more interesting and complex.  Obviously, Farrell has leading-man power behind him, but he continues to limit his potential by not stepping outside his comfort zone as an actor.<br /><br />Dead Man Down is a relatively uneventful plot in the realm of trying new things.  The act of revenge by the main character has been the basis of a film more times than anyone can count - not to mention adding in the supporting actress character trying to push him towards redemption.  Films of this nature need to have a strong villain to help drive the hero, but this story provides a weak, aloof villain with Dominic Cooper.  After discovering the hero's reason for revenge, this film is instantly comparable to The Punisher films/comic book character, and while The Punisher itself was by no means a memorable film (any of its renditions), Colin Farrell's character still solidifies itself as a proverbial knockoff.<br /><br />Overall, Dead Man Down is a film that lacks originality - but it won't completely deprive viewers of entertainment.  There is just enough action and interest spread throughout the sloppy plot to earn itself the `action' label.  At the end of the day, what more would you expect from a WWE Production that typically features John Cena as the main attraction?<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C-<br />FNDNreview.comr trying to push him towards redemption.

B00488SU02|5.0|Enjoyed the movie since it was for a chocolate project.  Had seen it before but now was able to see it unde a different light.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. Unlike a lot of other games, this games gives you multiple things to do. My favorite part is the competitions=)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started this book and realized it was about high school kids I was disappointed but kept reading. The story was so much more than I thought it was. Beautifuly written and really f touched my heart. The connection between the two main charactors was amazing!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Great book. Better than the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a good \\"faith and love\\" story.
B0002XDODU|4.0|This is something I would not normally purchase or be interested in yet it is a welcome diversion of German music, not what I expected.  GP
B009EAALII|4.0|Only comment is, 't would be nice if the running time was approx 1h30m.<br />Now it over before you know.<br /><br />Thanks Chris and band for the nice performance.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy just keeps getting better and better.  Had my doubts at first, but so far so good.  Can't wait for the last book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting, and I honestly think it is way better than Temple Run! The amazing and vivid colors, the fact that you don't have to steer with motion, and the different effects are great. Also the missions make people want to play it more! ALL 5 STARS!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was not sure when I first started reading this, but kept going.  It has turned out good.  Hope the next one is as entertaining.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting story line, but a bit plodding at times. Plus the Irish accent makes it a more challenging to read. But overall I liked the book and recommend it. Free via Amazon Prime on Kindle!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote in all my devices (cell phone,tablet,PC) and very satisfied with it. It helps me to remember all my thoughts and webpages that i use.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Although the movie left out quite a bit, I still enjoyed it.  I loved the way the author mixed fact with fiction.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Great game me and my kids loved it. Easy puzzles but hard to find hidden objects. Didn't last long enough though
B009VB97EY|4.0|I watched this movie of in honor of my friend Patti who passed away last year.  One of our last conversations was about having a girl's night out to go see this movie.  Although we never made it to the theater to see it, I watched at home and though about how much she would have loved to see Matthew McConaughey dancing dirty.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a game that is always enjoyable to play. I have tried others and they are hard and stiff to use. This game flows on the screen. Also it is simple to get from one game to the next. You don't have to sign on again for each hand. I'll stick with the best.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Oh come on, how do you rate Nathan...er...Richard Castle?  I considered it a fun read, if you can call a mystery &#34;fun&#34;.
1743117094|1.0|Let me start by saying I very rarely will give a book a one star rating. It is unusual that I will make it through a whole book without finding a redeeming quality for it. I had to read this book as part of a book club and was pleased as a) I've heard a lot of noise about Kate Morton b) I've been wanting to read more Aussie literature. Unfortunately I very much disliked this book. I found the language and literary techniques to be contrived and immature. Morton loves her similes within similes and metaphors galore in needless places. I struggled to believe the protagonist was a real person/lived in the UK or was even worth reading about. I found all of the characters to be weak but with horribly cliched 'hidden' qualities about them to make you either like them or dislike them but I found all of this so unconvincing I just disliked the whole book. I am surprised that, in reading the reviews, people felt so grabbed by Dolly's story and then so shocked and pleased with the ending. I genuinely spent the whole book waiting for 'the hook' that never came.<br /><br />Others have commented about Morton's superfluous use of words and scene setting. I completely agree. I felt although she had been given a word count and was desperately padding thought the book to reach that goal. The amount of times we would be reading about Dolly's thoughts, then she would verbalise the thoughts and then we would shoot to another person's perspective who would be either thinking or discussing Dolly's thoughts for the third time was staggering and unnecessary. A disappointment for me-I feel like I've really missed out as I am,most definitely, in the minority having read reviews here and on Good Reads. No more Kate Morton for me.
B005HSL626|5.0|fruit ninjas is so fun. keeps u entertained for hours on end. very addicting something you just don't want to put down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is a fun game for almost everyonei love it cause its really funny even my mom loves it
B001BANK32|5.0|I first read \\"The Shining\\" in 1977 and I don't know how many times I have read it since then. I consider it to be one of Stephen King's best books and just reread it again because I heard King is finally publishing a sequel to Danny's story called [[ASIN:B00A6CCF0K Doctor Sleep]] due out in September 2013. I can hardly wait.<br /><br />This tale of the Torrance family, especially Danny with \\"the shine,\\" the Overlook Hotel, and Halloran, the cook, is a masterpiece of horror. I consider \\"The Shining\\" and [[ASIN:B002SR2PKG It]] two of the scariest books I've ever read. I think this is because not only because of the supernatural horror aspects of both books but also the human elements that contribute to the horror.<br /><br />I also love both versions of the movie made about this book - the well-known movie with Jack Nicholson, scary but not following the book very well - [[ASIN:B002VWNIDG The Shining]], and the mini-series that was faithful to the book - [[ASIN:B000077VRT Stephen King's The Shining  (Two Disc Special Edition)]].<br /><br />If you have never read this book and love horror, you owe it to yourself to read it. If you've read it before, read it again to reacquaint yourself with the great story and characters before the sequel comes out.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Big fan of this group especially Adam.  He can call me from a pay phone anytime.  Love the show the voice!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|The premise of this trilogy is love. Fighting to choose love.  In Delirium and Pandemonium, one could feel that emotion as you read. You fell in love with these characters. You were hoping and cheering for Lena, Alex, Hana, Raven and even Julian. Even though the characters in Pandemonium were part of the resistance, the writing never lost the undercurrent of emotional ties between these characters. This is were Requiem fell flat. There was so much about the rebellion and no emphasis on \\"love\\" or even friendship. I didn't feel a connection between the characters and in the end didnt really care about any of them.<br /><br />The end was the worst. From the beginning, Lena and Alex love story symbolized what was wrong with society. Love was worth the fight, but in the end it didn't seem like love won. Sad.<br /><br />There were absolutely no loose end tied up and by the end I had more questions than I started with. I felt there was no closure or resolution to this story. Requiem would have been an excellent addition to the Delirium trilogy if it was the book that came before the final book. Apparently there is no final book on the horizon. What a sad  ending to one of the most promising trilogies out today.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|I liked the restoration and biblical message. Christians today should see how hard it was back in the early church compared to today
B004Q9T4E4|4.0|No matter what one might think of Niall Ferguson as a person or the ideology he displays, this book is a scholarly work which mostly refrains from drawing conclusons from the historical facts but rather lets the facts speak for themselves.The book traces the history of the evolution of economics in a highly accessible and entertaining way and makes a very valuable cotribution towards understanding our current global situation by tracing the history of the development of civilizations since man stopped being a hunter-gatherer. no matter what ideological system one comes from , one owes it to ones self to read this book if one's knowledge of history and /or economics is scant and superficial. Anyone interested in extending ones knowledge about what makes our human world tick should put aside their prejudices and they will find be surprised to find the book highly rewarding.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I bought this book because I want to see the movie and I always like to read the book first. I was so surprized at how good it was. I have a nephew with mental illness and if also gave me that much needed insight into his world. I will be sharing this book with my fellow kindle lovers even ones that I thought would not care for it. Just can't say enough good things about this book.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was a fine film, but its appeal for the Academy had to be because it was a film about film making essentially.
B00821PCJS|5.0|My wife and I are glued to every episode. The human drama written into the storyline is captivating, emotional and believable. We haven't found a TV series worth following until now.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|i rented this movie from NetFlix, then i bought the DVD, then I bought the BluRay version... it's one of those movies. you can watch it again and again and still find nuances and details you missed because you were too busy laughing at the broader elements. The cast is so perfect, each actor delivering a well crafted persona. make sure you watch the special features to help you appreciate every aspect of the development. All the elements come together to produce a special movie.
0307390349|4.0|These are great well crafted tales. I am only half way through this book, but so far my favorite is a story called FREE RADICALS. It was hard to put down.<br /><br />This is my first introduction to Alice Munro's work. Each story is so different from the story that came before. When I start a new one I simply don't know what to expect.<br /><br /> Any reader who is into short stories will probably appreciate her work as much as I do.  S.Laurent
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Sorry but predictable. Won't be bothering with the next two books in the series  why do I have to write so many words Amazon?
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book. It was original, exciting and I could not put it down. This is my first book by this author and I enjoyed it so much that I have gone on to read several others.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|good game but again, grammatical errors in the text. more than should be there. and as usual not enough game play to determine sufficiant quality of the game.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The game is fun but I wish there was a story mode. I probably would not play this game before I go to bed.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love English history and was very excited about this series when it came out.  I enjoyed the shows so much that I bought the compete series when it became available.  It's not completely historically accurate, but it is probably the closest form of historical entertainment outside of a History Channel special.  The cinematography is exceptional and the writers of the series did a great job of building complexity in the characters.  The actors, of course, rose to the challenge and played their parts very well.  There were times I hated some of the characters, and other times I felt sorry for their circumstances, and you can only feel that personal emotional attachment if the actor has done the job perfectly of portraying their character. The set and costume design is superb and portrays an accurate reflection of the historical period (someone really did their homework).  A word of caution: there is a lot of adult content (nudity and sex scenes) in this series and it is not recommended for children, or at least not without parental guidance.  Overall, the series is very well done and if you enjoy movies that tie into history you'll probably enjoy this The Tudors.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down and came back to it as often as I could - I really really liked this book
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This foreign-produced film is overdubbed in English but it doesn't take away from the story.  It's a beautiful story about how Santa Clause came to be.  The focus of the story is the humanity and loss in one individual's life that drove him to love and kindness despite the somewhat unfair challenges he experiences.  The plot of the movie starts with the boy who lost his family one winter and subsequently came under the protection of the nearby villagers and finally under the care of a loner who was a carpenter.  Through the boy's experiences with the villagers and his caretaker (the carpenter) he becomes the individual we know as Santa Claus.  The additional material on the DVD describes the difficulty in making this movie in the elements to give it realism and is definitely worth watching as well. If you're looking for a good family-oriented flick to get you in the Christmas Spirit, then I highly recommend this one with a big bowl of popcorn.
B005COO1X6|2.0|too short and not my favorite Stephen King novel by far.  It was not a book I would recommend to Stephen King fans
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|Got this to protect my iPhone...does that very well...still a little loose on the fit, but still serves the purpose.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Have not had read the other books as yet.... will let you know after doing so. Thank you for your good service ;  love the Kindle books..
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|I love this movie.  The only problem I had was with the streaming video function.  I doubt I will ever buy an online version of a movie again.  DVD's are better.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|fun for kids..<br />time pass and also enhances skills<br />a f f f f f f f f f f
B009ME47H2|5.0|I dont do surveys.  This product works as advertised. - - - - - - - - - - -
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Need more....great read but would love a book 2. So realistic of today. Would like to see how the work thru happens.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I have always like to listen to Train but this is one of their best yet. I really like the crossover with Ashley Monroe.  Everyone needs to have this CD in their collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like temple run 1 and 2 but better instead of having the same setting every time you play.  On subways surfers they have a world tour the setting changes every few weeks
B00B2DSK06|2.0|Usually Disney movies are great to watch for both adults and kids, however, we found this movie was cute, but very childish. The movie starts off very slow, too. Definitely do not recommend unless you've exhausted all of the adult movies on amazon instant videos...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a VERY fun game. I like the deals they offer. It is also creative the way they theme the game to different holidays.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This Sweeper is so light and it moves effortlessly around the floor.  It is perfect for when I need to get up dust and cat hair on my laminate floor.  I couldn't be more happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how they change the theme and but i would like it better if the prices wernt so high i think subways surfers is the best
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book keeps me wanting to read more. Look forward to the next day when I can pick up my kindle and read on.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a good game idea. In fact I give it a ten out of ten. I also recommend it to any gamer even those who are not interested in hidden object games.
B00BHMF578|3.0|One of the few triumphs of the Carter administration, Argo portrays the CIA's retrieval of a few American embassy personnel that escaped to the Canadian embassy during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. In my opinion Affleck's directing is far above his acting in his ability to present an compelling story over a feature length time span. However, audience investment in character is lacking and we are left with a simple suspense drama, albeit entertaining but not at all worthy of an Oscar. Argo is definitely worth watching but not worth adding to a feature film library.
B0061S0A64|5.0|A really good app, allows to make a lot of cool sounds and the possibilities are endless. But the only problem I have is that I like to record the music sometimes, and when I do, I can't find where the music was put. If someone knows where it is please tell me.
0143036424|5.0|Loved this story, easy read and I like the TV show also. Will probably buy more Longmire mysteries. Looking forward to more adventure with Walt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of the best horse games ever, this game has great graphics and keeps my niece busy when i am babysitting her she loves this game
0307352153|4.0|Introversion seems to be a much-misunderstood and underrated character trait in modern American culture. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain seeks to shed light on the value of the most overlooked one-third of our population known as introverts. Quiet is divided into four parts: in the first, Cain describes how America in the 20th century came to view extroversion as the ideal personality and how this has pushed many an introvert into a lifestyle not ideally suited for them. The second analyzes the roles of biology and environment in the creation of the introverted personality type. Part Three looks to Asian culture and asks the question, Does every culture have an Extrovert Ideal? And finally in Part Four, Quiet wraps up by delving into practical advice for living and working as an introvert, or with one.<br /><br />As an introvert myself, I found Quiet very interesting, enlightening and encouraging. There were parts of the book that bogged down with somewhat excessive research data that, in the end, seemed fairly inconclusive. However, this was primarily contained in Part Two, and even still I found it fairly interesting. I especially appreciated Part One and its explanation of America's \\"extrovert ideal\\"-- which is something I have run up against time and again, yet never realized what I was encountering. America's modern preference for extroversion can leave introverts feeling as though there is something \\"wrong with them\\" or that they are \\"anti-social\\", but this is far from true. Quiet explores what society would look like if there were no introverts and, conversely, what it would look like if there were only introverts. It turns out that both introversion and extroversion are needed for a healthy society, and therefore, both should be esteemed.<br /><br />Susan Cain claims to be an introvert herself, and this comes across very clearly in Quiet. Because of this, her book certainly comes from a biased perspective, butone I think most introverts will appreciate and find refreshing. Living in a culture that constantly shows preference to extroverts, Quiet becomes a source of validation and recognition for those who feel out-of-place in our \\"world that can't stop talking\\".<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was an interesting story but the ending was confusing and I'm still not sure I understand it. I wish that had been more explanation on Charlie and why he acted the way that he did.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I have enjoyed this game very much. It is so fun to play and the 3D is really fun.<br /><br />Thank You!<br />Selena
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is really fun! I really enjoyed it. I didn't want to stop playing. I would advise<br />getting this game. Draw a stick man epic!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. I like playing this game. It is alot of fun.<br /><br />Thank You!<br />Selena Gregory
160774273X|5.0|Great book without the traditional 'bakers snobbery.' Ken Forkish inspired me to try and bake artisan bread. His story, like so many others who are fed up with the Corporate rate race yields hope for others to follow the path that call them.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|a lot of odd characters but not over acted as I thought it would be.  a good watch for a lazy night
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Well written book on a controversial subject.  This book gives one food for thought especially since NDE's seem to be receiving much more attention as of late.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I have never been a fan of 007 movies but the trailers on this one looked liked it might be better than usual. It was
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|That was fast. Thank you. Eric is still the wonderful smartass that I remembered (Invitation To The Whie House will have you rolling).
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!! It is a lot of fun. When u play free games it freezes too much!! Lost 4 of my 5 free games due to it freezing!! Really aggravating!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like all the games. they are fun but hard to beat. good game to play in the car.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|This was great, very lifelike, enjoyed it on a new 3D TV..  Would definetly recommend this to enjoy with the family.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Has suspense - waiting for the bad guy to appear.  A nice romance.<br />Some family problems and fun. Kept me reading .
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a great movie for watching on a 3 D TV,  the colors are brilliant and the 3 D effect is perfect.
B00A9C3RNQ|2.0|Honestly, it will inspire married couple if you are in begining struggling level and might cause you to consider abt see cousler. But it is a slow and boring to others that they don't want listen to theitv stories abt why and how they don't get to reach intmacy level. They just don't have patience for the long story , so dont blame them. I don't have patience either. I don't like it when counscleor was asking them a lot of detailed sexual questions, I was thinking it is a way too much! TOO MUCH INFRO! It also make me uncomfortable 'cuz it reminds me of my own parents. Not that they have struggling or problems.. it is just that they are same age and been married almost same years as them so I am not comfortable to see ppl like them having sex. I try to be respect and turn off.<br /><br />WHO KNOWS? everyone has different opinions!
0062082353|5.0|great book. Keeps you interested, and makes you feel like your in the action. Hard to put it down, once it is started.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun yet stupid game. Dunno why I like it. Makes the time pass. The tasks could take less time but that's okay.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|This was another awesome book by Janet Evanovich. I recommend the hole series. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|well I think that this game is awesome because it has almost all the animals in the world and I love animals every single kind of animal even gray wolf's and Bengal tigers!:);)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The political intrigue and attention to detail in this book are as good as it gets. Martin is a master of suspense and twists!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I quite like this game, it's fun and you can do lots of different things which makes it interesting. I like that the challenges come up regularly so you won't get bored. You can make friends and compete so it's perf for everyone!
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|Not Awesome but very well made and keeps your attention. Look forward to watching season two of this series. Needs to be on Amazon prime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. It is like temple run but way better and awesome. I would highly suggest getting this game
B0014DW3OS|3.0|Well shot. Typical American movie about the mean streets being overcome by the idealistic white kid from the suburbs. I love LA. It doesn't need to be saved. It will save itself.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It is always hard to read of the mistreatment of humanity and the damage it causes.  This is a book of hope, and documents the strength of individuals to overcome.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is a great writer and I didn't want this book to end. Loved it and highly recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Accuracy and timely updating account for the high rating.  The hour by hour, 36 hours, next 10 days, etc., add to the positive evaluation.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I can't say this book was a waste of my time since I did enjoy reading it. I just had a hard time seeing 17 and 18 year old children talking and acting the way of adults. I get that in our society today that our kids grow up way too fast, but it still seems a bit far fetched. The story had a good flow to it. Some parts I felt were a bit drug out and some went by too fast. Overall I did not hate the book, it's just one that I do not think that I will read again.
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't have much to say about this app. The only things that i don't like about it are that it glitches all the time. So when I'm playing it it will freeze and then I die. It ticks me off. But hey its ok.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From start to finish, Hopeless had me entranced!  It is truly one of the best books that I have ever read.  I am one of those readers that usually anticipates what is coming next and figure out the plot and conclusion rather quickly.  However, this book left me shocked more than once.  I love not knowing what is next.  Colleen Hoover did not disappoint me!  She is truly an amazing author that can make you feel for the characters as if they are your dearest friends.  Sky and Holder are so real, that I almost feel like I grew up with them.  I laughed, cried, felt sick to my stomach, ached for the loss of loved ones and truly loved being apart of the story.  I agree with others that have said that this is probably the sexiest first kiss without even being a first kiss ever!  Holder could kiss me any day of the week.  He is the most wonderful hero/male character in the history of characters.  However, he is not perfect and I think that is why we all love him.<br />Without giving anything away, I do have to say that it is a very mature content (and I don't just mean the sexy parts).  Some of the content is disturbing but very real.  This is a &#34;cannot put the book down&#34; kind of read.  If you love real stories then don't hesitate- click &#34;buy&#34; right now!!  You will LOVE it!

B00979CS50|2.0|I Love Neil Young and I have been collecting his recordings since my Teens (1990's). I am tired of listen to these review that praise Neil on this recording. I shared P.Pills with people at work and the told me to turn it off. I Do Not blame them!  Neil Write A Real Song and get a producer! The last album I really loved was Sleeps with Angles but Living with War and Fork in the Road had great moments.  Neil you had one of the best producers in history and you created LE Noise???. Please!!!! Take your time and make a real album.... I'll even take TRANS II
B0049P1VHS|4.0|After many friends derided me for not watching I figured I'd give it a shot.  I really liked this show and the only thing that bums me out is the fact theat they rope you in with a cheap first season followed by a steadily, steeply increasing cost for each progressive sesason.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|It is not like Angels & Demons or The Vinci Code. This book could be shortened to almost half it's size. No real storyline. I will be very sceptic to read another Dan Brown
B005M0R4X4|2.0|One disc did not function correctly.<br />Last episode of the year &#34; Christmas Special&#34; was not included in series 2.<br />We had to buy this separately---only by chance did we even know it existed .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing. Hoover captures young love like no one else I've read. The intensity of this book was fantastic. I tend to steer away from romance novels, though I don't even consider this one to be flagged with that label- it was too real. Loved this book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|At first, I started the game thinking Amazon was crazy for pitting one of those \\"games\\" up. I collected the first few notes, and that's when it all changed my mind. I was actually getting scared just as I did on Slender for PC. Totally recommending it!
1591844096|5.0|Reviewing someone else’s work is not my forte however, I felt the need to pass along a positive note on Seth Godin’s work Linchpin: Are You Indispensable? I have not spent the time to follow Godin’s Blog work as I am not a big blogger but he has made it easy for me to make the attempt. This work is key to understanding yourself worth as it relates to your workplace or, if you have any imagination it relates well to any everyday circumstance. Keep in mind he doesn’t know you from Adam (or Eve) but it seems that he speaks directly to the reader at times. My thoughts - Pick it up and read it! It will not disappoint.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an easy read.  Quick and to the point; a hero's story.  The language is that of a soldier,  sometimes rough and vulgar.  If you want a smooth eloquent work of literature,  look elsewhere.  On the other hand if what you are looking for is a realistic truthful telling of the US war in Iraq,  then this is the book to read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome it have beyond amazing graphics!!! I suggest that everyone should get this game if you LOVE lot of fun and action! And if you know the monkeys the one for temple run 2 Is HUGE!!!!!
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Reminds me of Pepito the Italian mouse. Anyway, this is a great game. It gets you to thinking, tricking the cat and rat to fight each other, so he can get to the cheese.  There is also the dog, get him to fight with the cat and the mouse gets to the cheese.<br />Finally figured out that to get to the 3rd circle you have to take chances in getting close to them and not get caught.<br />The scores are 100,200 and 300. It is difficult sometimes to get the 300.  Had my friend get this game sight unseen and she is happy with it.
B009R6OTI2|5.0|Being able to use the instruction right away on my own library is great. Learning the short cuts most commonly used is an amazing tool even for a beginner like myself.
1452101248|4.0|I bought this book to increase the likelihood of eating vegetables and so far it has worked well. Although a lot of the recipes are not super healthy, they are yummy. They also are not in the 'easy' category in that many of them take a while to make and involve ingredients that you might not just have around your kitchen. But, saying this, I'm glad I bought it and will continue to try to expand my veggie eating habits! I would def recommend it if you are ok with the above issues mentiones.
0307951529|2.0|How do you make a million dollars playing jazz? start out with two million.<br />This is how I felt about the kind of advice in this book. The only reason I gave it two stars is because some of the cases are interesting to read, but I got nothing out of it. Basically, you just need to have an idea and luck. The premise of &#34;100 $ startup&#34; is not supported at all in this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book until the end. Well written. Some of the character development seemed kinda of sketchy or lacking.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great series , I buy the firts and for sure buy the next season , good quality<br />have subtitles in espanol , come on time
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good read but I'm split at the end, or the end is not good enough or I want to read the others book which will certainly keep going on this story.
B004NELBPC|5.0|Like the thread response, the notifications tab really helps to keep dialogue flowing.  The fave/fan option is my personal favorite!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good first person description of some pretty heavy stuff from a hero.  Easy read and basically a &#34;page turner&#34;.<br /><br />My only complaint is that he is a little too cavalier for my liking about taking another person's life. I suppose he had to be to get through the ordeal.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I fell in love with this book! It was worth downloading and it only took me a day to read it! The ending was the best I have ever read! For those of you who want to see the movie I suggest you read the book first as it will ruin the ending! Love this book as I do most of Sparks books!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Lots of great ideas and different things on here!  I just need to learn how to find everything I am looking for!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is an amazamungus brazilliant game to have. The best thing about it is that such a good game is absolutely  100% free!

B005UXJNPU|1.0|I SENT AWAY FOR THIS COLLECTION AND IT WOULD NOT PLAY IN MY DVD PLAYER BECAUSE THESE DVDS ARE NOT REGION 1 AND SO THEY DO NOT PLAY IN ANY AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS.

B0063HBPH6|5.0|I've never read anything quite like it, and I've read it over and over. This book has a cult following, and no wonder. The mixture of Gaiman and Pratchett is irresistible, poking (sometimes cruel) fun at everyone and everything, yet profoundly thought-provoking.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I loved this movie. I have watched it before but this movie came in handy at my job. I would recomend it
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is by far the best Slenderman game I've played on the kindle. I got it for the FAOTD but was going to buy it soon anyway. This is a must have for all you horror and slender fans. My heart was throbbing every single second I played. The controls are good and easy to get used to. You can change your sensitivity if you don't feel comfortable with how fast/slow they move. You can add fog, choose between three difficulties, easy, medium, or hard. I chickened out at first, I played on easy, without any fog but just from my first play through I can already tell I will be endless nights getting the cheap scared out of me and my friends. Also the best part there are two levels, road and forest (not sure about the name of the second) But I highly recommend everybody gets this. I promise you it'll be worth the money!
B000CNFC76|5.0|I  learned more about the history of golf than I expected.  It is a relaxing story to enjoy on a winter evening when it's too cold and dark to go outdoors to play.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I am fairly certain that my expectations for this book were too great. This is one instance where the movie may actually be better than the book.
1439152802|4.0|As a little girl, Laurel witnessed her mother kill a man in cold blood.  The event was quickly covered up, and from that day the child kept her mother’s secret.  But Laurel, knew from that moment her mother Dorothy had a mysterious past.  Switch to the present, where Dorothy lay dying in a hospital.  She begins to mention names from her youth, from World War II London, a past that is unknown to her daughters.  Laurel is reminded of that long ago day when she witnessed the murder and this time, she is determined to find out the truth.<br /><br />Oh, how I enjoyed this book!  It was quite the page turner, with a lot of mystery and a little history thrown in.  Totally terrific!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and has great graphics a also I think it is a good game for great skills and fast thinking
1416550550|3.0|The Forgotten Garden is Kate Morton’s best-selling novel that launched her to stardom in the book world.  I just now got around to reading it, and while it was good, I have to admit I found it a bit disappointing.  Perhaps it’s because it’s been touted so much, but I thought it was more of a rainy day read.<br /><br />The story jumps back and forth between the years 1900, 1975 and 2005 (or thereabouts).  A little girl has been found on a dock in Australia, having disembarked from an ocean liner.  She is alone and the year is 1913.  Morton’s story unravels the mystery of who this little girl is, and how she came to be alone, half a world away from where she was born.<br /><br />Having two Morton novels under my belt, I gather that her books are more about the mystery than the history.  In fact, she doesn’t appear to research very much, and I suppose that is why I felt The Forgotten Garden could have been better.  I also found it difficult to care about the characters.  Mysteries, for me, tend to be that way.  So, if you love mysteries, you will probably really enjoy this book.  It’s an easy read and a fun way to while away an afternoon.  Unfortunately, I pretty much guessed the ending beforehand, so there wasn’t much of an “aha” moment for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a great storyline!  Excellent production values and character development.  I wish more TV studios took their work this seriously!
0385341008|3.0|Set in London and the Island of Guernsey in 1946, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a novel of narrative fiction, told via letters between a female author, her publisher, girlfriend, and several members of a book club established on the island of Guernsey during the German occupation.<br /><br />I was intrigued by this book because there isn’t much out there having to do with the subject of Channel Island occupation.  This book was enjoyable and easy to read.  It reminded me of apple pie.  It’s simple, tasty and easy to digest.  But it doesn’t wow you the way a dessert with intricate layers might.<br /><br />I had read one book and seen one movie on the subject already.  This novel did not present anything new that was not already addressed in my former explorations.  That was disappointing for a history lover like me.  Also, choosing a narrative in letters is a challenge.  It is difficult to present several characters that stand in stark contrast to each other.  Many of letter-writers appear to have the same voice, in my opinion.<br /><br />That said, I would recommend this book as a summer read.  It was fun, and I even clapped with joy at events near the end of the novel.
B006M9NJFG|1.0|I bought four of these things and am I disappointed. First and foremost the pouch which the back of which is not shown has a weak little loop on it for a small belt which means it will not fit on any mil spec gear belts or harness units. There are no MOLLE loops or like devices for attachments so it will cost another $30.00 @ for  a Blackhawk case to use the canteen I wasted that much already on. Now lets talk about the little pouch on the side with no cover so my water  purification tabs will not stay mine long. As for the cheesy plastic bottle they call a canteen for the price it gets the thing should be at least a little more to it and more secure sealing as the water is supposed to stay in the bottle. I bought it thinking the note about the BPH free bottle and the nice aluminum cup should be good working field tools and durable. As for using the Aluminum cup you best not get it too hot or the plastic tubing around the tube will melt. I've not yet had the chance to determine durable as there is no way to attach this thing to my gear without some strap thing jury rigged swinging all over the place. If you shop around you can get a Mil-Spec unit for less money and a pouch that works. I bought Gerber thinking new equipment, better clean water storage,  description sounded good, and all fitting nicely with its own new cup. This is definitely a \\"DO NOT\\" recommend.
0618001905|4.0|I’m sure most people understand a little of what colonization meant for the original inhabitants of areas of Africa and Southeast Asia.  But nothing I had ever read about prepared me for the appalling history found in King Leopold’s Ghost.  The book is a non-fiction work about the Belgian King’s desire to have a colony of his own.  Not for the Belgians, but for himself.  Leopold looked towards Africa in the late 1870′s and took over area that would be known as the Belgian Congo.  At this point in time, slavery had been long abolished in England, recently abolished in the United States, and was generally looked down upon throughout all of Europe.  The inhabitants of the Middle East were still kidnapping native Africans and bringing them to the desert countries as slaves.  The “civilized world” of the west was up in arms over this.  So, King Leopold maneuvered himself politically to “help” those poor Africans, by establishing a state that would protect them from their oppressors.  He received financial and written support from the international community to do this.  What Leopold did, in actuality, was replace one oppressor with another.  He took roughly a billion dollars worth of natural resources from the Congo, with the use of forced labor, killing, in the process, approximately half of its native population.<br /><br />In the past few months I have read many books about Africa, learning about the tragedies of it’s wars and genocides, but nothing was as disturbing as the plight of the people in the Congo.  They weren’t the enemy, and they had virtually no value to their overlords.  The peaceful natives were thought of as mere animals, to be exploited, used as pack horses, abused and then discarded.  The Belgians in charge worked them to death.  It wasn’t a question of fighting back – the Congolese had no choice.  The poor dark-skinned people were killed if their loads were slightly lighter than others, or if they collapsed with exhaustion.  Worse yet, were bounties for the dead.  As proof (in order to receive payment), the colonial forces severed the right hands of the Congolese – men, women and children.  Sometimes they didn’t even wait for them to die.<br /><br />It is a harrowing story and a true one that most people don’t know about.  King Leopold was adept at destroying the Belgian records that would convict him of these crimes.  But thanks to countless personal stories of missionaries and others who journeyed to the Congo during the forty years of King Leopold’s rule, the story comes to the surface.Worse yet, were bounties for the dead.

1400052181|5.0|In 1951, a poor black woman by the name of Henrietta Lacks died of cancer.  Her doctor took some samples (without her permission) of her cancer cells and her cervical tissue that later made history.  These cells became the first to regenerate in a laboratory.  They became immortal, because they kept on growing.  This was important because most cells won’t do that, and having the cells for research provided important scientific breakthroughs like the polio vaccine and the available of chemotherapy in fighting cancer.  In fact, most research done today uses the offspring of these cells – which are called HeLa.<br /><br />Skloot’s work of non-fiction is exemplary.  She tells a very human side of this story. In presenting Henrietta Lacks and her family to readers, we can start to understand the ethical dilemma posed by the scientific and commercial value of human cells.  Should individuals have a say in what happens to tissue that is removed in a doctor’s office?  Do medical companies have an obligation to share in the profits of cells that are marketable?  Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of exploring all these issues and more.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a fascinating story that you won’t want to put down.  It draws you in from the very first page, and keeps you all the way to the end.

0061537969|5.0|“Gestures are all that I have; sometimes they must be grand in nature.  And while I occasionally step over the line and into the world of the melodramatic, it is what I must do in order to communicate clearly and effectively.”<br /><br />Have you ever had a book on your shelf for years and finally, when you read it, it is so wonderful you want to kick yourself for waiting so long to open it?  The Art of Racing in the Rain is one of those books.  The novel is narrated by a dog, Enzo, and through his eyes, we see an amazing story of resilience and humanity, centered around his owner, Denny.  Denny is a semi-professional race car driver, and the title reflects the diligence, patience and self-awareness needed to guide a car in precarious conditions.  It also reflects the qualities Denny needs to travel through the track that is his life.  The patterns woven throughout the book connecting racing and life earned The Art of Racing in the Rain that extra half star from me.<br /><br />Yes, I own a dog.  And Enzo’s logic at times made me laugh out loud.  But you don’t need to own a dog to enjoy this book.  A word of warning, however.  Have a box of tissues handy.  I think I cried for the entire second of half of the book.  It’s sad and happy, as is life.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars (out of 5)
B0068THAGY|4.0|Super 8 was a very good sci-fi mystery/action film with good sub plots and great young actors.  Some neat special effects.
1439152799|4.0|“It started with a letter.  A letter that had been lost a long time, waiting out half a century in a forgotten postal bag in the dim attic of a nondescript house in Bermondsey.”<br /><br />Okay.  How can you not be immediately drawn into a book that begins like this?  It gets better:  the letter was written in 1941, in a castle, and was send to a girl who had spent time there as an evacuee from London during World War II.  The narrator discovers that her mother is that evacuated child and this all leads to an amazing mystery involving a famous writer, his three daughters, and the disappearance of two men.<br /><br />Having read three Kate Morton novels, all enjoyable, I can definitely say this is my favorite.  I’m sure it’s merely for content.  This is the kind of stuff that blows my skirt up.  History, intrigue and a love story to boot.  Not that Morton is really that into history.  Nor is this a great work of literature.  I would describe The Distant Hours as the kind of book you read in front of your fireplace while wrapped in a warm blanket, with absolutely no interruptions for a few hours at a time.  It’s a real page-turner and highly entertaining.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I'm at a point in the game, where all my missions either require large amounts of money, or the animals/shops require peanuts to pay for them. While there are opportunities to earn peanuts, to get the amounts needed, you have to use real money to purchase them. As for the missions that require large amounts of money, I don't mind them. It's just frustrating when of the 5 missions I have, 4 require large amounts of peanuts to pay for them, and the 5th one needs $500,000+ to crossbreed 2 of the animals I do have.

I say it is the soundtrack to my days because I will listen to it with my headphones as I get ready for work. I play it in the car during my commute. I listen to it in the mornings while walking and jogging or in the evening to unwind or busy myself around the house and I SWEAR, I see a different viewpoint of the world around me when I do.<br /><br />I cannot pinpoint my favorite tracks and those that I do favor are for different reasons suffice to say each track stands out in its on right. As a lover of music and admirer of musicians, and all creative and artistically stimulating persons, a thanks is in order.<br /><br />I appreciate this album for being the soundtrack to my days. I would like to thank Jack White for his creativity (and the Grammy's for which without, I still may not know the about this music), and the team behind him who helped in bringing Blunderbuss onto my radar.<br /><br />Treat yourself. Buy this album and one more for a friend.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the upgrades to the game. I can play it all day. My only issue is you almost have to spend money to advance in levels.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Terrible game concept. Walk around and collect notes sticking to things. No need to figure anything out. Where is the game? It is just about being lucky enough to not be in the spot where the slenderman appears randomly, because if you are, you're dead and must start from the beginning again. I believe the &quot;skill level&quot; you select only controls the frequency of him showing up where you are standing.  BORING. Not even remotely scary, game music is like nails on a chalkboard. Annoying. Why would anyone pay for this?
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|The movie is really a lot of fun, great for all ages.  If you like the Shrek movies you'll love this one.

B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This game is for those who love to play Super Mario Bros. I'm not that big of a fan of this game.
B007IK44CK|5.0|This was good fun. Car chase, humor, great CGI and creative use of \\"technology\\" in the plot. There was not much serious romance, and that's ok. The actors were easy on the eyes. Lol
B001H4NXCK|2.0|It is right on the cusp of being funny but does not quite make it. The comedy was predictable and flat
B002RVCD6O|2.0|Why someone would take out whole sections of the book that are necessary to the plot only to insert scenes that add NOTHING to the plot is beyond me. I also would like to know why they have Harry giddy after taking Felixis and making a horrible joke FOR LAUGHS about the pincers of Aragog then sitting kicking his feet back and forth in a chair with a simpering smile on his face. It's not the fault of the actors or of Ms. Rowling ... but this adaptation of the book is HORRIBLE.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I loved this game, few very minor problems, but a great game for people who really get into games! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes scary games
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great cast - fantastic show! A must see for anyone whose ever enjoyed Twin Peaks, X-files or any other paranormal type show!
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I gave it 2 stars just because of graphics and sound creates nice ambience and feel to the game. But its just boring. Idk what this slender man thing as about but just keep going forward collecting notes that's it. Easy or hard setting its the same. And if you see him in the distance just avoid him simple. There's no stradegy really or reason to \\"sneak\\" around. Just walk around. Boring.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Still learning how to use this app. Lots of potential for me here to use and I like it a lot. Tech support is great, and they promised to help me learn to send it wirelessly to my printer whenever I am ready to try that. This is a great app!!!

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|love this game, it taught me a lot about using my new Kindle, something I have never had before even on my laptop. I really like playing this, but again, I have to set a timer to limit my time! Sometimes I get frustrated trying to get enough points to reach the second star to advance to the next level, wishing I hadn't done so well on the first star! It is lots of fun, and I have discovered things more by accident that helped me play, than by instructions. I am very new to this type of thing.

B009VB97EY|4.0|If you like hot men, you will enjoy this movie. Wow factor!! Some of the audio is weak and the music is loud. There is a story line, so thats a good thing.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|The plot left a lot to be desired.  For example, why wouldn't you take two shots in the begining instead of one?  That would have avioded a lot of issues down the line.  Good for action, poor for plot.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|great movie lived through all of the eras. Good sound great picture quality. One of many Tom Hanks best performances.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I simply love this game! It is extremely addictive, sometimes frustrating, but lots of fun! I have this game on both my laptop and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and although there are different aspects to each, they're both enjoyable. The version for my tablet goes much faster, as I have a touch screen on it that I don't on my laptop.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|The picture comes in perfectly, and it has it's built in cam-recorder. You can also take pictures while in the middle of recording a video, just in case there is a shot you don't want to miss. It also captures panoramic views. One of the best apps on my kindle.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This isn't the 40-something horn dog Green Arrow as written by Mike Grell in the comics I loved back when. But then who, besides me, would watch such a show today? That said, this is a fine action series with good acting and depth of character and a lot of intriguing twists. It's an update well worth watching, whether you know the character from old or not.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had people recommend this to me for years and finally jumped in. My favorite TV show in ages. First two seasons free in Prime, and by then you'll be glad to pay for Season 3. Of course, if you're not a Prime member, you won't be unhappy if you pay from the start.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Better than Season Seven.  There is much more variety in this season. 8 more words required for this review.  Geez.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Such an easy, imaginative and enjoyable read. Glad i found it and I'm looking forward to more from Mr. Sloan.
B009GX6600|5.0|One of the best shows on TV ...good characters and writing!  I love the honor that is paid to those who serve in the military.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Like so many others who read and reviewed this book, I had a strong emotional response to this book.  The story is heart-breaking and unique and yet, eerily familiar.  Beauty jumps out from the page in the most despicable scenes.  True love reaches up and pulls you close by the neck.  This is a beautiful and thoughtful book.  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
0062014102|5.0|Being a student of yogi philosophy, having read The Yoga Sutras Of pantajali and all of Franz Bardon's books and alot of other occult books I have to say that this is a really good book which futher explains occult themes with such clarity.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This movie had such wonderful actors I was sure it would be entertaining.  About 40 mins in I was still waiting to care about the story. Sadly I stopped watching.
0671646788|5.0|If you are looking to step outside of the four walls society has placed you in then read this book, over and over again
0385536828|4.0|When I read Atonement, I got 50 pages into the thing & turned around & started all over again - I was that confused.  I've since fallen under McEwan's spell & am willing to let him take me wherever he will. Sweet Tooth does not disappoint ---- but I've got McEwan's number now & figured out the denouement long before the last page.<br /><br />He's got to get sharper to earn that 5th star from me in the future!  I won't begrudge him 4 stars, but the 5th....well....Atonement doesn't come along every day of the week!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you are looking for a great show to get wrapped up in, this is it! From the romance to the mystery and scandal,,this show doe it all! Don't forget about the ritual of the royals as well. I am hooked!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I'm fascinated by this series and its characters. I love Holmes and Watson and the Captain.I'm watching all of the episodes for the second time.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the most enjoyable I have read in a while.  I hit all my buttons in the correct order.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|very fun show to become addicted to.  Some of the characters are extremely dramatic which drives me nuts but I can fast forward past them :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing story! I fell in love with these characters immediately. I also finally felt a sense of happiness finishing a book for a change. It finished in a great place.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well crafted fun movie, but I wish most of it were actually true! If you do a bit of research, you find they took A LOT of liberties with the facts of the story, and outright made up many parts. Not uncommon of course for a movie, but they really sold this a more truth than fiction. The opposite is true. But Ben Affleck is a good director, batting 3 for 3 now with each of his films. Great cast, good pacing, sharp dialogue . I don't think it was worthy of Best Picture Oscar, but an entertaining film for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun and cool j really enjoy the game buuut I just hare how it takes a lot of time to build money up ):  not cool bro work in that
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Gillian Flynn is undoubtedly a good writer but this book was depressing to me.  Maybe I can find another of her books that is not so dark.  On a snowy day I need a little sunshine and cheer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show if you can stand the gore.  Great characters and exciting story line.  Very entertaining.  AWESOME!
B009LUBA7M|4.0|I've been a bit spoiled by the upbeat genius that is Life in Cartoon Motion and The Boy Who Knew Too Much.  Expecting the same type of high energy music on The Origin of Love, I was a bit disappointed.  The music is more modern pop than anything else, but as with any Mika song, listen to it enough and it begins to grow on you.  Amid the more predictable choruses are some classically-inspired verses that are reminiscent of Mozart, and that stay in your head long after you've turned the music off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very easy for my 6 year old daughter to use.  Entertaining and also helps with learning to take care of the horse.  Great graphics and get realistic!!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I've finished the first year and found the program to be surprisingly entertaining, though the sometimes-arbitrary entrances and (maybe) exits of various characters is a little much when I think about it. However, so far it's got some interest and I see that it's also got five seasons, so the writers must be finding ways to continue the interest in the characters and underlying story.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really do love this movie. It's not as good as the book, but movies rarely are. They left out a lot and changed quite a bit, but really, in order to get the story into just 2 1/2 hours they did a great job. Acting was great and so was setting and make-up. This movie is great for anyone who loves adventure, strength, some politics, and just a little romance and angst. It's pretty original. And I was very happy with the fact that the hero is a female but they didn't play that fact up. It's not a feminist tale by any means. So I love this movie and the books it's based on. I'd recommend reading the books first though! They're great and add more to the story when you watch the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing twists & turns...a story of love and revenge.  Throughout the story, the reader is continually surprised at how the story unfolds.  I really enjoyed this book!

B001PARXHW|4.0|There's little question that on a day-to-day basis, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw has to be among the very greatest Mahler orchestras on the planet. However, that's sometimes the problem here as well: too much familiarity. For me, the most perfunctory performances in this set are the three directed by their main conductor, Mariss Jansons (M2, M3 and M8). He conducts with thorough knowledge of these works, and with a very clear conducting technique as well. However, there's so little 'fire' or opinion to anything he's doing here. His performances are 'just there'. They're not bad performances, mind you (how could they be with the Concertgebouw). It's just that they just don't come across as being inspired in any real way either. Beethoven, Brahms or Haydn may as well have been on the menu (and, obviously, they deserve better as well). But from here, the set definitely improves.<br /><br />In M1, Daniel Harding gives a straight forward, fresh and 'youthful' performance that's completely appropriate. He jacks up the Eastern European flavor of the slow movement, but without miccro-managing or sounding overly fussy in the process. This is nicely done.<br /><br />For me, M4 with Ivan Fischer and Miah Persson (sop) is the highlight of this set. If anything, this is an even 'hotter' and more flexible performance than the fine one that the two of them offered to the world, via Channel Classics excellent sonics. This is among the finest Mahler 4th's I've ever heard. The Concertgebouw has had an outstanding track record with the fourth over the decades, and their streak surely continues here.<br /><br />In M5, Daniella Gatti brings to the table that which the Concertgebouw sometimes truly lacks: fire! That said, his 'interpretation' of the fifth has deepened since his inaugural recording of M5 with the Royal Phil. two decades ago. Like Fischer, Gatti fully understands that he has an instrument in front of him - the Concertgebouw - that will respond to his slightest gesture or subtle adjustments in tempo.  In spite of Gatti's brusqueness from time to time (isn't the fifth a truly 'brusque' work anyway?), Gatti is seriously having fun here and so are we, his audience. I'm truly hopeful that Gatti will be considered on the short list for Janson's eventual successor someday.<br /><br />M6 with Lorin Maazel brings nothing that one wouldn't already expect, if they're already familiar with his dark, heavy and sometimes plain slow performances of Mahler that he's given in Vienna and New York. This is not a 'bad' performance by any means. However, the best that can said about it is that Maazel gives an appropriately dark and weighty reading of the piece. Oddly enough, the Concergebouw's percussion section plays far more timidly here than they did on Chailly's truly powerful recording of M6 for Decca (Chailly is a percussionist!).<br /><br />\\"DlvdE\\" & \\"Totenfeier\\" is conducted by the mercurial Fabio Luisi, who is now doing much of the conducting duties at the N.Y. Metropolitan Opera. This is very good - Anna Larsson is great! She even makes a strong effort not to over-sing her pseudo-outburst near the end of \\"der Abschied\\", where the good Earth and sky are turning all blue and green, and all that good stuff (Mahler does not make any dynamic adjustment above 'piano' at this critical juncture - many singers turn into a loud 'forte'). However, after hearing such a fine performance of \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", why would ANYBODY want to stick around to hear \\"Totenfeier\\" - the heavily Liszt influenced, first version of what eventually became the opening movement to the \\"Resurrection\\" symphony (#2)? I just don't get that. It's not a bad performance of \\"Totenfeier\\", but why would anybody couple it to \\"DLvdE\\"?<br /><br />M9 with Haitink: I skipped it! I'll get around to it someday, but I just can't bring myself to look at it right now. I've always thought that Haitink's famous Concertgebouw recording of the 9th from the latter '60's was highly overrated to begin with. In more recent years, Haitink has become a one-man 'snooze fest' when it comes to Mahler (and many other composers as well). What happened to this man? Besides, I've been listening to the Dudamel/Los Angeles M9 that just got issued on DG (how many 9th's can people listen to at one time anyway!). I'm sure that this isn't terrible, but I doubt if I'll be bowled over by it either.<br /><br />I want to like the Cooke version of the 10th symphony with Eliahu Inbal more than I do. I don't know what it is, but I just can't jump on the band wagon for his Mahler (that said, his M7 with the Czech Phil. is outstanding!). He obviously knows these pieces exceedingly well, but there's something that just looks too scripted or 'choreographed' about his Mahler conducting. Part of the problem is that I'm just not THAT crazy about the Cooke version (I like the Samale/Mazzuca version best, so far). This isn't bad by any means, so there really is little reason for me to complain at all. I'm just not hanging from the rafters either. For the Cooke version, I still like the Ormandy version best, as well as the recent Gianandrea Noseda one on Chandos.<br /><br />Special mention has to be given to the M7 with Pierre Boulez. For a man who doesn't like minimalist music (neither do I), he sure is a 'minimalist' conductor. Boulez hardly conducts at all, and gives his most 'meaningful' indications through his eyes. Perhaps this is what the 'zen' of conducting is all about. I say all this because the Amsterdam audience goes 'nuts' at the end. In this entire set, Boulez is the one conductor who gets a unanimous standing ovation. Interpretively speaking, this reading differs little from the one he recorded in Cleveland for DG, the hallmarks of which being a slower than normal first movement; very 'zippy' tempi for the two Nachtmusik movements, and a refusal to slow down at the symphony's final peroration near the end of the finale. Boulez hardly deviates from his game-plan at all. Yet, the results were quite convincing to the Dutch audience. Someone more astute in psychology and human behavior than I, will have to offer an explanation as to why Boulez is so charismatic, and seems to disarm so many of his critics.<br /><br />This pretty much covers it, but I want to take a moment to talk about the Concertgebouw itself. This orchestra has always been famous for its fine woodwinds, as well as a great transparency to its tonal colorings. The hall itself has relatively steep tiers for the orchestra to sit upon, which gives the woodwinds far more relief than in most concert halls. The percussion have an elevated tier to themselves as well. Thus, the orchestra is well suited for Mahler's music with its almost equal emphasis on all four sections of the orchestra: strings, woodwinds, brass and percussion. But as I mentioned before, my only complaint about the Concertgebouw is that they can sound a tad bland or 'routine' in some of their performances. Granted all orchestras suffer this problem from time-to-time, as conductors are truly little more than a necessary evil (at their worst, that is). For me, part of the problem is in the brass.<br /><br />The Concertgebouw horns don't blaze-out the way that their counterparts in Berlin, Chicago, Pittsburgh or Vienna do. No doubt, some of that has to do with where the horns are positioned in the hall, and in relation to everyone else in the orchestra. The other problem - for me, anyway - is their insistence on sticking with American park band style, piston valve trumpets. There are times when the brightness of those trumpets are just right in Mahler's music. But there are other times when the darker and more burnished colorings of the German rotary valve trumpets are sorely missed (in the famous Kubelik/Bavarian Radio S.O. Mahler cycle, a mixture of American and German style trumpets was employed to great effect). The difference in tonal qualities of these trumpets has nothing to do with rotary vs. piston valves. Instead, it's the length and taper of their bell sections and lead pipes - leading up to the valve section - that make the difference (and yes, there are have been numerous attempts to meld the qualities of both trumpets). I know I'm getting into technical stuff that most people can't be bothered with. The point is this: in spite of their fine woodwinds and thoroughly 'modern' percussion, there are moments when the Concertgebouw's brass are just not all that coloristically correct for Mahler.<br /><br />In spite of his efforts to differentiate himself from Wagner and Bruckner (musically speaking), there are moments in Mahler symphonies where the horns really need to seize the moment (take the bull by the horns?), and the trumpets need to play 'second fiddle' to those horns (and yes, there are many moments where the opposite is true as well). All this is a bit akin to what people frequently say about professional sports teams: all problems and criticisms melt away when the team is winning. I find that the same is true with the Concertgebouw: all my slight reservations about them melt away when the conductor brings the one ingredient that they themselves sometimes forget to bring: fire!  Watch the Fischer M4 and Gatti M5 and see if you don't agree.<br /><br />In spite of all the 'pluses' to this dvd set, if you want an all-Concertgebouw cycle of the Mahler symphonies, I personally would stick with the Chailly box on Decca. Just make sure to supplement that set with the outstanding Janet Baker/James King/Haitink \\"DLvdE\\" on Philips. But having just stated that opinion, nobody would go far wrong with the added bonus of the visuals that this unique set offers. If you want to hear and watch just one person's opinion on the major works of Mahler, you simply couldn't do better than to acquire the complete Bernstein dvd set on DG.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|It would definitely be a part of Seth Mc Farlanes sophomoric song...but such a good story! Loved the performances of all of the actors!
B00A85EMVK|1.0|I have a state of the art 3D system in my theater room. The 3D is there in the picture just not out of the screen at ya. And my Bose Acoustimass system picks up any imperfections in sound. This recording of sound stunk to high heaven. Sound skipped out constantly though-out the entire 3D version of the movie. And I did everything I could to stop that from happening. If your going to buy this video buy it locally so you can take it back easily to trade for another video or something. Wow this is junk.
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|My wife and I kept waiting for this movie to do \\"something\\". We watched until shortly after he got to the bus and shut it down. This is a story about a boorish, self-involved rich kid that was gifted money for his education. He completes his B.A. then gives away the remaining $25,000 that was to pay for a Master's degree. He then travels across country and finally ends up in Alaska without a map, compass or any real plan of survival. The fun continues as he then starves to death (poisoning still up for debate) and costs the Federal, State & local taxpayers money in retrieving his body and artifacts. How romantic and free-spirited. Jack London he was not. This movie was especially brutal for us to watch because we worked our way through school and struggled for every opportunity to make a buck to survive. The story itself was plain bad. The script, direction or even the scenery could not save it. OK, I'm not saying the script or direction were any good either. I want those minutes of my life back. Enough said?
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This is a significant film that exposes the contradictory life of the &#34;functional&#34; alcohol and drug abuser. The drama and tension portrayed are realistic and sobering (no pun intended!). I gave this a &#34;4-star&#34; rating instead of 5 in that I think that the &#34;point&#34; of certain scenes could have been achieved without nudity, making the film more suitable for a younger audience.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|By staying true to the best traditions of great sounding records, Raven is one of the best sounding recordings in years, masterfully engineered by Alan Parsons with Parsons and Wilson co-producing. Listen to Raven on a great set of speakers or studio monitors and you'll hear a clear mix, no gimmicks, and clean live-sounding music. The acoustic guitars shine on Drive Home and the opening of The Watchmaker, like someone playing next to you. The drums and bass on Luminol are up front and dynamic - you can hear the bass strings vibrate like sitting in front of a bass amp. On Drive Home, you can hear the breathy sound of the soprano sax. Gone are the guitar string squeaks in Wilson's prior recordings, something I won't miss. And with audiophiles in mind, the mastering has thoughtfully preserved the dynamic range of the music between soft and loud passages, a fresh approach when many of today's records are overly compressed to sound loud throughout. Wilson and Parsons have set a high standard for other recording musicians to follow.

I went for the lower end of pricing, and I was absolutely surprised at the quality of the recording, and am glad I took the chance.  If you love Jethro Tull, and also love Christmas music, then this is something to consider taking a chance on!  Delivery was a bit long, but I ordered it close to Christmas last year.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|When I first Bought this, I thought that it was originally the old Movie that I watched years back. Instead it turned out to be a remake of the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime first 4 episodes all packed into a movie (only told differently, so more like a rebuild). And to my surprise it was amazing visually (all the bright colors!! and the EVA looks much better in my opinion) and the voice acting is still great. I definitely recommend this any fans of this series or anime in general! When I first watched this on adult swim when I was younger, it blew my mind, it was something I have never seen before and it instantly drew me in. So buy it!!

I only have seen 1 other game on Android that even comes close to this (&quot;Labyrath of the Demon&quot;) but this is better! The creepy graphics &amp; soundtrack, the fog and sound effects. TOTAL emersion into horror, especially if you play with headphones in a dark room, alone. I am WAY impressed! Reminds me of nothing else. Found 5/8 pages my best so far, gotta keep trying, can't quit playing!

B000HSKUBE|4.0|If youhave  watched the new Netflix, US, Kevin Spacey House of Cards series, you will be very pleased with the original.  The BBC version compresses the story line and focuses upon the scorpion-like sting for the &#34;whip&#34;.  There's less sex and nudity, but more hardcore politics - including a close up look at the destruction of a prime minister.  The BBC version is a little bit dated, but the venom still feels fresh.

B000HKYNQ0|5.0|The storylines in Star Trek TOS Seasons 1 and 2 are truly timeless.  If you are new to original Star Trek, stop watching reality TV and spend some time getting to know these wonderful historical documents.  And get over that television production technology has improved since the 1960s.  Heck, iPads weren't even invented until Star Trek Next Generation.  It's even fun to notice technology they use that was unheard of in its day but is now in everyday use.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Good graphics, solid gameplay. Not for the impatient unless you have a load of money to waste. Everything you can pay for you can get free but it will take ten bazillion years. My wife wanted me to play so she could clear some tasks with me as a friend and \\"neighbor\\", but that element seems to be broken so no dice. I will likely delete the game since I cannot play within her game. She has already tagged me for about 50 bucks since she got this, so I guess she is the target audience here. There are alot of other things I could spend money on besides in game currency, such as expansions for my xbox games.
B0048LPRCS|2.0|Enter the Void (Gaspar Noe, 2009)<br /><br />For the first hour of its ridiculous two-and-a-half-hour running time, Enter the Void is my favorite piece of Noe since Carne (with the understanding that I have not yet seen I Stand Alone); Noe handles the non-linear aspect of the story very well, keeping it coherent while using what I have cone to understand is a very difficult convention. I've seen a few movies that have attempted, and failed, the non-linear thing in recent weeks (e.g. Wingard's A Horrible Way to Die), so I appreciate it working here a great deal.<br /><br />Then we get to the last hour and a half. I understand what Noe is trying to do, and for the most part I understand how he's trying to do it. But still, there are certain points where it just plain doesn't work.<br /><br />Plot: a layabout-turned-drug-dealer, Oscar (Nathaniel Brown in his screen debut), is on his way to deliver some pills to a regular client, Victor (Bright Star's Olly Alexander), when he gets caught in a police raid at the Void nightclub in Tokyo, and is shot and killed. At the behest of a friend, he's been reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead, to which he tries to introduce his sister Linda (A Walk to Remember's Paz de la Huerta) in the opening sequence, and the remainder of the movie explores Oscar's spirit--soul, if you will--undertaking the afterlife journey as codified in said book. We see Oscar--the film is shot completely from his perspective, over the actor's shoulder when he is in frame, or from his POV otherwise--watching the lives of his acquaintances in the present day combined with a number of traumatic memories that allow us to see how Oscar and Linda get from France to Tokyo.<br /><br />It's good stuff, and the potential of it is realized in the first 40% of the movie. After that, it gets bloated and unwieldy, with a great deal of repetition. I can understand that in the case of some of the more traumatic pieces (Oscar getting shot being an obvious one), but some of the repetition just seems senseless. Worse, at least from my perspective, is Noe's obsession with what I call \\"blinkies\\". The movie is chock full of strobe lights and other things that change color or brightness or what have you very rapidly. And I know this is a personal thing, and your mileage may (and probably will) vary, but I find that really, really annoying. There were a lot of portions of this movie where I had to close my eyes simply because I was so annoyed by the blinkies. Which leads to the movie's third, and worst, major weakness: Noe just can't stop himself from filming things simply for shock value. The entire last fifteen minutes of this movie, known as the \\"love hotel\\" sequence... well, you know that thirty-second shot towards the end of Requiem for a Dream that got it rated NC-17? Imagine that drawn out to endless, and ultimately boring, lengths, overlaid with stupid strobe lights, and you've got an idea of the contents of the love hotel sequence. How do you make this sort of thing (and let's call it what it is, porn) boring? You can take lessons in it from watching the last major sequence in Enter the Void.<br /><br />Starts off so well, and then finishes like a dog. **the repetition just seems senseless.

B001TM14VC|5.0|Rhis movie is actually well done with the right amount of action and romance.  The. story line is well done and fits within real life.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|wowzzers! I thought this game was going to be a dud but turned out to be surprisingly fun and scary. the graphics are good but the rotation on the kindle can get a little choppy at times, which is its one downfall.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is better then any others I have worked with. First off the multiple books that you can have to organize your notes. Then it saves everything as you type. And you can email from there. I have no cons for this program. It has never crashed on me. I use it for hours at a time. Buy it.<br /><br />Works on Kindle Fire 1.0
0062238868|5.0|My husband and dad read this book and kept them enthralled until the end.  Great read and would definitely recommend!
B00969PR18|2.0|I didn't really like it. It didn't have much for updates to its maps for my area. I have no need for an app with old information. I have paper maps that have the updates. I use Mapquest's free app. Works better for me.

B003QSHIPS|5.0|This was wonderful. I got it for my boyfriend for Valentine's day and he LOVES it. The case (or whatever you would call it) has all kinds of really neet artwork, and it's a lot of fun. Of course the music is fabulous and it sounds especially fabulous as a vinyl.<br /><br />Also, great seller. It was packaged wonderfully and in perfect shape when I openend it. Arrived very quickly! :)

B0054SMID0|1.0|I don't know how I ordered this movie! I have the Prime membership and must have thought it was a free one! I did not watch it, but I was billed $14.99 to my credit card. I should be able to return it with no charge.  Not happy!  :(
B000007UXS|5.0|Got to my house really quickly, was packaged really nicely.<br /><br />Besides, I LOVE this album, so I definitely can't wait to hear it on vinyl!!!!! AHH! :)

B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|The minutes he starts singing, you know it's Boz.  He sounds like nobody else.  His voice has changed naturally with age, but it he has not lost an ounce of emotion.  He knows, however, how to pick material that plays to his strengths so he owns the song.  Whether it's one his new songs or covering an old standard, Boz makes the song his.  Boz Scaggs is one of those artist that gives you more than you bargain for. Both on his recordings and his live concerts he leaves you with a smile and gentle, warm feelings that just lasts....  I never get tired of his music and his music never tires you.  He has such a large repertoire that no matter what album you reach for, that smile and gentle, warm feeling will sashay in and linger.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. I have a million world's on it!!! My B.F.F. and I play it together ALL THE TIME! I'll never stop!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|i can categorize training by before and after reading this book, it makes you understand so much stuff that goes on in your body unnoticed. We go everyday getting information on weight training, cardio, nutrition and supplementation from the wrong sources, then the decision we take are just not wise,and end up quitting, frustrated and burning money like crazy to get better. When the only thing you need is the right info to go with your already consistent determination to get bigger and stronger to achieve the results you want. This is just my sincere opinion after reading this book. I have spent a lot more than 6.99 in worthless supplements that doesnt guarantee the results youll have from this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a 43 year-old woman, I probably enjoyed this book more than the 15 year-old audience it is marketed toward at my local bookstore. I love that the author chooses to narrate the story as a female. It speaks the truth of terminal disease--even if no one is willing to say it in public. I laughed out loud & cried (mocking myself for crying). I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I haven't reviewed a film product on Amazon in a long time, but I first saw Prometheus after learning of its existance at the end of February 2013!<br /><br />Just to clarify my demographic, I am well into my retirement now and was there when the original Alien was released. When I commented on the original Alien I said that the reaction of those in the theater was spectacular and we all realized that we had just witnessed  a very special film.  My opinion is that Ridley Scott has equaled or exceeded his origin Alien vision.<br /><br />I have also kept up with the franchise over the years by seeing all the Alien spinooffs (like the Alien vs Preditor series which I didn't like too much). Prometheus on DVD viewed very well on my 52\\" HDTV and watching this new movie was as unique an experience as watching the original Alien and I viewed it three times serially! Now that I have seen it I know I would like to see it again on Blu-Ray for the slightly superior screen quality and the information contained on the total of four disks.<br /><br />Again it did not dissapoint except for being left open for a sequel.  I have seen the various chat sites at which dedicated Alien fans have left their opinions and suggested some plots for a possible Prometheus 2 after the gears of our legal system grind out to their conclusion.<br /><br />I hope the great Ridley Scott or as talented a director  can make it. I won't put you to sleep with what I might have added (or subtracted) to the movie.  It was grand, grand, grand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for the whole family!!  It's fun to try and get all the extra incentives they put in the game every month!
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|I received the package quickly and in great shape. Great customer service! I've already watched it twice since getting the movie. Thanks!
B00845PT18|4.0|I didn't watch the movie myself but other family members did and we all like Nicolas Cage I will make a point to watch it myself at some point.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Had to buy because our son deleted the season premier from the DVR. Great option from a trusted site. Thanks!
B00A757EFW|1.0|It's Pac man sure but to let you play not even the first round and try to get you to buy it!! Not worth the space on your kindle. Either buy it or don't waist your time on the lite.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is addicting! Even after all the missions had been completed we found ourselves still playing. My wife played just cause, I continued to play for the trophies. Even my step daughter can't get enough of this. Great game!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed Dance with Dragons. Martin struggled with his two previous books, but this one had some good character development, a lot of intrigue, and plenty of his trademark main-character deaths. This one still had some serious slow parts, but was thankfully better than others. Hopefully Martin can keep it moving from here to the end.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|It's not a bad game. Kinda makes you think of super Mario bros. I gave it a 3 because it's only left and right and no up and down. Not to mention when at a stand still and trying to move and jump over water or whatever it gets a little frustrating. Keep up the good work!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I think the game is awesome. It's so real. My favorite game by a long shot. Get it get it get it get it.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's totally addictive, it just seems to take longer than it should to complete tasks. Other than that I would totally recommend it for anyone looking to kill some time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I like reading about American History, mainly our early history. And learning more about what happen.<br />In this age we tend to forget how this country what made America great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author has a real gift for spinning a tale to keep the reader interested, with a series of close calls, plot twists, and characters you can empathize with.  I look forward to reading the next series...
B008YKGQR4|5.0|The other app hangs on pics. This one doesn't.  Works perfectly for me.  No probs at all.  Ithink its a good app.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A new take on an oft told tale. A great perspective on who we are and the journey of the &#34;soul&#34; without a specific theological bias
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you need a day to curl up with a great drama spend some time working your way through Downton Abbey. The costumes and sets are worth the effort. The plot is sometimes predictable but none the less I was captivated by the characters. My husband falls asleep - not enough action - but I love it
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Well written characters and interesting plot locations.  This book was both entertaining and intelligent.  I will look for more books by this author.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|There isn't enough I can say about this movie, part 1 & 2. I was BLOWN. I'm an enormous Batman fan, but am somewhat hesitant about the animated films. I absolutely loved Nolans Trilogy & was always a huge fan of The Animated series when I was younger, so I couldn't help but put TDKReturns up against these. Kevin Conroy & Mark Hamil do not reprise their classic roles & though when I read comics I hear their voices in my head, Peter Weller & Michael Emerson fit the bill in this MASTERPIECE perfectly. I could go on & on, but the main focal point I want to impress upon you is, this should not have been a DVD release, THIS NEEDS TO BE SEEN UP ON THE BIG SCREEN. It is absolutely theater worthy & once you watch part 1, you NEED to see part 2. Get them both, right now. Seriously, stop reading this & buy them & watch them.. NOW!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Never heard of this group before last week. I've missed a bunch. Her voice is haunting and the music, Indie Rock, is almost intoxicating. I've been humming some of the tunes for the past few days and that's crazy. Great set of songs. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's so simple yet so entertaining.  Cards behave in this one - you have total control.  I love having it available to me wherever I go with my Kindle Fire.  Staves off boredom if there's nothing to do but wait around.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Whey a kick. I am not very good yet but it is sure a.lot of fun. Highly recommend this game.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Cards get a little stubborn sometimes to move, and some move because your finger happened to be too close, which adds to the unwanted points against you.  But it's fun.
B002VECM6S|5.0|One of my favorite movies was delivered to me perfectly on DVD when I made my purchase at the wonderful price of only $4.99.  Then as a gift, Amazon gave me all-time Amazon Instant Video access online. Thank you Amazon!

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|even the free preview was worth it but the money was well spent. great story and graphics. if you play these games don't play the casual mode it was way too easy.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The fact that it was based on a true story made it more interesting than otherwise would have been the case.  But it didn't have the level of drama and intrigue that I had expected.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end!  I can't help to wonder tho what happens to everyone, or maybe I'm just sad it's over, maybe we will get a surprise and get another book!

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this hungry shark. I was partial to the second one but this one is even more addicting.<br />I highly recommend this game :)
B007A2O3FO|3.0|Maggie S. and Julian Fellowes, what more could an Anglophile movie lover want?<br />Well, a little more story sophistication, character development and Maggie sarcasm would have helped.<br />Other reviewers noted that this movie was based on a children's story series, and it's a little too evident in this translation to film.<br />As a family movie, it would probably be entertaining for the kiddos.<br />Rent it - don't buy it.
B004L0NGEC|4.0|Overall a very nice app that does what it was designed to do. My only complaint is that the slideshow transitions seem to fast and abrupt. These should be made slower and smoother. Better yet... make them user adjustable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 4 year old and I enjoy taking care of our horse. It's hard to get gems which is what you need to get things for your horse

B004PGAQMW|5.0|Just love this film can watch it over and over with my little one.  He just adores the action and adventures by the characters.
B00555X8OA|4.0|System 1: book good<br />System 2: book good because of some reason totally making up right now but that I totally believe because well I came up with it so quickly and easily.<br /><br />In nutshell the entire book, minus of course actual examples and illustrations. Interesting read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love that its been made to be more difficult and the upgrades are better. And so glad its free.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Loved the movie and every once and a while a DVD gets ruined.  Not a problem with streaming.  It is easy and the quality is better.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Don't prefer games that charge for hints, helps, extra stuff, especially when the game is free at first.  Would rather buy the game outright.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' album is fantastic, it's amazing to see wonderfully talented artists  like this get the publicity and fame that the so rightfully deserve. A good majority of their songs are very deep, personal and real. Music like this is hard to find and it's great to finally see an artist being recognized for true talent. Not to mention they are self produced and made their name by posting their music on YouTube. All around great experience and I look forward to seeing what they do next.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I found this movie very entertaining and enjoyable from start to finish. The video game cameos showcasing gaming history were pleasant to watch as well.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Its a fun game with a terrifying slender man. It also had my heart beating with jump scares. The game has a some issues. But its scary. And that's all that matters. You wont like the game if you don't know. uch about slender. Then there's not any fun for you. Its worth buying and I had fun. You can beat the game by collecting 8 pages.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Everything you need in one place.Was able to replace three apps with one and still get all the functions and more. Excellent App!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this whole series and this final book was just as good as all the others. Read each one in just a day, fantastic.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Just when I thought that everything had been settled, the world has gone back to chaos again. I wonder how it will all end.
0374533571|2.0|That's about all it's good for though.  I thought it was boring.  Only reason I'm finishing it is because I started it.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I agree this game is like gta..but who would of thought it would only be for $7 compared to the regular price of $60..It would be wonderful if they come out with a second one continuing this story.
0743486285|5.0|The title says it all.  It's crazy that Nikki is still alive after all he did.  The preacher lady that gives her perspective got on my nerves though.  Every harmless question was met with a diatribe about how she was a new person because God forgave her.  It's as if she was scared we'd think bad of her or something if she didn't keep brow beating us with how she's changed.
030758836X|4.0|This is one of those books where you tell everyone, \\"This is the best book ever!\\" and they, \\"Have to read it!\\" and, \\"I'm not one to toss around the word Amazing but really this book is AMAZING\\" when you are only half way through the book.  Then you stay up late into the night to finish the book.  If you are like me you will read the last page and think, \\"WTF?\\" and \\"Is my book defective and I didn't get the last chapter?\\" or \\"Is that really the end?  REALLY? Because now I hate this book and wish I hadn't recommended it to anyone.\\"<br /><br />I won't get into the plot or give spoilers because the other 8000+ reviews do that very well.  I will just say that the book starts out \\"amazing\\" and ends in \\"ugh, really?\\"  I'm still mad about the ending.  Damn.

B004UHF51S|3.0|If you are a fan of MF you will enjoy his latest efforts. Personally I wish he would branch out more and not hang-on to his<br />known sound as much
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts easy, but does get harder.  Its great when you want a logic game that doesn't strain your brain too much.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Easy to learn to use, but takes a little getting used to. After I made the same mistake about 10 times I learned not to make it again, but that could be my problem alone. I like that when I am at the point have to start plugging in guesses, if the guess is wrong, you can back up to the point where you began to guess without losing what you have already done. Whoever programmed this has great programming skills.
B004MYFUC8|4.0|It was tedious at first to settle into Austen's writing style, and tended to be very wordy.  But I loved the story.
B000JLSM00|5.0|When famous directors like Marty Scorese (sp) and Peter Bogdonavich comment that it is their favorite film and that John Ford was the best at their craft, that sums it up quite well! Ford, the Duke, Monument Valley and a fine story by Alan LeMay....the ingredients necessary for a gourmet treat!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so cool its awesome u should totally get the app has many challanging things like zip lines mine carts and the monkey thing is way bigger.
1451650728|5.0|This book that I purchase but I have still to read it.<br />It is great to read a new story about The Next Generation.
1559409002|5.0|Having seen Carnival of Souls several times before, I already knew it was an excellent film, the best low budget horror film to come from the late 1950s/early 1960s. Minus the usual gore associated with that genre, it relied more on an eerie atmosphere, greatly enhanced by the haunting score by Gene Moore. Under the superb direction of the late Hero. Harvey, and featuring the larger-than-life acting of Candace Hilligoss, this film takes the viewer on many eerie twists and turns, remaining, in effect, the only film of its particular kind, a true masterpiece of horror and the supernatural. Highly recommended!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Some but as you zoom in by clicking on the screen it becomes out of focus while some other objects stay in focus
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever. It's better than temple run like frfr. I think they should make a setting on Chicago cause it has a lot to see in the scenery.other than that awesome game.
B00A93ENX8|4.0|Apparently the folks who bought this hybrid SACD were under the erroneous impression that is was released by RUSH, and would follow the pattern set by the Sector boxes, Moving Pictures, and 2112 most recently. Nope. Should have read the description closer. However, those who have followed the Audio Fidelity (AF) releases for the last ten years, and the gold discs pioneered in the 1990s under the DCC label, you already know this is two-channel audiophile heaven all the way, at least we hope so. A year or two ago, AF released Roll the Bones, one of the Atlantic period albums, and generally from digital sources as was common in the late 1980s and 1990s. Nothing wrong with that really, but unless you could afford a DAC (digital analog converter) you had a bright, sometimes harsh and cold-sounding playback on the typical mass market CD players that nearly everyone could afford by 1993. AF farms out the mastering to two technology geniuses usually, in this case, Kevin Gray (the other being the honorable Steve Hoffman). The old days of DCC's tube mastering may have evolved to computer usage more these days, but that is what they have to do as \\"Original Master Tapes\\" are not always what they claim to be, or, in the case of Rush's Mercury era catalog, too degraded from years of storage and mishandling to loan out anymore. And this is where we are today, and how to approach this review and listening to this very recently released SACD of Rush's 1993 CD Counterparts. There was some limited vinyl released in Brazil and Germany, but good luck winning those auctions on eBay. For the rest, CDs seemed to be the direction music was heading, and very few bands insisted on a vinyl option through the early 2000s. SACD came out, but owning a dedicated player that cost so much, as well as dedicated discs kept only the most intrepid audiophiles away from making SACD the new big thing. Still, however, it persisted in classical and jazz circles.<br /><br />Now to this release. According to some press releases by Audio Fidelity, the return to SACD format was prompted by the rising cost and availability of gold used in most of their releases (they also produce 180 gram vinyl in limited titles). This, and the problem of mostly international pressing (Austria, Germany, or Japan) for SACDs has led to lengthy delays in this release, and its companion, Yes's Close to the Edge. As a private label, most of their selections stem from long-standing DCC rights agreements, and customer suggestions (I voted for this one a few years ago, as well as Hemispheres). Finally, I preordered it last fall, but AF finally caught up and released three long-awaited discs early this month (March 2013). To distinguish their new series of SACDs from their gold CD packaging, they have shifted to a gold slipcase and black ink on the top surface of the disc. A classy look, it is a shame so many throw away the slip cases as that is what increases their resale value. As with most AF releases, this is a limited edition, with the number printed on the back of the slipcase, so that's another reason to hold on to those. I never learned how many they make of each title, and they have several runs until the license expires. I estimate approximately 10,000 per item, but not always, as some are very limited and become obscure and overpriced almost immediately in the resale market.<br /><br />How does it sound? I popped this disc in my player, an older SACD-capable Marantz transport, circa 2004, which means the sound can only get better with current models. My system has tubes, and no EQ options in my preamp, something I prefer. Speakers are Wharfdale 3-way towers that can extend below 30 Hrz, and they make for a wide soundstage. I did not do \\"active listening\\" until the second playback, many hours later. One reason is to check for defects, and make sure I do not have to return the item. However, one thing caught my attention immediately: Stick It Out has a coda refrain that Rush evidently removed for the first generation release, so it sounds a little longer and more drawn out on this edition. I speculated that was the tape they got, just as Mobile Fidelity received a tape of Rush's Signals with a different take on The Weapon. I had not listened to the old, original release CD in a while, so my ears were receptive enough. I could tell something positive was afoot, but it wasn't like Kevin Gray remixed the album to sound compressed or overly loud, a common complaint with current CD release. All seemed well, so when I was ready to sit in my sweet spot and concentrate on the sound, I ran a test of the original CD and played the first two tracks, Animate, and Stick It Out for reference. The original, despite some audiophile tricks to make it sound better was louder, and brighter for sure, and what this really means is that at moderate volume, even with a DAC to even things out, listening fatigue would erode full enjoyment. A sonic beatdown if you will. Then, I put the SACD in, switched to the direct out line that requires (DACs don't work with SACDs thanks to Sony) and concentrated on what my ears could detect. Immediately, I sensed the volume level is moderately lower (I did not change the volume on the preamp after the first listen), so naturally I picked up the remote to increase to a comparable level. The next thing I heard was an apparent warm tone, not filtered, but more listenable balance. I also heard better distinction in Neil Peart's cymbals, especially the high-hat in Animate, coming almost three-dimensionally from the left channel. Other cymbal work equally stood out, but never brash or too tinny as in the original release. I enjoyed the song, and then the anthemic, heavy Stick It Out started. As before, the same sense of controlled volume and warmth that did not obviously compromise any other frequencies made for an enjoyable listed, As before, and this time I was prepared, the coda that repeats the outro was evident. I looked at the the timing listed on the original CD and it said 4:30. Comparing the timing on the SACD it said the same, but it is clearly longer. I think reproducing the cover art (darker than the original) is the reason for this. No big deal, it was interesting to note. I think you probably know the album by heart if you are reading this review, but suffice it to say, the rest of the album is great and sounds much smoother and sweeter than the past two versions released by Rush.<br /><br />All-in-all, I give it 4.5 stars for standing the time test, and revealing the experimental side of Rush we all loved on Hemispheres, 2112, and other classics. 5:1? Really? I think that is like anticipating every 180 gram record to automatically sound better than the original or Japanese vinyl release. Digital manipulation leaves its mark, but I think Kevin Gray made this barely noticeable in this mastering of a slightly murky original recording, not as muddy as Vapor Trails, but not crystal clear like Moving Pictures either. Not everyone will like it, and the audio weenies are sure to debate esoteric sonic figures, but I enjoyed it, and all music lovers who also like Rush will appreciate a sonic upgrade that SACD is.ved for the first generation release, so it sounds a little longer and more drawn out on this edition. I speculated that was the tape they got, just as Mobile Fidelity received a tape of Rush's Signals with a different take on The Weapon. I had not listened to the old, original release CD in a while, so my ears were receptive enough. I could tell something positive was afoot, but it wasn't like Kevin Gray remixed the album to sound compressed or overly loud, a common complaint with current CD release. All seemed well, so when I was ready to sit in my sweet spot and concentrate on the sound, I ran a test of the original CD and played the first two tracks, Animate, and Stick It Out for reference. The original, despite some audiophile tricks to make it sound better was louder, and brighter for sure, and what this really means is that at moderate volume, even with a DAC to even things out, listening fatigue would erode full enjoyment. A sonic beatdown if you will. Then, I put the SACD in, switched to the direct out line that requires (DACs don't work with SACDs thanks to Sony) and concentrated on what my ears could detect. Immediately, I sensed the volume level is moderately lower (I did not change the volume on the preamp after the first listen), so naturally I picked up the remote to increase to a comparable level. The next thing I heard was an apparent warm tone, not filtered, but more listenable balance. I also heard better distinction in Neil Peart's cymbals, especially the high-hat in Animate, coming almost three-dimensionally from the left channel.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game ever .you just keep playing and playing Intel your phone or any electronic device turns off
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|It's hard to find good kid movies that are PG. Don't know how this movie ended up as PG. The content is geared toward older kids.<br />***SPOILER ALERTS***<br />In the begnning of the movie Norman's mom asked him what he was doing and he responded that he was watching a movie with &#34;sex & violence.&#34; Not appropriate.<br />During the movie Norman's sister meets Norman's friend's older brother and flirts with him throughout their encounters, which was not too bad. Until the end when she asks the guy to go out with her and he responds the HIS BOYFRIEND enjoys romantic comedies.<br />Does teenage dating really need to be in a PG movie? Save it for PG-13
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game if you love girls especially for those country girls out there even if your not country it's awesome
B002CO1Y2A|5.0|I'm a bigger fan of the DLR VH records but as far as musicianship this might be the best.  Amazing record.  Sammy is a bit cheesy but he's a great singer.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game has a good story line with beautiful graphics.  Quite a bit longer than the previous game, &#34;The Secret of Grisly Manor&#34;.<br />The puzzles are logical, and there is no extra payment for built-in hints.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is just like Mario Brothers with a few differences.  This is a good one to have on if you enjoyed the old school games.
B003O86FMW|3.0|i enjoyed continuing the story, but felt like the author was rushing to get to the end!  there was not as much character development nor care with the story line as in the first.
B00BESM14U|1.0|I'm not even in the first 5 min of movie and haven't been able to watch anything. Not sure I will continue with amazon prime membership trial because the quality of my last 3 movies has been horrible!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Great series.  Really hit its stride in season 2, definitely canceled too soon.<br /><br />Surprisingly good casting with Brian Austin Green and Summer Glau really being the highlights of this series.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pintrest it has so many wounderful things u can do there are so many pictures recipes and fun craft but my favorite part is the funny things they have on there!:)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is another dystopian series I really enjoyed. When you first start the book you are really in the dark about what this world is and what is going on. We know these people live in a silo and that the outside world is decimated. As the series progresses, more secrets and mysteries are elaborated on and you begin to get a picture of what everything is about. It is this that really made it hard to put down. The world building is really great too... there is so much under the surface that it draws you in. There is so much going on here... the mundane day-to-day existence of the people, to the politics and leadership, to the &#34;cleanings&#34; that take place, and then to the bigger question of what is the silo and why is it there.<br /><br />As far as characters, there are quite a few main characters and are all well developed. Even the bad guys have reasons for what they do. The main character Juliette is very likeable and the prose really helps you get into her head.<br /><br />The only real drawback to the series is the over-the-top profanity that starts somewhere in book 4 I believe. It really added nothing to the story and if it had been removed, nobody would have missed it.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the stories and the characters, and it is a series I couldn't put down. I really hope the author revisits this world in a new series in the future.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is so much fun. I was getting tired of just playing Temple Run 1&amp;2.Until i got this game.I have not put this game doan since i got it.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Great product for the price but the handle is flimsy. I would recommend this product for a skateboarder for sure!
B009MZQQWA|5.0|This is a must-see cult movie!  The longest constantly running movie in history, for a reason.  It is NOT for the quiet conservatives, though.  There is a plethora of sexual innuendo and situations.  Let's face it, one main character is a transvestite and the others are only in their underwear for the majority of the film.  \\"Give yourself over to absolute pleasure\\" and watch!
B0012GMUIG|5.0|These used to be underground gems, so BJ released an album featuring these high-quality but lesser known earlier songs.  The sound and energy are terrific, and Joel sounds much better here than he does on 12 Gardens Live.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I had never ever heard of this movie but through the magic of youtube I ran across one of these songs.  Wonderful album.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This is not good.It wouldn't load as a game. As far as I'm concerned it isn't good. I really wish things would load as they are. Stupid!!!!!!!!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I do believe I have made everyone around me listen to this album.  It is great, I am so glad I ran across this group on songpop of all places.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Denzel  Washington was great as usual.  A different role for him but  he still played it well.
B0012NVGHU|3.0|It was a nice story but a little slow for my taste.  Wonderful songs worth a watch just for that.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 10 year old daughter likes how this set comes with a kitty and a place for the kitty to live, and a birdy with a place for it to live.<br /><br />This also comes with food for the kitty but no food for the bird.<br /><br />Lego friends can climb up and play in it. There is hidden treasure and the bench can be replicated with other pieces from other sets.
0062082353|5.0|With my military background I found it very believable.  It was presented in a way that made it very interesting to read.  It was sad to learn that Chris was killed by a former soldier that he was trying to help.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My 10 year old daughter likes the hamburger but the pieces easily get lost if you take it apart. This set is good for all of your lego friends to hang out in.<br /><br />The broom is good for cleanup and you can clean it off in the sink. You can make smoothies in the smoothie dispenser. There are also some more little pieces.<br /><br />It would be better if there were more food and more little seats for your lego friends.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The storyline was very accurate in the way he depicted the struggle many disabled people go through.  I've worked with many disabled people, and they often don't reach acceptance or sexual or intimacy.  Helen Hunt, did a wonderful job in depicting the sensitivity needed for the role.  Disabled people in general, do have number of choices.  The storyline was excellent.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|I love this book, it is so uplifting. I would buy this for anyone who is not comfortable in their own skin or has no confidence. There is so much girl drama in high school this book is perfect for any young woman or older. I read it when I was 22 and it really helped me get out of a dark state of mind, how ever it is very short. It is a book to help one be more optimistic and has several beautiful quotes in it so follow by to live a happier state of mind.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Had a little issue with my bandwidth but the quality was still great. Can't wait for season 3.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Since I finished FF7, 8, and 9 for the Playstation ONE (Yes I'm that old school), I haven't found a single game that could match their caliber. Now, almost 13 years later, I discovered Persona 4 Golden on Amazon, for which the ratings were the highest I have ever seen for any product. I expected a lot from this game as a result, hoping that it wasn't just all hype.<br /><br />Well, it EXCEEDED my already sky high expectations! No words can describe how much I love this game, but I will try.<br /><br />The story is unique and interesting. It's definitely not your cookie cutter \\"kids go on an adventure and then save the world\\" type of plot. It mixes the mundane and supernatural; at times it's dark, other times it's lively and happy, yet bittersweet all the same. I don't want to say anymore for fear of somehow revealing spoilers. Just know that it's an extremely well developed and well rounded story that keeps you on edge. At times I hated having to fight in dungeons just because I wanted to get on with the story. That's how good it is.<br /><br />The characters... Hmm, how do I put this. I personally believe the characters are the best part of this game. They are so real, so human-like. It's not a black-or-white world and these characters are the very examples. Throughout the game each (major) character is so fully developed that I feel like they are my friends in real life. And even as a female I found myself getting attached to Yukiko. By the end of the game I was practically falling in love with her. Even now, as impossible as this is, I desperately want to learn more about the characters.<br /><br />By the way, your main character is a silent protagonist, which I typically don't like, but in this case I could put myself in his shoes quite easily since a large part of the game is simulation.<br /><br />As for the gameplay, a lot of it is tied to the story which contains some spoilers, so I'll just say that it's very fun, but gets repetitive at times. It's not the game's strongest suit for sure. I played it on Normal setting and still had some trouble at certain bosses, but overall it's not too difficult and doesn't require too much grinding.<br /><br />Since the game is truly a mix of simulation and RPG, I'll admit that at the start I was both confused and skeptical. I didn't really get \\"into it\\" until maybe 5 or 6 hours into the game. Afterwards I couldn't put the game down and played it during any free time I had. 60 hours later I've beaten the game. I cried just because it ended. So if you're finding that the game is kind of slow at the start, just trust me and give it some time.<br /><br />TLDR - One of the best games ever. Buy now and play the **** out of it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is the same file manager I use on my Android phone and I was really glad to find it for the Kindle!<br />Very intuitive use allowing you to unzip files, view files, move files, create folders etc.  Pretty much anything you want to do with a file on your Kindle.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This CD exceeded my expectations. As what I read on Wikipedia after purchasing the cd is that album is cannot be categorized by just one genre of music. It covers a large spectrum and for every genre that a songs exists in is unique in itself. I love this album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this second book was much more interesting than the first. The first one doesn't get good until chapter 5 and you have to push yourself to me rip reading but once you read the second book is hard to put down. I recommend this book to a mature audience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb sandwich it is like a newer version of temple run the only thing I don't like is how u have to collect like 200 things to get a character
1401322786|4.0|Albom has written just a few books in his career as a fiction writer.  He has another really successful career as a sportswriter.  His first book, and the first of his that I read, was Tuesdays with Morrie, which was a chronicle of a series of interviews he did with one of his favorite college professors who was dying of Lou Gherig's disease.  Morrie was an important part of Mitch's life, although they had not seen each other for many years, through these interviews they were able to reconnect.  The experience was something amazing, and touches the reader in an incredible way.  Morrie Schwartz had so much to give, this book has educated millions of readers to many important life lessons he shared with Albom.  Albom was once a student in his class, yet these lessons have far transcended that classroom.<br /><br />His newest book takes on a similar theme.  All of his books seem to have a religious tone (especially Have a Little Faith, in which faith itself is questioned).  In Morrie, one is reminded to cherish time with family and friends, and to do something important and memorable.  In Time Keeper Albom is stressing something similar.  The main character in the book is Father Time.  You have a sense of who this individual is in the beginning of the story, and throughout the book the scope of his power - and curse are understood.<br /><br />Father Time began, in what seems a short time after the lives of Adam and Eve, to have experimented with time measurement.  Like Adam and Eve, his knowledge of the world around him was somewhat limited.  Another comparison is made between him and the two who were kicked out of the Garden of Eden, he is cursed for having measured time.  Instead of relishing life, he questioned God, his place in the universe, and his own existence.<br /><br />Time was meant to be infinite, until Father Time began to measure it.  His curse is to live forever, while his friends and family die he continues on.  He also begins to hear the pleas of everyone in the world asking for more time - for themselves, from their loved ones, to do things left undone before their time is over.  Eventually, through thousands of years of this cursed existence, he finds redemption - the possibility of helping two individuals who had each made a plea for more time.  These two people could not be more different - one a young girl trying to win the affections of a boy who seems out of her league, and an older man who is dying and leaving behind a devoted wife of many years.<br /><br />This book reminds us to cherish the time we have here on earth - with our friends, family, those who mean the most to us.  It also gives hope to those whose time has run out, of what awaits us when the last grain of sand in the hourglass (one of Father Time's most important tools) has passed.  I recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed Albom's other books - or to new readers who could use a little encouragement, a reminder of how connected we are as people, or anyone who could just use a smile!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|It sounds so clear.  I just listen to it all day long.  It is very clear.  sounds like the singers arer ight in front of you.  I don't need my jam box any more.  All of the music is right at your finger tips.  Love Love Love it.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|I havent seen this movie since the 1990's and I loved Madonna in this role. She was hilarious and I love the DVD quality. This was certainly a great buy. My teenage daughters loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great way to kill time. Good for hand eye coordiation.  Would reccomend to anyone who likes puzzles and has some idle time.
B00AW0KGYI|4.0|Withou giving spoilers. The extras are just mins spread out through the movie that extended particular scenes that were taken out of the storyline from the novel. If you've never read the books then this is a great buy. Those little extras are cool for both book and movie fans. But I much rather just stayed with my original copy of BD1 with an extra scene option then buying another movie altogether.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Les enfants adorent y jouer. Il est simple et addictif. Et pour moi aussi c'est agréable. Je le recommande. Merci !
B000095K7A|5.0|The level of audio fidelity gained from listening to vinyl version of this album is well worth the purchase price.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I loved this story.  However, the initial description of the story in the Kindle bookstore was completely wrong.  It had nothing to do with the actual story and even the name of the character was incorrect.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I LOVE this show - it has everything anyone would enjoy viewing - drama, love, suspense, agnst, death. I hate that Matthew was killed and right when he found out he had a son and heir...but since the actor playing him wanted out I understand why they killed him off now.  However, I know it will break my heart to see everyone's reaction - both upstairs and down - how devastating.  I STRONGLY recommend this entire series to everyone. BRAVO PBS!!!
B002ZG980U|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and loved it. Wanted to own it. It was delivered fast and in perfect condition. DVD works great!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this simply as a launcher for media files, so I cannot speak to the mile-long-list of features this app comes with.  This is perfect for gaining access to the filesystem, and I would say it is very well written; I have not had a single problem with the software.
B001223BLU|4.0|Frankie Valle and The 4 Seasons, all original for all times. go for it and you will not regret it. Great job Amazon.

B0054SMID0|5.0|I appreciate the fact that Icould watch a high energy movie and not be bombarded with course language and nudity.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The game is very fun that you can actually play as many runs as you can because the runs are very smooth and I love the hot air balloon because it has great graphics!! I recommend this app for kids, they will totally love this game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am absolutely hooked!! I love the film location-That it's an actual castle in England. I love the story lines and the characters. I appreciate the way scenes are tastefully done without blood, gore and steamy sex. I can't wait for the new season to begin. And when is Season 3 going to be a available on Prime? I managed to watch it on PBS website before they took it down but my husband hasn't seen it yet.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I enjoy this app very much. Helps on an everyday basis. Accurate weather updates and an insight to what tomorrow brings.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. What a riveting story. The author writes with such emotion that you feel like you're living it with the characters. Can't wait to read more from Colleen Hoover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to any one I know. It was one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't wait to read more each time I had to stop reading.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show! The third season is way more intense than the previous two seasons. I also like that it doesn't follow the book completely.<br />I don't have cable so I find it very affordable to get the episodes using Amazon.
1451695195|5.0|I have just began to read this book but it is very interesting to me how he found his real family...Not done yet...but so far love the book
0307394549|5.0|I like Martha Stewart&#34;s recipes. They are all fantastic. The pictures  are  well done and artistic, and it makes a bif difference to have them with the recipes.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Am not really happy I guess, it will NOT download.  Amazon says I already have it, not on my Kindle Fire HD as of now!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Maybe I'm just getting old, I don't know, but I find myself drawn to the pace and characters in this show. The story lines are usually interesting; however, I am very upset at the way season 3 ends. Fellows is such a good writer and the production team does such a good job that I think they could have managed the ending better. Very disappointing, there. Still, I can't wait for the next season.<br />The DVD arrived in a timely manner and in fine condition.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|a really good, interesting movie.  I find it hard to believe that this happened and for years we didnt know about it, or at least most of us didnt.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I didn't watch this show when it was originally on TV, but enjoyed Downton Abbey so much, I thought I try the Brit experience from this angle. FT is so crazy, as you might expect from any John Cleese [sic?] presentation. My young daughter enjoyed it so much, she has watched it a couple of times.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The strangest game I have ever played.  I don't recommend this game to be played at home alone and/or before bed.  Your mind will play tricks on you and your nightmares will feel real.  Play with caution.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My wife and daughter have emmersed themselves in the Monster High concept and seem to be enjoying all the different facets of it. I have to admit the dolls seem interesting and a nice break away from the boring Barbie concept. I didn't watch the movies, but they did and found them, in my daughter's estimation, &#34;awesome!&#34; They look forward to more MH movies.As for the buying experience, the DVD arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very happy with Facebook on my Kindle HD fire...works very simply and easy to understand, very atisfied with this Ap.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it in the theater. The different editions are OK. Personally I enjoy them all.<br />This has them all in one set. Great deal for an awesome experience.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|In this movie, Bond is old, out of shape, with little to no gadgets…is this even a bond movie?  Bad story, and Bond girls were barely a part of the movie.  Its been downhill since Casino Royale.
B004RE29PO|5.0|The best of the four movies by far. Personally I don't even think about 3 or 4. Great ride throughout and very well done.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best series on TV right now.  Have to watch it from the beginning to end to really enjoy it though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like the game. I really don't care for waiting to get more coins or purchase but it does keep my son intertwined for a while.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I like this because I can target one muscle group or all, at the same time. Anywhere from 5 to 10 min at a time for my busy schedule.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|If you are looking for a great story please pick up this book. Patrick Rothfuss has an amazing clevernes and turning phrase that it so refreshing in this day and age of recycled fodder that seems to be in most books. It is almost impossible to put this book down. This is story telling at it's finest.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Leaving for Las Vegas can be described as a thorn of roses with the sweet intimacy of two psychotic individuals wrapped in their seemingly war torn roles of addiction.  Leaving for Las Vegas had some unexpected twist that left the reader confused about which character to write about, Sera, Ben, or Yuri.  Ben is a depressed, distraught, alcoholic, trapped in a downward spiral with every intent of suicide through his drunken binges.  He made an interesting point of drinking to kill or aiming to kill to drink.  Although, the movie does not really set the stage why he drinks, he seems lost and destitude over his past.  Ben is alcohol dependent and realizes that his behaviors lead to destruction, but his love for Sera won't change the playing field--he understands his position as an alcoholic and Sera's role as a hooker.<br /><br />The gift--his flask reinforces Sera's acceptance of Ben's drinking--neither, attempts to get in the way of the other.  Wrestling with insecurities, this couple is mesmerized in their comfort zones, until his violent psychotic behavior emerges.  Realizing their dark past, each crossed over into the darkest places of their lives needing to be loved for who they were.  These two were enablers of their conditions seemingly beyond rehabilitation and unwilling to change.  At the bottom of the binge the source of the drinking problem is revealed--a broken marriage.  Sera, was in therapy addressing her need to be loved, but her livelihood became her addiction, and addiction that almost cost her life.  Ultimately, Ben's drinking killed him.  Sad ending to this awe driven movie--thorns of roses.<br /><br />In review, Ben suffered from psychosis of false realities appearing real.  Perhaps, his profession became his reality that led to alcoholism in order to cope with the denial.  His psychotic symptoms were displayed in the hallucinations and delusions, hearing things, talking to people, etc.  Ben was more likely to be suffering from a psychotic depression without a system of care.  His system of care became believing to knowing that his symptoms were going to kill him and held on to the hope of knowing that Sera would not leave him.  Their moments were filled will periods of bliss that he had not experienced in a long time other than his delusional thinking.<br /><br />Ben's condition was acute and required residential detoxification for a period of time in which he could receive appropriate medical treatment.  Alcoholism, if not treated medically can kill--in Ben's case, it was his fate.  His moment of change came too late.  Further, Ben's psychotic symptoms could not be treated until he was substance free.  Mental health symptoms are masked by substance use.  In aftercare,  an appropriate treatment modality for Ben is cognitive behavioral therapy.  Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat alcoholism, delusional thinking, depression and the like.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is great for people who love strategy games and just fun in general. The game is great for its price and I have played it countless times. Keep it up, Ndemic Creations!
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is a great writer and every book I have read of his holds my attention.  Couldn't put the book down until I finished it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's the real kindle one cause it says kindle on the cord. It is not a fake like there have been out there. I love it. Works just like the original
1400069289|5.0|I bought this as an audio book and it was so good that I ended up staying in my car sometimes to hear to the end of the chapter. Pretty impressive to write in a way that can take scientific research exciting.

B006R1T40I|5.0|I purchased this due to Mike Finnegan being on it -- and it is wonderful. These cats are very smooth.
0316069434|3.0|And I liked this one too, but not as much as some of the earlier stuff.  As always, Bosch gets his man.
B00122DF16|5.0|A perfect blend of remixes to follow up their debut album. This album really shows what the band is capable of. A must have for Linkin Park fans.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a fun solitaire game and it was free. I play almost daily. I have several other games but like this the best.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Wanted to get that outta the way first(title) I am a HUGE FAN OF ALL THINGS HORROR,AND AM QUITE THE HORROR \\"PURIST\\" i.e.-No twilight or anne rice bulls***...OK,with that all said THIS GAME IS AT THE LEAST UNNERVING,AND AT TIMES SCARY! Very atmospheric,and creepy.It's what you DON'T see that terrifies.The gameplay itself is not much,but I feel that's the point.You're in it for the experience.Plus the \\"controls\\" SUCK.Whoever developed this game SHOULD get into filmmaking,as they would be excellent at scaring the holy hell outta people.The five stars is for look,mood,sound,concept of the \\"game\\"Come to think of it,this IS a game of sorts,a \\"mind game\\",and that gets five stars too.Actual game PLAY,one and a half stars.DESPITE THIS,YOU SHOULD AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT FOR SOME GOOD CHILLS,BE IT A FAOTD,OR $$$.
B003VXRD4E|5.0|Having reviewed several versions made of David Copperfield, and having seen an older B&W version, we found the recommendation of this production to be the best choice.  We have watched it twice and agree this production definitely is the one to purchase, staying true to Dickens' written work, with great choice of cast and excellent script.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I generally enjoy Grisham's work.  While the story was a good read, I dislike plots that are explained after the fact.  Like M. Night' Shyamalan's Sixth Sense, the viewer finds out he's been led to believe a set of things based on a lack of information that is only revealed at the end of the tale.  To me this was the literary equivalent.
B004R36QUE|5.0|We saw the film in theatres (~2008), and it is great to have it to view again.  Excellent cast, talent, script. Provides great insights into King George VI the man, his country, and the turbulent times into which he was born to lead, despite what appears to be overwhelming, insurmountable handicap odds.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved this Love Story. Another heart pounding book with a wonderful unexpected ending!  Go on a twist and turn journey with Beth and Thiabault that will leave you wanting more, more, more!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I'd have given it four and a half, actually.  I loved it and hope/expect it will be made into a movie.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|It was not the best mystery I have ever read.  But it was entertaining and had some twists and turns I did not anticipate.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|When actor Dan Stevens decided that he wanted to leave Downton Abbey for other projects, it tore a major chunk out of the personality mix as well as the storyline of this wonderful yarn. To compensate, author Julian Fellowes  wrote in the birth of the new heir to the title and estate. I wonder in retrospect, if actor Stevens would have wanted to leave had he known what the response to the millions of DA fans there would be.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The dialogue is very good, and the characters are reacting like real people, and how family members actually react to each other.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I mainly got this to simply have a calculator on my Kindle.  Don't need one all that often, but nice to have it handy.  I did play with it a bit, seemed to work well, and thus more than meet my needs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|loved it all, story, costumes,characters, settings.  it is delightful, and exciting as well ,  the plot is believable and unpredictable.
B007RI56NY|4.0|This is great music to play during parties or get-togethers. Not to loud, not the kind of stuff that might distract patrons from socializing. Plus, most of us know their radio songs by now (&#34;Drive By&#34; and &#34;50 Ways...&#34;). A lot of their songs sound similar to each other, but I knew that before I bought the album (thanks, Slacker Premium). All-in-all, this is a great way to spend $5.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you enjoy character based dramas with hints of action and comedy thrown in, this horror based show is for you. If you're interested in a full review, there are tons of professional ones that will tout the virtues of this series. Suffice it to say that season 3 continues in the tradition this series has built of always surprising the audience with a variety of things, not the least of which is what a person will do once stressed to the breaking point. I've loved the show from its onset and still do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|entertaining, interesting, thought provoking. If you are interested in survival, you ought to read this.  It is an adventure about your future.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love to read, but rarely take time to read because of work and my daughter.  However, once I started rereading Pride and Prejudice, I made time to read.  I had, like everyone I know, read Pride and Prejudice in high school.  Now that I am older I can understand the complex relationships, formal attitude of the characters, importance of reputation and language of that era.  The character development WAS the book.  This is not a suspenseful or sexually provocative book, it is a book that delves into the psyche of its main character with the draw being how this character holds true to her values and beliefs.  I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Between the cinematography, the story telling and the casting, this is by far one of the best movies ever made. Tim Burton is a visionary, Ewan McGregor is perfect as Edward Bloom.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series.  The relationships you build with the characters in the first book carry over.  I love a book that can evoke emotion from me and this one definitely did that.  It has a great balance of suspense and understated romance.  Just an enjoyable read.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|The saving grace of this movie is the gorgeous men and the fact that Channing Tatum is a phenomenal dancer.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Loved this movie, liked the traditional values that are lacking in so many movies these days! Kept it old school to the comics
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is great it is a must have it's scary and suspenseful just trust me get this game slender follows you and pops up to make you jump
B004J88SGC|5.0|The DVD is amazing!  Great songs, sound, picture, and guest artists!  Enjoyed every minute!  Best $16 I've spent in a long time!
0811879542|5.0|Perfect for toddlers and pre-schoolers! So different than any other book we have. We loved it so much, bought it for all the cousins too!
0739375970|4.0|Last book I won't be a spoiler. The story continues, this is a complex multi threaded tale. Great characters,good plot(s), Audio version great voices, though alittle confusing at first to American ears.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Must see!!!!!!! I love this movie. Awesome from beginning to end. I've only seen it say 4x. Neva get tired of it
0449011917|5.0|The story continues, this is a complex multi threaded tale. Great characters,good plot(s), what will happen next??? Audio version great voices, though alittle confusing at first to American ears.
B004MPR80E|5.0|Take a deep breath if you are a cancer sufferer as I was, and read this hefty, sometimes ghastly, but always informative book.  I was dumb with disbelief at the history of cancer, and thoroughly glad I was not born in those early learning days.  This is not a pussy-footing history, it is all bared and laid out on the table, and some of it is really dreadful, but learning about how radiation came to be a tool in frying my cancer was amazing, - a decidedly scarey.  In my own case I had three times the &#34;normal&#34; dose of radiation for a particular reason, and 10 years later I am now suffering the results of that overdose.  Scarring of bladder, (is there more? - fragile bones in the hip and pelvic area, but already another 10 years of life that I would not have had but for that radiation - (is there more?)  I don't like what I have, but it is so much less than those brave people who strived to invent a &#34;cure&#34; for cancer. This book makes grave reading, but thank you Siddhartha - this is a monumental book.
0307913090|5.0|The start of the saga, this is a complex multi threaded tale. Great characters,good plot(s), what will happen next??? Audio version great voices, though alittle confusing at first to American ears.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Good read, crazy twists but still very relatable to anyone in a relationship, I hope all her books are this good
0449011909|5.0|The story continues, this is a complex multi threaded tale. Great characters,good plot(s), what will happen next??? Audio version great voices, though alittle confusing at first to American ears.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Very good app, never had any problems with it. Like what you can do with it and sharing your photos is easy.
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Anything Stevie Ray is worth getting. I have the original Texas Flood but I just had to have this one also. And of course it holds up to his standardss!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Oh wow. I still have my heart in my throat. At first when I started this game I thought it was gonna be boring and easy. But then when I got further down the road & got to the first building... lets just say, I \\"eeep\\"ed. That was awesome. I'v never reacted like that to a game before. So So good. I'm gonna go back & see if I can make it further on easy mode. Maybe turn on the fog. Make it day time. Lots of variations to try. The options include special effects on/off, day/night, fog on/off, and difficulty: easy, medium or hard. Each one can change how easy or difficult it is. I'm really surprised this is the free app of the day today. They don't usually pick the better games to offer for free. I had been wanting to get this one for sometime now but didn't want to risk spending even just the .99¢ on a boring game. Now that I know how good it is, I'd pay $1.99. If it had more levels I'd even pay $2.99. I got real lucky with this one, an awesome game for FREE! The reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars was that it doesn't give u very good instructions for how to move around. I had to figure them out by trial & error. FYI left side of the screen is to move forward/back & left/right. Right side of the screen is for aiming, looking up & down & turning around. I also didn't give it 5 stars because it only has 2 locations. But I still HIGHLY recommend this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game. Soothing music. I would recommend this cuz it makes you exercise your brain. I'm tired of getting the rating reminder. Hope this will make them happy.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Well, it was and is a little scary to me, and it's fun too. I find it playable and entertaining game, and it's free as well via an Amazon offer. There is some claims of 'fake' reviews, but mine isn't. I like the game and if chapter 2 comes out, I'll be buying it, that's for sure! It's fun, and scary. A good mix for me.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Kids really enjoyed this and some nice retro references for mom and dad! Great to see a hero learn that success is less about things and more about helping others.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This was a cute, predictable film with a so-so plot.  But it's handled well.  The ending is pretty good.  It's nice to see JG-L back as an adult.  This was a perfect platform for getting the word out that he has returned to the Third Rock and is calling his fan base back.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so much fun! I can't stop playing it! It's pretty addicting. To be able to build your own town the way you want it is the greatest feeling of accomplishment!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|It's time to retire  Alice.  What started as a great franchise is now is becoming more and more insipid with each new flick.  Another case of milking the cow or not knowing how to stop while you're ahead.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the movie, loved the book even more! Highly recommend this book for any age reader. Lots of suspense and excitement!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game! I love it! The graphics are really  clear and pretty, you should definitely get it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is one of the better games I've played. I really enjoyed playing and the graphics looked great on my Kindle Fire!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Now this game is very good!! It keeps you on your toes.  We play this game at camp, with our children.  Its alot of fun.  I would certainly recommend this one...Thanks Amazon...
B009K0P10K|5.0|I can't get enough of this series. I started out watching season 1 on Netflix, then I bought a few episodes on amazon to get caught up on season 2. I'm finally caught up but I hate that I have to wait tip Sunday night to see an episode. Give this series a try, you won't be disappointed.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|The boom was very action packed.  Kept me very interested and wanting to read more.  Wish the ending would have been a little better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a awesome game it is addicting. I have seen no reports that this game is bad .get  it. It<br /> is an awesome game. Sometimes you mess up and you say &quot;l hate this game!!&quot; But trust me folks we all know  love this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb,this is way better than temple run and they have world tour<br />too ,temple run to make a 2 but subway surfers has a world tour<br /><br />LOVE IT but on kindle fire you have to star all over again to get the other places in the world tour
B002G917ZK|1.0|I wanted to see this movie for a few years, finally watched it and was totally disappointed.  From my perspective, it's nothing more than a disturbed young woman who is extremely  dependent on men.  It was boring, unbelievable and the same old story.  Maybe it was &#34;cutting edge&#34; at  its time, but by today's standards, it is &#34;ho hum&#34; at best.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was an Excellent book! It had a lot of unexpected twist and I Could not put it down. Great read!
B00BHMF578|4.0|The only thing I really liked about this movie was ALAN ARKIN.  He is such a great  actor - he is outstanding in this movie!  Best picture for 2012?  I don't see it....but many times I don't agree with the Academy Awards.  Too much of a popularity contest, in my opinion.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|All of you people saying it won't show up in your inventory is because you have to exit out of your save world first then 're enter and you'll see the changes.
B0036UW09U|5.0|Streisand and Kristofferson...how could you go wrong?  By today's standards, it may be a little dated, but it's still a great movie.  The music is outstanding, with Streisand's voice being perfect, as usual.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Kept you guessing, not the normal plot. On movies i watch on a daily basis, you always can guess the next scene, but in this one, it keeps you guessing and i loved the ending. It shows how one man can put his life on the line and save hundreds of others, how one person can make a difference, that we all are connected in one way or another thru our actions on a daily basis.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Love this game. Lots of fun. Easy to use. Has new characters with some new abilities and I love being able to use a the ship from time to time. One of the best bird games yet.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accurate, precise, and great weather alerts. Don't need to watchr listen to weather reports any more. Would like to see times and temps listed for a two or three day period instead of scrolling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game I think that lots of people should get subway surfers because it is fun and entertaining.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is great in this film. It has an interesting story even though it gets confusing at a couple of points. I enjoyed it and thought it was definitely worth watching.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Plan a party, get a new excercise routine, plan a seven course meal, plan a new wardrobe, view art or photography, discover new products, plan a vacation, and so much more. Inspirational and addictive! Great app!
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I gave 3 stars because I've been a Who fan for many years, I've seen them perform many times, I have all their albums, buying them over and over on vinyl, 8-track, cassette and now iTunes. I was really anxious to read this book. I was disappointed. Much the same as i was disappointed by Keith Richards' book. I'd say its a book written by Pete Townshend for Pete Townshend. I had read other reviews saying similar things - I might have been a little biased by that. But I really felt that he was just skimming the surface on most of what I wanted to know. Maybe he's saving it for another book. Maybe I was looking for the memoir of the Who. This is not that.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Good movie, great ending. The movie was a lot better that I thought it would be. It has good elements to it.

1476734941|5.0|Incredibly easy to read. Such a smart idea. Great reference tool as well for those keen on following this eating plan. Not a diet but a potential lifestyle.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving this a go.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game got a little tireing but with the new update there have bean less glithes and now they hve 2 new worlds
0345803493|1.0|Against my better judgement I thought I would give book 2 of this series a go.<br /><br />What a dead loss. Still poor writing style with the phrase &#34;oh my&#34; the most over used in written history.<br /><br />But that is not all. There is no story. It is plain boring.<br /><br />Lets face it these books are over-rated and simply written to titillate. For me they are pointless and certainly if titillation is what I was looking for there is far better books available.<br /><br />I did not finish it. I could not finish it. I will never finish it.
052118939X|5.0|The book was an excellent buy. The pages have a good quality. It's more than I expected. I'm just thinking about to buy someone else. Great.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Way better than the tv show.<br /><br />I do like the tv show too..<br /><br />Walt and Henry have a great friendship.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Hitchcock was a real and rather flawed person. This movie reveals how a well-matched couple can work as a team to achieve lofty goals. It is very well-acted, of course, with a satisfying conclusion. Another tale of the woman behind the man.....
B004LWZW42|5.0|Great movie, great price. I don't know what else I could say. This is my favorite film from the X Men franchise.
1452113432|5.0|I have cooked some the recipes in book and they were very tasty.  Caught her BBC show and she is clever and adorable also a really good chef.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I really joyed the characters. It was fun to read. I took a chance buying this book and I'm glad I did. Well worth it!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Son loves this, and takes it with him to his friends house.  XBOX-360 It is safely packed in the case, and is a portable entertainment system. We couldn't afford the HALO system, which is a step up, but this case is great!  Good job guys!
B009MJU8P2|5.0|This is a very good poise for the hippo. With his mouth open to show off his great teeth and the depth of his mouth. He has been a great teaching tool for my grandsons, It helps them understand why a hippo is the most dangerous animal in Africa. His coloring is also very good. This is a very nice addition to my collection.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Read for book club, was a good depiction of the issues of the  time -- slavery vs indentured --- had a good disscussion
0439023491|5.0|And you thought \\"The Hunger Games\\" was a great book?! Wait until you read \\"Catching Fire\\". Collins has done it again. She's drawn you into a story, given you love, suspense, drama, action. She's made you feel anger, sadness, happiness, hope and all with a sense of rebellion. I'm fairly positive that I said \\"what?!\\" aloud every other chapter. This book has so many twists, turns and unexpected scenes that you don't know where Collins will take you next. It's a fabulous read. However, like my other review of \\"Hunger Games\\" I still say this is too violent for young children to read. You thought the first book had violence? Nope! I can only imagine how this book will transfer to the big Hollywood screen because it is action packed from chapter 1. I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either!
B002X3V4P2|5.0|One doesn't have to be an Enya fan to enjoy being saturated by this effort.  Though I admit to being a huge fan of Enya's music and all Celtic, Irish, Scottish old and new music.  In fact, I would suggest this compiliation of Enya music to anyone who is in need of relaxation and a place to go to find deliverance from the oppresive state of today's world.  Light candles, pour a glass of your favorite wine, find a favorite place of peace and calm in your home, take a deep breath, exhale and inhale fresh air, soft strokes, subtle wisps of silk against your skin all in the form of music.  Enya's music!  For the Enya fan, what's not to like?  It's all of the best of her music in one place.  You'll find yourself in Hobbitton, Lothlorien and the Misty Mountains, places you've visited before with Enya.  For you who are looking for the occasional escape, you'll enjoy the journey.  Be careful!  You may not want to come back!<br /><br />I downloaded &#34;The Very Best Of Enya&#34; (Deluxe-Amazon Exclusive) onto my Kindle Fire.  No shipping.  Just a click, and I was reading &#34;A Dance With Dragons&#34;, with &#34;The Very Best Of Enya&#34; as  the backdrop.  Sublime!
0439023513|5.0|After the first two books Collins really leaves you hanging. At first, I almost found \\"Mockingjay\\" to be a bit slow. But all Collins was doing was prepping the reader with the proper back story they would need in order to follow her throughout the rest of the book. When Mockingjay picks up it picks up fast! There are many twists and turns in the story line that left me wondering \\"Why'd she do that?! Now what'll happen?\\" There are many negative reviews of this book and I don't understand why. No, there is no fairytale ending and yes, a lot of people that you liked and felt a bond with died. Isn't that a sign of a good author? One that makes you feel for the characters in the book, make you feel like they're alive and when/if they do die or something happens to them that is less severe - you are concerned or upset? I think so. There are many character changes in this book. Their demeanor starts to change, but you know what? After all they've been through that is a side affect of war. War changes people and they're never the same again. The PTSD affects them so badly that they have a hard time adjusting to a normal life without the fighting and without the war surrounding them. I think that this is exactly what Collins portrayed in this book, especially with Katniss. Nope, she's not the strong fighter we saw in the first book, she's more of a puppet. But you know what? You wouldn't be strong either if you went through all that she did. War is a terrible thing and for those who go through it for years and come out alive, don't come out unscathed. Though they may be ok physically, there' so much psychological scarring that maybe some do walk around in a haze just to get by. The reader doesn't get the ending that they wish for, but the ending suffices. The ending shows us how things really are in life. Sometimes, no matter how badly you want something you just have to settle with what's in front of you and move on. Excellent read and I think Collins shows us the effects of war well and true to point. Well done! I couldn't be happier with how this trilogy ended.f war well and true to point. Well done! I couldn't be happier with how this trilogy ended.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Fans of fantasy genre will love season two as they loved season one and will be drooling for season three to hurry and come out.  George RR Martin's &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is a masterfully woven tale of power, intrigue, betrayal, murder, sex, violence magic and horror&#34;.  If I left something out, not to worry you won't miss it.  If you are a fan of the fantasy, you'll discover your own journey.  I have read all the books, and while the screen writers take some license, it's not enough to tamper with the story.  I have read reviews from other lovers of genre who are disappointed with some of the scenes in the book not addressed in the movies.  I'm like this, &#34;Who Cares?!&#34;,  &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is MMM-good!  Someone actually told me recently, they quit reading the books because there is no ending.  Here's the deal.  &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is a serial !  So, when ordering, make sure to get the first season.  When reading, make sure to read all of the books.....and yes Virginia, there is a 6th book.  Here comes my complaint, the sixth book isn't due out until 2015.  Hey Martin!  If you're going to write such great stuff, could you light a fire under it please?  Seriously, there are five books so far, and unless HBO et al wimps out, they will back the production of all of the books, into made for television films.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I watched the movie before I read the book. After \\"The Hunger Games\\" was released everyone was talking about it! So, of course, I had to see what the buzz was about. This movie was fantastic. It kept you in your seat the entire time and was really entertaining. The only thing I didn't care for (and it's just me!) was that people were taking their children to see this. I mean like 7-11 year olds! I also worked with a woman who's daughter was 11 and she said \\"well, she saw the movie and liked it, so I just bought her the books because she wanted to read it\\". What!? No! This movie is too violent for young children and at times made me wince. But what do you do? These are the same folks who read Harry Potter to their 4 year old. Anyway! Great movie. No, it doesn't give a lot of detail and I really noticed that after I read the book. I think they could have spared just a few moments and introduced some characters and given their backstory. And for goodness sakes, couldn't they have at least done the scene where Katniss got the mockinjay pin correctly? Very disappointed that the director really skimmed over that and made something else up entirely. Of course, Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job. She's a great actress and I can't wait to see how the other two installments turn out.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I Liked &#34;Brave&#34; as a nice way to spend an evening.  This is for lovers of fairytales.  The animation is fabulous, colors brillant and alive.  The story is much like Disney's &#34;Brother Bear&#34;.  That's okay.  In terms of appeal, it's very kind to women and little girls, as a &#34;You can do anything you want to do story&#34;.  It's interesting to see the mother/daughter relationship highlighted and built upon, and treated with respect.  Mothers and daughters may want to consider this movie for a special time together, while Dad and the boys bond over a hunting trip or trip to the local pizza parlor.
0439023521|5.0|I was one of the many who saw the movie and THEN read the book. However, even though I knew what was coming and how it all ended I still could not put this book down. Collins has a way of writing that makes you turn to the next page and then she'll leave you with a cliff hanger to make you continue reading to the next chapter. Excellent read!! She has almost a George Orwell \\"1984\\" feel to her writings, which I love, and this really surprised me due to the popularity of the books. Most people don't read Orwell for fun or think that there are no way his writings could predict the future, though they have. So when I realized that Collins' books had the same feel to them, I was very surprised that the majority liked them so much. Granted her writings are so far fetched that we could not imagine them happening...but what it?! Ahhh well, I digress. Excellent read. I think it's very violent so no, I would not read these books to my 6-11 year olds, though I sure many people do. The book divulges so much detail that the movie simply could not express. End result? Buy it and enjoy!!
B000002KEV|5.0|It has and always be one of my favorite albums from when I was a teen. It brings back a lot of memories.

B007712XAU|1.0|Disc 3 was missing part 9 - leaves you totally up in the air with no logical end to season 2 - very poor production not worthy of this marvelous series.
B00000IZOR|5.0|My one, two and even my five year old boys have really enjoyed playing with this toy. I highly recommend it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|For some reason, my Kindle Fire stopped accepting my Yahoo mail and refused to let me use my calender... This fixed everything for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app - only one complaint...the Kindle Fire doesn't get the videos included on the newest version. Please, please update the app for the Kindle Fire, so that we can have the video options too! Other than that, it's my favorite app and I use it all the time! I really appreciate the many translations available and the ease of use. It's a great companion to use in my regular Bible studies and I highly recommed it to anyone serious about Bible study and growth!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dee Dee

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great dealing with the horse and teaching it how to do great tricks and very high jumps which is a lot of fun. The game also keeps you occupied so I doubt that you 'll be bored or unentertained

B0064X7FVE|4.0|when I go on it is great some times it freeks by keeping the old weather. on that location so I have to delete location and but in zip for it. also I can't find the mpoint spot on this app but on my phone I can.
B000NH7SZ0|4.0|I bought the module for my HP Laser Jet CP1525 nw Colour Printer.<br />It didn't work on initial installation and the printer would not even start up so I figured the module was defective. When I removed it, the printer fired up as usual. Finally, after reading the directions (I'm a Man) and realizing I probably hadn't used enough force to seat the module, I reinstalled the module as per instructions and sure enough, every thing worked as advertised.<br />I wanted to share my issues with the Module installation because some purchasers had problems and I was wondering if they'd done the same thing I did.<br />In any case, I've been using the module for a couple of weeks now and while there is a great improvement in the speed the print jobs go to the printer,I find no real improvement in the actual print speed. That may be because I print PDF's with a lot of graphics. ie Utility bills, Vender invoices, etc. and they are usually one offs.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I really liked the first one and this one didn't disappoint. I actually liked it better than the first one because it has more action. Hope they make another one.
B004UID2LC|1.0|DON'T GET THIS APP!!! It may seem cool at first to download music from the web, but don't be fooled. After having the app for a week my kindle started actin weird. I wasn't able to fast forward my music and my Kindle wouldn't turn on when I charged it. I immediately idmeadiatly uninstalled it.<br /><br />If you want to get this app fine, but don't say I didn't warn you! : 
B004HXIZVC|5.0|SO glad i can access my music on my kindle. now my friend can jam to some tunes that i have found on the internets. :)
B00BESM14U|4.0|somewhat like my Highschool expeience except they had way more disposable income then I ever did. Just sayin overall it was a good movie.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I downloaded the drives as instructed an had it installed within minutes. Using to manage switches and routers that require serial port connectivity. Had no issues with the product.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Worth watching, I dont think it was as good as the first two. follows the same basic formula as the other two.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|A great introduction for a follow-on Superman, Metropolis, or Lois and Clark TV series. The Homecoming, Isis, Booster and Finale were my favorite episodes.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|this is a great game. it just needs to be a little faster. it takes forever to earn money. other than that i love it.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I read the preview of this book and thought it seemed like a food book. A few pagers in I realized it was a GREAT book. It's inspiring and spiritual. Although the ultimate sacrifice made by Adam was known, I couldn't help put get the message of hope through perseverance.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|Jennifer best all in one CD. so danceable. the best selections of songs . it's like a greatest hits for dance and more

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I waited to see this at home and I was happy I did cuz I got to see it twice
B006O3MU96|1.0|I downloaded this app for my toddler's Uniden tablet that she got for Christmas from my mother. It's not appropriate for the little ones, and there is no educational value to it. It is a perfect waste of time, if you enjoy that sort of mindless fun and have time to kill, though.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Great book!<br /><br />  Dave Kerpen seems to have a knack for delivering quality, relevant information in a manor of which lay can digest.  I purchased this book in print for both myself and an employee after finding the Audible version both useful and enjoyable. Overall, Likeable Social Media does well to frame effective social method with reason and context.  The book will help you better understand the WHYs and HOWs of creating compelling and engaging social campaigns  -understanding = succeeding.  No silver bullets here, rather, here is how to approach, think about and execute your social campaigns for success...all-the-while, entertaining and easy to follow.  This book will set you on your path to social righteousness!  Bravo!<br /><br />Jon M. Pauley
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Being  late to discover this series,  I watched the first 3 seasons of Downton Abbey back to back, over the course of a few days.  I love this series and was quickly caught up in the lives of all of the characters from the footmen to the wealthy Dowager and found myself laughing and crying right along with all of them.  The background provides a great review of the history of that time period,  and shows the struggles that come with change.  Love this series !
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The producers have done a great job at adapting this series to the modern age. Its not the Sherlock Homes you grew up with, but just as entertaining. Better than the BBC's version &#34;Sherlock&#34; in my opinion.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Yes, you got it, wow, it is the best. The makers of this app really have there stuff together. I like reading a lot so I use it often, almost every day and am very pleased with its abilities. At one point I had some problem with my device and had to reload the software app. WA-LA all my stuff was there, that sure made me happy. I have the feeling that Amazon wants my business and wants us the users to be happy. I currently want to have another tablet specific to travel and just feel after using the Kindle for android that my purchase will be the New Kindle HD.  It does everything that I use on my current tablet, my Xoom so I am going for it. I guess you get the idea that I am happy with Amazon and the Kindle app, you will be as well. Ya, I could go into all sorts of specifics but it is not needed here. Just give this app a try and you will see for yourself.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|It's Bob Seger what else does one need to say? If you enjoy him you will love this cd buy it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|A taut and fast paced thriller that gets loner Jack back to working with the closest thing he had to a real family - his specialized unit, the best if the best. The usual \\"justice by Jack\\" system is heightened here because it is completely personal. But personal feelings won't get in be way of Jack doing what needs to be done. And he does get it done, as only he can...
030758836X|4.0|Oh this book...<br />It's been a long time since I've read a book I couldn't put down. I'd tell myself, \\"I'll finish with this chapter\\" but then the chapter would end on a cliffhanger and I'd have to keep going.<br />The book is divided into three sections.  The first is the POV of husband Nick the day (and subsequent days) his wife disapears, the proceeding chapter will be from Amy's diary detailing their first meeting, early years of marriage, and growing problems.  The second part of the book continues to rotates chapter from Nick's present day to what happened to Amy.  The third part wraps everything up.<br />I was continuously suprised by the twists and reveals in the book.  The characters are not entirely loveable, but, I did love the story, especially Amy's description of a \\"Cool Girl\\".  It's simply wonderful.  One of the themes is how women pretend to be interested or act in a way society and (some) men consider to be ideal (loving beer, Brazilian waxes, and not being \\"clingy\\")and how it's kind of sad women need to put on this show.  Especially at the expense of hiding what you're really feeling or want.<br />As people have said the ending is... not what I wanted.  I don't want to ruin it but it keeps building up this idea that someone is not only an insanely genuis criminal mastermind but also has the most ridiculously luck.  Things keep falling in this persons favor -again and again- and it gets annoying but I'm just waiting for said person to be punished.  Everything keeps building and building, then it abruptly platueas and ends.<br />I do love the author's writing style, critique of relationships, gender roles, and society.  It's pitch perfect until the end, but I would definitely recommend it and read more of her books.
B004LWZW2E|1.0|Honestly, from the descriptions, this looked promising. Unfortunately, and without giving out any spoilers, it's just a poor rehash of Poltergeist, despite all the advances in CGI since then (1982). So if you want to choose, get the original, if you want something recent and different, get Sinister, though that is. quite unpleasant as well as a bit scary. Insidious is going on ebay.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought this dvd for my granddaughter and she loves it. I had it sent to her which even made it more fun. Mail to a 4 year old is exciting.
B004T5K3OK|4.0|I love that I can take my old notebooks, especially from college, and convert them to pdfs<br />The quality is very good!<br />The only thing I don't like is the fact that it is difficult to get the camera angle flat to not distort the text or the page.<br />Not so much an app issue as much as camera issue.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|You'll get addicted to these books fast...believe me I did!  I was thrilled with my purchase and read it all in one night!
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|I have followed the advice in Dr. Cordain's The Paleo Diet for over 6 weeks straight now.  I'm down 9 pounds--which is great--but more importantly, I FEEL more energetic, I'm ready for the world when I hop out of bed (that's a new sensation!), and I'm not tired all the time, nor hungry.<br />Eating fresh, wholesome foods, and removing processed foods, starches and sugars from my diets seemed challenging at first. Habits are hard to change, after all.  But my meals are delicious, and I don't have the afternoon lull anymore, and I'm never hungry.<br />You will HAVE to exercise on this diet, or your body won't know what to do with this change. Your body will burn the fat you eat as long as you plan exercise into your routine.  Good luck!!
B008RKKUZ0|4.0|Haven't watched this movie in a long time, came across this the other day and showed this to my grand kids and they loved it, now they want to watch it over and over again.

B00498YZH8|4.0|Two reasons I watched this the lead actress and it was filmed in Missouri. Liked it but not a movie I would watch again
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The plot lines, the characters, the costumes and production design are far & away the best in television. Adult drama to be sure, but riveting and engaging.

B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I played this game on my first generation Kindle Fire and had no problems with the download. My problems began when I tried to find the hidden objects. Some were easy to find,  but there were many that were hidden to the point of invisibility even though I was using a magnifying glass.  Had there not been a hint button those objects would have been impossible to find. Even when the hint function highlighted the object,  sometimes I still could not see it. I just had to click in the spot it highlighted. Why game developers do this is beyond me. Maybe they are trying to make the game seem harder or make it seem to last longer. I have played many G5 games and enjoyed them,  but this is not one of them.
0345803485|5.0|Gave this book to my mother for Christmas, she prefers paperback. She was very pleased at the condition, being used and all. she carries it everywhere. just as described, book contents also, lol

B00B6OEDS4|5.0|I think my favorite song must be \\"The Fall\\". Great album- a lot has been said about the fact that these sound like women- hey, he sings in a high register. No big! Relaxing and chill album.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Enjoyed the other 2 game but was Leary of spending real money for play money.<br /><br />From what I see, so far, you can earn your growth with patience & play money isn't every expensive compared to other games of this type.
1780387105|4.0|This is a good song book by justinguitar.com.  I also have the beginner course book, which is really good.  This book is a really nice compliment to the youtube videos that Justin has put together and follows really nicely with the beginner course.  The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that I feel like it could be a little better as far as the strumming patterns, which are really hard to determine without watching the youtube videos.  My skill level is beginner/intermediate as I have almost completed the beginner course and I am completely self taught.  I was having a very difficult time progressing until I found the justinguitar.com method.  He is a great instructor and you should buy this book if for no other reason than supporting a great teacher and innovator in the online teaching community.
B000QDYQQ0|3.0|Alien 3(1992) is a good science fiction-horror film. Then again, it'll break your heart if you've seen Alien(1979) and Aliens(1986). Those two films set the bar high. A young David Fincher directed Alien 3. He ended up disowning the film after the studio tampered with it. In Alien 3, Ellen Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) is stuck in a prison on a planet run by the Company. Corporal Hicks and Newt are dead. The android Bishop is damaged beyond repair. Two xenomorph aliens are on the planet hunting the prisoners. Things get worse when Ripley finds out there's an alien queen growing in her stomach!  Alien 3 is dark, violent, and depressing. It's also packed with cursing! Ripley has to shave her head due to the prison crawling with lice. The music by Elliot Goldenthal is decent. The visual effects of the Alien are cheesy, but they are kept to a minimum. Charles S. Dutton is good as a prisoner and Charles Dance plays the prison doctor. Lance Henriksen made a cameo as a human version of Bishop. I used to play Alien 3 on the Super Nintendo. It was a fun video game and it had a similar ending to the film. In the game, Ripley had access to guns and flame throwers! The trailer for Alien 3 promises more James Cameron's Aliens, but it delivered something different. It's not a bad movie.
0061730335|5.0|I am an engineer that has lived in USA all my life and this book really puts into perspective the process of innovation and the ability of humans to over come.  William is a great inspiration and the difficulties he overcame to provide, what we consider, simple convenience for his family is astonishing.  I highly recommend this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was totally surprised by ending....a great gotcha!!! Makes you wonder how many spouses of law enforcement are victims without protection due to 'Code of Blue'....
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|the game is so creepy its really scary once you see slenderman its like you are litterally running for your life. If you want a good scare get this game.
B000026OW3|5.0|It is indeed wonderful to have all of Rubinstein's performances under one roof, so that I can focus on them and compare them with other artists. This is especially true for the Preludes. The recording quality isn't quite what we are accustomed to today, but nevertheless very good for someone used to vinyl records with pops & scratches (none of which are found on these CDs). I truly value Rubinstein's performances and am thrilled to add them to my pantheon of great piano music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm having trouble downloading it I bought it but it wont download please fix this D: I love mine craft
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Great actors but really drags. It was hard to keep watching. Don't recommend to anyone to sit through the film.
B00005ATZT|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it was first released in theatres and I can tell you I was spellbound from beginning to end. The tenacity of Richard Kimball was phenomenal. How he perservered to bring the true killer to justice put me in awe.  I won't go into too much detail concerning the plot. Others have done that here. What I will do is discuss some of the contrivances and please feel free to comment on this if you will. First of all, during the fight with the one armed man there would have been DNA and fibres from the man's clothes left on the stairwell. This would have allowed for some reasonable doubt if he had been charged. I did like the attention to detail concerning Katsulas and his gloves This would have prevented his fingerprints from being left at the scene of the crime. But we must remember that he fired the gun that killed Richard Kimball's wife. Thus Kimball's hands would not have had gunpowder residue. That point would have been brought up at trial and would have created reasonable doubt. Too, would not someone have seen a short, one-armed man running away from the scene of the crime? These matters would have been brought up by Kimball's defense attorney at the trial. One more thing: Tommy Lee Jones asked and got a warrant for tapping Kimball's lawyer. That is never granted unless it is a terrorism investigation. That alone would have gotten the US Marshall in hot water to say nothing of firing a gun at a suspect at point blank range, resulting in his fellow agent's hearing being lost in the right ear, not to mention putting the man's life in danger. I once knew a US Marshall, and I can tell you that he would have called Jone's character an apocrophyl representation of a US Marshall.  Despite the flaws, this movie is Five Stars. One of the best in its genre I have ever seen. Buy the dVD and you won't be disappointed. This is the 205th Five Star review and the 282nd overall rating.  A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I'm planning on taking a trip this summer and figured this would be one of the better things to add to the Kindle Fire HD to keep my girl from becoming bored.
B000055Y0X|4.0|First, let me say that this is visually a remarkable movie. The way this movie was shot really put it up in the stratosphere. The special effects alone were remarkable for the time period. The movie had a major effect on movies like it for years to come. Movies from War Games to Under Siege had the huge war room that has now become ubiquitous in all movies of this genre. The handheld cameras that were used to capture the assault of the air base was remarkable! It may have been the first time they were used in such a manner to give the movie viewere a POV of a battle.<br /><br />The motion picture itself is a farcial satire that Americans enjoyed in 1964. Today, although dated in the sense of 1960s geopolitcs of its time, its theme still holds its own as of this writing. Substitute Communists for terrorists and you get my meaning.<br /><br />I enjoyed the DVD extras. However, I agree with James Earl Jones in his assertion that some of George C. Scott's performance was a bit over the top. Too, Kubrick cut out a pivotal scene where Jones's character questions their orders to hit Russain teritory.<br /><br />I give this movie Three and a Half Stars. It was somewhat crass and pedantic, but still holds its own quite well visually. For the time period it must have been truly innovative.<br /><br />Ok, I'll be the 69th Four Star review and the 570th overall.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
0765325950|4.0|To be fair to this book, we (fans) were never going to be happy. How do you write a book to finish a 20 year series written by another author? Considering the limitations faced by Sanderson, I think he did reasonably well.<br />Lets list the things that confused me/ I had questions about:<br />1. How the crap did he switch places with Moridin? Wtf.<br />2. The scene where he and Matt try to one-up each other seemed like a Brandon addition to lighten the mood. My issue with this scene was this was never been an issue between he and Matt. Matt never wanted to one up Rand. I would argue Matt likes that people underestimating him<br />3. The death of the Forsaken casting the Compulsion has always ended the compulsion. Not in the case of Perrin apparently. Curious.<br />4. Demandred and his tattooed minions came out of nowhere. I am not cool with this. Too convenient to the story.<br />5. Battle scenes and plans after awhile get really tiring. Sanderson tried to break it up however, annoying.<br />6. What is the deal with the symbol of dagger thru the raven that Min saw above Mat's head. This was not explained and I am not smart enough to figure it out. Throw a girl a bone here.<br /><br />Things I didn't mind/ could rationalized:<br />a. Egwene - I totally understand how she can soldier thru the death of her Warder. Adelorna lost one of her Warders during the Seanchan attack. So possible with much willpower. Egwene burning herself out facing off Taim. The leader of the White Tower against the leader of the Black Tower? Fitting. Symbolic.<br />b.The deaths of marginal and even some main characters. Rational though I don't have to like it.<br /><br />In all, I think it is a strong book. I wish there was a less open ended ending. Sanderson is fond of these \\"leave it up to you\\" endings. Overall Sanderson did well.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I haven't read a book that sucked me in like this one since Peter Straub's 1980 classic &#34;Shadowland.&#34; Both of these books create worlds where magic is entirely credible and where its workings are effortlessly explained, then mercilessly played out. What makes The Night Circus (TNC) the better book of the two, IMO, is that Morgenstern manages to be sympathetic to all of the characters, villains and heroes alike. The world of the circus and its devotees, the Reveurs, is also lovingly detailed and masterfully illuminated. Though the ending of the book as as necessary and well-crafted as its beginning, this is one story I was sorry to see end, and would have still been sorry had it gone on longer than it did. A book for all ages; a book that should stand the test of time. Read it!
B002B3ZXWE|5.0|Harry Potter is the world's best movies and the musical scores are some of the best around.  The music is wonderful
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you enjoy anything related to what life is likepreparing for or during war, then you will really enjoy this book..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|While I don't love this game, I keep coming back to it. Easy enough for my 6-year-old. The graphics are good,  but I wish there were more options for competitions, breeding, etc.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I have no dislikes of the product. However I do have to say that you have to be a person who likes puzzles and thinking on there feet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing page turner! Just when you think things couldn't get more complicated, think again. Once you start, you wont be able to stop!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a game for all ages! Graphics are good, choices offered for a variety of gaming experiences. Does not matter your skill level you will get hooked.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|In the car, this is a great game! Sometimes it closes automatically but I deleted the game and then I downloaded it again. It works fine now. Great game for kids learning to draw.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|When I had a problem with my kindle fire, I called and talked to a technician whose name is Jose, he solved it by sending me this product, it worked, thanks Jose.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is amazing show.  I got hooked instantly.  There's drama and history and tons of storylines that keep you intrigued.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I wanted a you tube on my kindle so I got this one works great. I could even watch musci vidoes on this really cool...
B006LSZECO|2.0|I got this book because of all the wonderful reviews, but I did not like it at all.  I did not like the characters and couldn't feel any sympathy for them.
1427201439|5.0|Having different readers for the different characters is a major plus. It is almost like you are listening to a movie.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is Stargate there is NOTHING to dislike and eveything to like and there's absolutely no other product to compare it with.
B0091REZMW|4.0|A fun game. I don't like that you have to pay more. It ends up not being free. Its a fun game and I do enjoy playing it.
B0017MO10U|5.0|As I've said no other product compares to Stargate. I've watched this movie over and over again and will continue to do so for as long as I'm able.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|The plot was great. The DVD worked well and good picture. Why do I have to enter 9 more words.?
B00005JMFQ|4.0|A pleasant, happy feel good movie that we break out every Christmas.  Love the actors and the stories, which are woven together into a very watchable movie.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a very wonderful movie.  I have watched it three times. What else can I say? I need to use 3 more words!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Dredd is truly dreadful. It's just a predictably uninspired, shoot 'em up, video game. All we get from Karl Urban as Judge Dredd are his pouty, frowning lips for an hour and a half. Lena Headey is appropriately deranged and horribly despicable as the villainess, Ma-Ma. It's my least favorite comicbook movie.  Dredd is just sadly bad.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is an excellent movie, I liked seeing the countryside and the streets with so many people. The story was a great one, again as I always say, leave out the love scenes and curse words, they don't add anything and only offend. Does anyone like this junk!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|fast moving, well directed , excitement at every turn.  perfect cast  no question as to why it was best movie 2013
B003M696QS|5.0|I believe the author  has done a great job of compiling evidence on NDE's and then trying to explain them and make sense of why and how they occur. His book takes you on a great walk through the brain, mind and consciousness. Through his lifelong studies and questions in this regard he has amassed a lot of information that he presents in an easily readable and interesting manner. For myself the book made evident the connection between NDE's and my own spiritual development. I found this book, interesting, informative, and full of strong evidence to back up the authors theories. A great companion book to the Irreducible Mind. Will definitely read it again.
B009GEON22|5.0|This batman is always on que with dc comics giving the viewpoint of an older bruce who has been retired recently.  New robin is introduced just like the comics.  Great movie for a dc fan.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I find it quite thought provoking, and eloquently written. Makes you evaluate your stand on capital punishment and its effect on religion.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|each of the batman returns have features in blue ray that give an insight of the making of each character and dc outlook on how they play their role a must see if your a dc fan.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I haven't actually watched the DVD yet. I wanted my own copy because watching the movie in the theater was a thrilling experience.
B00B2Q9NM2|5.0|As always a great movie due to the director and his imagination of creating great movies.. must see this movie if you have not already.
B0041YI4ZO|5.0|when I ordered this I was not aware that it was in Japanese but my fiance didnt mind that at all. contacted the seller and got an immediate response. excellent customer service, speedy delivery and A + seller. would definately recomend this seller to everyone. thank you
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|A true classic for the kids and myself to watch.  Still very enjoyable.  bought it as a gift on a trip
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is awesome  I even got my friend to read it and she said it was awesome  now I am looking forward to reading The Lighting Thief  (the graphic novel) :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Set in England in the early 1900's, this show has very good acting, amazing sets, and all the intrigue and drama you'd expect.  Worthy of awards!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so addicting and I can't stop playing it. It is way to fun! The graphics are great and horses look so realistic! I would highly recommend it.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I enjoyed this sleeper movie... Full of surprises and wonderful music. One of the greatest song writing talents and he had more than money could ever buy, he had a rich soul full of purpose.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|Awesome CD, it was great to hear great songs and also to see that wonderful disk. You won't be dissapointed.
B0010T0OCY|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. It kept my attention. It definitely had underlying meaning. We all have a dark side that we need to bring to the light.
B005FLWU6G|4.0|Record sounds great! There is just a slight warp in one of the records. It doesn't affect the sound but it might. I'd still buy it if I had the chance
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Shame on all the people writing comments here that seem to be full of hate. You disrespect the memory of a man that envisioned a world of peace and love. To those that have the opinion that he would hate this being released, I have to disagree. My opinion is he is greatly touched that, after almost 43 years, he is still a huge influence on musicians today, still loved and admired by so many around the world. I recommend this release to fans. Just sit back and listen, and if you are old enough.......remember when.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie to me started slow and ended slow.I expected more action but was not surprised with the outcome of the movie.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It is still a good show, but Rick's visions and some of the other bizarre conduct by the characters is getting to be a little much. Andrea doesn't even make sense anymore.  Lets' get this battle with Woodbury over and move on.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Love this new compilation. Until the band gets back together and tours, this CD is the next best thing. Buy it! I got it for $1.99 on sale through Amazon. It was a steal!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Basic &#34;how-to&#34; that even the most computer-challenged individuals should be able to handle, Wish the section on &#34;cover design&#34; was more comprehensive, with suggestions. But other than that, not bad.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|A very well-produced continuation of the first season, with added drama from the first World War. The streaming was very good, as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|get this game it rocks you can ride skateboards<br />and you can get big shoes and jump over trains I mean you will love this game
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love to buy and sell on eBay and this app works great for that. Super easy to use. Love how it is set up.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its the same facebook. To me there's nothing different. I use it when I don't feel like getting up to check my FB. Plus you get messages instantly.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|From beginning to end, a true masterpiece, and Opeth's finest album (so far).  A deep album that takes many listens to appreciate the \\"wall of sound\\", and also how the songs and story tie into each other.<br /><br />My personal favourites are Godhead's Lament, Moonlapse Vertigo, and White Cluster.
B005HSL626|5.0|Such an amazing addictingly fun game. Its the first game I searched for and downloaded to my Kindle. I was happy to find out it was free.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I needed this to show to my class and compare it with the book.  The transaction was easy and it arrived on time.  Whether you like the movie or not depends on your taste, of course, but it served its purpose for me.  Thanks,
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I rather this than Temple Run 1 but I bet some people would beg to differ. My fave part is when you go in the trolley throughout the cave :)
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The movie is very amusing.  Children would love this movie. Me? I am a child at heart.  I love cartoon movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and entertaining. I really enjoy the training  and even without spending real $ it keeps my attention. Good game. Well done.
B001E75QH0|4.0|Great series and fast service.  I don't know what else to say other than this was a good buy if you like Indy!
B000UK73QO|5.0|This is a book that can be read over and over and will touch your life each time.  I would recommend it to everyone for the peace it will give to you after you read it.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this game! if you like penguins I highly recommend it. heck. I even recommend it if you hate penguins! ( I love penguins! :D)
0670026182|5.0|The photo's alone in this book is enough to make you buy it.  The recipes are amazing as well.  This is a book you put out in your kitchen for display as it is so well done.  It's a yummy cookbook.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I love this album.  Don't expect hard rock.  It's modern and poppy.  I love the harmonies and the smooth beats.  And I love that Cornell took a risk and did something new.
B0011Z1BTW|5.0|In a few word Dazed and Confused is like 30 min long and worth the purchase price alone, especially if you are a guitar player; Better yet it needs to be viewed on dvd just for the violin bow used on the guitar in this tune...it will AMAZE and reveal why NOBODY touches Jimmy
B003F3NE1Q|4.0|This is a great drama show. The show arrived in great condition and goes perfectly with the rest of the seasons.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|On the edge of my seat the whole time. Loved it. I remember when this happened. I like movies based on history.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Download game on kindle and when it started it would play the first few seconds of the intro then start over. Once i skipped past that i was able to input information and tried creating a park but nothing every loaded.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game! I love it! You can ride on hoverboards, you can earn coins and buy characters like Tricky! You can also get mystery boxes. In some cases,  you can get a amount of something from the box and earn a character to run as! Its great! I wonder if they will have subway surfers China or England..
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|It was a compelling mystery. Generally  I am tired of stories about serial killers who target and torture women. However, the character of Harry Hole and the framing interplay of the investigating team was a major element in my enjoyment.<br />. . My disappointment was that  I figured out whodunit quite early on. Oh, and that Hole is utterly  incapable of reaching out to the woman who loves him. And whom he so clearly loves.
B0054VVRBQ|3.0|Purchased the same reader but its terribly slow, 1,18 MB/s, card ist an Sandisk extreme 16 Gb. Anybody has an idea how to solve that problem?<br />Thanx!
0465011047|4.0|I was very impressed with the amount of detail<br />in this book, and believe that people who go through<br />such an experience deserve to be heard.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game to play when I am bored I hop on my kindle fire and have a great time with the game
0670023329|5.0|it is nothing short of a miracle that the young man<br />who wrote this book was able to get out and to the<br />&#34;Other World&#34;.  Being born in the camp, he would<br />never have known how it was outside if someone had<br />not told him a little about it.  It is very hard for someone<br />with his background to adjust to a life of choices and<br />decisions.  My heart goes out to him.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|frtyetyyug wye jshdjash  sjhdj jd sj c c c c c c c c c c c c c c
0385523912|5.0|Shows what life is like in one of the most<br />isolated places in the world.  How would we<br />know of such things if the few who come out<br />didn't tell us.  Glad they wrote the book.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|This is Anastacia's Greatest Hits! I loved it! Wonderful music and very fun!!!!!!! It was a great enjoyment to listen too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all three books.  Getting to know these characters was a pleasure.  They were rich and with each book I was hoping for growth in both the main characters which happened.
B0085FF55W|1.0|Was going to buy this CD, but then realized it had profanity in the lyrics.  I don't want to play that in my home, so they just lost a sale because of it.  The music sounded great, however.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought this for my father who already had seen the series and wanted to own it.  He was impressed with the packaging.  The price was hard to beat!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|loved playing this game until the last part of level 8. The last 2 goals take so long to get that I am actually losing interest
B00AH34AUQ|1.0|I was waiting for this album to come out there are no tracks to be listen to here its garbage !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought I watched for free through my Prime account. However I got it, I loved it....had missed many episodes and it was fun to see what I missed.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I enjoyed the story. At first it was a little hard to get used to the style of journal entries & telegrams instead of live conversations.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I may be the only person on the planet who hasn't read the Harry Potter series, but there you have it. When I saw J.K. Rowling was venturing into new subject matter, I thought it might be interesting. I found the book to be a bit uneven, and she tried to deal with a lot of serious subjects. But about halfway into the book, I started to feel bored with the whole thing and not very interested in the outcome.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I liked this very much until the last episode. It was very disturbing and disappointing the way it ended, Oh well, I'll just have to find a new favorite show to watch.
B0023S50DO|3.0|Typical, predicable, slow at times.  But if you're trying to get to sleep this is the perfect \\"white noise\\" TV to do it to.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I use to pass this buy...Why?Cause of the front cover.It wasn't fly looking,it made the album seem to conservative.I gave it a chance for some reason,now i luv it.Love Is Blind,Doesn't Mean Anything,Wait To You See Me Smile,That's How Strong My Love Is!!!,Un-Thinkable{I'm Ready} is the best tracc on this album!!!,Love Is My Disease,Like The Sea,This Bed!!!,Distance and Time,How It Feels To Fly!!!,Empire State of Mind pt 2!!!,Pray For Forgiveness is insane!!!,Put It In A Love Song ft Beyonce is hard!!!, & Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart!!! is the second best tracc on here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an awesome game and is very addicting....I really recommend this game.....enjoy...<br />P.s. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THIS APP YET....UR STUPID....JK
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This is a &#34;watch it again and again&#34; type of movie, if you like really good vocal talent!!  I thought the cast was wonderful, and really showed off their varied &#34;pipes&#34;....just their own voices, no musical instruments.  Really loved it.
B0049J2BSM|2.0|the movie is great but streaming quality was bad. i am not impressed with amazon instant video. maybe i am doing something wrong i dont know.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|The movie loses something by moving from first person to third person, and fails to do the book justice in a lot of ways, and still manages to be an ok movie in it's own right.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved it! Read what i knew to be true, but never heard from anyone else. Wondering why he doesn't mention Jesus.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|A good story but a little bit light. A good beside the pool book for your next holiday. No doubt it will be a marvellous film.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Can't stop reading these books.<br /><br />Only 4 books through at the moment but so glad I started.<br /><br />Such a different side to the story than the show as well
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Cute video, it's good a nice story to it, just cause your labeled the bad guy, doesn't mean your bad
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Probably the most John Corey has made me laugh out loud!! So much that I never noticed the 650 pages!!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This is such an awesome movie.  It continues in classic Jim Henson/Muppet style.  It flows with older Muppet movies but with a modern scenery and digital clarity.  It is hilariously funny, the music is awesome, the kids love it, the grown-ups love it.  You will gain perspective as you ponder for yourself, &#34;Am I am man?  Or am I a Muppet?&#34;
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I was skeptical of this movie.  Horton Hears a Who was ok but not a keeper for us.  Plus I was sort of bugged that 7th Generation picked it up and was using it for advertising.  I am not a fan of characters selling products, the product should do that on it's own.  Anyway....<br /><br />This was such a good movie.  There are so many hilarious little side things that make you laugh, fuzzy bear defibrillation as an example.  The music is great, the message is good, and I think they did a spectacular job fleshing out the story without losing the integrity of the original Dr. Seuss story.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I read this while watching Downton Abbey and I could imagine living in the big house just as the main character did as a thirteen year old maid in 1910 England. The character remembers growing up with the members of the family as she is intervied when she is over ninety (70 years later) for a production  about The Riverton House. Good behind scenes and secrets are told as the tale continues.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton writes some fantastic books. You can't put them down. I recommend all her books. The Secret Keeper is also tops.
1451627297|5.0|I couldn't put this book down ! It grabbed my attention from the first page.  In my opinion this is the best book Stephen King has ever written.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another excellent read starring Katniss Everdeen.  I enjoyed these books more than I thought I would.  They come recommended for teens/young adults, but I think that label should go by the wayside, since I'm neither and I have enjoyed reading the first two books.  I'm on the third book in the trilogy; let's see how sweetly the Mockingjay sings...
B0012GTZC0|4.0|An easy and quick read. You will not be disappointed. This is third book I have ready by t Ken Follett, and so far I have enjoyed each one.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I ordered this for my fifth-grade grandson.  His class was reading it as a group.  It is a good story, but it hasn't stood the test of time like the tales of Dickens, Twain or Barrie.  It doesn't have the magic of Harry Potter.  Fortunately, it is relatively short.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Acting was not good, story line predictable, only thing going for it was the music.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is great for any minecraft lover. it even includes water lava and cameras. at first I was skeptically but I came to love this amazing add on to minevraft pe
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the riveting storyline and 'out of the box' entertainment.  I hope they are able to continue the series for a long time!
030758836X|4.0|The narrative it slow and overly detailed in the first 100 pages or so and theres a the nagging question in the back of my mind : &#34;thriller&#34; of the year, really? But just as I was about to give up, things got interesting, REAL interesting. So much that I didn't care about my nights sleep,which ain't worth sacrificing for anything less than extraordinary.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Really enjoyed it, great book for those looking to get in to para cord braiding Recommend to all. Great! Great&#62;
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I think it is a good game but the one thing that would make it better is if you could hit the blocks and then put them somewhere else.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Seems as the new updare works.  Either I'm getting smarter, or the levels have gotten easier. I'm even looking forward to the Quell Momento.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I saw the movie before reading the book and still enjoyed the book.  A quick read that captures your attention right from the start!
B004L3AQLU|5.0|Delivery was quick the box looked just fine. No problems at all. No scratches in the CDs and the cd box looked just fine.
B004GGM444|3.0|Some interesting sounds, 95% electronic, with a similar beat. I found the music tedious after a few songs, actually. I like to hear new sounds and see what I think, so I downloaded this EP. I'm not really sorry I downloaded it, but I won't be listening to it often.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game for me because there is a big variety of characters and items in the shop!!!  C
B00003CXXP|5.0|I missed this movie when it came out, so I'm delighted that I finally came across it. It is a wonderful fairy tale that, like all good fairy tales, contains moments of fear, love, joy, despair, horror, reality and hope. The special effects are fantastic, as are the script and the acting. The Jude Law character, &#34;Gigolo Joe,&#34; seemed a bit out of place, as did the glaring, blatant sexuality of Rouge City and the Flesh Fair. I'm not sure why Spielberg felt he needed to take the story to those extremes when he could have gotten his points across in a much gentler way that would be more suitable for younger audiences; I would be reluctant to take a younger teen or pre-teen to see this film for these reasons. I think the base-line story would be inspiring for younger audiences, however. Heck, I'm 62 years old and was inspired and touched by the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a sci-fi story and a very human story ... about robots.
B009AKI3IM|4.0|As a DJ Shadow fan I gotta say that Entroducing and The Private Press changed my idea of what instrumental \\"hip hop\\" could be, up until that time the closet thing I'd heard to anything like those albums was [[ASIN:B00008OM5G Scratchology]] and maybe stuff like the early [[ASIN:B00136Q5V8 93 'Til Infinity (LP Version)]], and of course Madlib ([[ASIN:B000THGMWY Beat Konducta Vol. 1-2: Movie Scenes]],[[ASIN:B000V5F2YS Beat Konducta Vol. 3 & 4: In India]]) and J Dilla [[ASIN:B000THCFA2 Donuts]] who are in a category of their own, but listening to some of the newer songs on reconstructed gives me a feeling of \\"yea they sound good\\" but don't really move me, the only exception would be \\"High Noon\\" . Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not one of those every album has to sound exactly like Entroducing people, and every artist has to explore and grow (or should at least), but there was something about the way the songs complemented each other on Entroducing and the Private Press that keeps them on my car's mp3 play list to this day, which as other people have said, and also in my opinion is kind of missing here, but its still a good cool out album....<br /><br />BTW: I thought the DJ Shadow's Infamous South Beach set was amazing, from which he got removed off the stage because he combined Hip Hop, with everything from dub, electronica, house, and the kitchen sink, and the crowd at the club just wasn't ready for it, you can listen to it on his (if I can link it) sound cloud page (or sound + those fluffy things in the air page),and there are some other musical gold nuggets there as well.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I really like the game but teamlava is the worst! I don't know what the deal is but they consider the words &quot;come&quot; and &quot;amazon&quot; inappropriate. Also, since I play on a kindle fire I can't get the newest edition of the game, so no cool new toys. BOOOO!!!!! I will change my review if teamlava ever makes updates available to kindle users.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This program helps both adults and kids to learn very useful and handy knots.  It helped teach my son as I learned beside him.  Highly recommended.
B009YX02T8|4.0|This is the first album I've bought in a long time, and I'm glad I did. Great songs from a great movie!
B008IBP24C|5.0|My daughter and I are hooked on this fun old fashioned soap opera!.  We especially love Mr. Bates and Anna.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. it is really fun for horse lover's. it can cost money but if you are patient it won't.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It has great graphic and It has an excellent price and things to choose from. Also its great for horse lovers.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Beach Buggy Blitz is a fun and exciting game to play you first have to get the hang of it but then its fun.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Nice and fast coming from an AMD Phenom II x4.  I haven't overclocked it yet, but I plan to with a watercooling rig.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If you are looking for a cute, sweet book to take your mind off your present day worries, this book is for you!! I enjoyed it more than most and it was FREE! What more could you need--a FREE BOOK! A FUN read!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I actually did not much like Muse when I heard them around the &#34;Origin of Symmetry&#34; era. This album is what got me to actually appreciate the things that Matt Bellamy puts together. He and his bandmates are very talented; that much. I never questioned. The change in step from their other albums to this one is not overtly drastic. It merely looks at their previous revolutionary-themed music in a different musical light. There is, however, a stark &#34;darkness and light&#34; theme on this album that intrigues me. If you are a hardcore Muse fan, you might not appreciate this deviation, but I strongly urge you to give it a few listens before you toss it out (at that point. I highly doubt you will feel the same way as you first did). For those of us who may be a little newer on the Muse wagon, this album is a perfect introduction to what their other albums have expressed. The James Bond esque track &#34;Supremacy&#34; had me hooked immediately. Bellamy arranges these orchestrations with precision and purpose. The wildly popular single, &#34;Madness&#34; had me busy for days, picking it's every mesmerizing instrumentation apart whilst being carried away by Bellamy's soaring voice. For me, it is one of the best tracks on the album. Also a nice change in pace is Chris Wolstenholme's two anthems, &#34;Save Me&#34; and &#34;Liquid State&#34;. The whole idea of the 2nd Law of thermodynamics is crazy in musical form, but if anybody can do it with superior musicality, Muse can.
B000683VI4|5.0|As expected, I enjoyed this movie, its definately one of my all time best love story movie! I never get tired watching this. Beside, this was the only dvd that worked, I had gotten two dvds from amazon that day another of my fav christain best movie but unfortunately that one didn't work. I love the notebook and thanks to this seller for a great working dvd. Will buy again from this seller if need be.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|stupid game a total minecraft copy all the recipys are the same a proper s***y game and if you want suggestions makesomething witch disentangle a copy of an amazing game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is super addictive! You can only get better. My 10 year old son loves it too. He loves to run from the monkey thing chasing you. He might be better then I am.
B00942X8PY|4.0|The rules are pretty simple, though they all have to be inferred: you can only visit a square one time. Each starter has a specific number of moves you have to use. One way arrows can only be exited in the direction of the arrow. X's cannot be exited. Squares with a colored dot can only be crossed by that color. There are more, but all are pretty simple to understand.<br /><br />Each level can award a medal based on time to solve. Take too long and you get none. By around 1-20 I was having to think a little bit. Overall, very pleasant game.
B0094K1QR8|2.0|Silly and not in a good way.  Spend your time watching something better at least something more funny than this one.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I put GalenGoo on my cheap little Android tablet to see if i could get my MacBook Pro iCal events onto the Android. It is possible if albeit a bit convoluted. You have to set up a link from the Mac to Google Calendar online or export each calendar from the Mac to and import in Google, then set up a sync link between GalenGoo and Google Calendar. It is not too bad but does take a bit of effort if you decide to periodically export and import between Mac and Google.<br />Getting the iCal events to automatically show up on the Google calendar takes a bit more care. You have to select the version of the calendar listed under your Google ID and then create the iCal event. If you create it under the original calendar, it will not get transmitted to Google. So the two accounts are different, even if you first export the calendar and then import it into Google. For that reason, you probably should give the calendars different names on the two systems and use the Google versions on the Mac if you want the events to sync. Fortunately, the Google versions seem to work ok on the Mac even when you are not connected to the internet. The calendars will sync the next time that both refresh.<br />On the Android side, the process is pretty simple; just set up the Google account on the Android tablet and tell it to sync. All this is in the settings for CalenGoo. The Sync button is a separate tab and the accounts controls are under the Settings tab.<br />crc
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Affleck did a  great job on all aspects of this movie definitely worth watching.  Easy to see why it was an Academy Award Winner.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good insight into the mind of an average warrior who accomplished above average feats. It is the first book with the family perspective in their own words.<br />RIP Mr. Kyle.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|This takes me back to my childhood, when I loved watching this show, but as an adult, I now appreciate other aspects of the cast and story-lines and why I still like watching Star Trek so much. Capt.Kirk, had it all!, and the crew, even most of the aliens were amazing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not put this book down. Great story despite the flowery language, which seemed to decrease as the story went on. A real movie ready book!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Great app! Tells you how much , how long, when and where.  Tells how long to charge with AC or PC.
B00942X8PY|3.0|Simply ok. Not terribly interesting, but not badly made. It's just too simple and from that, boring. Just try it out.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have played several versions on different devices and purchased this one based on the reviews.  This one is easy but I haven't played all levels.  Many of the levels here will provide hours of fun for children too.  I like it very much but did not give it five stars because of so many easy levels.<br />Update: I have reached the more difficult levels and have now rated the game with five stars.  These levels are complex and require much study. The game provides hours of entertainment!  I play it often.
1574214276|5.0|...went to the library and took out six Zentangle books...as a beginner I wanted to get involved fast and easy...this was the only book that gave me a sense of can do and how to do...Warning: once you start you cannot stop...you will begin to view the world as one big Zentangle extension...and that's a fun thing..!!..
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I enjoy this BBC version of Sherlock.  Brings him into the current century - cell phones and laptops - while maintaining the essence of Sir Doyle's creation.
0425074811|5.0|Went looking for this book . It was what I expected. I really can't judge this purchase any other way. Depending on what people like to read.
B004132I20|5.0|I am a fan of the Sherlock character since I stumbled on one of the books in high school and preceded to read every title.  This BBC version is faithful to Sir Doyle's original character while bringing him into the current century.  Kudos to the producers and directors and writers for your obvious attention to the essence of Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson!
B0072OFM28|5.0|We use these sets, for our winter tv watching.  This is NO disappointment.  We look forward to watching this, each week.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, that does not find nudity offensive.  It gives you an idea of what life might have been like back in the Roman days.  The bible talks of these times and this leads me to believe these portrayals might be right on.  Just gives you a visual idea.  Looking forward to the release of Season 3
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon 's ability to make a story fantastical, yet grounded in real life, is remarkable. I can't wait for the next book he puts out. Keep them great and keep them coming.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|This set was just a lead in for the replacement of the original Spartagus, &#34;Andy Whitfield.&#34;  Sadly, he passed away and had to be replaced.  I have to say, this was a bit LESS then Spartacus, but then it always is, when the original characters are not there.  I would suggest getting this set, as it prepares you for the SEASON set.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a splendid reverie, the dreamlike qualities, the development of characters, the unfolding and arc of the plot-line all combined to make the fantastical eminently practical.  I will read this time and again, I can't wait to share it with my daughters.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|If you haven't started watching this series, you are missing out on a great one!  I didn't think I would enjoy this set, but I am as excited to watch it, as my husband is.  Very interesting, and lets you see what it might have been like, in the Roman days.  Don't stop, pass Go, and get this set started today!!
B009DH379C|5.0|Freddie is in good form on this bluray.  All of Queen's hit are pretty much there so it's more than entertainlng.  The video is good and the sound is better.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The Pact was sad,, thought provoking and interesting. While the subject matter was interesting and kept me reading and captivated, but the book overall was unrealistic in its portrayal of teen love except the imagination of teen girls. That part of the story was overdone, but the idea was something that the reader would like to imagine is possible. Overall a good read.
B008OHV4PG|4.0|This bluray doesn't feature Neil the Rocker, but it's still a nice laid back musical exprerience.  The car driving part of the &#34;journey&#34; is interesting, but you probably won't play it too often.  The music is classic Neil which is always good to watch and hear.
1416972242|5.0|About<br /><br />City of Ashes is the following book after City Of Bones in The Mortal Instruments Series. Clary is still new to the Shadowhunter world and now facing a horrible war that involves her own father, Valentine,  as THE bad guy. She is also crushed since her flirting with Jace went wrong when she learned that he is.... *drum roll*..... her brother. Clary is trying to find out more about her past, and is desperate to hear her mother's version of events and why there were so many secrets kept from her, but Clary's mom is in a \\"magic coma\\".<br /><br />Alec, Isabelle and Max Lightwood are by Jace's side the entire time and no matter what they have his back! Jace is after all like a brother to them. But the same cannot be said for the Lightwood parents, who doubt their loyalty to Jace when the Clave tries to convict him.<br /><br />Simon and Clarys relationship is developed and tested, but when something life changing happens to Simon, they realize what they both want and make a decision that makes both of them happy.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />I absolutely love this book. And yes... I still think the whole idea about Clary falling in love with Jace and then realizing they are siblings is still very weird to me. But I am keeping my fingers crossed and hoping that by some magical reason they can fall in love and they are not really blood related and they can live happily ever after.<br /><br />The book was completely action packed and I completely devoured it! I just got the third book (City of Glass) in the mail. Can't wait to get to it!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I saw this concert on TV on Palladia (which is a great way to check out performers you wouldn't ordinarily see).  As I watched each song, it was obvious that Joe can really play.  Very well shot and the sound is great.  Definitely recommended if you like Clapton-style blues.
B007SGM084|5.0|This story will have you up all night begging for more. You will not regret buying this book. Excellent love story with a twist.
B00992CF6W|5.0|oh yeah mc rocks get this game now its tots worth it bra get it get it get it get it creepers
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is really cool and addicting I play it all day every day I also really recommendit to everyone
0545265355|5.0|After seeing the intense first movie I immediatly bought the series, and read them all in a matter of days.  This series is good for a variety of ages, and does not feel as much like an adolescent series.  The author also raises several ethical and philosophical questions that adults can pick up on and contemplate. Great series and I can't wait to see how the books are adapted to the screen.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I really enjoyed the book up until the end...that was a little sappy....The dead wife chumming with the new love...
B00AAU2QA2|5.0|If you are a music snob, don't listen to Ke$ha.  If you like to party and dance, get this album.  She continues to do the party music for good reason.  I have her other albums and I think she actually sings more on this one, especially on Wonderland, instead of just autotune or her rap.  I am obsessed with Crazy Kids. When they say explicit, they mean the F word.  It's Ke$ha!<br /><br />This is a great album to drink, dance, or drive to (just not all 3 at once).  I'm very happy with it!
1601251556|2.0|Bought this a few years back for a campaign my roommate was starting up. We were less than impressed by the quality of the item (I could make a similar quality, if smaller, item with standard printer paper and a laminator) but it didn't take up stains from the markers we used and the double-sized grid was nice for quickly changing areas or reducing set-up time in-game.<br /><br />The mat folds up for easy travel and storage, but it doesn't flatten out well afterwards, requiring books or other objects to keep miniatures from falling over or sliding. After a year or so we noticed the laminate falling apart around the edges and forming holes at the fold intersections. After this point, the mat took up stains (both from water and the markers) at the holes when we washed it off.<br /><br />If one has the extra money, I would recommend a Chessex battle/mega mat (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015IQO2O) instead. The aforementioned roommate bought one since he needed a mat with hexes and it is a great quality item.<br /><br />In short, this item will fit your needs, but there are nicer options which will last years longer.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I first found out about Ellie Goulding from a random techno remix youtube video.  I immediately bought her album Lights (GREAT ALBUM, BUY IT NOW).  That album was more hopeful and sweet with guitars, pianos, and her sweet voice.<br /><br />This album is like the twisted sister of Lights.  It is more dark, more intense, but still lovely.  I love the sheer rawness of the lyrics in My Blood, which totally captures what a breakup feels like, and why we need to move on.  I am OBSESSED with Figure 8 with the nod to dubstep and just a great set of lyrics. I am disappointed that she put the song Lights on this album again, because it doesn't really fit the rest of the album (it fits more with her first album).  You should buy her first album that has the original song on it, plus a host of other great ones that never hit the radio in America.<br /><br />Ellie is a really good songwriter.  I am really impressed with this album and can't wait for her next one.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a really cool concept that I know a lot of people are going to enjoy. Imangi played it smart by teaming up with Disney for this. The idea is great, the graphics are exceptional and gameplay as ever is fabulous! This is good to play on both phone and tablet, so I do not believe anyone will be disappointed with that. What I'm worried about is not being able to easily exit, but the game itself is great overall.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I purchased this to watch on a Saturday night.  It was suspenseful and had a few twists at the end.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This is such a fun and exciting game to pass the time with. A high quality game graphic wise, and one that you will not be able to put down.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I am a big fan of Owl City because he lifts up your spirits with each new album.  I am glad I purchased this CD.
B006HL9G10|2.0|I'm not really sure what the developers problem is.  This app is a battery hog because it keeps your screen on.  Especially on older devices this is very poor form.  The FAQ's state it is not the developer problem but the way Android changed the access.  That just tells me the developer is lazy.  In my book Lazy isn't worth $2.<br /><br />The app performs flawlessly, mechanically speaking.  However a long meditation session will leave you with little battery life left, even if you have it charging, because it leaves the screen on.  You can mitigate a small portion of that by having the screen dim, but this sense of worry is not what I want from my meditation session.<br /><br />One star for form, one star for function, but update your code to play the bells as a background app.<br /><br />Seriously I could put in a few bell sounds and just set that as my timer alarm with the bilt in timer app and use notes for journaling.  Having it in one place with an friendly UI is what makes it worth $2.  They got the UI ok but that is where it stops.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fearless, this is an amazing book, Suzanne Collins knows what she's doing. The hunger games series is by far my favorite books, without a doubt.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I was actually gonna give this 5 stars. BUT it decided to lock me out of it. every time I try to play the stupid game it shuts it off. but when it did let me on the game at first it was very fun.
6305161992|5.0|..a good actor. Not a Great actor and if he still lived, I've got no doubt his mark in cinema history would be slight. In this movie he plays the straight man prim and proper to the lose cannon that is Dolf Lundgren. He barely shows up since it's Lundgren's movie and he does what he does as well as he does.<br />+<br />Pure pop-corn blood and guts actions. Show it to your kids!
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I have been training for Ironman on a very different philosophy to this. My efforts and results have plateued and I think its time I tried something new.This has been a good purchase.Great technique explanations and the science behind the training. I will need to read it a couple of times to understand the progression in training, but a very interesting book
B0000640SA|4.0|This couldn't of been on a blu-ray boggles me. But like all types of equipment and software, they tend to shine at the end and so I got to see this movie completely forward instead of the original direction.. and seriously. I can understand why it would've failed if it was done that way.<br />+<br />Then again; it didn't do well when it first came out since it was more an art house flick that catered to a very small group. In the theater when I first watched it, I actually saw a guy (outside of myself it was just the two of us!) get up half way through!<br />+<br />If you want history in technology, buy this movie for what it did. The movie is pure art house.<br />+<br />Buy 'Accel Saga' for actually exploiting the ability of All DVD players that could show different colored texts and is different locations outside of the usual spot too!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This trilogy was something my husband requested for two Christmas holidays and I finally broke down and bought it for him.
B004I1K2NW|3.0|I'm thinking it's release has something to do with the director's other show about munchkins.<br />+<br />I saw this in the theaters and thought not much of anything about it, and then I get suckered into the blurb about this is the DIRECTORS CUT... outside of a few minute changes that really don't come to mind from what I previously saw in the theater I really didn't see anything different here.<br />+<br />If you're a fan of the director and want to be a completionist. Buy it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What an inspiring book of a most loyal dog, R. Gere did an outstanding job playing his role...Whats there not to like...no human could be this loyal...it is well worth seeing over and over...
B008CJ0JTI|4.0|I saw this movie at the theater when it first came out and had moments of thinking that left me for some time afterwards, so I know that this was a great movie that doesn't insult your mind and stays with you. Though to me there's something still a tad off to such I can't give it five stars.<br />+<br />Technically it is five stars because Criterion never releases horrible prints. This director tends to push special effects in every film, but never to the hollyweird summer &#34;events&#34; levels. So it always stick to you as simply amazing even if you can't explain it to anyone.
