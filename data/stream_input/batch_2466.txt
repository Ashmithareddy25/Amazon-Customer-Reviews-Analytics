B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Don't like the fact that you have to be on facebook to use it.  I don't think that was explained well ...or maybe it was. I'm not into that
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is one of the best of Rick riordan yet  I am brett and I do tutorials on minecraft my name is halotrooper32
B000FC11A6|4.0|This book is not for all.  It is long and a little convoluted and does extensively use flashbacks.  Definitely not 5 star but for those who enjoy the historical aspects of code breaking during WWII it is good.
630241380X|5.0|Well done and close to the original text by Larry McMurtry. The beginning of a long walk with the characters in the movie that are in subsequent novels by McMurtry. I've transferred the VHS to a DVD for long life.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|In spite of the fact that there are many aspects of the narrative and characters in this book that are not realistic, it still holds this reader spellbound.  It's as if you are there watching it all unfold.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Not really the best novel I have read.  It leads the reader through a tedious  lesson on diamond mining that seemed to just be filler but not really necessary to the story.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The best cast topped off by Nathan Fillion what more could you ask for?  Well written and funny stuff too!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I love the actress and the show's plot...also some great supporting cast members too!<br />I can't wait for the next episode and Season 2!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Bones is one of the favorites and this is a great season. Cant wait to watch it when the boy gets home for the summer.
B0012HEB32|4.0|The series does what series have the time to do: it allows the characters to feel the effects of their choices and actions.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Haven't checked the discs yet, but otherwise it got here in a timely manor and seems to be in good shape. Thanks.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Just can't get enough, watched 3 seasons almost endlessly, interesting provocative, engrossing to say the least.  Can't wait until season 4 is available for free
B008XNZMOU|5.0|The cd arrived on Saturday, it is awesome.  Definately recommend this CD to all.  Two hit songs on this CD, but all songs great!
B00AECDDYY|4.0|AWESOME GAME! Very interesting game. The graphics are nice and so is the game play. Worth every penny. Definitely a recommend.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I HAD FUN AND,OF COURSE, I won so even better... good graphics and a cute little bell. So I recommend this game.
B00378VGGO|5.0|Mr. Fox is an excellent film packed with both obvious and subtle humor. As such, the movie has great repeat watching value. I always find something new to give me a good laugh. While it’s better to only rent most moves, Mr. Fox is worth a full purchase because it has great rewatchability.
B006M4F67A|4.0|A well created app.  Fast and accurate. A good range of different layouts. Sound effect a little annoying but I suspect some make like it.  Worth buying if you like this type of app.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Once the big reveal happened that Amy was framing her husband, the book became really predictable.  I thought the initial idea of the Amy diary was clever and how she framed him, but it left everything else lackluster and dragging on.  I never found myself rooting for any of the characters.  I felt the ending was flat and without any impact.  I would have ended it with someone dying or something.  Them continuing a fake relationship was not satisfying to me.  Overall it could have been good but instead just became annoyingly predictable.
0307888908|5.0|I liked the read. I had heard a lot of the stories before in business classes and such but he has to write it as if the audience doesn't know all of those stories so I know why he did. It's a great read if you are interested in business or improving your career and your stuck to old ways of thinking that don't work anymore.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|The movie was generic for the most part but enough to keep me going. However, the ending was quite stupid and lackluster which really ruined what decent experience it had been up until then. This was certainly my least favorite movie from this otherwise excellent director.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My wife got this for me as a gift from here. I have watched it several times. We saw it in the theater first and I love this movie. The product came just as I expected, in great condition. We love the values of buying from Amazon when things like this are on a great price!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Ok....I haven't made it completely through this video yet.  But when it comes to motivation, Jillian Michaels is the way to go.  No excuses!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The way the book was written was more like a bunch of short stories put together. Was an interesting read though.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Story plot was excellent. Mr. Cruise was supported by good acting. No bad guys, good guys.Nice Cinematography and decent directing.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I recently upgraded to the newer version and was pleased with the new layout. Everything was perfect...until I realized that moving music via WiFi LAN won't register the music on the kindle fire hd.  If I pull music from my computer via lan to my kindle I have to plug my kindle back up to my pc, move the file to a different location, then move it back, just to get it to show up outside of the app. This is a weird bug and an annoying one...reason why I didn't give it full 5 stars....it worked flawlessly in the last version.<br /><br />If anyone knows how to fix this I'd be grateful...until then I'll just have  to plug my kindle fire hd into my come to put music on it instead of the easy way.
B0053O89KG|5.0|We love Castle!  We plan to get all the seasons so that we can watch at will.  Will be purchaseing the next one when it comes out!
0760703329|3.0|Very nice display Book, but realized I needed annotated, so I will try again to get what I really wanted.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|At first I wasn't interested in seeing this movie, I was tired and thought a rom-com would suit me better.  But my boyfriend insisted and wow.  I also thought I was only into the older James Bond movies.  Little did I know (or I forgot) Daniel Craig is not bad on the eyes and the action was just....awesome.  It was a really great movie, I was impressed and recommended it to anyone who would listen the next day.
B00000JR2A|5.0|I usually hate 80's music, but the production on this album is sick. The musical precision is mind blowing. It actually forces you to stop and wake up mentally. What I mean is that every second is thought out on this album. There's ZERO filler...non whatsoever. These guys spent over a million dollars to produce this album and its pretty obvious why. I can only think of maybe two other albums EVER that have caught me this off guard based on the production alone. This deserves to be put up with any beatles album. You have to listen to it and then you'll understand. Even if you don't like the style... the arrangements, timing and just every detail.....sometimes you'll hear a small sound only ONCE in a song for a brief second...talk about an obsession over details. Trully impressive.....
B00942V1J4|5.0|Which I am. If you haven't watched any of the Twilight movies before don't be ridiculous and start with the last one.  That's just silly.  But if you already love the movies because it takes you back to your days of pre-teen angst and general lack of knowledge about anything involving actual human romances then this is perfect for you.  Watch it, it's necessary.
B00BN3ECTS|4.0|This is a very compelling story with twists and turns you would not expect.....unless you have read the book already.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Elvis exploded on the world like a rocket mid-fifties as the Ultimate Singing Superstar of them all...years of sublime hits and other wondrous recordings along with those fun movies fans never missed, savoring the chance to watch and enjoy that ultimate charming handsome guy who stole hearts in mass with a glorious voice that could sing anything & everything plus that winning persona forever magnetic...massive hits throughout the fifties, Elvis continued through the great musical sixties producing one stunning classic after another, sadly movies became a little stale as the sixties wore on even though Elvis always remained fascinating to watch, then smartly someone realized \\"The King Of Rock & Roll\\" needed a new venue to show Elvis magic still existed beyond those manufactured movies.<br />\\"The Comeback Special Of 1968\\" exceeded all expectations showing Elvis not only retained artistic brilliance from the beginning but had clearly gone on to the next level, that mid-fifties explosion joyfully happened all over again.

Massive hits came from these phenomenal Memphis Sessions, uniquely brilliant gems as \\"In The Ghetto\\" were stunning to hear over the airwaves, Elvis once again clearly hit the heights reclaiming his position as King Of Rock & Roll...hits continued with \\"Suspicious Minds\\" a joy to experience over and over, once again Elvis dominated the airwaves with \\"Kentucky Rain\\" another exquisite gem...complete beauty and deeply felt soulfulness of these classic songs took Elvis to greater heights in his already accomplished career, ultimately these banner sessions created a timeless masterpiece that is joyful to experience over and over.<br />\\"Elvis In Memphis\\" entering the digital age is an interesting journey, eighties \\"Elvis - The Memphis Record\\" an engrossing twenty-three track collection essential for any Elvis fan or true music lover in general...playing the great release over and over through the years had the feeling by now must exist a release of these great sessions with superior audio, \\"From Elvis In Memphis\\" Legacy Edition is that collection being beautifully remastered two-disc sumptuous collection, ultimately the definitive issue of an important timeless musical masterpiece!

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The book comes to life in this movie.  I look forward to the extended edition and the next two movies to complete the story
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was a good story. Nothing earth shattering, but enjoyable.  I wanted to read it before I see the movie.  (OK, I'm a little slow....).  I am anxious to see it now.
B0098G67TU|5.0|I LOVE Leonardo DiCaprio!  Such a great actor. I can't believe it took me so long to watch this movie.  Glad I had a box of tissues handy, though!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I loved this story because it made me think not only about people who have had head injuries due to accidents, but about people who wake up everyday in a convalescent home or anywhere when they have dementia or alzheimers.  Imagine how they must feel when they really don't understand what is going on around them... and it can change from day to day.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I was very happy to find the app for this game because I play online and have points. As long as you have WIFI and you can connect it works great of course and keeps track and uses your accounts points.I have Kindle Fire and I am very happy with this game and glad that I downloaded it. Also if you love bingo this keeps you always connected :) have fun, susan
B0017QSZW6|2.0|I did enjoy season 1 for what it was, but it did have too much nudity and sex scenes that just didn't fit smoothly into the story line.  Season 2: I got to the second episode and they tortured one of the guys for sleeping with Queen Anne.  This was an over the top, gruesome depiction that I wish I had never seen.  I will not be watching this show further.  I enjoyed learning some of the history contained in the show, but the nudity and torture are not something I want to subject my self to.  Be warned. There is some very cruel things done in this show, and they show it all.  They boil people alive, burn people alive, burst eyeballs of people, and break people on the Rack.  Season 2 just became too gross for me. Good luck.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A must read for any dog lover! It gives a great story from a dog's perspective. I have never read anything like this before. Definitely one of my forever favorites!
B000OJFV4C|3.0|It is a compelling look back into the history of England and the rest of Europe to an extent.  The show is okay, and oddly injects nudity into some scenes.  I enjoyed being able to put my self into the era and realm of King Henry's rule but the adult content really took some of the value away.  The treatment of Queen Katherine was insightful and it was worthwhile to see how King Henry started going from a normal person into more of a crazy person.  I wonder if King Henry was truly influenced by everyone the way this show presents.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The descriptions of the events of his childhood were necessary to understand the man he became and the difficulties he had with relationships.<br />I enjoyed the writing style and was never bored as I read the book. I actually wanted the book to continue past where it ended.<br />I hope this author continues to produce many more stories especially ones based on factual depictions of life.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|He has the best voice I have ever heard for giving his rendition of old and some of the newer standards  He is so smooth .
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It does not seem that a familt could go through such a horrible ordeal. I was inspired by their courage.
B000088E6D|5.0|What more can be said about Michael Buble ? He is very accomplished at what he does. Must get is you like old standards.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Funny! Thoroughly entertaining. It is my outlet into the world of comic books and pop culture, without the annoying reality TV aspect
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a handy app for the Kindle.  Very easy to use, especially helpful when grocery shopping or balancing the checkbook.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Funny! Thoroughly entertaining. It is my outlet into the world of comic books and pop culture, without the annoying reality TV aspect
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had the weather bug and like it at first then decided it wasn't user friendly for me.  So I looked at other apps for my Kindle and the AccuWeather was highly rated.  I downloaded it and it works great!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Thank goodness I have the second one ready to read right now and the third is only a few weeks away! What a story. Besides the hot sex, these two complex characters fell hard and fast and made for an interesting read. I KNOW I will find out what dark secret Gideon is hiding soon. I think his background is just as messed up as Eva's, if not worse. Can't wait to read the next two!
B001684L0A|5.0|This is our 1st Blu-ray, WOW is all I can say about picture quality compared to a DVD. I've been wasting my HD TV. Anyway my son did a school report on John Adams and I found it to be very interesting. I saw this movie while browsing on Amazon even got notified when the price dropped. Really opened my son's eyes to see how hard the original colonies lived and how passionate the people were. The whole family is totally into it, we are at the end of disc 2 and can't wait for more. So awesome the details our kids can see versus the cartoon drawing we only had to look at in a history book. Great story and the actors did very well. You will not be disappointed.
0062080237|1.0|I have to agree with all the other one-stars on here. No plot, lots of irrelevant side-stories, and read like something a college student would write. When I finished it I could sort of remember the beginning, was moderately satisfied with the very end, but could not for the life of me remember or describe the middle 400 pages of the book. Lots of mystical characters running around bumping into each other, I guess.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|The first time I read this book, I went to work on applying what I learned and completely forgot to come back and leave a review. Well, recently, I decided to re-read this book and I completely enjoyed it the second time through as well, but this time I remembered I should leave a review. Great book! I'm hoping to Crush IT with my websites! Thanks Gary!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft on a pc is better with how huge that world is. But don't get me wrong this works great on my kindle fire, same great building game. I just wish they had a difficulty setting on it like they do on pc.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|What else can you say it does what it is supposed to I have the old kindle fire and it works great.
B00BZOD63S|3.0|A somewhat unique twist on the modern &#34;woman loses child. Goes on to become vengeful ghost&#34;. The first 3/4 of the movie are actually fairly entertaining with some understated but interesting characters (especially the little daughters). There are a few cool startling moments. However, the end/climax is totally over CGI'd. The monster/mom/vengeful ghost animation lets all the air out of the suspense built to that point.. It's okay. Try it if you like this genre of horror. Otherwise, watch &#34;Breaking bad&#34; reruns.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said? The CD came in a paper sleeve, which was unexpected but welcome since the case just sits in the center console of my car. This disc is in my CD changer and will probably never come out.<br /><br />I won't go into detail on the album since most people on here have done that do death, but I will say Reckoner, 15 Step and Weird Fishes are phenomenal songs. Having said that, I've yet to skip forward through any tracks on this album. You probably wouldn't either. All of these songs are great.
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|Story of two men, polar opposites that turn out to be the same guy.. Great stuff. Carnal and visually exciting. Characters are fully developed and the dialogue is funny and deep. A must see for fans of modern film.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I really love this series, and then seeing it in Blu-ray just made me love it even more. The extras for this season gave me more tidbits that I did not know about, and as I finished this season I am more knowledgeable than I was before I started watching.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The story held my attention from the first page to the last. Made me laugh and cry, that's always a good way to tell if the book is a good one. Was surprised how it ended, didn't figure that out until real close to the end. Was a good read.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband is addicted to this game and loves to play it during conversations. It's simple enough that I think he can multitask.
B00821OX98|4.0|Love scifi and aliens, add that to the whole end of the earth survival thing and this is way better than zombies!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I love Tina Fey in movies so I thought I would give this a try. I think parts and certain phrases are funny but I disagree with her opinion most of the time so it never sat well with me all the way through. I'm sure someone that has similar ideology would like it a lot more. She's clever and it's entertaining but just slightly crass for my taste.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show. It is a mix of Scifi & CSI. I'm very pleased with the plots, the characters, & the themes.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I've always been a hotmail girl and this app helps me keep connected with just my phone or kindlefire. It works well.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is my favorite season of Doctor Who. I really like both Billie Piper and Chris Eccleston for some reason, maybe it is the chemistry between them.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love this author. I always feel like I learn a ton when I read his books. This one is my favorite. It's intriguing and entertaining and full of religious and concepts.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I had tried several other methods of remote log in and had settled on Teamviewer because it was the best balance of reliability and ease of use. Jump Desktop covers both of those and for a really good price. The interface is clean and simple. I've added a keyboard and mouse to my tablet and it really is just like a Windows laptop! My only complaint is viewing video from the remote system has been choppy but that's not what I use it for so....<br />It's a great app and it took about 5 minutes to set up. I definitely recommend it (I actually have to friends and family)
B000R8YC1I|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time on a date in high school, and many times since. I still jump every time that little ball of fur pops out of the log!
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I've been using this app to listen to some of the books I wouldn't take the time to sit down and finish. It's great because you can read along if you want to. The app can also read web content if you put in the URL. It's really good. If you try it you may consider changing the stock voice app on your device to make listening more enjoyable....Unless you're into robotic readers.....not that there's anything wrong with that ;)<br />It's a good app and definitely worth trying.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Okay I am finally getting around to writing this review. And after much thought over my 2 star rating I have decided to keep it where it is. No time didnt change my mind. I still think this was a way over the top look into a dysfunctional relationship. I simply cant get over the fact he slept with other women in the next room as a \\"punishment of sorts\\". Tacky and not a good thing to romanticize if ya ask me. I know I am in the minority here but some things just aren't cool. So I am sticking with my 2 stars.<br /><br />www dot ktbookreviews dot blogspot dot com
B00A77II0U|1.0|This game crashed multiple times before it finally froze for good on chapter 11. Simply doesn't work on my Kindle Fire. Will be asking for a refund.
B00628BOMM|5.0|I was introduced to this album at a very sad time in my life.  It was just the fix I needed, wish Opeth would release all of thier work in this style, love their poetry, not a fan of the growling metal presentation which is their norm.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This episode was certainly disappointing on many levels. First of all, all of a sudden we are jumping a year ahead and Mary is &#34;with child&#34; and Sybil and Tom's baby is a year old and he is still upset about being part of the &#34;elite&#34; rather than the working class. Bates is firmly back on the staff, Thomas is still eyeing the sexy butler (even after almost being arrested) and Edith is an older old maid. Cora is mourning Sybil but is out of the black clothes which may explain why they jumped forward a year...<br /><br />Strange episode with the introduction of some cousin named &#34;Shrimpy&#34; who hates his wife and we see that silly Rose again who apparently will be a part of next season. Downton Abbey might need to be renamed &#34;Down Abbey&#34; since this episode was disjointed, silly, and lacked the usual high standards. It seems as though the events of the last three minutes were tacked on at the end after contract negotiations with the character playing Matthew ended unsatisfactory. Mary will spend next season mourning Matthew -- that is of course unless they jump ahead and Matthew and Mary's son is taking over the estate...<br /><br />It takes a lot to put up with English snobs but this episode made me want to join Tom and his Irish cohorts as they try to chase them out of Ireland and my den... just because you are on PBS doesn't mean you can't be a second rate soap opera and that is what I watched with this episode!
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a fun fun app.Occasionaly freezes but otherwise works well. If not for the freezing it would rate a 5.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is my favorite of all the books so far.  It's fast paced, and full of adventure!  Keep them coming!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Enjoying the season 1 on Prime.  Scripts are a good mix of typical lawyer stuff with personal intrigue.  Some nice touches during court scenes and judges act like the idiots they are in real life.  The main actress and actors are excellent in their characterizations although a bit flat at times because of the repetitiveness of some of  necessary confrontations during discoveries.  Nonetheless, an enjoyable series when viewed without commercials.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game will bring hours of fun that is also educating,  teaches the skills of long term planning urbanism, money management and strategic goal sitting
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I thought this was a great story of overcoming the impossible. It was amazing how it all came together. Well worth the time to see.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have been playing diamond dash on FB for quite a while now! Totally love it!  I could play for hours! Awesome game!! Want many more FB games on the kindle.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|This record reminds me the most of their Bringing Down the Horse album. Favorite tunes include: Misfits & Lovers, Reboot the Mission, and  It's a Dream. You can listen to the entire album on their website.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It`s a cute app. Be careful & use parental controls. My 4 year old grandson loves to purchase items. Be prepared to do the side missions multiple times & some are costly. There are no extra side games for the kids to play, like the scrat game in ice age. You can only play the game if you are connected to internet. Which is not very convenient.
B0035QA3M6|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  My wife had been after me for a while to see this movie and it delivered on the hype she gave it.  It was both heart-warming and heart-wrenching.  Downey showed how well he could play a character who was full of brilliance and cheered so many, but who was also hopelessly alone at times.
B0001MLMKY|2.0|I was looking for a basic watch with the calendar date on it, but when I received this watch, it felt like something out of a bubble gum machine.  The weight, the feel, the plastic was all too cheap for what you pay.  I sent it back.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This Anthology is presented with Blu-Ray quality and contains the individual Alien movies, their theatrical and either director's cut or special edition versions: Alien, Aliens, Alien3, and Alien: Resurrection.  It also contains two separate discs that pertain to creating the Alien Anthology and also the Alien Anthology Archives which details never-before-seen content and documentaries.  Typical to the term of Anthology, the disc set is presented similar to a book, that must be flipped through to find the discs nestled within their appropriate compartments.<br /><br />There are no playback issues, and the discs respond well in the PS3 and regular blu-ray player.  The quality is spot-on and great for anyone who loves the films or wants to see them for the first time.  In addition, the price is absolutely superb for the amount of material you get.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Recently lost our son and this book made me feel better.  I have always believed in heaven but Dr Alexander's experience confirms my belief.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Really only did it when I could not sleep at night, so when it was the last possible thing left.
B008Q0D32S|3.0|The movie is one of the best &#34;Spaghetti Westerns&#34; from a bygone era of movies. The film represents the genre at its height.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a great app! The game has more than one level and there are cute little medals you get for playing.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My whole family loved the book and when we bought the movie we were all very pleased with it. My kids know the book by heart but having the characters come to life was great for them. We loved it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It;s so easy to use!  I am thankful that I can use it on my Kindle Fire HD.  I love it!
B009NSHZLW|1.0|tried DIVX, AVI, and XVID...  none of the formats would play, even when they were lower scale grabs off youtube and not in HD
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy arcade style games so its decent entertainment for me. though some games could be a little different for the touch screen use
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|THIS APPLICATION TAKES UP TOO MUCH STORAGE ON THE KINDLE FIRE SO UNABLE TO DOWNLOAD. I LOVE THE GAME HOPE THEY FIX IT.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like it and when my grandchildren plays it! They seems to be a game going all the time! Love it!
B009D5VNLS|4.0|Funny. Clever. Heartwarming. Great lesson learned by the daughter. Made me cry like a baby. My 21 year old son loved it also.
0393327345|5.0|Fight club, by Chuck Palahniuk, is one of the best yet unique books I have ever read. It kept me interested throughout the entire thing and had me wanting more. They're multiple genres that fit this book but I would have to say it's a suspense, drama and mystery. If I had to give it a ratting out of 5 stars, I would have to give it a 5. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and anyone over the age of 16. It has everything you want in a book including fights, love, drama and everything in between. It does have many sexual references and inappropriate language that may not be suitable for young teens and children. Other then that, I would recommend this to any audience.<br /> Palahniuk did a really good job giving each character a distinct personality. I could really picture the characters in my head. The author's use of imagery is spectacular, especially during the fight scenes where his words make you cringe as you can feel the narrator's head crash in to the cement. Many exciting themes are seen throughout the story, which makes it so much better. Each chapter has a deeper meaning than just what the text reads. There are twists that will shock you and keep you entertained.<br /> Although this a great book with very few flaws, there are some things that I would change. I believe that the title of the book doesn't do it justice. When people pick this book up, they will think that it is all about fighting but that isn't the case. A fight club plays a big role in the story but I believe that there are many other titles that are more suitable for this story. At times the author will also get a little confusing and is hard to follow. Many random thoughts by the narrator will push you off course a bit at times. Overall this is a great story that should be read by everyone at least once.
B0031RS42K|5.0|A thriller from start to finish I could not put it down .<br /> This is one of the best , keep up the good work .<br />dan You are the BEST.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The old app worked well. This will not wirk at all.Extremely disappointed. I cannot access my Amazon kindle content like before. Amazon, fix this!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wish that the Rio update would stay on your kindle loved the look of Rio much better than China, but over all love the game would definitely recommend this game :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything you could want in an easy to navigate format; use at least once a day in the am, and often one or more times through the day.  I highly recommend this app.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game and always go back and try to improve my score.  great thinking processes and hand and eye coordination.
B00BT0ZS52|2.0|I saw Tom Hanks was in the movie and so I pretty much ignored the negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />CLOUD ATLAS was violent in a really gross way from beginning to end, boring at times, and always self-important, as though this movie has some great message to convey.<br /><br />And for those of us who didn't get it, the great martyr heroine of the movie spells it out, word-for-word, in a speech for all to hear while bodies are literally flying around the place.<br /><br />The movie is a preposterous as it is bombastic. It is a complete waste of over three hours of your time.<br /><br />It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst movie I've seen this year.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|not just a mindless game.  you must think about how you are going to play. helps to improve hand and eye coordination and thought processes.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Ok if you can live with constant ads.  Some ads hide the escape quite well but once you master that the commands are easy
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|improves your hand and eye coordination and makes you think about the moves you must make to win. It can be frustrating but ultimately loads of fun.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I have just read the book, and although some changes were made, I still enjoyed the movie and the performances a lot!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|again, not just a mindless game you must think about your move.  improves hand and eye coordination. Frustration aside, it is an excellent game.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter who is 5but she doesn't read well enough to play independently. It's also too slowly paced to keep her interest. I have played it and find it fun and relaxing.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It shows how she continued on no matter what happened. The choices she had to make was for her children, her family. Just wished it continued on.
B0081336FO|5.0|This series was masterfully done - my favorite version of Sherlock and Watson to date. Kudos to the screenwriters, director, and excellent actors... and congrats on landing a major role in the new Star Trek (although I won't be able to watch it now without wondering to myself, &#34;Why is Sherlock Holmes in space?&#34; lol).
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This Gangstar game is a lot better than the other ones. It looks more realistic than Miami Vindication and West Coast Hustle. However, it would be better if buildings rendered more farther away, and if the lag was a little more flattened. It still worked like a charm on my Kindle Fire 2nd G. Some people say this is a copy of GTA, but it isn't fully a copy. It has realistic indoor settings (clubs, safehouses), and you can do more than you can in GTA 3 or Vice city.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|It's great that they are making movie's that I grew up with in HD. Now I have my six year old loving the ninja turtles. They just don't make movie's and cartoons like they use to.
B0010X745K|5.0|I was glad to have found The Mist for my movie collection. It's a great buy and came in good, time and good price. The movie is really good, it has one of the most shocking endings I've ever seen. No spoilers but I would recommend it to anyone.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I enjoy this app. Let's me make several different books. And I can change the titles, fonts, colors, covers. Helps me distinguish my to do list from my diary. The only thing I dislike is the lag it has when opening, it runs a little heavy. But other then that its A great app.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|I have always been a Tom  Clancy  fan as an ex serviceman and a fan of the USA , I served with marines  In Korea .................
B000Q79HS8|5.0|Didn't really realize the shot of him underwater in the first movie is mimicked in the third like visual bookends.
0670014893|4.0|As a casual reader, I found the Smiley novels to be so opaque as to be more of a study than a read. But the effort was worthwhile, because in the end I was not only entertained but had a memorable experience. Living characters, and plot that seemed to rise from the ground like mist.<br /><br />By contrast, A Delicate Truth is not at all difficult; it's a fast and easy page-turner, with plot points that stand out like billboards on a sunny day. As entertainment, it's worthwhile, but you'll probably forget all about it in a week. Which is unfortunate, because the issues raised in the novel are every bit as important as those faced in the Cold War.<br /><br />Maybe the problem is that evil has become so banal that it's no longer interesting. When the bad guys of the world are just puerile rich people, how can you describe them with nuance and ambiguity?
B00BSWMITK|1.0|What a letdown. Being a huge Satriani fan, this was a highly anticipated release. Especially with new band members I was hoping for some fresh energy. Nothing new here. I've been a fan since Satch had hair but I find this to be his worst recording to date. Sorry Joe but that's just the straight up truth - my opinion of course. Maybe the masses will like it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so gripping. Very entertaining. Can't wait for next season.  We will see what the Governor has up his sleeve.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|A must for the Hero3 camera. Best to know what you are shooting and review is important also. Without it you are blind.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great mahjong game. Just the right amount of difficultly. I download all the 24/7 mahjong theme games. They're my favorites.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Die Hard(1988) is a fun, well made action thriller based on Roderick Thorp's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever. It has a first rate musical score by the late Michael Kamen. It stars Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. The score borrows bits and pieces of Beethoven music! It has state of the art special effects. It's been ripped off in movies such as Passenger 57(1992), City Hunter(1993), High Risk(1995), Crackerjack(1994), Air Force One(1997), Skyscraper(1997), Paul Blart Mall Cop(2009) and more. The film has spawned infamous catchphrases and sequels. New York cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) has to rescue hostages being held captive in an office building. On my VHS copy, \\"hostages\\" was misspelled as \\"hoistages\\"! Alan Rickman is superb as an intelligent, charismatic, well dressed German terrorist Hans Gruber. Die Hard earned its R rating. There's foul language, bloody violence, and brief nudity. The film also has some humor. A limo driver casually ignores the bullets hitting a moving police car! I spent most of 1995 watching Die Hard on VHS. I was elated with joy after buying it on a special edition DVD in 2002. Bonnie Bedelia is quite good as John McClane's wife Holly. Hart Bochner plays a hostage who tries to bargain his way out. William Atherton plays a reporter who ends up putting people in danger. Reginald Veljohnson is good as Officer Al Powell. In an Angry Video Game Nerd review of Die Hard The Nintendo Game, the Nerd jokingly called Al Powell \\"Officer Carl Winslow\\"! Then he showed us an 8 bit still photo of Steve Urkel! Die Hard is a classic action movie. Yippie kai yeh, Mr. Falcon!
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|This one was a stinker, explains how it got to online rental so fast.  I would wait until its free and then sleep through it.
B004DK49DW|5.0|This is another great album from mike ness and social distortion, more mature sound, but great composition i love this cd, great work
0062209493|5.0|the cd starts out a bit slow and rehashes seal school which I guess does provide for a solid foundation to the story.  Chris is without a doubt a great American hero and has taken on the toughest task humanly possible.  His book shares all of this inner thoughts and insight to being a Seal.  Highly recommend.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat again delights us with its peculiar sound, a decorated disc in the far West, full of sounds and atmosphere that transported us to the West, loaded with guitars country style, featuring Rob Caggiano as producer and guitarist, Also features exquisite passages of harmonica in charge of Paul lamb, this wonderful album also boasts the participation of the legend of the heavy metal King Diamond and the singer sarah blackwood, finally a theme that walks through sounds country, rockabilly, metal and even punk, In short another great work of volbeat
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This may be a B movie and many others might say it is junk, but there is just something about this movie which I really liked. Having said that, this doesn't mean you will.<br />Ken<br />Webmaster<br />About Facts Net
B00BF124PC|5.0|I had no idea, opps almost spoiled it.  No, I wont tell you but it is very good and intense.  Very suspenseful.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Very realistic submarine movie, one of the best ever made. It is so good I don't even mind the closed captions translating the German to English.<br />Ken<br />Webmaster<br />About Facts Net
B00BT0ZS52|2.0|Kind of interesting, but not.  And it's way too long.  The acting is not very good either.  I expected better effects.  I thought it would be more sci fi and fantasy but it was just weird.
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Dear Amazon folks, On a number of occasions I've tried to rent a movie only to be told that I have to purchase it for my 'library'. I would rather rent since I only watch movies once. I'm considering moving to another internet provider if this doesn't change.<br />Bob Dewar<br />5/14/13
B000KX0HVY|4.0|This cd is missing \\"Seperate Ways\\" which peaked @ # 20 in 1973. Its also missing \\"Raised On Rock\\", \\"My Way\\", \\"Until Its Time For You To Go\\", \\"I Really Dont Want To Know\\", \\"Promised Land\\", \\"My Boy\\", & some other top 40 hits. For once i wish RCA & other record companies would put together complete hit packages instead of bits & pieces.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this App. I have one on my phone and Kindle too. The hourly forecasts are great because they help me plan my day and clothing around the weather, especially on my days off.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Safe Haven is a really good and I really love this movie I would recommend people to watch the movie .
B001TMCFFQ|3.0|I hadn't read a Steel book in many years as the last few I read seemed to be written by an amateur. I noticed in reading other reviews that I wasn't the only one that felt this way. She was getting highly criticized by long-time fans. I also dropped her. My sister recommended I read this when I returned from St. Petersburg, so I did. I was glad I did, even though at times getting through it frustrated me. It's not a story I will easily forget, and actually I should have read it prior to my trip to Russia. There is some history here that seems factual to what we heard over there. The main character and a few of her close relatives were developed well, the story line was interesting, overloaded with tragedy, \\"but\\"...<br /><br />I knew I had stopped reading Steel because of the writing but didn't remember why. This brought it all back to me. She begins many sentences with the words \\"But\\" or \\"And.\\" Such as \\"But she felt the war was inevitable.\\" or \\"And they went to see the Wizard of Oz that night.\\" Each of those words could have been left off the start of the sentence and still conveyed the meaning. I remember being taught in English class that one never opened a sentence with either of those words. Often times she uses those words to elongate a sentence as well, too many \\"buts\\" or \\"ands\\" in one sentence drove me up the wall. I can't tell you how many times in just a few paragraphs this happens. It felt like I was reading a teen girls diary, not a novel written by an accomplished author. What were the editors getting paid for? One wonders. I liked the story of Zoya very much, so much so that I started overlooking the words that were put together to tell it.<br /><br />I just didn't like the writing style at all, which is a shame, since it could've been just an awesome 5-star novel if it had been done right.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE the whole series.  Can't wait for the next season<br />to continue the saga.  Very well done - great acting and scenery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so cool and I can't wait for the update.  All of you out there who hates it because it is not the computer version are missing out.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I couldn't wait to play this game.....which is kind of hard if you can't even get it on your device.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It is a good story about two lost souls looking for love and what happens to them.  Good comedic moments but sometimes contrived.  Something good to read overall.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great season until the end.  Kind of spoiled it for a lot of us.  Oh well, I was loving it mostly!
B00000K3CK|5.0|This is the black and white original version the movie my mom has been wanting this for years and i found it at a great price its a great Christmas movie. so yes i would tell someone to buy it if they are looking to add to their Christmas movie collection
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting story  with  an uplifting ending;makes me want to go back to Ireland and meet folks like Jamie & Lydia!
1400069289|5.0|Wow! This book changes the way I think about what I do and why, as well as how to change what I do and why. So insightful! A great read for any person seeking to create positive and lasting change in their life.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|This movie was as historically accurate as could possibly be given that the battle was fought 150 years ago.  It was very well done indeed.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Well written entertaining and humourous. What more can I say. Enjoyed the TV series but this is far better as books usually are.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Great stuff. Did what I needed it to do. will order more as needed. Cheapest I had found and and was afraid was going to be cheap product but was great.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie was very tastefully done. Well acted and great action! Cant wait to see the next one coming !
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I was committed to Dropbox long before I bought my Kindle Fire HD. It is an easy-to-use cloud storage system in which the files reside on my computer and work just like other files; they simply sync with other devices. When I wanted to put the app on my Kindle Fire HD, I went to Amazon to get it. When I clicked to purchase, I got a notice that it wasn't available for the Kindle Fire. What!!????!!! I went ahead anyway; I couldn't believe it. Sure enough. It didn't work. Called Amazon Help. No help there. They simply confirmed that it was not available for my device. I finally got on a forum and found out how to get it and now I am a lot happier with the Kindle Fire HD.
193700788X|1.0|I am so disappointed. If she hated Sookie this much, she should have let a ghost writer pen the last book or not even bothered. I feel cheated not only out of the cash! but also of devoting myself to a series that utterly failed at the end.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Highly addictive game! Makes me want to go on another dive trip to see all the fish and coral for real!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Awesome.....I Love this Movie Clear and Authentic a Must See Movie Will Have You Rolling All OVer the Floor ....
B005HED08I|5.0|It's like seeing these episodes for the first time! The colors are crisp and the audio is great. Despite poor special effects due to budget constraints I highly recommend the series to young people who may have never seen the original show. The themes will always be relevant.  The jokes even seem funnier!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I heard this group for the first time on Saturday Night Live and was completely blown away. Went right to the computer and ordered the CD. Every song is excellent. Can't wait to hear more from this group.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I use this app for everything from an alarm clock to a stopwatch to time my bike rides. Works great on my kindle fire and has yet to dissappoint!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a compelling read of a family's conflict in dealing with raising a different child from the one the always thought they knew.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This is one of those movies you have to watch more than once to understand what is going on half the time. That's fine, but my biggest fault with it is that it gives no personal background of Lincoln himself -- probably because so many other movies and documentaries have dealt with his pre-presidential years already.<br /><br />The whole focus of the movie seems to be on the drama of how hard it was, once he had freed the slaves by the Emancipation Proclamation, to get the 13th Amendment passed, so that the slave states couldn't just reinstitute slavery again after the war. It was a worthy issue to focus on, but the title of the movie could have not led us to expect a much more comprehensive treatment of Lincoln's whole life. Something like \\"Lincoln's Fight To Permanently Outlaw Slavery\\" might have been a better title. Over all, a worthwhile movie to see.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|People often communicate in different ways using language.  The language of flowers provides an opportunity to observe a very different way of communicating using one's instincts and knowledge to interact with others.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book is for everyone since we're all creators. A huge self esteem booster and depression buster. I know I'll turn to this book whenever my ego pokes its head.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|Don't expect any dialogue...there is none.  Really.....not any at all.<br />I watched this for a psych class. Human Growth and Development.<br />This was perfect.<br />It compares and contrasts pregnancy, child birth, and child rearing in different cultures.<br />My own cultural beliefs caused my jaw to drop in some scenes but literally laugh out loud in others.<br />Seeing how different cultures approach family life is astounding and very interesting.  Watching these babies develop was fun.  I think I watched I three times!<br /><br />If you are looking for action and adventure....move along.  If you like a cute and interesting presentation of what might otherwise be considered mundane, grab you popcorn.  I enjoyed it for what it is...an informational documentary.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Without a doubt their best album. Hayley's voice is very powerful. Make sure to listen to guitar and drums, very creative, great composition. They just keep getting better and better.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album because the music is just as I remembered it.  Easy to download and play.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|Perhaps just expected a bit more from this movie. The story was adequate, the \\"human\\" animation was well done, but for me just fell short of a go rent it. Perhaps if ALL characters had either \\"cartoon\\" faces, or \\"real\\" faces as did Tin Tin, I would of enjoyed it more. Snowy the dog, however, was well done!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Colorful use of time and era based themes makes a great mixture for this inventive sequel in cut the rope
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie beary much and would recommend it  to anyone that wants to watch a good movie.  Awesome movie....
B005LAIIFS|5.0|My grandsons absolutely love this movie.  The eggs were an extra bonus as this was part of their Easter basket!
B001XVD21Y|4.0|Acting tour de force...jack, Leo, Matt Damon, Marky Mark...Sorcese does it again...only weak point, final shot. A must see for Leo & Marty fans.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is an excellent rendition of the book.  I can't wait until the second one comes out!  One of my favorite books!
B0007XT7V8|5.0|It is one of those albums that the more you listen to, the more you love it. Buy it, you won't regret it.

B00AOEA2B4|5.0|They sound like W.E.T. and Eclipse so it is great!<br />I don't know why I never hear these groups on radio in the U.S. They're better than the stuff I usually hear that's out today unless I listen to frontiers internet radio. This is my favorite cd. Great lyrics, vocal and music so easy to get into. Crank it up!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I sincerely hate that this is the end of the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I will miss this character deeply. I feel as though I'm fixin to cry!<br /><br />However, Ms. Harris chose a terrific ending for Sookie. For a moment there towards the end of the book, I thought the worst was going to happen.  That's all I'm going to say.  I don't want to ruin it for any of the people that have not had the chance to read it yet.<br /><br />Guess now I will catch up on some of Ms. Harris' other series.  I have enjoyed all of her books that I have read and that is a whole bunch!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Not enough sophistication in problem solving. . kill the bad guys seemed to be the answer to everything. . .it made sense in the end but not enough information about what Reacher was detecting or what he saw or how he was going to tame the villains as the story unfolded.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has become part of how I take notes every day. I use it at work across multiple devices. Cut and pasting content, organizing and quick notes are super simple.

B005UDD1R6|1.0|transfered a .mov movie into this program.  it plays like a scratched record.  skips and stalls.  maybe the resolution of the original was too high...
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Was watching it with the parents, not a good idea they got up in the middle because of the f-bombs and description of sexual acts. Over all it was funny...had a great ending. Left me with a smile.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Oh my goodness. I would stay up all night because I could not get enough. This was the most exhilarating book I have ever read!!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|was a little over the top...I am a vampire and Lincoln fan for sure. It was weird seeing them put together.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved the book so much. I don't have the words to explain how I feel right now. This is the best book I have read in a while and recommend it to anyone especially teens trying to find them selfs. I'm 15 now and absolutely loved reading this book. This is a must read.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Good movie was great to see Will Smith again of course and to see what it was like before..would watch again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I absolutely love this app and use it all the time but i wish that there were more stuff for it to do like a pi button or a fraction button but over all it is so great and i never have problems with it so it is so cool

B001UGB1X8|4.0|A little slow at times but it was interesting enough to keep me watching. Like John Goodman as a bad guy.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It makes sense we are all different, lots to learn , put in in practice should help your life and relatinships.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I gave this 3 stars because once you take it off, it only runs for 5 hours before it stopped. Aside from that, I do like that it's not very heavy and a good watch for every day use.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator app. It's the best one on Amazon, I've tried several. This one even goes full screen and remembers the previous calculation typed in. I would highly recommend this app.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|I love this game! It is just like Farm Story or Dragon Ville or other games where you build towns or cities, except no wifi connection is required! Hence my review title. The only problem I have with the game is your action bar. You only have a limited amount of actions (used to collect rent and coins, harvest plants, and  build structures) before you buy some with real money or CityCash, Specificor wait until it fills up again. If you choose to wait, you only get 1 action per 2 minutes, so be patient. Specific structures' rent is CityCash. You can, as I already pointed out, use it to refill your action bar, or to buy specific buildings, shops, or decorations. Consider Buying the game! If you do, have a great city! (I know, corny line.) :)
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|If you only buy one album this year,  this is the one you buy.  Best album I've heard in a decade.  It's been a long time since I've listened to an album from start to finish.  Especially since we all have Mp3's or Ipods these days.  Not only do I  listen from start to finish but I repeat the process.  Every time I listen I like it more.  I swear this album will continue to grow on you.  Excellent variety of music.  I'm going to see Tom live next week and couldn't be more excited.  Click on the buy button,  this is an excellent album.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I really enjoyed this game but way to short and easy would of been more worth it if it was 99 cents. I gave 4 stars because it gave you a little bonus game at the end. I would recommend playing it but only<br />if you want a fast game.

B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Providing console graphics with an action packed first position shooter, a game like this just doesn't get any better! Havok,  game designing technicians, really takes Gameloft to the next level, with the use of beautiful environmental graphics, and an easy to use stylish control allowing you to be integrated in the heat of combat.<br /><br />  The game itself contains two types of play. The campaign, and multiplayer. The campaign, created with an excellent storyline, is based on a national terrorist war against the US and Russians. Many of who probably recall at this point Modern Warfare 4, with the similar storyline, and is probably thinking why get a game that basically mocks the original, but I say rest assured because this storyline comes with a freshly new point of view, while it stretches its feet of combat in a new era, and a new form of combat.<br /><br />  As for the second type play in multiplayer, there have been some complaints on how it functions. Mainly because of the limited use the character is somewhat constrained in combat, that is, it's hard for some to check his full surroundings without having to continuously slide the screen and get a full 180, to some of which may come in handy when getting shot from behind. This minor technicality, though, does not interfere with the fun of dueling it out with your friends online and<br />people across the world!<br /><br />At 99 cents, this offer will not last long! Especially with the fun and sense of integration this game brings, this truly is a worth it, and new form of combat game! I advise people, who enjoy playing combat and first shooter games, with the love of console graphics, to get this game. It's fun and just straight up new, especially within in the grasp of your fingertips on your tablet! Who could ask for more?
1439170916|5.0|This book is written for easy read. But for those who want to dwell more into it there are enough references to go to. What a good way to write about complicated issues.<br /><br />Covers a bit of the politics of science too and of research!<br /><br />A good insight into how science research  gets done in this country... a bit disconcerting.
1449433251|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is one of the sweetest, funniest, most heart warming comic strips of all time. It doesn't matter how many times I read the strips, they always make me laugh, and think, and feel, and make me remember what it's like to look at the world with a childlike sense of wonder.<br /><br />Bill Watterson is a genius. I don't know how he managed to slip so much fun, joy and wisdom into such an ephemeral medium, but he did it masterfully.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Daniel Day was awesome in this movie.  This movie has pushed me learn more about Lincoln the man.  The unexpected twist was perfectly done.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie so I waited to do so. And it is a good thing because the book is far better than the movie, I loved it!

B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I have the amended or clean cd and download which says more about me than it does about Bruno. Just like \\"Hooligans and Doo-woops\\" his previous cd this has 10 songs.<br />Unlike the freshmen offering this actually has a 1960's style song reminding me of Sam Cook's \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" in melody, if not message called \\"If I Knew\\". \\"Treasure\\" in subject is similar to his \\"Just The Way You Are\\" with a different style and beat. This has a few she took me on a roller coaster ride of love song which seem to be his favorite genre and he lesson seems to be be in the  low times remember the highs. The highlight is the hit,\\"When I was Her Man\\" he makes sound heartfelt. You may ask why only 4 stars? I am partial to songs about love not sex. But for those who like sex songs and people that live love only for the moment those songs are here too. If you loved the first cd, you'll find something you like a lot playing the Unorthodox Jukebox.<br />An important reminder I have the AMENDED CLEAN VERSION.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I really enjoy this app, you simply slice the fruit with your fingers and avoid slicing the bombs. It is very addictive. There are many modes to do, like Zen, which is no bombs, 90 seconds. The other two modes are Arcade, where some fruits give you power-ups and bombs are -10 points, and Classic, with unlimited time, 3 lives and bombs that end the game. I really enjoy this game, I can get my feelings out by attacking the fruit. I suggest you get it, or at least try the free version.

B007NZDES0|5.0|This is a wonderful video and album.  It's a shame there is such a long time between her recording/touring sessions.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|This is a pretty basic courtroom drama with a romantic triangle thrown in for fun. But the gold in this show is in the acting. Julianna Margulies, Alan Cumming, Christopher Noth, and wonderful guest actors make what might otherwise be trite something interesting.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Good flick always a good movie when love saves all and they can get over whatever they were led to about.
B000P0J06K|5.0|I had on VHS and it got hard to see so we DVD version. The first of a series is usually best one and grand kids And I like batman so we are very happy.
B004NELBPC|1.0|I have the first Kindle Fire and the old app was great for reading Huff Post.  This one won't tilt in the direction in the direction I would normally read Huff on my Kindle, the list is all photos, like I can't read headlines, and when I touch a photo for the story, I get this small print that I can't expand and make larger.  I used to be able to read a story and easily post it on Twitter and Facebook without losing the page.  Now I don't dare because I have to go to the Twitter page or Facebook page and then try to go back.  I also use to be able to comment on articles, but can't do it now.  I try to go on other news sites on the Web now and ignore the Huff post app.  It's impossible to use for very long and I can't read the articles very well any way.  For what reason, this app wasn't tested ahead of time on many Kindle devices, I don't know, but it makes the Huff post look very bad and drives readers away from it.
B005HEK3JW|2.0|I love this series, but Amazon has some problems streaming this when I want to watch it.  That is really disappointing.  It's not a browser problem.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I really enjoyed  the movie. I have visited South Port and recognized some of the scenes. I also had the book.

0812982622|1.0|I got this as an audible book and was excited to listen to it because of all of its accolades and the award of the Pulitzer Prize. But I found it was so boring and dark, that try as I might, I just couldn't get into the story, care about the characters, or understand what made it a compelling read.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I am not sure how people with view it if they have never seen a live show of Cirque, but I am positive they will appreciate the skills and art of these athletes is extraordinary.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|Loved the ride!  Outstanding acting performances combined with a strong storyline that masterfully weaves together the limits of fantasy and our basic human physical and emotional frailties.
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you are a fan or not, this is still a great watch.<br />Interesting and filled with humor.<br />Great background on all the members and can be watched in parts.
193700788X|1.0|As many others have noted, the quality of writing has declined over the last few books, but in this one even Sookie's normally spirited personality seems flat. I seriously cannot believe that Sookie has no real goodbye encounter with Eric--no resolution, no reflection. I would have been fine if they didn't end up together, but for Sookie not to even really care about what happens to Eric? Whether you think he's good for Sookie or not, the Eric/Sookie chemistry was sizzling throughout much of the series and to so easily let it go trivializes both Sookie and Eric, making them much less real. I would have never read any of these books if the writing had started out like the writing in this final book in which there is absolutely no pay off at all:( Well, things happen, but we don't care about them, and neither does Sookie seem to care about much of anything. Even Bill seems to have given up on trying to get her back.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|great movie cant wait for the rest of the story to hit the DVD shelf, going to give this copy away and get the blue ray
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was such a good ending for the series.  I would have liked it to pull in a few more threads (like what happened to Morgase?) but over all I was very pleased with it.  I sort of want to start over at book 1 again now!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I did not have the opportunity to see any of the series when it debuted, and with more time, I watched all three seasons this past week; the third season I purchased for download into my Amazon Prime Video Library.  The caliber of the entire production is not only remarkable, but one I will repeatedly watch and enjoy.  Each character, without reservation, is wonderful and more important, watching their personalities go through a series of hardships, joys and sorrows is quite emotional at times.  As everyone else who has watched the series, we are waiting for the 4th season and as far as I am concerned could go on for many years.  Masterpiece Theatre does not disappoint and have proved once again to bring a flawless production to its audiences.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, I downloaded it for free on my Kindle Fire after teasing my best friend for playing it so much.  Now I understand why!  It's a great game to play in the waiting room, or in the evenings to wind down.  The music and sound effects are soothing, and it's a lot of fun to build your own under water home for the sea life.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have not had any issues with the game. No freezing, no crashing, no lag.  DH4 loads fast and plays smooth on my kindle fire.  Recommend this game for fantasy fans, action fans, and rpg fans.  The story line is not to encumber some but it catches your ear and eye, story not your thing easy skip buttons.  My favorite part is you dont have to spend any money unless you absolutely want to. Long story short. Great game buy and beat up stuff with your friends.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch novel! I love this character and that nothing keeps him from solving his cases! He's down-to-earth and uncertain in his relationships.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and bright and colorful.  Played with it for hours, my grandson picked it up quickly.  I found the graphics crisp and sharp and little draw on resources.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've seen the first movie but it really does no justice to the book that makes you laugh, cry, grow to anger, and truly get caught in whatever moment arises. Seeing the movies now will be like revisiting the memories as if peering into an old photo album. I'm going to miss following the lives of \\"friends.\\"
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is fun.  It's good to fill time.  I like that it's different every time, so u can't just memorize the routes.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I watched Captain America in the theaters and was kind of let down, because it seemed like it was just a set-up for the Avengers.  Fortunately, The Avengers was a great movie so the set up was worth it.  On its own, it's an ok movie.  With The Avengers, it adds a lot of depth to the character and really fleshes out the whole experience.<br /><br />Watch this movie.  Then watch The Avengers.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|Being a fan of The Lord of The Rings movies this one didn't disappoint me at all. All the action and the storyline are top notch.
B0055D3EFU|3.0|Insidious is at times genuinely scary.  The whole film is pretty creepy, especially if you have kids.  The thought of something coming after your children that you can't stop is frightening, and they manage to pull of some decent scares.  I was really enjoying the movie until the last 1/3 rd or so when you start to understand what is causing the disturbances and how to stop it.  Once you find out the source of the hauntings, and how they go about fixing it, it gets a little out there for me.<br /><br />Not a  bad movie, but I found I couldn't suspend disbelief in the last 1/3rd.  If you like modern haunted house movies like paranormal acitivy, but crave higher production values, check this one out.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Not as good as advertised! I think the Academy Award should have went to another movie. Three stars will have to do.
B003FC3LQK|5.0|My wife loves this movie.  She has seen it probably 1000 times. This movie made teenage girls CRAZY for SWAZY!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a very good movie, but I did not like the ending. Denzel is great in all his movies
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It took me a few pages to catch on to the fact that this book is written from the dog's perspective, in his own words, so to speak.  He talks about his owner, who is a racecar driver, and they watch race car movies together.  It's quite funny at times, but also sad after his owner loses his wife to cancer.  The emotions are real throughout the book and gave me a good insight of how our dogs perceive us and how compassionate they truly are.  I liked this book a lot because I am an animal lover and could emphathize with the dog and also the people.  It's also very sad, but with an excellent ending.  The only thing that got a little big boring was the talk about racecar driving, but it compared race car driving to real live and how we live it.  It's definitely worth the time to read it.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I started this book years ago and got too busy to finish it then. I just re-read it so I could finish out the series. Well worth a second read!
B00AR3WD8W|2.0|Disc 1 is an old mix. Nothing has been done to enhance it since 1998. The excessive hiss totally kills the experience. Plus some of the dialog has been cut. Disc 2, although remixed for this set, the original tapes were not used. It's just a transfer of the master, complete with fake applause and whistles added. This was supposed to have been a \\"Legacy edition.\\" So I don't see the reason to cut such deep corners. The additional songs recorded that evening are almost unlistenable due to excessive hiss. The booklet is decent if slight. But neither BMG nor subpar sound can take away from The King being, well, The King. Another missed opportunity by BMG to do right by ELVIS.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I thought it was really good till you have to purchase the full game. If were on sale would definitely purchase
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This story tells the human side of the war on both sides.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading stories about WWII
B004K58GSO|5.0|This is the best western movie of all time. Or maybe not. I think so anyway. Everyone has their own opionion
B00C7TAWAK|5.0|This book was recommended to me by Brant Peters for improving drawing skill. After reading the book and putting a few of the practices to work, I am noticing an improvement in my own drawing. This book is totally worth it.

B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I could watch it a hundred times, in fact I probably have. Not your typical romance, but fun and entertaining.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|So full of emotion.  There were times I wanted to stop reading, but was compelled to read on. So glad I did. Beautiful.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you use ebay, you need this app.  It was so handy to have when selling some items around our home.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|It is a really good  series. You get a feel for the life during Henry's rein. The actors do a nice job. Highly recommend all 4 seasons.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love the series. It's X-Files recreated, and I really enjoyed X-Files, so that's a great compliment. Fringe is a bit better.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I am of the WWII era so found it to be very interesting.  The detail was great, you felt like you were there.  A very compeling story and how wonderful an ending after so many years of reliving the event.
B003IY47JK|5.0|I really like the album its melodic and the singer can sing well and she looks hot :) The music is definitely good.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|Loved it and was willing to give it 5 stars for the value it offered until the adjusting screw broke 2 weeks into my ownership of this watch. Now I'm looking for some sort of customer service and the seiko corporation seems to have no record of even having produced this series of watch, so thanks for stealing my money I guess.
B007Y1JGOY|5.0|this album is awesome and it is melodic. The musicians can play and the singer is hot and can sing too :)
B000002GYG|5.0|This was a replacement for a vinyl memory of my college days. Great stuff, even if dated. If you are a Waits fan, it's a 'must have'.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|It is fun to watch the entire series of Fawlty Towers.  It has been many years since we originally saw the show.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|What can I say? A necessity you can't do without if you want your amazon e book reader charged. Works as intended.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|new and exciting.. something different, but keeps you very interested and coming back each episode for more.  I love it!
159102594X|2.0|While I was pleased with how quickly I received my purchase, I must say that I found the material very bland. I haven't read any sword & sorcery novels in over 20 years and thought I'd give this 'highly touted' novel a try after reading many positive reviews. It wasn't long into the book that I realized that the genere was no longer for me. After 170 pages, I should be hooked but I wasn't. I kept making excuses to keep reading and finally I reached a point where I could no longer justify further time spent on trying to like it. Nothing wrong with the writing; just not a very interesting plot. Sorry.
B007MDB548|5.0|We love the 3D of this movie and when then send the 4 disc combo, I can actually send the DVD home with her to view.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a very good book, I finished it in 2 days which is huge for me because  I hate reading books. I just couldn't put it down!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Overall---acting is excellent. Character development exceeds conventional TV. Am looking forward to seeing the other seasons play out. Thank you.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|It got here very quickly. We seemed to have lost ours and this was a good price so we got it. Great movie.
B005HS00NW|3.0|I wouldn't ever say that the music on this album isn't quality, but it's not something I was ready for after having an idea of what I like from M83. The allure of Midnight City and trusting that the rest of the album would live up to it's promise was a VERY misplaced assumption. I'm a fan of 80's revival; even with that most of the tracks on HU,WD were a little out there for me.<br /><br />Some good songs are to be found here, seperated by strange very out of place interludes. The whole album felt like much more of an experiment than a well thought out series of songs, but if someone wants me to take place in an experiment I'd like to be paid for it and not do the paying.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Overall, I thought the message of the book was an important one. This was a choice for my book club, and the consensus was that the writing wasn't all that fantastic, and the message was one that we'd all heard before, but it was an interesting way to make the point.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thought that the Language of Flowers was very different, with a charming story. It was nicely written and I learned a lot about flowers.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|I like the songs. But when I play the CD using my laptop, there's Trojan (informed by my Norton anti-virus)...Strange.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have never written a review about a book before, but I had to about Dead Ever After.  I have been reading the Snookie series since it started, but the last few books have been disappointing.  The final book was so bad I wanted to throw my kindle across the room. After all these years I thought the last one would have something that would stand out. There was nothing. It just ended, in fact it was boring. I'm really disappointed in Charlaine Harris.
B005D63ICI|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all times. I think this season as well as all the other seasons are five stars. Each one is better than the last. This season is exciting because he is starting to have feelings for a new love. Very exciting!
B00BF123WG|4.0|I hate the idea of this film. I really don't like the obvious liberties that need to be taken to make a story like this into cinema. It sickens me that it's marketed with video game levels for &#34;Call of Duty&#34;. What an idiotic world we live in. Yuck.<br /><br />Ok, now that I am off my high horse. It's a really well crafted film. Great acting performances, great editorial, great cinematography, and a director who has really made an effort to understand and convey this story.
B0090XG9T4|5.0|I love the glory days of Hollywood, this is the best of the best...a must buy blu ray if you want to relive the glory days of film
B00COHIFQS|3.0|There are a lot of well crafted elements in this film, it could have been something much more gratifying. And I do think it is a worthwhile rental.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />Soooo predictable. There is nothing you can't see coming from a mile away. The plot is old and stale, it would have needed some serious directorial toasting and buttering to be anything more than derivative.<br /><br />There really isn't much more worth saying about it. The VFX are hit and miss. The performances are ok, but not crafted well enough to make up for the mediocrity of the story telling. There are massive holes in the 3rd act.... blah blah. Another film that requires you to pretend you haven't seen it all done before. But graced with Guillermo Del Toro's gift for cinematic allure, it shines just enough to be watchable.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|As always Michael does the standards which I really enjoy the best of todays artists.. Just wish he would do more..
B00932A4XE|4.0|I thought this actually really funny. I love that it even explored the heartbreak of a loss. Rented this movie thinking it'd be lame (but i was in the mood for lame) and embed up loving it. It's still not a blockbuster, thus the 4 stars, but good in my book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use very functional.. Just what I need to complete daily tasks; does all math operations without a hitch..
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The Good Wife is an interesting show which depicts the legal world through the eyes of a female attorney returning to work after a 15 year absence during which time she was raising her children. I particularly enjoy watching on the Amazon Instant video so I don't have to be bothered with commercials. I have thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 seasons.

1589269063|5.0|This audio book is literally #1 on my list for the best advice on how to love those in your life, especially your spouse  (#2 is &#34;Love and Respect&#34; written by  Dr. Emerson Eggerichs).  We tend to love others the way we want to receive love and unfortunately, that leaves them feeling unloved.  Once you realize that, and figure out &#34;what speaks love&#34; to them It's very simple and leads to the wonderful love-filled relationship everyone craves.  I give this book to EVERYONE for a wedding gift.
B00006IX0R|5.0|Love the Cranberries.  Bought this cd and constantly play it in my car.  Do have sirius but prefer my own music.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book blew my mind. I learned so much about North Korea; Barbara Demick's writing style is fabulous. My eyes are opened to a new facet of this world- definitely a fantastic read!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest director’s working in the movie industry. Django Unchained manages to tell a great story, have a big heart, show the absolute inhumanity and brutality of slavery in pre-civil war United States, be brutally violent, and hysterically funny all at the same time. The combination of all those elements while paying homage to spaghetti westerns and 70′s style film making with Tarantino’s uniquely modern flair is nothing short of amazing. Django Unchained is like the most spectacular house of cards you have ever seen, one slight miscalculation could topple the entire thing but instead it stands strong and is a must see for any movie lover.<br /><br />Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave in 1858 America. Early on in the film Django crosses paths with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Schultz is an out of practice dentist turned bounty hunter who originally recruits Django’s help for a single job. Schultz makes it clear he despises slavery and quickly forms a bond with Django. Schultz takes an interest in Django’s goal to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was cruelly separated from him. Django and Schultz spend a winter together hunting bounties and making a good deal of money. Django takes to the bounty hunting trade and gun slinging naturally. Schultz discovers that Broomhilda is being held at an infamously cruel plantation known as Candie-Land under the slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br /><br />Django Unchained is a fictional story but seems to take place in a very real world. The brutality and widespread of slavery in the early United States is crystal clear all throughout the movie. Every actor in the film does a flawless job of getting the audience up to speed with the general mentality and racial structures in the time period. The abundant racism and cruelty toward the slaves is, at times, almost difficult to watch but it is never overdone or unnecessary. A lot of prejudgements and accusationshave been thrown around because of the sensitive material and racist elements. This movie is in no way racist. It tells a story during one of America’s more shameful moments and does so without pulling its punches. The slavery and racist aspect of Django Unchained is also only one aspect of a phenomenal film. On top of the brutal realism and historical aspects is a story about a man willing to do anything for the love of his love. Intertwined to the great, though somewhat unconventional love story, is a fantastic story about two people who could not be anymore different finding common ground and forming a strong friendship. Dress all these elements up with some hilarious moments and amazing action sequences and Tarantino may have produced his best work yet, that’s really saying something.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays the titular hero in this Western-action-homage. Soft spoken and closed off for the majority of the movie Foxx plays Django from the inside out. Much of the characters understanding and development is told in his face, and especially his eyes. It is completely believable that Django lived a hard life and the audience never has reason to question the actors commitment to the role. There is never doubt that Django lived through his past traumas or that his blood wasn’t actually boiling during some very tense situations. Foxx is an actor who could have easily made a career out of soft roles and phoned in performances but he is constantly trying new things and succeeding immensely. Christoph Waltz first worked with Tarantino in 2009′s Inglorious Basterds. This was also his introduction to the majority of the Hollywood audience. Waltz absolutely stole the movie and outperformed all of his costars despite being virtually unknown to American audiences and playing the main antagonist. Waltz’s performance is equally impressive in Django, he is quick witted and very funny. Waltz as an actor has an air and charm about him that says he knows something thatthose around him don’t. He carries scenes effortlessly whether he is merely sitting at a table in dialogue or running a wild west type shoot-out. The dialogue he was given as the Dentist turned Bounty Hunter is perfect and Waltz sells the delivery of every single line, no matter how small it may seem. The only actor who may have out-done him ever so slightly is DiCaprio. DiCaprio has been one of the movie industry’s greatest actors since he was a kid. Constantly blowing away expectations and steering clear of being type cast of thrown into cash-grab quality projects it isn’t a surprise DiCaprio did well. What was surprising is that the actor took the role at all. The role was absolutely a good one but Calvin Candie is a straight up monster. DiCaprio has never played a character so repulsive and evil down to his core. Another complete shock in casting was Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen. Stephen is essentially Candie’s estate manager and top tier slave. The two banter as equals and Stephen seems to hold a power over Candie’s other slaves. Jackson who has proven in the past to be a solid actor lately has been a little lazy in many parts he has played. Choosing to simply play himself in a costume rather than really challenge himself. In Django, Jackson really pulled out all the stops along with the rest of the cast and did something no one has seen him do before.<br /><br />Django is shot so beautifully. In true Western fashion there are plenty of sprawling scenery shots and very nice establishing shots. The camera is never irritating and shots are set up so well that the audience can be totally immersed in the rest of the movie. The most amazing stylistic approach to how this was shot is that despite it being a top quality gorgeous movie it never loses its “Tarantino” flair. Fast zooms, interesting angles, and almost a 70s style feel are applied all throughout the movie in a perfect balance with new film trends and technologies. The soundtrack is equally good and equally as diverse. Music audience’s would expect in a mid 1800s set movie is mixed in with classic rock, easy listening and modern rap. Combining the elements with the flawless sets, props and wardrobes must have been a tough mixture to pull off and Tarantino does it expertly.<br />From sitdown-shutup.net<br /><br />Django Unchained is a movie with a little bit of everything. Quality cinematography, acting, directing and writing all come together to form a perfect historical action movie with a huge heart. This is certainly unlike anything Quentin Tarantino has ever done while still having all the familiarities Tarantino fans have grown to love. It is safe to say this is the director’s best work despite his very impressive resume. Hopefully Django is a sign of more great things to come not only from the director but also from the entire cast. More movies need to be as bold and more actors need to tackle roles they are not as used to being put in. The challenge clearly produces astounding results. It is no question why Django Unchained is a 2012 Best Picture nomination.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an excellent series that is well written. I hated to see it end. I'll be getting the next books in this series.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|From [...]<br /><br />A gripping, charming, hilarious, and moving movie about a couple troubled people making life work in their own way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are both at the absolute top of their game. Both actors deliver mesmerizing Oscar worthy performances and sell what was already a fantastically written script. In a smaller support role that turns out being a lot more important than at first glance, Robert De Niro brings one of the most moving performances in his recent career.<br /><br />When Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is released from a court ordered stay in a mental institution he moves back in with his parents. Pat’s goal is a new attitude, fitness, and to reconcile with ex-wife. His behavior is obsessive and he has no filter on what comes out of his mouth but it is clear Pat isn’t an overall bad guy. As pieces of his past are filled in, the depth of the character comes into focus. Pat Senior (Robert De Niro) at first comes off as a smaller role who throws out a couple snappy one liners but doesn’t amount to much. As the story continues and Pat Jr. and Sr. interact more it becomes very clear how Pat turned out the way he did. Pat Sr. isn’t a bad man or a bad father and mental illness can not be blamed on the individual but the personality traits carried through father and son are very well laid out and subtle. At a dinner with some old friend Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). The two seem to have no chemistry at all but end up bonding over their own social issues and medications they have been on. After a couple seeming random encounters the two form a unique and borderline hostile friendship. The friendship deepens and Pat agrees to help Tiffany with a dance competition she has been training for.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook was advertised primarily as a comedy, the movie is very funny. As funny as the movie is it is also very deep and moving when it needs to be. Director David O. Russell really strikes a perfect balance between the deep emotions and hysterics that are delivered perfectly by the amazing cast. Along the way as Pat and Tiffany grow closer Playbook could easily have derailed and became one of several typical romantic-comedies that get churned out every year. Bradley Cooper would have needed to flash a smile and Jennifer Lawrence bear her emotions after indulging in expensive ice cream and the movie could have been shipped, sold and forgotten about. Instead the audiences were served a spectacular story about family, friends, redemption, moving forward and all forms of love. The various levels of the movie don’t just make it interesting to experience but give a lot of re-watch value beyond the humor and amazing performances. The writing is so well done that everything can’t possibly be absorbed one time through but nothing is obtuse.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper has been acting for a while now and has moved steadily up into meatier roles. He has proven he can handle comedy in popular movies like Wedding Crashers (2005) and The Hangover (2009), he handled action in The A-Team, and has had more than his fair share of romantic comedies. While always delivering for the part he was given Silver Linings Playbook is the first time he got to fully stretch his legs and show off what he can do as an actor. In the best performance of his career so far (no doubt that there is more amazing performances to come from him) Cooper plays Pat perfectly. At times he is bouncing off the walls and at other times he is angry beyond comprehension but Cooper always brings these extremes up to the line but never crossing into doing too much. Jennifer Lawrence hasn’t been acting for quite as long but started her career fairly young and has had a variety of roles. Her first leading film role was in Winter’s Bone (2010) and she proved that she has what it takes to be a leading actress. As good as Lawrence did in Winter’s Bone and her other movies leading up to Silver Linings Playbook, Playbook was a whole new league to the caliber of acting Lawrence is capable of. Tiffany is a more damaged character than Pat in some way and Lawrence gives the audience no choice but to feel for her. Her performance is incredibly moving while she teeters on the brink of incredibly strong or cracked and fragile. Robert De Niro gives his strongest performance in years as well. De Niro plays a man his age, a husband and a father. There is none of the typical De Niro “cool” or toughness that seems to follow him to the majority of his roles. Taking that away he is left as a very real man. He wasn’t a perfect father or husband but a man who tried his best and he feels completely real. Pat Sr. has some obsessive compulsive tendencies, a gambling problem, and a horrible temper. A lot of these traits can be seen in both of his sons in the movie and the progression is subtle, but makes all the characters that much more complete. The supporting case is also impeccable. Chris Tucker makes his first appearance in 2005. He provides some great comedic relief and doesn’t overstay his welcome. It was nice seeing Tucker in a tame but still hilarious role since in the bast he mostly overacted and was always over the top. Jacki Weaver, Dash Mihok, John Ortiz, Shea Whigham, and Julia Styles round out the rest of the cast with smaller but very important parts.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook is absolutely one of the best movies of it’s year. Every element of the film clicks into place perfectly. There is something for every movie-goers taste and Cooper and Lawrence prove that they are a couple actresses that audiences will be seeing a lot more of in the future.

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|From my site [...]    Based on the 1987 TV show that launched Johnny Depp this self aware comedy was one of the freshest movies of 2012. Channing Tatum really showing off his comedic chops and Jonah Hill’s own brand of comedy worked so well together that 21 Jump Street was absolutely the funniest movie of 2012.    Despite a rocky personal history Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) bond in policy academy and become fast friends. After graduating from the academy, being sub-par cops land the two in a strange undercover program that puts cops into local high schools. Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) does a great job of setting up the concept of the movie while at the same time berating Schmidt, Jenko, the plot of the movie itself, and the overall lack of creativity in recent Hollywood projects. “We’re reviving a canceled undercover project from the ’80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they’ve run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle s*** from the past and hope that nobody will notice.” Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is the man in charge of running Jump Street. He was the first to admit he is the stereo-typical angry black man. Almost all of Dickson’s lines are shouted, but they are also all hysterical. Dickson puts Schmidt and Jenko on the case of finding a new synthetic drug called HFS (look the acronym up yourself) after a kid at the school dies from the drug, a fact no one at the school seems to care at all about. Schmidt and Jenko find the dealer in with ease but the supplier proves to be a much harder task. Eric Molson (Dave Franco) is the environmentalist popular guy at school and the popular click takes a liking to Schmidt immediately where Jenko gets stuck with the nerdy kids because their identities get switched. The role reversal was a brilliant comedic move and the bizarre situations are knowingly over-the-top but the comedy all ramps up and actually does contribute to the plot of the movie.    Channing Tatum didn’t start his film career with the best movies and only dabbled in comedies. 21 Jump Street shows that Tatum can handle more than strutting with his shirt off and second rate action movies. Only a few of Tatum’s gags are physical and his willingness to look stupid and put himself out there conflicts with his past film resume but sell the comedy on Jump Street so solidly. Jonah Hill comes from the complete opposite side of the industry than his co-star. Hill has been known for his comedies and most of them are quite funny. In 21 Jump Street Hill doesn’t get to stretch his acting as far as Tatum appeared to but he is still very funny and his on-screen personality gets to clash nicely with the action in the movie. The supporting cast is equally as funny as the lead actors despite their somewhat limited screen time. Dave Franco (yep, the brother of the amazing James Franco) plays the popular drug dealing Eric Molson. Franco has done some very funny material. Along with smaller roles in movies he also did a great series with his older brother for Funny or Die. After 21 Jump Street he should be getting some more substantial comedic roles. The absolutely adorable Brie Larson plays the closest thing to a love interest this movie gets. Schmidt falls for her the second he arrives back at school and she fell in line properly with the popular crowd. Larson is really the only character in the movie who got to show some range of emotion. She is funny with the rest of the cast the majority of the time but she also plays the heart-broken school girl very well. Ice Cube doesn’t really strain himself as an actor but the man is very funny and embraces his stereo-typical role well.    For a movie based off of an 80s TV show its safe to say expectations weren’t high. Screen Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Manic, Project X) took a silly idea and ran with it. Admitting that the movie was goofy and having the lead actors be justas goofy as the core concept let the audience sit back and really enjoy themselves. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller don’t have extensive amounts of directorial experience but they certainly did due diligence to a fantastic script.    If you haven’t give 21 Jump Street a change. It is funny from the opening shot to the end. The story is told along with the jokes, it doesn’t suffer from switching tracks because it can only handle one thing at a time. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a brilliant comedic team. 21 Jump Street is a mockery and pays homage to the serious show it was based on.

B004FP1WX0|4.0|Unfortunately I don't have a fully written review on my site ([...]) for this one yet.<br /><br />The movie was really interesting in today's world of online interactions and so much importance on digital communication. I am told large part of this are based on real life events of the main character / narrator (now doing the Catfish TV show). I imagine those parts that are real were reenacted for the movie and if that is the case all cast members did a great job selling their story.<br /><br />Ignore the advertising for this film, it is really intentionally misleading. Great movie, worth a watch. Especially if you have online only friends/relationships.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|From [...]<br /><br />The Wachowskis are at the top of their game with Cloud Atlas. A sibling duo of film creators the two always swing for the fences with their films and with Cloud Atlas they hit it out of the park. This movie is story telling and film making firing on all cylinders and never misses a beat.<br /><br />An epic tale of fate, love, friendship, humanity, greed, envy, and the human spirit is told through several time lines in several settings. The all star cast takes on up to six roles each of varying forms, changing not only their basic attributes to fit the time period but even full on racial and gender changes.The transformations of the characters appearance is literally just the surface of the changes the actors take on. Accents, voices, and mannerisms disappear and new ones are created with absolute perfection.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding in all the roles they take on. Tom Hanks, Halle berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae (in her first English speaking roles), Ben Whishaw, Keith David, James D’Arcy, Hugh Grant, and more all take on at least three roles and up to seven. The three directors it took to capture a story many criticized as being “un-filmable” also adapted the David Mitchell novel for the screen. Lana and Andy Wachowski along with Tom Tykwer.<br /><br />There is no absolute direct thread or linear path that the characters undergo that can be traced in black and white. Rather the decisions a soul makes in life cause a ripple effect that don’t only change an individuals karmic destiny but ripple throughout time. A lost love in one life can be realized in another, past crimes against your fellow man may require redemption paid out through decades. Every character has their own journey within their life times and every character’s soul has a journey through time. The advertising and many plot synopsis make the movie sound unruly and confusing. In reality this sprawling epic tale is massive but the Wachowski’s and Tom Tykwer never lose control of this massive undertaking. The story is large and spans time but it is not confusing. The actors get to talk on so many different roles of varying importance so that no one actor gets played out or causes the audience fatigue.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is multiple stories in one, many different themes and genres are explored and all of them are explored properly. Any one of these individual stories could be a movie entirely by itself and it would be incredible to watch. While the smaller stories within Cloud Atlas take on different genres they also take on different tones. One of the threads is a very witty and fun comedy and a separate story line has some epic sci-fi action scenes. The fact that these elements don’t leak out of their main story lines doesn’t hurt the integrity of the movie but still gives the audience the emotional jolts as they need them.<br /><br />The make up is an achievement in itself. It is never over done or shocking to see. It all fits so naturally even knowing what the actors under the prosthetic look like. The make up is trans-formative and subtle at the same time. The audience is never taken out of the movie by an unconvincing look or cheesy prosthetic. The score for the movie is yet another element the Wachowski’s nailed along with Tykwer. Tykwer even worked on the original music for the film along with the other composers. The score for the film rises and falls with the audience’s emotions. As a film-goer you would be hard pressed to see this modern epic along with the immersive score without being totally engrossed in the spectacle before you.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is everything the movie industry needs right now. This movie speaks for itself and is incredibly entertaining while being an absolute masterpiece. This is something that as an audience member you don’t just see, you experience.

B007REV4YI|5.0|From [...]<br /><br />Daniel Craig is finally back in the expensive suits for his third run as the iconic James Bond. The stakes are high and the super spy’s very existence is examined in this worthy entry to the franchise on its 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Director Sam Mendes wastes no time jumping straight into the action as Bond and Eve (Naomie Harris), another field agent, are tracking down a missing hard drive. M (Judi Dench) is forced to make one of the toughest calls of her career leaving Bond incapacitated. The script drops the ball on Bonds return to the world of the living and the details are merely glossed over, but non-existent. When MI6 is directly threatened through terrorist acts, Bond brings himself back to active duty. In trying to discover who is committing the terrorist acts against his agency Bond has the pleasure of running into Severine (Berenice Marlohe). Severine is Bond’s link to Silva but the character doesn’t have much purpose beyond being a bridge and is incredibly underdeveloped. Silva (Javier Bardem) is the greatest Bond villain in recent memory. He is smart, powerful, and funny while simultaneously being creepy, threatening and emotionally disturbed. Silva has a personal grudge against MI6 and using his vast well of internal knowledge tests Bond’s dedication to M.<br /><br />A big part of Skyfall is the question of someone like James Bond still being relevant in a digital world. This is an especially interesting question to ask on Bond’s 50th anniversary as well as Daniel Craig’s return to the character after a lackluster second film and an extended break due to MGM’s financial woes. Q (Ben Whishaw) summarizes these exact thoughts to Bond in a very well written scene that speaks directly to the audience without being blatant exposition. Unfortunately the question of Bond’s irrelevance and his triumph in proving otherwise isn’t fully explored and the notion is essentially ignored by everyone involved except newcomer Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Mallory is the British Government’s answer to M after the aging director failed in recovering the crucial hard drive Bond was hunting when he was injured.<br /><br />The script for Skyfall pursues many interesting angles for an action franchise. Unfortunately Mendes leaves a lot of threads hanging on some of these subplots. Skyfall does something that the Bond series has needed for a while, it begins to explore who James Bond actually is as a man. Since he is not someone whose origin story needs to be shrouded it is surprising that this character could have such an impact on pop culture without his past being well known cannon. Exploring Bond as a man is great for breathing new life into the franchise and would have been absolutely perfect in 2006′s Casino Royale. The concepts are not wasted on Skyfall but the subplot is not fleshed out fully. The question of old fashioned ways in comparison to the amazing technology that world governments now posses is another brilliant concept in the script. However when it comes down to the finished film Mendes again fails to fully deliver to the audience. There is never a moment of doubt in Bond’s capabilities or a major triumph moment for the character where technology is proven to not be able to do everything a thinking man in the field can do. The subplot merely tells the audience that times have changed in the 50 years since Bond began entertaining us and that goes without say.<br /><br />Craig embodies the character he re-created in Casino Royale and this version of Bond lands somewhere between his Royale and Solace roles. In Royale Bond was as charming as he could ever be and the most physically impressive Bond ever. Solace was a much darker story where Bond was only motivated by hatred and revenge. Skyfall strikes a nice balance where the spy can turn on his charm when needed, even directing it towards a man at one point, and despite some bodily harm is still fit and up to the physicaltasks that Silva throws at him. M plays the same role she has with little variation. Dench is not a physically dominating woman but when she is playing M it is clear that she is a character you don’t want to cross. Mallory and Eve are both newcomers to the Daniel Craig Bond franchise but both characters are played so magnificently its a shame they couldn’t get more screen time. Mallory seems almost villainous since he is introduced as damage control to a botched operation but he is likable and a man just doing his job in the most sensible and real way possible. He proves his worth in a few pivotal moments and definitely wins over the audience with ease. More of Eve and Bond working in the field would have been nice to see. The script doesn’t short the audience on the interactions between the two characters but they play off each other so smoothly that an entire movie could be built around their working relationship. The true stand out performance of the Bond film is in the villain. Villains are often allowed to be larger than life while the heroes have to remain relate-able to the audience and Silva is no exception. A strange look to a strange man Silva seems very happy and confident in his work. At the flip of a switch he can change the mood of the entire scene and really make the audience feel for him. A sympathetic villain that can remain terrifying is not an easy feat but Bardem nails it.<br /><br />Despite some minor pacing issues and a couple sub-plots that needed a bit of grooming Skyfall is a great action movie with a lot to offer fans of James Bond and action movies alike. To answer the main questioned poised by the movie, Skyfall tells us that James Bond is up to the challenge and here to stay.

B009RI4FRU|2.0|From my site, [...]<br /><br />The audiences’ enjoyment of Moonrise Kingdom really depends on their like for Wes Anderson movies. If only one thing can be said about Wes Anderson it’s that he definitely has his own style. Anderson movies are usually slower paced in oddly detailed environments with intelligent dialogue and a sense of comedy that is exceptionally dry. Moonrise Kingdom is no exception to these conventions, however it falls short because all of the oddities don’t amount to anything of particular interest this time.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom is a love story between children. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a Khaki Scout who leaves the organization to run away with a local girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward). When his escape is discovered by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) an investigation is started involving the rest of the scouts and the Captain of the local police, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are the Bishops, Suzy’s parents. The two are very confrontational and constantly get in the way of the search for the run away kids. There is never a sense of danger for the movie, that’s not what Moonrise Kingdom is about. It is a quirky love story set in a real enough era but with a surreal twist.<br /><br />The movie never ramps up enough that the audience is on the edge of their seat about anything. There is no question about the progression of the movie or the end results. Even when new elements are introduced to the audience it is clear where things are going to end up.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom boasts a very solid cast but no breakout performances. Gilman and Hayward are solid child actors but the deadpan delivery that comes with Anderson movies may be the cause for that. Bill Murray is a staple in Anderson movies and usually provides a good amount of the offbeat humor. In Kingdom he is more a placeholder than anything. Frances McDormand has never been a great actress, she got lucky with Fargo and that is the sole reason shecontinues to receive acting work. Edward Norton was probably the funniest performance of the movie. Norton is usually an edgy and very serious actor but in Kingdom he plays the complete opposite.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie lacked substance so there isn’t much more to say. It’s one of Anderson’s weaker movies. In a year filled with amazing performances, break out stars, and truly original movies it is a complete mystery how Moonrise Kingdom got nominated for an Academy Award at all.

B00BB22GQM|5.0|I first randomly stumbled upon this band years ago when they first released their self titled album.  I was at Wal Mart and saw the album on sale and I thought the name of the band was interesting.  I impulsively bought it.  I had no clue who they were.  I assumed based on their name they would be some new gothic rock band or something.  Then I played the CD and I was blown away!  It was an instant indie classic.  Fast forward a few years when they released their second album \\"Contra\\".  They were now very popular and the album even reached number one in the US.  That album is also a classic with many great songs.  I personally had a few songs on the album I would skip over, but that doesn't mean other people didn't like those songs.  So years pass and finally I found out Vampire Weekend was releasing another album after long 3 years.  I heard the first two singles and was so glad to hear their unique sound again and couldn't wait for the album.  It lived up to the hype and much more!  I personally think this might be their best album yet.  But that's just my opinion!  Here's a track by track breakdown.<br /><br />1.  Obvious Bicycle:  Another reviewer said this song didn't engage them and gave the song a 5/10.  We all have opinions.  But that was the stupidest opinion ever.  They thought this song wasn't as good because it wasn't as upbeat as other VW songs.  I personally think this is one of the best songs the band has ever made and it is not one bit boring.  It is very peaceful and catchy.  There are many layered vocals and different sounds in the song that are so infectious to the ears.  Give it a listen and see what I mean.  Great album opener.<br />2.  Unbelievers:  This song has a slight \\"Beatles\\" vibe to it and it works so well.  Such a fun song with catchy vocals.  There are also parts of the song that remind me of \\"Arcade Fire\\" a bit, but still keeps to the Vampire Weekend sound.  Not amazing, but still a great killer song!<br />3.  Step:  This song.  One of the most relaxing songs from the band.  Ezra hits this note during the chorus when he sings \\"bones\\", and it is just perfect.  The song has the classical vibe that was heard in songs like \\"M79\\" and \\"Walcott\\".  I have had the part \\"Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl\\" stuck in my head for a while now.  Theres just something amazing about this song.  Great song to listen to while touring a big city.  I feel like going to D.C and touring the museums while listening to this song.  Sure the lyrics have nothing to do with it, but the feel of the song is just so peaceful and cinematic!<br />4.  Diane Young:  At first I thought this song was annoying.  The constant weird \\"Babys\\" chanted throughout the song.  I didn't like it at first listen.  But I first didn't listen to it with good speakers so I didn't really hear all the perfect layers of the song.  Then I started to love and love the song more with each listen.  It's a classic!  The song has this weird yet awesome vocal effect.  The lyrics even have a deep meaning(Diane Young = Dying young).  I think it is their best lead single so far!  I can see this song featured in awesome movie scenes and commercials for some reason.  Listen to this song with good earphones or a nice car sound system to experience it the best!  You will find yourself singing the 'baby baby babys' in your head.  I can see people singing it in the shower too haha.  The song will blow you away even more  in the last 20 seconds.<br />5.  Don't Lie:  Nice song to calm down with after hearing \\"Diane Young\\".  Again the chorus is so infectious.  There is something highly anthemic about this song from the vocals all the way down to the marching band-like drums.<br />6.  Hannah Hunt:  The song slowly builds up with calm vocals during the verses.  You really need a good pair of earphones to appreciate this song to its full extent.  The song tells a story.  The pianos tease you in this song making you want more!  This is a very beautiful song!  Toward the end of the song there is a slight upbeat repeat of the chorus before it ends peacefully and perfectly!<br />7.  Everlasting Arms:  The bass of this song reminds me of \\"The Police\\" slightly!  But the rest of the song is pure Vampire Weekend!  The chorus is so so so so so perfect.  It's just another classic catchy amazing song.  This band can do no wrong!  I don't know what else to say about it.  It's awesome!  It could be released as a single!  One of my personal favorites!<br />8.  Finger Back:  This sounds more like it would fit into the bands first album.  One of the more upbeat songs.  Very uplifting.  The fast vocals might give you a hype feeling.  Halfway through the song the bridge kicks in calmly before the catchy quickly delivered vocals jump back in.  Very fun song!<br />9.  Worship You:  I thought the last song had quick vocals.  The vocals in the verses of this song are twice as fast!  The chorus soars.  The drums also have this marching band feel to them!  The vocals during the verses remind me of the vocals in System of a Downs song \\"Violent Pornography\\".  No I'm not comparing the bands, they sound nothing alike and aren't even of the same genre, but the scatting vocals are similar in those songs.  Beautiful song either way especially toward the end of it!<br />10.  Ya Hey:  My favorite song from the band so far.  I read that the song is about god(ya hey = Yahweh) and it is just beautiful!  I cannot get the chorus out of my head.  I will just say how perfect and original this song sounds.  Perfect vocals.  Perfect instrumentals.  Everything compliments each other so perfectly.  There is even this weird yet infectious sound during the chorus that works so well.  If you haven't heard the song yet then you will see what I'm talking about.  The song combines the wacky element of the band with the beautiful elements of the band.  The longest song on the album is the best song in my opinion!  Amazing and gorgeous!<br />11.  Hudson:  A new sound for the band.  The song sounds inspired by some of the darker \\"Depeche Mode\\" songs, but only slightly.  It still has that Vampire Weekend spice to it though.  There is something epic and apocalyptic about the way it sounds.  Yet it is also beautiful and tragic as well.  The song also has a 'vampire' feeling to it fitting to the bands name!  Not an easy listen, but still a good listen!  I could write a whole essay about what this song feels like, but I'll stop here.  It's just another good song!<br />12.  Young Lion:  Ending the album on a peaceful note with this short yet awesome song.  The vocals are so beautiful.  I could fall asleep to this song, and I mean that in the best way.  The song leaves me wanting more and more!<br /><br />So I loved the album.  I think it is personally their best album yet.  Maybe it's just because the album is brand new and I'm still on a high from it, but I'm sure this album will have great replay value for almost anyone who loves good music.  I forgot to mention that each song on the album also has this city life feel to it.  Great album to listen to in any city setting.  You can still enjoy it in the country, but I feel this album is meant best for the city experience!  Some reviewers are complaining that this album is less appealing because it has less to no guitars.  Who said Vampire Weekend needed guitars?  Vampire Weekend stated in a recent review how their three albums all have a different sound, which is true.  This saves them from being typecast to one particular sound.  They can keep exploring new sounds.  So just don't compare it to their first two albums.  This album is great in its own way!  Definitely a strong contender for 'Album of the Year'.  This is one of the best modern bands working today.  They make good, beautiful, and clever music.  This album is a MUST listen for anyone that wants something new and awesome to listen to.  Make sure to listen to each song at least twice before forming an opinion.  Thisalbum is a classic. It is a grower.  I can tell I will continue to discover new things about each song through repeated listens.  Great album to listen to during the summer as well.  Now excuse me while I click replay again!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My 2 year old loves this game. It has great graphics and fun music. She already knows her letters so this is great practice!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Very well told story, but violence is too much, too graphic. Story unfolds with intrigue and great depth of characters.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I am surprised that Cruise would agree to making this picture. Poor acting and predictable. Very leery of future rentals featuring Cruise and a cast of unknowns!
B009NY43NY|1.0|SPOILERS INCLUDED<br />Charlaine Harris was not the best of the Urban Fantasy writers out there. But the most enjoyable of the Sookie Stackhouse books had an exciting, witty love of life, that was shown best in scenes between Eric Northman and Sookie. For 12 books Sookie's and Eric\\"s romance has been central to her stories. In the last book Harris undoes the spell she cast and leaves her readers in the dirt.<br /><br />Saying that she knew, almost from the beginning who Sookie would end up with, Harris forgot to tell us, and sprang Sam on us, in this book, like a rabbit from a hat, with no story arc at all. Sookie who was growing into a wiser and more confident woman in a multi-being world has ended where she began; working in the same bar living in the same house with the same OLD friends, but none of her new ones. No one to rock the sleepy town boat or to make her feel more alive. Sookie is in the same role she started out in, except now she breaks her own rules and not only sleeps with her boss/partner, but does it outside of a relationship. Something she always refused to do before.<br /><br />It looks like the only magic here is where the eleven middle books have disappeared  to, because if you read the first book and then this one, you'd believe there was no story in between.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I cannot enlarge the font just enlarge the page. It would be nice to enlarge font size with wrap-around. All it does is add pages.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|There are plenty of reviews with details, so I don't want to repeat the same thing again. Overall, this is a very good book to understand the art of negotiating an agreement, where you work things out from a persuasive position, rather than being a bully. Well written and worth the time you would invest in reading it.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|LOOOOOOVED this book. For anyone intersted in the books about the German Occupation, its a must read. Charming is the only work I can use to describe the story and characters. It was just so cute.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|The book is very much to-the-point and concise. It includes excellent tips on presentation. You may not make it to TED, but you can apply these techniques to improve your presentations at work.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Quick somewhat challenging workout. Serves it's purpose to get you in shape quickly. I combine with running for a more rounded workout.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Works great, as expected from any Intel CPU. No issues with performance, over-clocking or operating temperature. Very satisfied with the purchase.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Good thriller, better than I expected. Wasn't too happy about the ending and nice special effects that gives chills, I would recommend it to horror fans.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|The special effects are just fabulous, specially in Dubai. Tom Cruise never fails to deliver, and the rest of the cast is great too. The movie is thrilling and funny.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|\\"A\\" is the perfect fusion of melodic elegance, pop joy, and melancholy, along with \\"current\\" production and arrangement elements.  \\"A\\" is further a perfectly elevated fusion of Agnetha's ageless vocals evoking more than ever and better than anyone love, nostalgia and melancholy accompanied by melodies that match the yearning and expressiveness of her voice.  The album is instantly catchy without being common, showcasing the Swede's (Elofsson and Nordahl in this case) mastery of melody ---melodies so good no doubt they could be labeled or confused for \\"formulaic\\".<br /><br />Two songs are stand-outs as well as instant classics for me, and among the 10 most beautiful solo songs Agnetha has ever recorded, The One Who Loves You Now, & I Was A Flower:<br /><br />The One Who Loves You Know --- I hear hints of The Carpenters in the melody, but it could have been written by Andersson and Ulvaeus during the 1976 - 1980 period.  That says it all.  It has one of those melodies full of melancholy, overwhelming sweetness, and love.  I ADORE this song.  Further, I cannot get over the vocal fragility, lightness and perfection with which Agnetha delivers.  A brilliant joy of a song!  A++<br /><br />I Was A Flower --- Listening to \\"I Was A Flower\\" for the first time brought tears to my eyes.  Listening to such an amazing voice again --- a voice in beautifully perfect shape and form, and being blown away by the grand melody and dramatic lyrics of the song.  This song could have easily been on The Visitors.  It is that dark, sad, melancholic, dramatic, intense, and perfect.  It has a bitterness that one can almost taste.  If you listen carefully and know Agnetha's voice well, you will notice that there are parts where Agnetha uses her voice like she has never done.  I find her voice in this song impeccable: more mature, more bitter, more fragile, and more expressive than even in The Winner Takes It All and The Day Before You Came.  I was a Flower is simply one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  A++<br /><br />The rest of the songs minus two:<br /><br />Perfume in the Breeze --- This song could have been written for Madonna's Ray Of Light by William Orbit, but it comes in a lighter and less sophisticated production.  Despite Ray of Light being among my all-time-favorite albums, I actually like the fact that Perfume in the Breeze is so light and unpretentious.  The first time I heard it I suspected it would be one of my least favorite songs in \\"A\\", but by the second play I was sold.  It has a sad lyric with a bright and uplifting melody \\"a la ABBA's S.O.S\\".  I love the carefree joy that the melody evokes.  I love, love, love listening to it.  A+<br /><br />I Should Have Followed You Home (with Gary Barlow) --- A grand and gorgeous song full of tenderness, displaying the most \\"current\\" sound and production on the album.  The melody is pure pop with very slight hints of Coldplay and Tiesto, if you can imagine that mix, but it works!  Vocally and melodically it works as well, and it is definitely another winner.  A+<br /><br />Bubble --- Accurately described by Agnetha, and her favorite song on \\"A\\", Bubble is no doubt reminiscent of Sade, especially of songs on Lovers Rock.  If you listen carefully, you will realize that the melody is also reminiscent of Duran Duran.  Simon Le Bon could have easily sang this song, well suited for his range and style.  Elofsson and Nordahl (the producers of \\"A\\") do a great job with the production and arrangement that make Bubble feel very Agnetha despite my comparisons.  It is a \\"wow\\" song displaying gorgeous vocals, dreamy/ambient-trance/atmospheric-like production, and nostalgic undertones.  A+<br /><br />I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed --- This song just goes to prove once again that Agnetha can truly write beautiful songs. Very Beatles-eque/E.L.O-ish, the melody is loving, sweet, soft, and nostalgic, with hints of resignation and peace.  It is obvious that Agnetha wrote the melody originally thinking the song would end-up being a children's lullaby (as she mentioned on a recent interview), but the lyrics work well non-the-less.  I can completely hear her craftsmanship and writing style, so much so that if in Swedish, I feel this song could have been on Elva Kvinnor I Ett Hus.  It is unfortunate that she did not write more songs for this album.  Beautiful!  A+<br /><br />Dance Your Pain Away --- Already having read many comparisons out there to Voulez Vous, As Good As New, Summer Night City, and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight), all I have to say is that despite Elofsson being a great songwriter he does not match (or intend to match) Andersson and Ulvaeus' perfect blend & balance of sexual tension, yearning, melancholy and fun on the aforementioned ABBA songs.  On the other hand, I cannot deny that Dance Your Pain Away is an extremely fun and irresistibly catchy & camp \\"disco\\" tune, perfectly produced.  I am glad Agnetha recorded this & really hope that it is a hit.  It would make me happy to see it on the charts.  I have no doubt it will be a huge club hit!  B+<br /><br />When You Really Loved Someone --- It was surreal hearing Agnetha's voice in such great shape after 9 years of silence, so this song will always hold a special place in my heart.  Critically, I find it a bit over-produced although elegant, classy, and at the same time \\"current\\".  It has a great soaring chorus and nice verses and bridge, but something is missing which I can't pinpoint.  Lyrically it is also a bit awkward. Having said that, I am surprised it was not more of a hit.  I think that if more of the \\"new ABBA fans\\" out there had known who she was, it would have been bigger.  Youtube's video of the song is already past 1.1 million views......  B+<br /><br />The two songs I left for last:<br /><br />Past Forever --- No doubt a very beautiful song delivered pristinely by Agnetha.  Personally, I am surprised how \\"country\\" the melody sounds, and am having a hard time getting past that.  Agnetha's emotional vocals make me want to listen to it, but the melody is so far away from what I like that I skip it for now.  I have the feeling it will grow on me.  C+<br /><br />Back On Your Radio --- I am glad so many people out there like this song.  I can understand why.  Unfortunately, it is my least favorite on the album.  I do not enjoy the \\"girlie/cute-sie/teeny/American Idol-esque\\" production.  It just sounds weak to me.  The melody is good, but in my opinion it needed a lot of embellishment to make it believable.  Not that the lyrics are serious, but I feel like the song should have been produced more intensely --- perhaps more electronically and modern.  I would go even as far as saying it should have been produced like Lady Gaga's chorus on Bad Romance!  It needs more layering of the vocals perhaps.  That may have saved the song for me.  As is, Back On Your Radio is a \\"skip\\" among mostly great songs.  The only thing that saves it a bit are Agnetha's ageless vocals.  C-<br /><br />Mr. Samuel Memour, who I don't know but reviewed \\"A\\" in Amazon UK said what I also personally feel about this album, \\"Agnetha's new album is just like meeting a dear old friend again after a long time. Like an old friend who isn't young, trendy or trying to change the world, but just such a joy to meet again, this album brings back so many memories with new stories to tell.\\"<br /><br />To those who may not understand the overall beauty of this album, I leave them with Agnetha's last words on this album, \\"Why is love so hard to understand?\\"inking the song would end-up being a children's lullaby (as she mentioned on a recent interview), but the lyrics work well non-the-less.

B00BS3EMNY|4.0|This is a perfectly decent follow-up album from Caro Emerald. She is a very good singer, that enjoyable fusion of swing and modern sounds is still there and some of the material here is good. People like me who found Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor such an original and joyous treat will certainly like it, but for me the terrific musical zing and zest which I loved in Deleted Scenes isn't quite there on this album.<br /><br />Part of this is that Miss Emerald isn't really at all shocking here, but plays it pretty safe. The old sense of a bunch of really good musicians having a great time has been overlaid and dimmed by a much more expensive, corporate gloss. Sweeping strings and slicker, more impersonal production have largely driven out the immediacy of the terrific, gutsy brass section, for example, so the humorous twinkle of Dr Wannado, the irresistible swing of That Man and the infectious beat of Back It Up are harder to find here. Some of it is great, and there's a lovely light feel to songs like Completely, Pack Up The Louie and Liquid Lunch, but this is an album which seems to take itself far more seriously than Deleted Scenes, and for me it loses something as a result.<br /><br />I don't want to carp; plenty of people will love this, and fair enough. I do like it - it's just that for me it lacks the real sparkle which made Deleted Scenes such a treat.
B000JMKRKC|1.0|It's rare that I don't finish a book, but this one just doesn't launch.  I gave up after 45 pages ... and a good book will grab the reader in less than 5.  There's a reason this book was severely discounted.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I don't understand the negative reviews.  Sam has been waiting in the wings forever and I felt that was who Sookie would end up with in the end.  Eric is too selfish and Bill betrayed her in the books.  I felt like Harris wrapped up the series nicely, brought back characters from other books, and left everyone in a good place (except Arlene!)<br /><br />Maybe she can do some witch books set in New Orleans now........
B006M4F67A|5.0|FUN GAME TO PLAY SPENT FAR TOO MANY HOURS PLAYING and not doing my work.  Really was a good thing in my case. I spend to many hours tense and this relaxed me!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I get so tired of so many shows that are gritty, dark, gross. This show is so not gritty, dark, or gross - it's bright, engaging, and fun.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|I followed Caitlin Moran's columns in The Times for years. Not every week, I confess. I loved them. The humour, the irreverence, the freshness; and the mastery of the language, the easy flow of the stories, the richness of the anecdotes.  So I rushed to buy How to be a Woman. And, well, it was not that funny.  I don't know, maybe some things are best tasted in small doses, every now and then. Suddenly, the freshness and the liveliness were gone. It was still funny and mildly enjoyable -but not that much. The stories did not seem so effortless. The humour seemed a bit laborious. The whole  thing was a bit cloying. Yup, cloying. And the arguments were unconvincing: particularly, when tackling some serious topics the whole thing sounded rather immature and sophomoric. Perhaps Caitlin should not venture into serious topics. Perhaps we should keep reading her columns and not her books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is a great easy game for almost all ages that never gets old.I love the different theme updates every month! I love this game!  P.s.I think it's better than temple run...

B001CB4SRW|5.0|I purchased this sheath for a Leatherman Wave that I purchased elsewhere. With the sheath, I also bought a couple of other accessories. I've seen a couple of reviews that are having a hard time with the side \\"pouches\\" or elastic \\"tubes\\". Some have said they use it for a mini flashlight. Well I purchased the bit extender and it fits PERFECTLY into those side pouches. There are two \\"pouches\\" so no matter if you're left handed or right handed you'll have easy access to it. Some have also said that the tool kind of moves around in the sheath. Well I purchased the \\"40-Bit Assortment for Leatherman Bit Drivers\\" and when they are placed into the sheath the tool fits snugly into it. I love how they designed the extra bits to fir into a elastic pouch inside the sheath, nice. I noticed that Leatherman sells another sheath but is a little cheaper. If you're looking for a sheath that has the extra storage options buy this one. Engineering perfection.
B008645YH6|1.0|I had to return this cd just for the reason that I did not have  &#34;How to be a Heart Breaker&#34; and the 2 additional songs &#34;Teen Idle&#34; & &#34;Sex Yeah&#34;
0765348276|4.0|This was a nice gripping story, that had enough &#34;hard&#34; sci-fi to keep me happy, with enough of the sappy emotional stuff to definitely satisfy other readers. The writing style was sharp enough to make me interested in the sequel (look them up on Amazon), and it didn't drag on too long either. I really could have used more action and hard detailed science (I'm a big fan of the Isaac Asimov books), but this was fine too.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|SyFY Channel played half of the season and then unexpectedly just dropped it for several months.  Because of the order from you I now have all of the Fifth Season of the best show on t.v.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I fist watched this about two years ago, I have since started buying local and have cut out all fast foods. I have dropped 40lbs and will be running my first marathon in a few weeks.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story was well written and the plot has many unexpected twists and turns. It was a refreshing change in the mysteries I have been reading. It was worth it.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|That was my first thought after viewing this film. A large part of 'Hitchcock's' troubles lie in the fact that the team behind it could not find a singular voice. Is this a docu-drama on the making of Psycho? A commentary on Hitchcock's strange mental state? A torrid romance picture about he and his wife, Alma, and their marriage difficulties? Or was it just another episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents? No, 'Hitchcock' decided it wanted to be all of these things.The trouble with this lack of focus is the movie couldn't go very deep in any regard. I gleamed little detail from the production around Psycho or even about Hitchcock himself. The script was soft from beginning to end, and albeit easily watchable, my final take was of disappointment. The acting is fine, however. Helen Mirren could be called the British Meryl Streep because she is absolutely thrilling in any project she partakes in. Jessica Biel was particularly interesting to watch as Vera Miles; I would almost be willing to tag her as the scene-stealer in 'Hitchcock.' Scarlett Johansson was bland and forgettable and Anthony Hopkins take on the formidable Hitchcock was overbearing at times, playing to almost comedic effect, which certainly did not help the loose focus of the movie. After the smoke clears and the dust is settled, 'Hitchcock' proves to be just another cinema dud. Thumbs down!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|It is an &#34;old world&#34; kind of book.  It is a good read to curl up with on a cold rainy day.  I liked the main characters and could sympathize with their heartbreaks.  The &#34;tale&#34; twisted again and again.  Altho the misery of their youth was an atrocity, I still liked the book.  It was so worth my time.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Yikes. Irish orphans and orphanages. This compelling story is set in Ireland after the evil sisters have closed their orphanage. It is creepy, thinking of these brides of Christ abusing children. But that is not the story. We are treated to a story set in Ireland and the loneliness of being alone. There may be a bit too much of the drink in the novel, but it dovetails nicely with the subject matter. You will cheer the hero as he plods through his life. It's not all about getting married. Moving and uplifting but with a serious bent.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I have enjoyed the visual effects of Thor's homeworld Asgard which were impressively progressive.  The cast seem to fit and  complemented each other in respects to each realm.  However, the storyline required more work in regard to gelling all the parts together.  Most of the history was left to the audience to fill in with sensible & practical conclusions.  Overall, it was still entertaining.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I really enjoy sci-fi movies that is not completed out of the scope of reality, yes, I think humans have the ability to do much more than we are currently accustomed to seeing. I would rate it 3 1/2 stars, but closer to 4, but not 4.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved this story for the complexity, reality, and tenderness it portrayed regarding relationships.  It will capture you from the very first sentence to the last.  Enjoy!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I definitely didn't expect a 4 star, but i really enhoyed it.  Great cast and twist that wasn't expected.  Two thumbs up!
B00B9JDBSO|2.0|I love the Knife and Karin's other project Fever Ray. Shaking The Habitual is just irritating noise to me. As others have mentioned the stand out tracks are A Tooth For An Eye and Full of Fire. Sometimes artist get too experimental. And this album is simply that. When you stop making music and make noise that sounds cool too you....don't be shocked when people stop listening.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|Tarantino has definitely run out of steam. But then again, I always question if he ever had steam. Though this movie is visually stunning, the storyline is so-so and uninspired, the use of the \\"N\\" word every five seconds is only done for shock value. The music is taken from classic movies that everyone should be watching instead of this. The use of Jim Croce's \\"I've Got A Name\\" is hilariously and unintentionally comical and reminiscent of a road/buddy movie. The lynch mob \\"bag\\" scene where they portray them as bumbling buffoons, while deserved, is at best, hokey and eye-roll inducing. In other words, this movie doesn't have an original idea and is totally predictable. But that's not too surprising coming from a director who's movie structure is to take every cliché from B-movie classics and passing it as his own to movie-goers who's knowledge goes no further than Top Ten movies. TC
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was a great story of survival. I was worried I cry through the whole thing, but I didn't, it was a perfect mix of tragedy and triumph! Must see for the whole family!
0142420891|5.0|Wow... that was intense. Several people told me before I started this book that they liked it even more than If I Stay. That's something that you won't even begin to understand until you pick this book up and read it. I started reading this book after dinner and couldn't go to bed until I was finished. I can't remember the last time I did that. I also can't remember the last time a book pulled me in, wouldn't let go and made me feel as much as this one did.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I expected when I started reading Where She Went. I knew that it would be an emotional read, but I didn't expect it to be as intense as it was. I knew from the synopsis that Adam and Mia had gone their separate ways. Reading what Adam went through, the experiences that he had and the way he handled it all was almost more heart breaking than the emotions that were evoked in If I Stay.<br /><br />Needless to say there were tears. The entire book was from Adam's perspective which worked so well. His grief was tangible and pretty much defined who he was. I spent most of the book wanting to hug him and let him know he wasn't as alone as he thought he was. Watching his transformation by the end of the book was amazing.<br /><br />Gayle Forman did an amazing job of bringing the pain of both characters to the surface and making you feel the devastation that grief can cause. It wasn't always easy to read, but it was real and powerful and giving readers the glimpse into the aftermath of the tragedy the characters experienced in If I Stay was just as important as the initial story. I have to say that even though I loved the first book, I now have to agree that this one is even more powerful and amazing than I expected. It's definitely a series that I not only recommend, but will be one that I re-read more than once.

B009FBX5M0|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater and enjoyed the big screen action.  Now I can enjoy the sound tracks as I go through my day.
B001BODXVW|4.0|Scars on Broadway is one of those bands to me that is fun to listen to because it is so absurd. With the members coming from System of a Down, they have a sound very similar to that. Their lyrics are heavily drug and social movement related. It is worth the price just to have a fun records to listen to.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|This product is awesome and works seamlessly with the western digital cloud drive. It is easy to setup and very user friendly. Quick and convenient when on the go.
B004KRQFI0|2.0|Skrillex should not be called a dubstep artist. He should have his own genre or something. It is not for me, I prefer the true dubstep music that is more than constant drops and machine cranks the whole time.
B0002KRTUW|1.0|This dvd must have been copied off something because it will not play on any of my dvd players. They all say it does not recognize it.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|This is a super album. It came with Hot pink discs in this double LP. It also includes the digital download, you also get this with amazon auto rip feature so you will have 2 copies of the digital album if you buy it new from amazon.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Not only does this read like &#34;butter&#34; but it is also an accurate account of both the events that led up to as well as the period during  WW2.  Really a superb book.
B001EPIIMC|5.0|This is a legendary album by Zeppelin. With hits like Black Dog, Stairway to Haven, and When the Levee Breaks. It was just as described when it arrived in great condition and fast shipping time. I would use this seller again.
B009XWD02G|1.0|How is it that dumb apps like this are even an option on here! Do not download!!! It just makes sounds when you try to download
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This little product works just as it is supposed to, but is kind of expensive for what it does. But this is Apple and that is what they are known for.
0385349831|5.0|I have read the Alchemist and the Pilgrimage by this author. This is not a story that should be read with the thought of getting a plot out of it. I must admit I thought this when I first bought this book. I did read this cover to cover initially and was puzzled. One day my daughter asked me a question and I thought , wow, I have read something very similar to this. Currently I read a chapter a day of this book and think about what lesson Paulo is trying to teach. The chapters run about 4 pages each so they are a quick read. I have a 10 year old daughter that I am trying to teach about life so I have her read a chapter and tell me what she thinks it means. I wish my parents had done something similar to me when I was growing up. I would be so much wiser and have made so many less mistakes. I think this is Paulo best work, though it took me a while to realize this.
B008N4XC2I|5.0|If you do not know MUSE, why not? This is another great album put out by these guys and on vinyl it sounds crazy good.
0756405890|5.0|I loved this book! I won't say I couldn't put it down because the thought never crossed my mind. I started reading it one Friday afternoon, read late into the night and then read for hours standing at my kitchen counter drinking tea. My kids would come in, then come back hours later and say \\"Your're still standing there?\\" Let me start by saying that this book is beautifully writen. There were phrases and even entire paragraphs I had to read over again just to wrap head around the astounding use of the language. It began with the first paragraph.<br /><br />First, this book is about a humble, defeated man. Kote. An innkeeper.<br />Then the book is about the boy that began the man and the contrasts between the two. The boy has such a wholesome family life and such a rich (culturally) upgringing and the man seems so damaged, yet kind, you are reading the story of the boy and his life knowing the shoe is about to drop, and you just don't want it to. Well, I didn't. Then the book is about the arrogant, damaged teenager that emerges from, well, the shoe dropping.<br /><br />Then the shoe does drop and Kvothe goes through so much tragedy, pain and hardship, it is unrelenting. I kept thinking enough already! But unlike a fairytale, no fairy pops out of the woodwork to save our hero, no rich patron finds him and sees his worth and raises him from his abject poverty. No. It's really kind of like real life. Kvothe saves himself.<br /><br />I have known damaged people. Truly. People who have been tortured and imprisoned and have lived through things we can't even imagine. Kvothe reminded me of them in a very realistic way. Here is this brilliant, talented boy who has buried this trauma and damage deep inside him and just keeps doing stupid, arrogant things for a 15 year old boy. Wait! I've known undamaged 15 year olds like this. You keep thinking here's the person that will help him turn around, that will reach out to him and he'll reach back, but he can't. As people can't in real life.<br /><br />The book is frustrating in that way, over and over because you see the happy path and he doesn't take it. Anyone who has lived a little, or raised children, or grandchildren, or had friends surely knows someone like this. Someone who just can't take the easy way.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss really represents the bullheadedness of youth, inexperience, too much experience, the pride, and the tragedy of a person who has so much potential, who knows it, and yet remains locked away. If you can see this, you can appreciate the character that is Kvothe and understand both the arrogance and the defensiveness of this young man who is very much alone in the world.<br /><br />To the people who complained about the unrelenting poverty. Poverty and poverty again. In this I praise Rothfuss for representing poverty as it really is. Very few people rise above it, it traps you, it holds you down and it doesn't stop. When you don't have money, everything costs more, its harder and people really don't help you. It amazes me how realistic the depiction of this character is in a fantasy novel.<br /><br />On occasion I had the \\"Oh, no, not again, he can't be that stupid!\\" feeling of exasperation, but then I reminded myself, he's only 16. I have known smart damaged young men, and have seem them do all kinds of stupid things that I found incredibly exasperating and simply did not understand.<br /><br />The story drew me in and kept me there. Every time the characters would emerge from the story back to the inn, I felt the surprise of having been so involved in the story I forgot that we were at the Inn hearing the story and then that I was actually in my kitchen reading the story.<br /><br />About the women, well, I'm a woman and I was not offended. This is the story from the perspective of a young man. The representation of the women from his perspective seems pretty on target to me, whether I like how he sees them or not. Mostly he seems genuienly baffled by them andas he is narrating the story, that is what comes accross. I found some of the exchanges between Kvothe and his mother quite profound, and his mother is represented as a boy knows his mother, no more, no less.<br /><br />It is a beautiful story for those who enjoy seeing a person grow up and evolve and learn. Kvothe certainly does this. I have read the second book and found it almost as amazing. The mystery of how Kvothe the teenager becomes the man at the Inn intrigues me, the suspense of knowing there is more tragedy to come, that there is yet another shoe to drop, has me chomping at the bit for the next book.<br /><br />If what you want is an action packed novel with lots of sword fighting and galloping around the countryside this is probably not for you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a really good movie and it fun with 3D. If you havent seen this movie yet. Stop being lame and watch it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very very addicting!! The game should have a better tutorial though.. I definitely would like to recommend this game if you like the Sims city games
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Lots of good clean fun. Play with friends and share scores. Great win for fans of the birds. Just a little Laggy at times.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|From Spock and his bride T'Pring to not being a tribble a'tall season 2 of the franchise to be was one of the highlights of Star Trek.  I was but a young whippersnapper when this first aired and now almost 50 years later the power of Star Trek and the second season is still as meaningful as it was in the 60s.  Long live Kirk and Spock.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Poor quality service from Amazon. The third disk is missing. Several weeks ago I ordered the Hulk blu-ray (new) and the disk was missing. Both blu-ray orders, Avatar collector and Hulk, were listed as new. Yet, the orders show up and disks are missing. Both movie orders showed up with the cheap shrink wrap plastic. They were not in the normal &#34;crispy&#34; plastic a new movie is wrapped in as normally seen at Walmart. This indicates I am getting used movies and not &#34;new&#34;. At least Amazon shipped overnight to replace the Hulk blu-ray. Amazon told me they did not have any more Avatar collector's disk and I could refund or wait. I attempted the refund and the website procedures indicate that I must cancel the second shipment. No clear procedures for refund. So, I'm working through email to get a refund and feeling frustration that I should not have to feel. I have used Amazon for over a decade. Lately, the service has been poor not only with this but also utilizing resellers for college books. Amazon need's to get their act together!
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Why ain't these guys in the Hall of Fame ? Makes a joke of the voting process. Wonderful cd that gets better with each listen.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Life with a brain injury turns one's world upside down. However, Matthew Quick describes how his character copes with the loss of reality and gain of a newer, more positive view of the world. Quick read, humorous, worth the time and money!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the best fantasy series I've read since I finished reading C. S. Lewis. I'd lost hope and desire for the genre but was compelled to read the first book after watching a few episodes of the third series. Love this story and the mind of this author. Ahhh...the sweet kindling of new literary love.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a fun game. easy to understand. can have a lot going on. I would recommend it if you like building games. does not take too long to load.
0385349831|5.0|This book is told as a transcription of a manuscript written in Arabic, Hebrew and Latin and discovered by an English archaeologist in 1974. The document's origin was traced to Accra, a city on the southern coast of Ghana.<br /><br />The life lessons of this 192 page-turner by Coehlo are immense, masterfully crafted, threaded, woven, brought to life, nourished and laid at our feet for our choosing. Not just lightning in a bottle but wisdom we already know - if we listen to ourselves, if we pay attention to the world, if we care what happens and dare to make a difference first in our own lives and thus in the collective consciousness of the Universe.<br /><br />We learn those who never lost a battle, avoided scars and taking action, those who eschewed the powerful emotions of humiliation, loneliness, uselessness and despair, also missed the open arms of love and plenitude of beauty that crossed their paths. The manuscript warns that by wasting energy to forego adventure and to shun change, we will likely squander our blessings of love and be quickly and quietly killed by routine in the dead of night... and no one will mourn our passing.<br /><br />The old story teller reminds us that no one can go back but everyone can go forward and so our imperative is to scatter our seed wherever we go because we know not which seeds \\"will grow and flourish and enlighten the next generation.\\"<br /><br />A delightful book... Buy it, download it, borrow it, somehow get your hands on it and read it again and again as I have.<br /><br />Namaste,<br /><br />Becca Chopra, author of Chakra Secrets
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My 5 yr old absolutely loves this game!! It's very challenging for me but, I can't put it down, I keep coming back for more. Well worth the 99 cents!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this nifty little app! I use it for falling asleep when my family is still awake making noise. its a great substitute for normal music that actually keeps you up. I would suggest this for anyone.. I love it!
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I love the firefly series. I've seen most of the episodes many times, but they never cease to entertain me.  I am sure I'll watch them again
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Great song for summer fun :) Catchy and upbeat!<br />I've heard this on the radio on multiple stations... hope it doesn't get overplayed too quickly!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Not just a match 3 game, but a &quot;thinking&quot; match 3 game.  Very hard to put down and do other things.  Will go for Jewel Legends II.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|I wouldn't NOT recommend it, but the characters weren't particularly lovable.  Just didn't stand up to say, Wall-E, which teaches a similar lesson about saving our planet.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Listen, it kinda brings you back to Tragic Kingdom. They ROCK, I've been a fan since I was what, 15? I am so glad they FINALLY made a new album. I love, LOVE track #2 of course #4, but all are good on their own, those are my favs :0)
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This is the second time reading this book and it is by far my favorite of the entire series. The world building is phenomenal and character development continues to delight and entice.
0374533571|5.0|This book has just been placed in the top 5 of my all time favorites. Great story, great read, and hilarious.

B006M4F67A|5.0|Enjoyable way to pass some time. There appears to be several variations to this tile match game. For the price (it was free today), what's not to like?!?!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|New to the anger of birds. but it just cracks me up. was not about military did not tax my already taxed mind.
193700788X|1.0|********* SPOILER ALERT!!! **********<br /><br />If I could give \\"Dead Ever After\\" zero stars, I would. If I could give it negative stars I would.<br /><br />After reading Deadlocked I knew Charlaine Harris would break my heart with Dead Ever After. I was prepared, I swear, but this... all of it... Low blow. LOW BLOW. This book was so bad near the end I was starting to root for Sookie to end up with Bill. Yep. That bad.<br /><br />I didn't really care who Sookie ended up with. That was not the important part of the series. Not really. I just wanted plausible reason and for it to be romantic and written well. IT WAS NOT.<br /><br />Most of this book is filler. Sookie puts moisturizer on more than she actually has conversations with people. It is full of out of character issues, pacing issues, and continuity issues, not to mention all the other problems.<br />Sookie wasn't even like Sookie, she swore a lot and was almost never cheery. She didn't give off the feel we had come to associate with her for the first 9 books.<br />The Sookie that is so special and so entertaining is completely lost. She has been reduced to a bigoted, foul-mouthed, wussy and directionless strumpet who despises her telepathic 'curse'<br /><br />Most depressing are the overall themes. Sookie has suffered so much to gain so little. The price of rape, torture and all that heartache seems a little high for the ending she gets. She's in the same job, same town, with the same people who think she's nothing but Crazy Sookie, (same friends as all the Supes seem mostly absent now) and has ended up with a man who has never fought for her or shown her passion... Wow, inspiring!<br />You could have had Sookie end up alone, but instead you put her with a character she has shown ZERO interest in since Book 1. Not only that, but you have her banished from Eric while he is isolated from everything he loves, sold into slavery for 200 years. So not only did you split them up, but you did it for all eternity andwas epically cruel to Eric in the process. Eric is left emasculated and victimised. Any and all prior acts of kindness or love are dismissed by the author's sneering commentary. What upsets me the most is the complete annihilation of the Eric character. Just appalling.<br />If Charlaine Harris truly loathed Eric so much, she should have just written him off many, many books ago instead of building his character to be so loveable. Why not build up Sam's character? I know nothing about him, other than he's a friendly, brotherly 'nice-guy' who dates insane chicks.<br />Let's not forget that Sookie is not even sure if it is the Cluviel Dor that is making her feel this way - so a Blood Bond isn't okay but a magical fairy Cluviel Dor is!? It is convenient writing, lazy and shows no respect.<br />Why write 13 books only to end up where we began? I am so mad I could spit!<br /><br />I feel sad and bitter that the author herself holds such a poor opinion of the two, what I felt, main characters. Eric and Sookie could have had much better endings even if they weren't going to end up together.<br /><br />It just feels like the author wants you to know that no matter how hard you fight it you're destined to keep living the same old life.<br />I thought the main message of the series would be that differences don't matter. And love will prevail. Boy was I wrong!! Instead the message was settling for second best is okay. And you can have seal sex *shudder*<br /><br />Nothing, and I mean nothing, was given a satisfying conclusion. I just cannot believe it. It's like Charlaine Harris was too concerned with tying up all the loose ends, so did it in the most succinct unimaginative way possible.<br />WHY ON EARTH IS IT A GOOD ENDING TO HAVE A RAPING PEDOPHILE WIN FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE!?<br /><br />Charlaine Harris likes to say she writes for herself. Actually Charlaine Harris, because you charge me for reading your work, you write for me. And this was bull hockey. A lot of people aresaying Charlaine Harris sold her fans out when she sold the rights of the books to HBO, but I think it's just sloppy writing. She didn't care anymore. Game Of Thrones is a hit HBO show now too, but those novels continue to be fantastic. Not so with Charlaine Harris. FOR SHAME.<br /><br />I'm not sure the SVM community will ever recover from this. No wonder Charlaine Harris decided not to tour with this book. I have no clue what would possess Charlaine Harris to alienate her fans like this, but that is exactly what she did.<br /><br />It was a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.<br /><br />This was a sloppy farce of a finale and Sookie deserved better.<br />It's not the ending we deserve, and definitely not the one we wanted. This series deserved a better class of ending. And we thought Charlaine Harris was gunna give it to us. DISAPPOINT.<br /><br />DEAD EVER AFTER is apt, because from this point on that's what this book will be to me.<br /><br />Goodbye, Sookie. I don't belong in your narrow-minded, boring world anymore. I'll make do with True blood and hopefully Alan Ball will read these horrible reviews and make sure that has a much better ending.<br /><br />P.S:<br />* Why does this book read like fanfic?<br />* Why is this book basically devoid of any substantial vampire input. Isn't it a series about Sookie and vampires?<br />* Why is the devil that made a deal never explained? What was the point?
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I liked this book a lot, Liked the characters and the subject matter.  I camped at Lame Deer twice in my life so i was familiar with they area.  I like Walt, someone I would like to know.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Honestly, I bought this CD as a gift for a Michael Buble fan. I am not too familiar w/ him. I did see him perform 2 songs on TV from this CD, and I was not impressed. My bff, who loves everything of Michael Buble, was very happy to get this gift from me.<br />Debra-Sue
B008ROELL0|5.0|this i an older movie that i have watched several times over the years it a slice of real life;
B00CH87HF4|5.0|hits that itch for committing. genocide. on demon trash and its free. the controls are fluid skill animations are nice. but most of all the maps are nice and feel authentic.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game.  Be prepared for your fingertip to get sore from chomping on a variety of aquatic life(and birds and  people)!  Unleash your inner shark!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I'm surprised at how often the \\"n\\" word was used, but it was interesting the different ways each character would say it. All around entertaining, typical tarantino blood splattering everywhere style.
0374533555|4.0|Type size was too small for me to read comfortably.<br />So, I bought Kindle version--now it is a great read.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It's a really fun game. It isn't to hard but it's hard enough that it will take a little while to finish a level. Saying all this, it's really fun and you should buy it. But there are better games but still you should try it, it's one off.the best games I've ever played.
B004G6009U|4.0|This is a great movie, the horse is so much like my dog that the spouse can be heard giggling behind me as we watch. For someone who always wanted to be a princess but is way too old now this movie goes great with Brave and Sleeping Beauty. Very cute take on Rapunzel.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This novel holds the readers interest and had a nice climax.  This book is a great way to spend a day.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Glad to have on my kindle. Told my brother about game so he got this game on his kindle also
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great storyline most of the action believable. Dont mess with Reacher he`ll put a hurt on ya big time if your into action watch it
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|fun to play and challenging.  Will tell my friends about game.  hope to get better at playing the game. thanks
B00AW8UK0K|3.0|This is a very short book. The idea of the diet makes sense, though it did not work for me. However there is not much detail in the book and nothing that is not out there on the internet.<br /><br />I suspect it was put out in a rush to cater for the popularity of the diet.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I downloaded this game just to be able to play it with my grandchildren. They had fun trying to teach me what to do.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|Maybe it's the direction that's off-kilter in this too literal interpretation of the text.  I just had no interest in the characters.  Mia Farrow's Daisy Buchanan just seems like a crazy person, and Robert Redford's Gatsby is just vain and too pretty
0307887960|4.0|Information was presented well, super easy to follow, but too restrictive for me.  I have a friend that has had great success following this diet and recommend it for those with a good amount of weight to lose, or those just looking to eliminate some bloat.  I lost a few pounds during the first few days but couldn't stay on track after that!
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is a great read. If you've read any of Michael Pollan's books and thought \\"god, this guy can't write and apparently doesn't know how to do research either... I've never been so angry with an author whose premise I generally agree with,\\" then this is the book for you! Moss can write! That should go without saying, but sadly does not. This is seriously interesting and also informative. Everything is well based in research and he lays out the possible conflicts of interest of the researchers, examines their past research and findings and says whether or not they happen to find in line with their funders or not, which is really important.  He doesn't fall into vilifying people or companies where it's unlikely they had malicious intentions but he also does not pull punches.  I had considered myself relatively well informed about food science, but I still learned a ton, and it was a fun read.  It's exactly what I wanted when I read \\"In Defense of Food\\" and nearly pulled out all my hair in frustration since the whole book seemed to be hearsay; almot no supporting evidence!  Salt Sugar Fat was really interesting, Moss clearly did a lot of research and it doesn't feel like he had a preconceived idea of what he wanted to say or find... but instead just did the research and laid out what it said.  Yes, it has left me feeling like processed food sucks and I can't buy most of what's in the grocery store... but I know all the reasons and none of them are the general, fuzzy ideas like \\"well, it's not NATURAL,\\" or \\"I can't pronounce half of what's in it,\\" which aren't very compelling on their own... I mean, I can break fruits and vegetable down into components I can't pronounce either. Instead I can say, \\"well, the salt, sugar and fat in this product were engineered to induce cravings and reduce satisfaction so I am inclined to overeat the product.  My brain rewards me for eating these things because it evolved in an environment that had very little of them.  So I need to eatthem in serious moderation and not trust my instincts.\\"  And of course that's only the most basic of the ideas encountered in the book.  Anyway.  AWESOME BOOK. READ IT.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love how it has all the iron man suites and how it is like temple run. That's why I love it.
B00BHWG0DQ|5.0|I just thought the packaging with the character's profile was cool! Love introducing this show to my kids! It's great!

B009LMTDL0|5.0|It's like a review of all that has happened in the process of the woman and now a look at what we have not done.  Sheryl Sandberg has had tons of experience working in the new 21st century market.  She tells it like it is.  The chapter headings cover all the fine points and remind the young couples how important it is to be true partners in the process of child raising, making space for the working mom -- I could go on and on.  But you should read it instead of my review.  I made sure my daughter and daughter-in-law and their husbands have copies and that they will read it and launch their careers and family lives from this perspective.  I loved this book!!!
B0013ND30W|5.0|Love this movie still.  I watched this when I was little and still watch this movie.  Would recommend to all those little girls out there.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This was a charming film...well directed and made interesting by a good script, and a solid cast. Time well spent...
B00003CX8N|2.0|This fabulous story, so wonderfully acted, has a giant flaw.  The sound is poor.  Even with the volume turned up to the maximum, my husband missed much of the dialog.  I was attempting to share an old favorite with him, but I couldn't get involved in the story either, for having to continually fill in the dialog he missed.
B00021HBGS|5.0|These were a big hit with my grandson . Now I have another grandson who is 18mos, and he loves them also! The grandson I originally bought them for is 3 and he still plays with them. A great fun product, easy to use, and a great value.

B002BJGYV2|5.0|Gilmore Girls in their 5th season...for a fan that watches any episode that comes on, now you can watch them in order!  Some big changes are on the horizon, and single mom Lorelei and daughter Rory laugh and cry their way through them.
B009B4ZEKM|1.0|I am in my late 20's and have grown up with Christina. I liked her since her genie in a bottle days, but especially liked her cd Stripped. I listened to it all of the time. Stripped was definitely from the heart and it touched me on an emotional level. I kind of got out of her music when Back to Basics came out and I think that album is very heartfelt, and she was focused when she made it, but it was not really my cup of tea. I got back into Christina when Bionic came out and while a lot of the songs are pretty bad I found about 8 songs that I really liked and still listen to. When I got this album I was excited, but after listening to a few songs I was disappointed. They were terrible. Your Body, Make the World Move, and Army of Me have such a weak message. Even the music video for Your Body was pretty much unwatchable. I am not sure why I did not like it so much but it seemed really safe and mainstream, like Christina just wanted to sell records. It seemed rushed as well. I will give Lotus a few more listens but my first impression is that this is the worst album Christina has ever made.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Rory is growing up and Lorelei is too...fun and quirky series about a young single mother and her daughter.  They have a very close relationship that is endearing.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I LOVED this book - it's really a great read. Written for boys and girls; a lot of fighting, romance. Really cute and funny. Definitely a five star book. Riordan's style of writing is witty, sarcastic, and plain amazing!
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Google Nexus 7. I am changing my review. Play first released an update that has locked the remaining levels in the game, even after I paid for the App. I got it as a free app of the day, didn't want to lose my progress so I got it via Amazon instead of play and now I can't even finish the game. It's still asking dor more money to finish the game.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is the best show ever! If u dont watch it, WATCH IT NOW!!!!! It is sooooo good!!!! I watch this show about everyday! And it amazes me ever week there is a new episode!
B00979CS50|5.0|To begin with, I am a Neil Young fan. Most of his albums reside closely within reach, and I constantly recommend him to friends. There is, therefore, the slight possibility that I am somewhat prejudiced toward this album.<br />From the opening guitar notes, I knew that this album was going to be special. Neil can take the simplest of phrases like &#34;Hey, now now, Hey now now. I'm Drifting Back&#34;, put it with his guitar, his voice, and Crazy Horse, and you find yourself &#34;Driftin' Back&#34;. His guitar work makes one float to, well, wherever your mind lets you float to.Then he takes what seems to be an almost silly phrase like &#34;I used to dig Picasso&#34;, adds, &#34;Then a big tech giant came along and turned him into wallpaper&#34;, to it, and I realize &#34;I used to dig Picasso&#34;, too.<br />As always with Neil, one genre is not enough. You get some great electric rock songs on the first thee cuts, &#34;Driftin' Back&#34;, &#34;Psychedelic Pill&#34;, and &#34;Ramada Inn&#34;. I reckon most people would label them &#34;grunge&#34;, but I prefer &#34;classic Neil Young heavy rock, bordering at times on acid rock, with some drone- style Neil Young thrown in for good measure&#34;. How's that? The next two songs, &#34;Born In Ontario&#34; and &#34;Twisted Road&#34;are Neil Young country-rock (he explains his style a bit on &#34;Twisted Road&#34;), then back to &#34;classic Neil Young heavy rock, bordering at times on acid rock, with some drone-style Neil Young thrown in for good measure&#34; on &#34;She's Always Dancing&#34;. They slow it down a bit on &#34;For The Love Of Man&#34;, but return to the heavier sound for &#34;Walk Like A Giant&#34; and &#34;Psychedelic Pill (Alternet Mix)&#34;.<br />In my opinion, there is not one bad cut on this album. Add it to your Neil Young with Crazy Horse collection. You will not regret it for one of the 87 minutes of music on this album.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|It is what you would expect from Bon Jovi..a cd you want to listen to over and over.  Can't wait to see them in concert.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Justin Timberlake does not dissappoint in his new release. I gave myself this CD for Mothers Day.  Best present to self, cant get enough.
B0017HMF6W|4.0|i have it on vhs .It's about a story about mistaken identity.A man his mistaken for a secret agent who fighting for his life while trying to find the truth .
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|I like all of Rammstein's albums to some degree. They have a heavy, yet lyric quality that sets them apart from the typical metal crap that's usually out there. And as much as their previous albums made a good impression on me, this one really set its hooks in me. It seems even more melodic and artful than their former works, yet it retains the aggressive tone in just the right places. To me, it's their best album.
0783114893|4.0|story about a young kid experience with a hitchhiker who turn out to be a mysterios psychpath gone on a rampage .
B0026IUXME|5.0|Yes, I give it 5 stars.  But &#34;I love it&#34; does not quite coincide with deep admiration for the first-hand and anguishingly accurate depiction of an immensely inhuman historical atrocity.  It brought out some savage feelings:  I found myself wishing we had developed the atomic bomb a little earlier, so that it could have been dropped directly on Hitler's Berlin bunker in 1943.  I found myself loathing Darwin for the off-hand remarks he had made about one human &#34;race&#34; at some future period finding themselves necessitated to exterminate another human &#34;race&#34;---remarks that fueled the frivolous press in Austria and Germany whereby Hitler developed his ignoramus ideas in Mein Kampf.  The movie evoked much sadness, much horror, still more loathing,little joy, and blind rage.  Which, sadly, is exactly what such facts about the history of our supposedly civilized and advanced 20th and 21st century culture should evoke.
B0049J2BSM|3.0|This Movie is great for young kids... Older kids might think its corney, but we enjoyed it for the clean cartoon humor.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|woke me up on time. lets me know how the weather is outside. its a good clock. its loud and easy to see.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a heart stopping  page turner that catches the eye of everybody. I am a 12 year old girl and I read this book in only two days. This book is great for all ages and I recommend it to you.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have been a vampire nut since I was a kid.  I have read hundreds of vampire books and have seen just about every vampire movie ever made.  I was enthralled by this series.  I loved the development of the characters and I especially enjoyed the relationship struggles between Sookie ad Eric.  It made the relationship more real that it wasn't all perfect that they had their fights and their moments of betrayal.  However I firmly believed that in the end Mrs. Harris would show that Eric had it in him to be a true eternal love and that Sookie would realize that playing in the sun was secondary to a an eternity of nights with a soulmate.  Boy was I wrong.  This book was horrible.  I regret reading it.  I would have much rather the series have ended 2 books ago than the way Mrs. Harris basically destroyed this series.  Sam was weak.  While I enjoyed Sam as the faithful friend and big brother type I never saw Sookie as being content with him.  While some would say that the Flash Bang fire of the vampires is secondary to a slow sizzle I never saw the relationship with Sam as being more than lukewarm bath water.  I found this book boring and utterly devoid of the intensity of emotion that the rest of the series showed.  I will not be reading any more books by an author who cares so little for the characters she creates.  I hope the TV series continues to deviate from the books.
B0027BVMSY|3.0|The movie is OK. Decent plot line, but too much action and not enough intrigue for a James Bond film. On the Amazon Instant Video end, the resolution kept falling out of HD and even went blurry at times. I checked my connection and found it to be running quite fast, so it's probably an issue with the streaming site. Save a buck and get the standard definition. The change in resolution was distracting.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|It does not stand like the picture shows, I have tried everything to make it stand like the picture but no, don't like it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Gary Chapman has written an excellent book, especially significant for use in adult education classes.  His five languages are significant in any relationship and all apply to everyone; however, his recommendation on observing your loved ones to determine their primary love language is very helpful.  Gary effectively shares the conflicts of clients he has counseled to illustrate the significance of the languages.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Any Nicholas Sparks book is going to get 5 stars for me.  You can't go wrong with his novels.  Never written a bad one in my opinion.
B008JIWNYG|5.0|I used to be a huge Marvel fan and didn't give much attention to DC Comics, but with DC starting over again with the New 52, how could I refuse to get in on the ground floor of a new beginning?  I'm glad DC did this because Batman was, what?  Pushing 80 in the comic?  It's hard for someone my age (41) to have gotten into reading any of the comics because I had already missed out on 30-40 years of storytelling anyway.  By starting over, it gives this generation a chance to see the birth of a new world by updating all of the characters.<br /><br />Anyway, while I am enjoying the new Justice League and all of their spin-offs (except the new Flash...seems too boring), there is one that stands out...Green Lantern.  Green Lantern is one that I never enjoyed before but the Green Lantern Blackest Night/Brightest Day series seemed to be very interesting.  However, I never picked them up because I hate to be lost when I start reading a comic.<br /><br />OK, so I was a little lost when I started to read this book on my Kindle, but I knew enough that I got the general storyline.  Someone who hasn't read GL before will also be lost, but the series does a great job of not confusing people with trying to run 15 different storylines in five different issues.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle \\"trade paperbacks\\" but I'm becoming very impatient at waiting around for the next one so I'm going to switch over to purchasing single issues.<br /><br />Green Lantern...my new favorite hero.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's not bad, but I'll probably just go back to the free calculator that came on the phone.  takes a while to get the app to load.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Just wonderful, who can beat Andrea Bocelli?  His range and selection of music make this a great addition to my collection.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I think it would go good if you made a book just like it. I know I would by it!
0736092269|4.0|Nice, compact illustrated handbook with common exercises, stretches, physiological explanations and common injury information.<br />It's not all inclusive, however, and there are some drawings that depict nudity which is superfluous and unappreciated.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|A very pleasant surprise that keeps on going and getting better and better from season to season. The writing and legal topics selected are clever, involved and handled extremely well.  With elements of The Paper Chase, The Good Wife take it to a whole new level. You won't believe who shows up on this intelligent series and how sensitive topics are handled.  Exciting, informative and extremely entertaining.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm not sure how or why I got away from Tom Clancy...I really loved his early books and have a first edition of \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\"  This 21st century thriller was great and despite being very detailed about cybercrime, it was still reasonably easy to follow.  I had no idea that Jack and Cathy Ryan's children had grown up and that Jack is in the White House...quite a leap from where I last left them!  No details here...too much of chance for a spoiler.  Despite the length, the book moves quickly and leaves you with the satisfaction that comes from a well-written plot.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|The show is definitely for adults and the violence coupled with the sex scenes are certainly pagan but I am interested to see how the Christian influence manfiests itself through the future episodes.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Funny and sad at the same time. Great descriptions of the characters. I really liked this book and didn't want it to end.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It took me a few sessions to get caught up in this one. After about a third of the book I was hooked, and didn't put it down mentally until I had finished. The disparate living conditions of the characters mirror where our society is going today, as is our increasing dependence on our electronics. It is not much of a stretch to see that this could be our future. Parsival, our hero, has learned from his station in life to be a step ahead of authority, and this skill keeps him alive both physically and digitally. The revelation regarding Aech is a bit clunky - probably unnecessary - and the two brothers aren't fleshed out much. However, those are minor gripes and Art3mis owns most of the storyline where our hero is concerned. The 80s is the the true leading character here - I came of age in the late 70s/early 80s, and this homage to that time frame is unbelievable. I can't say I miss those days, or that hair, but the memories this story tugged up from the mud were a blast.
B00BJS7104|5.0|I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino (the Kill Bill seres were a bit tedious for me). His masterful, lyric like, dialog and artistic camera angles makes his work unique. His work is ofter exceptionally violent in a bizarre manner, but inside the strange juxtaposed nature of the violence is always a touch of reality and irony.
B004GYY714|5.0|Free apps are awesome and this is a good one. There's lots of music genres, you can search for stations by location, and I even found the police scanner for my area. Yes there's a few commercials on the stations, but oh well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm addicted to The Walking Dead. Even when i run out of episodes to watch, i go back and start from the beginning. I really miss some of the characters. But its my favorite show!  Can't wait for season 4!!!
B0097K21YW|5.0|It's a lot like Crush the Castle and Angry Birds. It's a good game to relieve stress and anger. Play it!
B008RV5K5E|3.0|The art was fine. it looked like a decent adaption of the original miller artwork, but the voice direction was pretty crummy as was the casting.<br /><br />the slang that the kids use was handled pretty poory. I would only recommend this to DKR completists like myself.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I like all the &#34;Story&#34; games, they're well-made and fun to play. You can purchase items in-game but it's not really necessary.

B008K8VDPU|5.0|This has everything: a big keyboard, lots of songs that you can learn to play, ability to load a midi file and learn to play it.<br />It's a good app for the free version, but if you upgrade to the Diamond for $1.99, it is totally worth it. Not only do you get so many more songs, but the ads are removed and there's more instruments added, including some that are suited for headphone use.  The single thing I wish would improve is more instruments and more songs.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was hooked by page 10 and then it was a so real you could feel the pain in this family. I was totally shocked at the end.
B008EKMB82|4.0|It took a few chapters to get into, but stay with it, this is a wonderful read.  One of those books that's stays with you long after you are done.

B00BXHE0CI|5.0|The Dillinger Escape Plan style has been described as many things down through the years such as Mathcore, Hardcore and Metalcore to name just a few, what they really are is one of the best bands in music today. With their relentless non-stop style both in and out of the studio they have forged a path that is unmatched by most bands with their complex playing of styles being heavy yet melodic at the same time and not to forget Greg Puciato ability for high pitched and angry in your face vocals and all this from a band that have a high turnover of members including numerous drummers, bassists and rhythm guitarists, of course lead guitarist Ben Weinman is now the only original member. Former guitarist James Love returns replacing Jeff Tuttle.<br /><br />Following on from 2010's outstanding \\"Option Paralysis\\" the band release album number five \\"One Of Us Is The Killer\\" which has the same in your face style of tracks starting right from the get go. They come straight out of the blocks with the hard hitting single \\"Prancer\\" and follow that up with the equally aggressive \\"When I Lost My Bet\\"  The band have long been influenced by Mike Patton (he recorded an ep with them back in 2002) whether it be his work with Faith No more or probably closer to Tomahawk and that style is evident on the title track which has Puciato adopt a much more straight forward vocal style, and with \\"Nothing's Funny\\" they have a song in the style of \\"Black Bubblegum\\" from 2007's \\"Ire Works\\" including Ben Weinman's use of electronics on the track. \\"Paranoia Shields\\" is a song full of twists and turns with Puciato twisting every vocal into a different style and features a real mellow breakdown at the 2:27 mark as it goes really quiet before coming out full belt again.  If you want to hear how good the rhythm section of Liam Wilson and Billy Rymer are check out the mainly instrumental track \\"CH 375 268 277 ARS\\".<br /><br />If you liked The Dillinger Escape Plan previous albums with Puciato on vocals you will love this as it features the usual mix of styles the band offer. And at forty minutes long never out stays its welcome and doesn't have any filler and just confirms the band as one of the most must see live acts that there is.
B0084I2PEO|4.0|I loved this book and it is very well written. The Kite Runner is one of my all time favorites so I was really looking forward to reading this book but I do feel that the story is one I've heard multiple times before in different forms. But regardless, I still recommend this book to anybody who is at all interested in it from reading the description or has read some of the authors other works (new book coming soon!).
0439023513|4.0|The delivery of the book was quick and I was also very pleased with the condition. The story was a little slow, but then I'm not writing a book review, only the product itself and the price. Very pleased with that.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Excellent. The 3d really does add to the movie. Simply marvelous. At first I thought the price was way to high. But now that I have seen the movie it's worth the price!

B002M87V0A|5.0|Wilson's music is outstanding in using the same themes, over again-with varying tempi to maintain a consistant upbeat feel to the film. Creates a fine ambience of the &#34;rag time&#34; era. The film has great cinematography, acting, dancing and singing.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I love Vince Flynn novels and the Mitch Rapp character.  I think this book wasn't as exciting as the others in the series, which made it even more of a bummer.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|With each record is seems that Vampire Weekend expands their unique sound ever so slightly. The summertime pop and world beats of their debut and the electronic loops and mellow ballads of Contra are all here, albeit with a fresh coat of paint and some challenging instrumentation that demands repeated listens. With Modern Vampires of the City they've crafted some of their finest work yet and have dispelled any doubts about whether they could survive beyond the initial hype that first surrounded them.<br /><br />\\"Obvious Bicycle\\" is a slow and melodic opener, complete with heartbeat rhythms and Ezra Koenig's gentle crooning. \\"Step\\" combines the harmonies of Simon & Garfunkel with a near-identical chorus to Bread's \\"Aubrey\\", yet it all comes together to create a relaxing and atmospheric track. \\"Diana Young\\" and \\"Unbelievers\\" sound a bit more conventional in their approach, harking back to the band's previous work and putting their upbeat sound up against darker and more contemplative lyrics. A majority of the album's tracks will be instantly familiar to any VW fan while also hosting enough surprises to keep them from sounding stale and rehashed. The gentle ballad \\"Hannah Hunt\\" is truly moving, a reassuring track that reminds us that this band's relentless energy can be easily poured into the tenderest of songs.<br /><br />\\"Everlasting Arms\\" and \\"Don't Lie\\" are so weightless and natural that you can't help but be pulled in immediately. They provide a perfect compliment to the fast-paced energy of tracks like \\"Finger Back\\" and \\"Worship You\\". The pacing of the album is flawless, allowing for an accessible and attentive listening experience. Each track flows directly into the other, with hardly any space or silence between them. It really helps to give the album a consistent flow without ever brushing over the individual tracks. That's a tough feat to accomplish and the band deserves huge credit for churning out another engrossing and consistent set of songs.<br /><br />Modern Vampires of the City is already a strong contender for one of the year's best records and cements the band's position as one of the brightest on the scene. Current fans will be more than pleased and newcomers will be able to easily sink into the album's lush sounds and vibrant melodies. Don't miss out on this one.odern Vampires of the City is already a strong contender for one of the year's best records and cements the band's position as one of the brightest on the scene.

B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Unfortunately, without the pizazz of Sly Stallone nor the creative fun and development of the character roster from the first, this flick is somewhat a joke.

Wonderful revenge tale. If you believe that what goes around comes around you'll love this story. What are you waiting for?

B005J2V74C|2.0|Couldn't give this film/mocumentary a good review on the basis that it just wasn't believable. The acting was poor, visually, stagnant. Could've been better perhaps with a more generous budget. Storyline, not very original. Bottom line, didn't enjoy.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have read a couple of different books lately written from a child's perspective and this is the only one that felt authentic to me. One recent book about a sexually abused girl who was rescued by a prison parolee/gardener made her seem like a caricature. I can tell that the author of this book drew on her personal experience as a mother to make Jack every bit as complicated as a precious five-year-old child should be.<br /><br />I also felt that the author made intelligent plot decisions throughout this book. Sometimes it hurt to read, especially in the second part of the book, but I think it was necessary to stay true to the story and for the development of each character. Life Outside is suddenly complicated; like Plant, Jack and Ma are stunted from living in Room so long; the malleable child learns how to exist separately from his mother and Ma learns that in order for him to grow she must give up a little bit of Jack.<br /><br />The author did not elaborate on the story of Old Nick, which was also a good decision. It focuses the story on Jack and his Ma and refuses to humanize Old Nick who in this story is the monster.

0525423281|5.0|I saw this on sale on Amazon so I knew I had to pick up a copy, especially since I really enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins introduces Lola, who is unlike any character I've ever met. She's creative and spunky, but still very much a teenager. She has the perfect rocker boyfriend, two very loving and protective dads, and she wears something crazy every day that she has created herself. But then a childhood crush moves back next door and somehow everything falls apart. Will Lola be able to figure out how she really feels before things really spiral out of control?<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED this book. While I liked and enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss, I loved this book a million times more. I loved Lola, and I loved her character arc. I didn't always like her or agree with her decisions, but she learned a lot and grew, which is the important thing. I loved every description about her awesome gay parents, the details of living on Castro street, and her friends. Lindsey was awesome (can't go wrong with a nerdy Korean best friend!), Cricket was super sweet and hot, and we even get to see Anna and St. Clair again. I think that my favorite character would have to be Calliope, Cricket's talented twin sister, and her arc ended most satisfyingly.<br /><br />At one point last week, I wondered how contemporaries could ever be entertaining since they can't really make up new worlds or magical powers. Stephanie Perkins reminds me how wrong I am-- if a book is written well, regardless of the genre, it can be magical.<br /><br />Overall, a perfectly written book with beautiful descriptions and a unique, unforgettable protagonist. This book is a must read and one of my top reads thus far this year. I will definitely pick up any book Stephanie Perkins writes.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|I was beginning this whole activity of `reading`. Now I remember how enjoyable and special and different it can be.
0920668372|5.0|This has been an absolute favorite of ours since we were children. While kids will definitely empathize with the story - this tale pulls at the heart strings of parents most of all. I remember reading Love You Forever as a child - finding it endearing but not quite understanding the emotions of the mother as she ages and watches her beloved son grow up. Now, I read it through the eyes of the mother, from the time she rocks her son in her arms - until the very end, where it is the adult son, who rocks his elderly mother in his arms. Beautiful story.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|needed some editting once the meet up with Leonardo.  But, good overall.  The humor was good, great action, it just gets a little old near the end.
B002M87V0A|5.0|What can one say about a truly amazing masterpiece of musical genius? Familiar catchy tunes from it's beginning to the end. Robert Preston draws you in, just like he drew in the people of River City as Harold Hill. This is one to watch with the family and a big bowl of popcorn and you might find yourself singing along!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I started watching this set as soon as the pack came in the mail for me. I live in Philly & I love watching the city back in the day. Mr.T's victory dance was funny in the middle of the flic.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Little on the pricey side for me but this was a Christmas gift for my avid Diablo III playing boyfriend.  Fits very well in both mine and his hand and smooth to the touch so it's comfy.  Response time is amazing and we will be purchasing a second one for myself!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game. can not quit playing. greart way to spend your me time. time flies while playing it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The USB cable arrived in one day and worked perfectly as a replacement for the original cable that came with my Kindle.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Got it for my daughter's 18th b-day.  Most would think that's stupid, but she's a Dr. Who nerd, so it's a great gift.  Wish it was metal though.
B005HEPOKU|4.0|As a pilot original Star Trek fan I was hesitant to watch the Next Generation when it first aired. I have watched all episodes of the Original many times, and though I never tire of it, I was thirsting for more and different adventures. After a few episodes of Next Generation, I became &#34;hooked&#34; and now enjoy them fully as much as the Original. Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, and all the other cast members give life to heroic characters that anyone will enjoy and want to watch many times over.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It will bring tears to your eyes and loud laughter from deep inside. It is the story of childhood stolen and love sought. Whether that's found or not, you'll have to read to find out. I LOVED the book! Every Irish turn of word. MARVELOUS!
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This is honestly the best album Demi Lovato has come out with, in her words \\"Each song takes you on a different journey. Even if they are the same genre, all the songs are different. And personal\\" and it means a lot to know that in my hands is Demi's story. I love her to pieces. I would recommend this Album for anyone who likes Demi lovato!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An amazing trilogy! I love everything about this trilogy. The fight to survive, the post apoctolyptic solution of separate cities and &#34;Hunger Games&#34;, and of course the love story. Like it the Twilight Series by Stephanie Meyer's you end up falling for one the the men in Katniss's life, team Peeta and team Gale. Hard to put down and after the trilogy is over you will wish there was more!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I think it is most everyones favorite family movie. It never gets old. The kids win over the bad guys and what a great treasure hunt story. A first rate exciting ride for everyone watching, no matter what your age. Your kids will make you buy it, so you all can watch it over and over, because you never get tired of it, or cheering for the kids, at the exciting end.
B006MPK9SU|5.0|Michael Connelly always delivers a first rate read and this was no different.  His characters are realistic, narrative flies along and always with the twist and turns of the plot, keeping one glued until the final page.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I have Really enjoy this game very addictive excellent graphics and quick to pick up so you know what it doing.<br />Quite similar to cityville.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I don't mind downloading a free game and getting ads in-between, but what it takes to get back to the game screen is stoopid.  I deleted this before I got 1/2 way through the first level.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a brilliant game and very adictive to play the differnet cities mean different places to travele in the game and there are lots of thibgs to collect like trophies and charecters!!! :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this everyday.  Helps pass the time waiting for my kids.  Dang, hard to beat though.  Nothing like an old school game.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is an extremely fast paced game....I love the Iron Man series, but I am not quick enough for this game...It's going to take some practice for me to get somewhere, but I am determined.  Graphics are amazing, sound effects are sharp and it's almost like watching the movie!  I would recommend this game to someone with quick reflexes or someone who wants to sharpen their reflexes.
0743246616|5.0|this magnolia book is as good as the previous. many many delicious recipes I cant wait to try. worth the price for sure
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game:)but it is a little too much and distracting. If u like to exercise this so NOT the game for you!
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Good plot but weak execution.  Slow pace.  Tom Cruise character not developed well at all.  Rosamund Pike's performance was poor... Attractive looks but zero chemistry with Cruise...why use such a good looking woman for this role?--not believable.  Suffers from lack of pre-production.  Robert Duval was his usual best.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Possibly the best British series ever with incredible actors/actresses. Can't wait for season 4 to become available. The settings at the Abbey and the period feel make the series very believable.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I liked the movie for the most part and the fight scenes lasted longer and were a bit better than part one but part one still had just a touch more pazzaz in it for some reason. But it is still a pretty good flick.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have seen the movie several times and am not much of a reader but this book is fantastic! Couldn't put it down
B005Z28M58|5.0|She now has all 8 season and she love to watch them one of her all time favorite tv series'. She is totally bummed that they ended it. But at least she can watch them all now when she wants and with out commercials.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Few of us would have liked being around Steve Jobs, but he transformed part of an industry, and forced the creation of the best products of their kind. Isaacson's writing and knowledge are decent, not great, but he arranged and took productive advantage of wonderful and unlikely access to a brilliant, mean, and incredibly successful person, and he tells an amazing story.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Humble, yet intelligently written. Full of creative plots and lovely characters. You will certainly enjoy it. Look forward to dust!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using the app for two months now and can find no problems. It doesn't seem to use too much power. It never fails to wake me. Love the option that makes the alarm louder as it continues to ring.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|This product looks good and functions well,  but it has a distinct left wing bias in its choice of news feeds.  If that's your bag, go for it, but if you prefer a more broad-based view of the news,or you don't want to take the time to reconfigure the entire set of feeds look elsewhere.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The model of an underlying story punctuated with self-contained episodes works for us. We keep coming back because the writing, acting and contemporary background feed off one another to make the whole gtrster than the sum of its parts.
B00B671VYU|5.0|Mr. Lordi does it once again, he and the band bring us some awesome tunes from the Nordic Regions Keep Them Coming And ROCK ON LORDI!!!
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Very entertaining.  Looking forward to each episodes revelations about the main characters and their pasts and present connections to each other.
193700788X|5.0|I thought this book was the perfect ending to the Sookie saga. I want to thank Charlaine Harris for staying true to herself and the fabulous characters she created.  I loved Eric too and his hotness but Sam was always in her corner. Like the books, life is unpredictable, and rarely do we get what we want. We get what we need. Just like Sookie - Sam is just what she needs.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Wonderfully interesting. Tina's writing style is as if she were talking to you.  Immensely funny too. An unmitigated delightful read!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I have all Temple Runs and they are amazing.I can't choose my favorite Temple Run but this one is around the top of my list.
B00BHMF578|3.0|This was a good suspense story with good writing and good acting. The backgrounds, though not shot in Iran, were believable. It may have deserved an academy award, but only because it was well-crafted and acted.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I totally enjoyed this flick a lot. Great Special FX Great Cast Awesome fight scenes lots of action hoping they bring out a sequill to this one.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I bought the app and it took FOREVER and it said download fail,again,again,again,again, and again! DON'T GET! DON'T GET! DON'T GET!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Why can we not play this game to any fruition without paying money for objects? or is there something missing in my understan ding?
B00138EVJO|5.0|Follows the evolution of both the music and the artist.  Brings back memories for older listeners and presents an historic treasure  for younger listeners.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It keeps me alert to the status of my power supply. I would highly recommend it. It poops every time I boot up.
B004HD61KE|3.0|Lots of historical tie-ins, action, cutting edge science, mystery and bigger than life characters. Although many of the scenarios seem a little too contrived, the story is nevertheless interesting and entertaining.  With almost seven hundred pages, this novel will keep your escapism going for some time.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|Loved these shows when I was a kid and still can sit down and watch them and enjoy every second of crazy fun horror they produce.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The pictures are top quality!  I find it hard to stop...addictive and such a pleasure to see the final picture. The colors are true to life. A fun app!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This movie was very good with a great plot.  What made it even better was the twists and turns. I could not see the ending coming until the very moment the movie revealed its final plot twist.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|A very fine representation of the talents of Woody Allen.  It's amazing how he commands the screen with wit and under-stated presence.  And Diane Keaton is a treasure to watch.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|If NBC cancels this, I am going to be REALLY irritated.  One of the best shows on TV right now.
B000002AH7|2.0|It was highly recommended but has aged very much and is too slow.  I think it appeals to those who heard it when it was new.
B005T86J0I|5.0|Who knew that, that Arogant Dr. House aka Hugh Laurie had so much talent this guy is amazing not only an actor but his musical talents and singing is totally unbelieveable. Hope he continues making music.
B006M4F67A|4.0|A nicely presented game of mahjong the tile designs are attractive and the various layouts and formats are a pleasure to work with. All in all a worthy purchase and as a freebie an absolute bargain.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I love this game. Easy to play a quick game. The animations of the hang man are great and love to watch them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  I only started watching it a few months ago.  I caught Season 1 & 2 on demand. I can't wait for Season 4!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 7th graders have been writing book reviews on this book for years and i finally decided to read it.  It is an easy read.  The plot moves along and makes sense (and it easy to follow).  It has mythology, battles, a young whippersnapper and his side-kicks as the heroes.  I can see what they enjoy about this book.  I highly recommend it to the 5th-9th graders (and any adults who enjoy reading young adult fiction).  Glad i finally picked it up.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Never tire of watching this and soaking up the wonderful music...timeless.  The beautiful melodies and meaningful lyrics make a fine package for sure.
B00417HUV0|5.0|It doesn't seem like this was ever a very popular cd by Twisted Sister but I have always liked it. It has some great catchy 80s up beat Hair Metal Riffs and some pretty cool songs that for some reason just didn't get the airplay that it deserved.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's I nice game the only small problem I have is it slowly loads coins to put In so that's why I give it 4 and  a half
B004J64QR4|1.0|I have not even watched this video! I bought this disk with the idea that I was going to receive a DVD in the mail! I do not and will not buy movies from Amazon so I can watch them on a computer. When I buy a disk to add to my collection, I expect to receive a disk not a download/streaming option!!
0307387178|3.0|This book is about two chapters too long. It's very annoying when someone writes a book and can't help but dedicating a couple of chapters to themselves. I found the same thing in \\"The Last Dive\\" by Bernie Chowdury. He just couldn't stop talking about himself. It seems instead of getting some training with some good survival skills and preparing to survive, Christopher McCandless instead prepared to play Magiver and prepared to improvise. Simple things like a topo map, compass and better training could have prevented his death. As for the book, a lot of conjecture, opinions, just like my opinion in this review.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoy playing Mahjong and this particular app has so many variations of patterns to play the fun is endless.  If you enjoy Mahjong, this is an app you should have!
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|TERRIFIC BASEBALL FLICK -it was just an all around fun movie to watch.it brought me laughter and smiles.with team work you can accomplish anything.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|I love having the whole collection of my favorite British Comedy ever! It includes some extras like outtakes, commentary, and interviews. The packaging is sturdy and I have no regrets or complaints.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great!! I babysit a 9 year old and a three year old and they love it! I just wish it was easier to get diamonds
0517548232|5.0|I am currently reading this book. Easy read. Teaches you to stretch your common sense a tad and put your grey matter into motion. This is a good book for all Americans to read--all ages, and especially those leading our nation.  Would help get everyone on the same page.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love all the apps that require you to find objects and solve puzzles using those found objects (for example: find a box that is locked and you need to find the key in order to open it.  The key is hidden in a book, or somewhere else.  In this game there is an added detail: there are clues hidden that can only be seen if you are 'wearing' the magic monocle. This is the most challenging of all the similar apps I've tried. Definitely worth it if you like this kind of puzzle... I love it -
B00571F26Y|5.0|Why for almost all of us we need to be aware what wheat consumption is doing to us in a negative way to our health and the health of our children.  Read this book and change your diet, you will feel better for it.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I enjoyed this romantic film very much.  It was a feel good movie, but also had lots of twists I didn't see coming, especially the ending.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I didn't have high expectations for this book, because the author seemed to stop caring about her characters a few books back. But the story was adequate, if a bit far fetched. Johan Glassport would never consider working with anyone, for instance, and a psychopath like him wouldn't care that his employer were gay as long as he got paid. The appearance of Quinn was superfluous, and it made no sense to ban Sookie from Fangtasia after Eric was gone.  The relationship with Sam left me scratching my head, but okay, fine.  It certainly represents a significant conflict of interest in their business partnership, but that probably would have occurred to anyone but Eric and I.<br /><br />Overall, I was not very excited about this book after I finished. I don't feel as though there was actually any sort of conclusion, Also so that I could say goodbye and move on.  Also, it is likely that I will completely forget this book in a couple of days, because it just wasn't that memorable. Kind of sad to send off Sookie in such a boring manner.
B0042XA2U4|5.0|This book made me laugh, smile, and cry just like all good books should. Way better than the already great movie.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved this whole series.  I thought it was wonderfully written and detailed a very intricate world created by the author.  I would recommend this whole series without reservation!
B001F4UHEE|5.0|One of my favorite Kevin spacey movies. He plays the role of a man going through a mid life crisis but the story line is thought provoking and it is beautifully made. The cover looks more risqu&eacute; than the movie is. Don't get me wrong I don't recommend this movie for the under 17 crowd but they wouldn't sit through it anyway. This is one of the best movies I've seen and I've seen it several times it covers a range of subjects that are very topical in our lives. Well done!
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|I saw Oz: The Great and Powerful and had high expectations. As far as effects go it exceeded, this movie is beautifully stunning with the visuals and the sets but in terms of acting, it was a little bit of a let down. James Franco, played an okay Oz, a dubious, ladies man who isn't taken very seriously because he is not a man yet. Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz play out great in their part, then again one is an Academy Award Winner and the other has been nominated several times. Not saying their performances are Oscar Worthy, because this is a studio film. But Michelle and Rachel, were great. Especially Michelle, making the bubbly and graceful Glinda her own. And Rachel, I must say...stole the show, as the conniving and manipulative sister Evanora! Mila Kunis, however, is the reason this movie receives a 3 out of 5 stars. People said she was a \\"miscast\\" and I didn't want to believe it at first but then when I saw the movie. I believed it! She played Theodora great in the beginning as a beautiful, sweet, and naive witch but as her story progresses, it just flops from there making the film experience a little silly. And at a certain point, she just can't shed a single tear. It was bad, it was silly, and I usually like to feel what the actor is feeling but I remained emotionless for her. I don't want to spoil it, but I was laughing at her and not taking herself too seriously as an actress, and at some point I hated her for being in this. Which is hard for me to say because I love Mila, I've always loved her as an actress. She usually plays cute and adorable roles, this one was outside her box a little and let's just say she isn't ready. At least, not this material. I will consider the fact that she tried to make it her own and she did but their was something so good and terrifying about the original that makes it classic.<br /><br />Obviously, the original is way better! But try not to compare the story or the plot to the original because it's not the same. This isa prequel to what we loved to watch many years ago! I liked it well enough to enjoy it, it had it's flaws but I think the moral of the story is what makes it \\"not suck\\" all the way. (C+/B-)
1476715904|5.0|The Short of It:<br />Are you ready for layers packed upon layers of yummy reading goodness? I certainly was!<br /><br />Ah, Layken or Lake if you're Will. Sad and uprooted after her father's death, she finds herself in Michigan. Now, I'm telling you, I'm a Texas girl myself, and how any good Texas mother could drag her baby to Michigan is beyond me. When I first read this, I was horrified. Literally. I mean, I love all you peeps from Michigan, but this is Texas! Okay, so I eventually understand her mother's motives, but I would be just a little pouty if I were forced to move anywhere but the Carribean, or a secluded island. But Layken's really not that pouty. Sure she's sad because not only has she lost her father, but she's being transplanted to another state at the start of her senior year! She's making the best of it for her mother and her little brother, Kel.<br /><br />Then there's the boy next door, Will. I mean isn't there always? Except he's not. He's not the typical bad-boy next door, he's not even the good-boy next door. He's the stranger from across the street who's had a tragedy of his own and  now instead of playing college football he's raising his little brother, Caulder, while attending college and working an internship. He's a busy boy, without no time for a relationship. Until he notices the cute girl sitting behind the steering wheel of the U-Haul truck across the street who stops sulking long enough to play Zombie with her little brother and his newly made friend.<br /><br />I wish I could say things were that simple, in this book or in life generally. Lake and Will have a chance for one single date before everything changes. Lake and Will, the two people who need each other the most, aren't allowed to be together. Not because of those pesky parents, or even age ranges, but because Will can't afford to lose his internship and Layken can't stop going to school. She's made a couple of friends, but no one like Will.<br /><br />Layken's heartache doesn't stop at Will, but I'll go no further with the storyline as there is so much left to tell, and so much a reader should not experience through one blogger's eyes.<br /><br />My Overall Opinion:<br />In all honesty, my summary sucks. I can't do this book justice without going into a ten page essay on it's merits. Overall, I'd call the theme edgy, but not necessarily dark. Two families are negotiating their way through the most un-perfect storm the only way they know how. One day at a time.<br /><br />Layken's mom is a doll. And an exceptionally smart woman. Reading this book as a mother has given me wisdom when dealing with children. \\"let them carve pumpkins when they need to\\" (that one you'll need to read the book to understand, and \\"while you must choose the battles you pick with your children, it's important not to pick that many.\\"<br /><br />I love the culture of poetry slamming, I love that this book shows strong male characters hitting back at the world with their words in a civilized manner. And the Avett Brothers? Has anyone ever seen them in concert? I haven't, but my sister has and she told me how amazing they were. I looked up a few videos on YouTube and became enthralled with their enthusiasm. Watching them play, even on my laptop, is exhilarating. But to read their lyrics, to understand them in reference to Slammed gave me a complete different appreciation for them. Eventually Will refers to them as philosophers and I'm not too sure he's wrong.<br /><br />And Finally:<br />Now, if my words are not a straight out endorsement of Slammed, perhaps you'll read a few other reviews or just pick up the book, because there's just so much greatness packed inside. The characters are amazingly strong, even during their weakest moments. They're funny and upbeat, tragic and sad, but mostly, they are inspiring.<br /><br />In the end, when the tears were cried, and the giggles laughed, life felt lighter and I breathed easier.<br /><br />Until...I started Point of Retreat (Slammed #2)<br /><br />*I have never met or conversed with this author formally or informally.

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Great Music, Great Songs. Didn´t expect to hear from Kiefer nor Cinderella but The Way Life Goes is an amazing surprise. Buy it if you are a Rock fan.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I've noticed a lot of reviews stating this is a demo or other game that requires a purchase of $2.99, $3.99, or even $5.99 after the initial purchase. In the deluxe edition, it seems as though there are 12 restaurants already unlocked. When I went to the screen displaying the restaurants, I see restaurants unlocked is 12/12. Now, since so many people have reported a requirement for pay, this may be due to the idea that today is the FAOTD. However, the description seems to suggest the deluxe edition does include more restaurants.<br /><br />At least for today, though, I have not run into any request or money. All 12 of the restaurants are unlocked and I was able to go past level 5 and still play. There was no request to pay for more levels.<br /><br />Because I'm not sure if this is a FAOTD allotment or if it is for every day, I'm giving it 4 stars. If the developers are able to let us know if the game does not normally require additional purchases for levels or restaurants, then I'll be happy to add 1 more star.<br /><br />This is a great time management game where you are Flo, a diner waitress. You seat customers, fill orders, clean dishes. As customers are taken care of quickly, they pay bigger tips. Those really satisfied will order dessert, too. Those not satisfied will leave. Your goal is to make everyone happy to get as much money in eac level as possible. There is another challenge level where your goal is also to make as much money as possible, but you do not go through levels. It is similar to old video games in arcades where you play the same screen over and over again, with the difficulty increasing as time goes on. Your goal is to play as long as possible by not irritating 5 customers enough to leave. Once you do this, your challenge ends. I played this but I really prefer to progress through levels. I also had trouble at first even recognizing that one customer was ordering eggs. The image looked like lemon cookies. Playing through the levels would likely have solved that issue.<br /><br />I really like this time management game, and am glad to see all of the restaurants & levels unlocked. However, if this changes, I will update my review to 2 stars total.<br />**************Edited 6/3/2013**************<br />I had issues with my Kindle Fire HD and had to remove the account, then reload my files and apps from the cloud. This is a game my kids and I had managed to get rather far in. We were expecting to be able to go back to playing in the last restaurant we were in, but that is not what happened. The game downloaded the latest version- which includes only 6 of the restaurants. To get the rest, there is an additional $3.99 fee. Too bad. I really thought the developers had figured out a paid app does not need to have its levels require additional fees.<br /><br />So, everyone stating they had to pay to get the levels is absolutely correct. As I stated previously, since I learned the other levels are not free, I'm downgrading the stars and updating the review. Too bad. It was a fun game for several in the family.
0739368044|4.0|Can't wait for the four installment. I know it is out in print, but with all the driving I do, I need the CD. Eragon is very captivating and the story is fun for all ages.
B003NB8KE6|4.0|I would aim for a smaller size than expected. These things can stretch. The tighter they are the more compression you'll get too. Great buy!
B009PMB3CI|5.0|My daughter enjoys it and has played it for a bit. She did note that that the instructions were a little thin - but she figured it out.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Awesome. Excellent end to an excellent series. This book unlike the series doesn't drag in the middle. Action all the way down.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I like the 1st part and the writing was cute and I was intrigued to see how it unfolded.  After that, the writing became extremely repetitive and also the 'sex' scenes became more & more uninteresting because of the repeated usage of the same words.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|What a marvelous tale!!<br />I was fascinated with how much I learned from this book. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who asks.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Wonderful to have his new album. Remember his in the 70&#34;s in the Bay Area. Always great!!! Hope he has more to come in the near future.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Bought this for my brother at Christmas and it was the perfect present.  Loved the series so I wanted to share.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|Funny enough movie for a young teenage crowd.  Some silly dumb puns and jokes on Star Wars.  Overall quite enjoyable and still amused us parents.
1934030597|5.0|My family is fortunate to own seven bikes including two very nice high end dual suspension carbon fiber mountain bikes and I am at about the advanced home mechanic level of expertise.  I clean, rebuild or install my own headsets, bottom brackets, hub bearings, disk brakes and fork internals. I even build my own wheels occasionally.  I however, am not a shop mechanic, and I do not chase bottom brackets, weld frames or align dropouts.  With that said, I like to have as a backup to the internet, one complete reference for everyday maintenance.  The Zinn book fits that bill perfectly.<br /><br />His book covers all the basics from purchasing the right tools to basic maintenance to emergency repairs. (I like his recommended tool lists more than those covered at the Park Tools website or the lists compiled by United Bicycle Institute) He also covers roughly 99% or more of the repair procedures that any home mechanic might need to attempt.  The book even covers wheel building (which bike purists would say is holy ground), frame alignment, proper rider fit and has a decent set of torque tables. The repair procedures are broken down by difficulty in each chapter into Levels I, II and III. For example, a Level I repair would entail a procedure that a newbie mechanic could tackle (like changing a tire or adjusting a seatpost), a Level II would be something more for the home mechanic with some experience (like installing a new front derailleur) and a Level III repair would be for the advanced home mechanic or shop guru (like facing a bottom bracket).<br /><br />There are a few areas where Zinn does not go into much detail, but these tend to be rare topics that even the experienced shop mechanic is probably only going to see a few times a year.  Perhaps the only weakness of the book is that for a few of the more detailed procedures, some more photos or diagrams would be helpful.  For myself, I was fine with the amount of diagrams but I can see where a newer home mechanic might appreciate it.  I am also glad he tends to update this work about once every three to five years.  Will be waiting for the next release, and a great guide for more than 99% of home mechanics. Five starsalso glad he tends to update this work about once every three to five years.  Will be waiting for the next release, and a great guide for more than 99% of home mechanics. Five stars
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wasn't expecting literary genius but I was expecting better writing than repeated usage of the same adjectives, phrases & conversations over & over again.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book got me hooked on the entire series.  Love the action, descriptions and plots! Ready to start the next!
6305132984|5.0|So much fun to see this again and again. Brings back memories from the 50's. Introduced it to younger friends who had no idea what it was all about. Those youngsters are too into their Sci-Fi stuff.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|If you love JT (I do) then I think you'll like this album.  It's not nearly as danceable as his last 2 but I really enjoy the songs.  Each song is pretty long (about 7-8 minutes); each one is pretty much 2 songs.  They start one way and become something else.  I'm not sure everyone likes that but I'm fine with it.  I also really like that the CD looks like a mini vinyl album - pretty creative packaging in my opinion.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Had a great time with this film.  From the very beginning Christof Waltz kills it.  Much like Inglorious Bastards the movie keeps you entranced from the first moment.
B00C1S945G|5.0|The fact that I can watch these episodes I've and over gives me great pleasure as I didn't watch them when they first aired. Guilty pleasure....Make it so!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I wasn't expecting literary genius but I was expecting better writing than repeated usage of the same adjectives, phrases & conversations over & over again.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|If you loved Option Paralysis, you'll enjoy this album. If you're more of an old school Dillinger Fan and less of a Option Paralysis fan, don't bother.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Recommend this to anyone who loves a great love story.  It's full of emotion, obviously great intense sex and you truly get caught up in the characters.  When Fifty Shades first came out, I thought it was porn with no story.  I was way wrong.  Absolutely love this book.  Can't wait to start on book 3.
193700788X|5.0|This was a great series.  Some books I liked more than others, but they were all a good read.  Charlaine Harris may not have ended the series the way some folks wanted, but she was true to Sookie and tied up the loose ends.  If you haven't read the series, read it in order.  It's worth it.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|brilliant, emotional and thought provoking.  it's  rare  that  you  discover a  film  on an  airplane  that you  are  totally  absorbed  with  and your  attitude  to  situations  and  people  changes.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this album. Every song is so well-composed. The lyrics are amazing and complex. There is an eerie, beautiful, quiet mood about in these songs, and I have loved the progression from each album to the next.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good movie even better book. Good twist to the story line. There is life after the pain. U can learn to love again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me guessing, kept surprising me! Flynn plays with the reader's thoughts and emotions, and completes the story with a shocking yet satisfying ending. Loved this book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is one of the funnest city games I have played...always a new mission and you get money really fast. I definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes these types of games.
1439153663|5.0|A must read.  A slave narrative with the inclusion of a white indentured servant who transforms to become part of both worlds.  Excellent.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great park  building game, but the only downside it needs much patience and focus. Money and resources need time management which is where the games skill aspect is at.
0375831002|5.0|It's a great boo for all ages. I am a prolific reader and I appeciate the love of books, especialoly in this case.
B00ABT39MG|5.0|Awesome! Must own for a true Rammstein Fan. The CD only has 5 songs but they're really good. Overall this was a great buy and a great add to my Rammstein collection. Rammstein für immer! R+
1433209551|2.0|There is a reason we don't read Jane Austin anymore:The CULTURE has changed (in every demographic).<br />Unless your English teacher is trying to drum vocabulary words into you and show you how the English language was once used to write novels...skip this book. Read a chapter for amusement or torture--your choice.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Really enjoying this game! Makes for a great way to dispose of some boredom and gives you plenty of goals to work toward.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Convoluted, lots of junk to sift through in order to follow this ho-hum tale of corruption. The characters were sloppily written and I could care less about all of them. Honestly, this was a poorly executed attempt at an overplayed story line
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Usually Nicholas Spark films are depressing to me so I stay away from them. People groaned when the twist at the end was revealed, but I liked it. I will probably buy this on BluRay
B002M87W9K|5.0|This is a movie for all ages.  What's not to like?  I saw it when I was younger and have always loved it so when I saw it available for sale I had to buy it for my grandkids!  There is music, family values, lessons to be learned, comedy....
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Oh Yeah! This movie kept my attention the whole time and the plot was good. I liked the car chases!
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I liked the way the app worked at first but then it began giving me problems. I was unable to pull it up even after cutting my kindle off and everything.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang and other helpers have done so well on making this game so interesting because first it was on the computer then Xbox360 now touch screen devices. I tell you they are the best for fixing my bordom when I go places.  :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Had to watch because of all the books & older Hobbit movies.  Very good entertaining movie that was watched over & over
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This was a fun movie. Kind of a typical Tom Cruise action film, but it had some witty lines in it. We all enjoyed it
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Lincoln was just ok for me.  Of course it was not some big action adventure movie.  And I didn't expect it to be.  It was about his life and the problems he encountered trying to get others to agree with him on the slave issues.<br />It would be a great movie for someone who is very much into historical movies.<br />I also saw J Edgar and in my opinion it was more interesting and held my attention better.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and the car chases were good. It's what you come to expect with the Fast N Furious franchise.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|This is one film that holds up, even decades after it's initial screening.  The FX work, the plot's exciting... Just good old fashioned fun and wonder, wrapped up in the best effects of ILM.  Spielberg at his best!
B0035G04TI|5.0|This is such a great book to apply to any close family member or friend, not just a spouse! It makes you understand and look at those you love on a whole other level, plus it helps you to understand what you need yourself to feel fulfilled.
B009AMANBA|5.0|very entertaining & learned much more about President Lincoln than I thought I knew.  Very good story keeps your attention
B00BESLT6G|3.0|It was not as good as the first one. It was just okay. However I have friends who really like it. I guess I just was expecting more.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|These guys are awesome! I'm so glad they released a second CD. I hope they do a third one sooon!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My four year old daughter saw this movie for the first time and LOVED it!  It really is one of the great movies, enjoyable for adults as well as children.
B000KJZWMW|3.0|Finally saw Road Warrior.  Okay - to be truthful: the characters weren't particularly deep, or the car crashes particularly amazing.  For its time, it was probably far better than seeing it in 2013.  So - it's okay.  But unless you're already a fan, I wouldn't over recommend it.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|makes wiring receiver very easy just plug in appropriate terminals and play. Will purchase more to wire other receiver and speakers
B00947N6D8|4.0|Purchesed for my 8 yr old son for easter, very entertaining & have watched it twice since we got it
B00B19F3PG|3.0|I confess I only watched this because my daughter wanted to and I like Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was okay. It has been a very long time since I have seen a suspense, horror film that was really good.
1442359315|5.0|Fascinating story a bit dense and detailed in places, glad I got the cd version. Explained a lot about the afterlife, the reason for the existence of evil and left me feeling more aware of God's love for me and every person<br />And more secure in my own faith
B0014JKJHK|5.0|It is a quality product and its price is very affordable. Soon I come back to buy another pair for my daughters. I recommend it without any fear of contradiction
B000002GC2|5.0|My former husband purchased this on 8 track WOW, it has brought back so many memories I had to turn it off so I would not become too nostalgic.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It was a good movie to watch with my wife. We enjoyed it as a movie on a night that we just wanted to unwind.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!  My husband actually wanted it, i thought it would be boring but Loved it & how he put his faith in GOD!!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I was expecting so much more out of this movie. I was really enjoying it until a little over half way through and then they kind of dropped the ball. It was just okay for me but I am sure the teenagers will like it.
B008K7PS1Q|5.0|Fabulous debut album  by singer Lou Doillon, daughter of Jane Birkin and sister of Charlotte Gainsbourg.<br />A stunning cd that is well worth buying. You won't be disappointed. Every track is strong with ICU and Places being the stand-outs.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I knew when I bought this book that it wouldn't end like I hoped.  However much I'd hoped for a different ending, it was still an entertaining read.  I've loved Sookie, Bill, Eric, Jason, Tara, Sam from the beginning.  Yes, I was disappointed in how Eric was written off, and how Sookie had to break with the gang at Fangtasia.  I was just as sad to lose Pam and the gang in Shreveport.  I kind of thought that Sookie would end up with Bill, but I'm OK with how it ended up instead.  Odd, yes, but OK.<br /><br />So, without giving away too much, I will say that this book was a bit of a disappointment in how it ended, BUT it was at least an ending.  It wasn't what I would have chosen for Sookie, BUT, it worked.  Disappointed?  Yes.  Pissed off mad like most everyone else?  Not really.  I hope down the road we'll get a short story or two with our gang in louisianna!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Can't stop playing this one.  It is an old favorite born again.  It challenges me and the more sleepy I get the less well I do! Do Love it and play most nights
B00B22IJXK|3.0|But if you're going to try anyway this will work.  It's not bad. but it isn't great either. Have fun.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Just wow!  There is nothing missing in this. You want to move on to the next book right away. Can't wait to start
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I hate having to buy coins to play a game on my Kindle.  I have uninstalled it and will not buy this type of App again.
0345536886|5.0|This is my first John Grisham novel I've ever read and let me just say, I started off on a great one. The amount of details in this book are simply amazing. Mr. Grisham knows how to fill his characters without losing the interest of the reader. By the end of the book, I felt like I could predict or at least fully understand the actions of the main characters.<br /><br />Synopsis- David Zinc was tired of the long hours at a major law firm where he ate lunch at his desk and often did not leave until after 10PM. He needed a break after suffering a meltdown on his normal routine into the office. He frequents a local pub near his previous employer, drinking himself to near oblivion. When he is finally cut off, the bartender sends him home in a taxi. However, fate had a different plan for Mr. Zinc. He sees a sign on a bus (or bench, I forget which) for the lawfirm of Finley and Figgs. Wanting a change, he stumbles in completely drunk and offers his services to the small time, ambulance chasing lawyers.<br /><br />After initial hesitation, the three men join forces for the biggest cases any of them have ever tried, which doesn't take much, a law suit again a major drug company. After ALL of the facts don't go their way, they are left with a case that has no chance to win. To make matters worse, both of David's partners are unable to try the case for one reason or another, leaving him as the sole attorney against an onslaught of high priced attorneys. Despite the odds, he tries the case as best as he can with the limited resources he has available. The end of the book is quite sad, but not because of the case outcome. Rather, the death of a secondary character that almost didn't have a chance to begin with (I don't want to spoil it).
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is by far my favorite app on my kindle fire (even better than all my games!)  because I can watch all my favorite videos from Youtube even when I don't have Wi-Fi!! Brilliant! I was especially happy I got the app when a channel I liked got deleted from the web ... but my favorite vids were safely stored in my gallery! Definitely suggest it.
B00C0W08XK|2.0|perhaps it was just the setup of the game...  just couldn't warm to it.  I usually LOVE Sudoku  so feel a bit let down
B00BC24NT4|1.0|I have read all of John le Carre's books and I wish I could get my money back. This is a joke on all of his fans.
B006H5120E|4.0|Even though I would have preferred a digipack, or digibook, or steelbook edition (like the old 4-disc DVDs), this is a great purchase. Not that this is bad, it's just that I don't like the blue plastic boxes. Personal taste...<br />The image and sound are simply perfect. The extra features too. Good purchase.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book, only took me a few days to complete. Remembering all the traps and problems we had while running our IT company back in 1997 !
0553801473|5.0|The entire ice and fire series is our generations tolkien. George R R Martin may surpass tolkien if his last 2 books are like his first 5.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great time playing, time passes so fast when playing this product, as good or better than other angry birds products.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|the kindle itself doesn't have great photo quality, so was hoping this is better, it seems to be what little i have use it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is awesome.  Dramatic, well acted, and Maggie Smith is a gem!!!  Hope this series continues for a long time!
B005JZBP8W|5.0|So happy to have this in Blu Ray, this has been my favorite musical for over 20 years. Can't wait to watch it.
B00B935SUY|4.0|My Two cents:<br />Very cool.. but it  has a bit of Dave Grohl love fest thing  at the end.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong .. he is ausom!  realy.. its just a odd feeling to watch a movie about a place/time/thing & then have it  last quarter be kind about Dave Grohl's braging right around the mixing board & how cool he is now , sence he owns it.<br /><br />Having said that .. if you like music.. watch it!! It is total worth it!! i wich i saw it  on eth big screen. :)
0345529057|5.0|If you enjoy fantasy or any good story buy these they are a must read for everyone. One of the best book series I have ever read.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|So glad they finally released this for Kindle...fantastic graphics, challenging but not impossible puzzles...over way too soon. Can't wait for the next one!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show pulls no punches! it puts you right in the middle of the action. The characters are all believable,the villains as well as the heroes.
B00CELB98U|1.0|Great song, but what's the point of releasing CD singles if more mixes aren't included? iTunes has six other mixes that aren't on this disc. With the slow death of physical product,you'd think labels would want to make purchasing as enticing as possible. A wasted opportunity.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Greatest show ion TV! The twists and turns and plots are awesome!!!! We are addicted to this show and it is so easy to get on Amazon!
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Great vocals, tasty guitar work, beautiful tone, tight musicianship, nice songwriting and arranging. Well worth listening to. A good buy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addicting.  Only con is that power chips and keys are used up faster than bongo chips.  Play specialty rooms for faster chips and power ups.
0061743526|4.0|Sometimes it's hard to write a book that kids can read, and still make it real and exciting for adults, but I believe Lee has done just that.  This book can be read as a simple childhood story, a love story, even, but I see it as much more than that.  It gives a basis for our lives and what we believe in.<br /><br />Anger and prejudice are stirred up in town, and Scout, only eight years old, is caught in the middle of it.  She doesn't know who to believe, except for one person: her father.  When Atticus is called on to defend the accused of a rape case, she sees that he is willing to stand up for the truth, even when people hate him for it.  It sets an example for all people, young and old, that there's some good left in the world, and it's worth fighting for.<br /><br />Yet truth and justice don't always triumph, and people sometiems kill the mockingbird that lived only to sing for them.  They hate anyone that doesn't see things the way they do.  Hopefully this book will show us how to change our world for the better, and teach us that love for our family--and sometimes even for those we don't understand--can change even the hardest hate.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the contrast and conflict between the small burg and the village. Very delightful to watch. cant wait for the next episode!!
193700788X|5.0|I am sad that it is over. I enjoyed this one just as much as the rest! I am very happy with who she ended up with. It was not a surprise. Now I will have to read them over again!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game and beautifully done. It runs wonderfully on the kindle fire. I have to say that I do love the G5 games and this one lived up to standards.
0393976041|5.0|I enjoy Norton critical editions because they give so much attention to the critical tradition and to the textual scholarship. Great book!
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Many great recommendations to read this...waiting for my summer reading once school is out.  So much to read and so little time.
0439023521|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book, and I wasn't disappointed either. I picked up the book the next day and couldn't put it down! It was a good fast read that kept me wanting more! Once I finished I picked up Catching Fire (the next book) within five minutes.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've used them all and this is the most accurate,in depth weather app out there. I love the hourly temps,wind speed,activity weather,ect. Would highly recommend.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a total must read...rawer than fifty shades...and more graphically hot...Day writes beautifully...well fleshed  out plot and scenes...you have to buy this book!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A great strategy game with a fresh concept. This is not an easy game and will keep you challenged. There is a high replay value as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I still haven't read this book yet but it was delivered quickly and It has very good reviews I will review again once im done reading it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Not quite as stuck in my seat as the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, but a good movie.  Looking forward to the rest.
B009R659L8|2.0|I usually am so hooked into MHC that I read the book into the wee small hours. Not this time. First, I figured out the villain within the first two chapters. Then there were the sub-stories--not up to her usual interestingly plotted. I am still a MHC fan but am waiting for her next to decide if she has lost it.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I felt like it started off funny then went downhill from there. I was disappointed and expected it to be better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book...the first one too...so hot in general....so amazingly well written..poetic at times...what a hot relationship ....a must read ....you have to buy it....
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I often rate movies by the fact that I don't fall asleep watching them. This one kept my attention and the scenes seemed realistic and gave a good feeling for actually being trapped in a tsunami like that.  The effects were pretty good. It was totally believable and at least one family had a happy ending.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|This will be a skimpy review.<br />In my opinion, Prometheus is visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.  I've seen it a few times now.  The first time I saw it, I found myself thinking about it for the next 48 hours, trying to puzzle it out.  Sure it is over the top at a couple of points, but not enough to detract anything.  It is tense, scary, smart, adventurous, and very well done.  One of my favorites.
B005LAII80|3.0|Better than Stallone's Dredd, I reckon.  Nice and violent, but some of the effects were wishy washy.  One of these days they may do it justice.
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|Does a good job converting but should have an option to replace or delete converted file. Could auto add to amazon music folder. Could add to play list. A mass convert would be good. Maybe a split screen drag and drop with navigate at the top.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well executed and unpredictable.  It was very hard to put down.  My friends all agree with me on this one.  A winner!!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I hate that this series has run its course, but I do think Ms. Harris did a fine job concluding it.  The writing really was on the wall from the last book so there was not any surprise. A little predictable? Yes.  A little light on plot? Yes. But not terrible considering the quirkiness of this series as a whole.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I agree with so many of the other comments. The writing went down hill and with this last book, it was like she wanted to just hurry up and be finished with the series and to hell with her fan base. The last 2 books left a bad taste and a serious disappointment in what used to be a good read.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|it is cute, but been done a million times over. Got it because of the actors, so my expectations were a bit higher than what was delivered.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Very interesting movie. Tries to answer the paradox about going back in time to kill your grandfather. (If you do, you're not born to do it)  Ok, not that particular question, but close.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|We normally play the real game at fairs and lose money cause it is addictive. Love that this app is free and is like the real thing, plus not losing money. Well you could if you bought more coins to play with. Number 1 in all my apps.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the series. Movie followed the first book very well. The characters came to life. If u were hooked on the books. Enjoy the movie. Looking foreword to the next movie.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love the book, so I've pretty much gone out of my way to see every version of Jane Eyre there is.  Trust me, there are some really wretched versions (especially the newest).  This is great.  Ruth Wilson is the walking image of Jane Eyre - odd looking, dark, but bewitching in her stare.  And brilliant.  Toby Stephens perfectly portrays Rochester with his suave little smirk and swagger yet conflicted and tortured personality.  And the setting....amazing.  I honestly don't think a video version of Jane Eyre could get any better than this.
0525478817|5.0|WOW this book is phenomenal. It was well-developed, heart wrenching, and utteringly beautiful. I loved the morbid humor and the beautiful love story that has a bittersweet ending. This book shows a perfect concept of the way people with cancer think and feel. It brings up many things such as sick people getting preferential treatment, getting treated like they aren't normal, and it shows just how normal and human they are. The characters in this book were awesome. They fight and cry and live better than any nonsick person and they do it with a morbid sense of humor. This book had me riveted from the very first chapter and it had me bawling by the end. Get ready for a roller coaster of emotion if you read this book.<br /><br />This book is about a 16 year old girl named Hazel that has lung cancer. While at a Support Group she meets her boyfriend Augustus Waters. He is charming, funny, smart, and good-looking. He is there supporting his friend Isaac. Hazel and Augustus become close so fast but instead of turning me off to the story like this usually would Green does it in a way that makes it believable. These kids are dying or are survivors of disease. They are not going to take anything in life for granted. So the fast paced romance makes sense.<br /><br />I love Hazel and Augustus' characters. They were beautifully and tragically written. I loved their humor, their view of life as they talked about wanting the universe to notice them. I loved their bittersweet love and romance. I love how charming and funny Augustus is. I wish I had a boyfriend like him. I find Hazel a perfect match for him. She is witty, smart, and has the same sense of humor.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Just love this show! so great to be able to watch a whole season without interruption. each episode totally keeps my attention from beginning to end. acting and writing are just great!
B005LAIISA|3.0|These have been a very funny series, but they seem to be running out of family funnies.  Time to quit before they get bad.
0143039601|5.0|One of the best by Jack Kerouac... it'll make you want to put on a rucksack and head for a nice spot to meditate...
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It works well. It has many features you might expect out of a notebook. My biggest complaints are that it functions more like a word program so it can be hard to make casual notes. The writing by touch system is weird, so usually I have to use the keyboard.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Great show, includes some songs that I haven't seen on the other discs such as Killers and The Prisoner.<br />They play all the hits from the 7th Son era such as Clairvoyant and Heaven Can Wait.  Only problems I have are that it isn't on Blu Ray, and the sound mix from time to time just seemed off.  A reason a Blu Ray version wasn't released is because of how old the footage is, I may not have been much of an improvement.  Also, it is in 4:3 ratio.
193700788X|1.0|This is by far the worst book in the series, which is unfortunate considering it was supposed to be our final farewell to Sookie. Ah Sookie... I rooted for you for 12 books. I watched you come to terms with your \\"disability\\". I cried with you when your heart was broken. I rejoiced with you in every victory you accomplished. I laughed out loud because of your sass and spunk. Then, I watched the complete and total destruction of my favorite character in this story. I could list the many inconsistencies and weakly woven plot, But I feel that would be \\"beating a dead horse\\". Of course I am also upset about the ending. Not because of who you seemingly end up with Sookie, but the HOW! I really don't need to go on. Like I said. One star is too much! Save your money!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Extremely interesting, and exciting. I love it... I can't wait for the rest. I am so excited to watch it everyday. Please keep the series going.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What more is there to say? How about Director's Cuts?  No, these ain't them, just wishing.  I wanted the Blu-ray and got tired of waiting.  Let's see if Paramount does what Lucas did with Star Wars and re-release better issues at a trickle.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|Made in Germany, high quality solid wood blocks! We love them! No rough edges and solid wood makes for great non toxic fun for all ages!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|What else is there to say. It preforms basic functions a calculator might. I wish it could do more advanced functions, it's slightly below my Windows 7 Calculator program, but it works OK.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the fact that it is relatively fast moving soap. All characters have been well developed with lots of twists and turns in their lives. This, coupled with the characteristic British understatement and wit embedded in the dialogues makes this show one of my favourites!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Always a big fan!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Loved these movies as a kid and probably haven't seen the first one in I don't know how many years.  Decided to buy it and bought the trilogy and watched all three in probably as many days and they really brought me back to my childhood.  Can't wait to watch these again.  A must have for any Jurassic Park fan, kid or adult.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene and company have created an inspiring Jesus experience...anyone who loves Christian contemporary music or would like to experience a worship dvd like no other...must see and listen.<br />Her God given talents are put to the best use and I hope will inspire others to share this with all their friends and the curious !!!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The movie was very entertaining. Alot of shooting and killing and a couple of funny moments, which was unexpected. Would not want kids to watch this movie. Alot of blood
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Everything is just moving from one tutorial to the next while pushing pay options which you can somewhat disable. Ultimately the game isn't very interesting and it's even difficult to close. I sometimes had to force crash it because I had no idea how to get out of it.
B003B02O14|3.0|The book seems to all of a sudden bring in actions or happenings the main character did previously which now mysteriously solve a problem which arises suddenly.  It almost appears that Grisham repeatedly wrote himself into a corner and had to fabricate the main character taking a number of previous actions (unknown to the reader) in order to work his way out of it.  So, the book loses a lot of the punch and intrigue of most of his earlier novels.  I'm beginning to think Grisham is &#34;running dry&#34;.  I was really disappointed in this one.
0767802519|5.0|Great shoot em up movie, Portman when she was young did a great job, but when Jean Reno took out the neck cracking jerk of a cop out was the best.  I almost for got, the price was great!!!
B00AEBBAEU|5.0|Awesome movie, I thought it was better than No Country, and DDL is amazing in it.  On Blu-ray it is great too.  What more could you want?
B004AFFZNI|1.0|This product does not fit the Hero 3. The lens does not fit where the camera lens slot is. It is too big and the lens does not fit properly! You cant even rig it in some way because the lens is too high for the lens slot. DO NOT BUY FOR THE hero 3!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This issue different from others, symbles that I do not know made me think but it was good it did not take long to learn and win.
0143117157|5.0|i spent 1month in SA so i decided to read about Nelson. I loved it. real story and if you seen the movie you know
0385535147|3.0|This was not as interesting and as fast-moving as some of his earlier novels. It is almost as boring as his novel about the football player in Italy . . . . . . Is Grisham losing his &#34;touch&#34;?
B008QMMEOE|5.0|A great puzzle for that my 2.5 year old can do on her own! And she loves it! Celebratory balloons at the end of each puzzle is an added bonus.
B000026OW3|5.0|Bought this as an aid for study music and sleeping music (the nocturnes) and really like it.  I have listened to the nocturnes the most as I will put them on a lot real soft as I am trying to fall asleep when my mind is racing and it seems to do the trick.  Very relaxing and good for anyone to have in their collection.  Classical music makes you smarter and more relaxed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it reminds me of the frist brave game i ever played.Brave is a lot easyer  dut sudway surfers is harder I love hard games.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|This has become my son's absolute favorite toy! He started out with the crinkling feet when he was just a few weeks old and still loves to chew on the rings on the tail now that he's nearly 8 months old. It goes with him everywhere and keeps him entertained on car trips.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Very Dark (not lighting). Some dialog can be hard to fallow and some passages are hard to hear. Or am I just getting old?
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Overall this movie was a lot better than I thought it would be once I made it through the beginning. I enjoy the hidden message in this film and I would encourage anyone to watch this film. The only reason I gave it a four star is there is a lot of yelling so I had to constantly turn down the volume and some parts of the movie were slow.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the bible what is there really to say. glad I got it. I hate this part of reviewing on here. I have no more to say
0547884591|1.0|This sounded like such a great deal on the TV program it was featured on.  It turns out to be a bunch of poorly written gibberish with little or no cooking instruction.
B004R11XBS|5.0|&#34;A CAUSE CELEBRE&#34; FOR WORKERS RIGHTS. AN IMPORTANT FILM OF COURAGE REWARDED IN CONTRAST TO TODAYS DEPRIVATION OF WORKERS RIGHTS AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN. THE MOVIE IS WELL ACTED AND TRUTHFULL ABOUT HOW CORPORATIONS DISCRIMATE AGAINST WOMEN IN THE 1970S IN ENGLAND. VERY SIMILAR TO &#34;NORMA RAE&#34; WITH SALLY FIELDS.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Although interesting, it was not a dense story, it was thin. The premise of in any way finding G(g)od was particularly void.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|I like all the marvel ,series this is action packed and very entertaining, the whole family enjoys this.thankyou for putting good movies on like this.
B008Y7GSS4|4.0|I liked this movie and would have given it a five star if I was younger. The ending makes this movie different from all the other teen movies.
B0000C1733|5.0|I could not find this cd anywhere. Awesome cd! It was so easy to just order it. He loved his gift!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|It was an amazing movie!!!! I use it in my psychology class when we discuss certain personality themes especially the humanistic theory and we focus on self actualization
B000A6EXNO|5.0|This product works exactly the way Nikon said it would. You don't need to know how to read English to put this on your d700 properly. Your d700 is a precision machine & most of its parts also need precision to install. Hand tools only need common sense but machines like the d700 need common sense and a little bit of brain power. THERE'S A REASON WHY THERE'S A GROOVE ON THE RUBBER EYECUP AND IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY THE RING THAT'S INCLUDED WITH THE DK-19 HAS A LIP.THE LIP NEEDS TO GO INTO THE GROOVE PRECISELY TO STAY PUT. And please all of you reviewers out there that order the wrong parts for your camera coz you're too blind to read product descriptions and then decide to put a bad rating not because it's a bad product but you felt the need to blame someone else for your stupidity...stop it. You're making other people's businesses suffer coz of your selfishness.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Good graphics..good way to kill some time. Kid friendly. If your looking for a quick time drainer..this one is for you.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I like how marvel tells the stories and brings them too life,please send more super hero, movies our way my family really enjoy this .
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  I'm sorry I did not watch it when it was on TV.  Can't wait to watch the entire volume
193700788X|1.0|Let's face it. This series lost steam about three volumes ago. Maybe Ms. Harris gave up on her characters, ran out of creativity or inspiration. A standoff with Freyda and Felipe to fight for Eric would have been so much more interesting.  As excellent a mystery/suspense writer as Ms. Harris is, she could have taken this in so many more creative directions. And now it ends. I feel jipped, but I felt that way after the last couple of volumes in the series too. Sad.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I bought this because I really like the songs on this CD that are getting air time in my area right now.  I'm not crazy about some of the other songs that are on the CD but overall I'm still pretty happy with it.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I think it is a very fun game and I have no complaints except for that I can not access my allies bases to collect hearts. Every time I click on an ally the message failed to load allies base comes up and brings me back to the map. Please fix this it is very annoying and I cannot make many units because of it. Otherwise I love the game. :)
B0092C2X7U|4.0|It's a great game but need more characters you can unlock by doing stuff and needs more levels<br />Overall AMAZING<br />:D
B009GEPPYC|4.0|If your a child from the 80's and 90's you'll love it!! The music is great and Tom does a great job playing a washed up 80's singer, all though it was like a musical(like watching glee) you just can't stop watching till it's over, you think oh no they're gonna sing again but you cant't wait to see where they are going with it next.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I won't see this again, it was just a ok movie that miss its calling. The write had a great idea, but did nothing with it. My kids like it but were not thrilled by it.
1594744769|4.0|I enjoyed Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children. It was very unique and I absolutely loved the photos. The photos are what made this novel. I will admit that when I first heard about this novel I envisioned a completely different story and severely got my hopes up while reading. I had to take a break from the novel to clear my head before finishing it or I would have probably ended up not liking the novel since it isn't at all what I envisioned it to be. Once I cleared my head I enjoyed the ending and liked the story overall. I really think this is a great novel for those readers who read middle grade and are starting to transition over to young adult novels. Great transition book.
B000NIVJEU|2.0|Ok first of all, I'm a fan of the books (own them all on CD) but, man does this ruin a great universe. First of all, the plot is really condensed, the tone of the book is completly changed, characters are all different from the book and it doesn't do that great of a job leaving room for a sequel. Now we've seen all of this before and some of it is to be expected. However there is a vast difference between doing it because you have to and doing it because you can, this movie feels like the latter in many situations (the Razac being a great example).<br /><br />Now let's ignore the fact I like the books and take it on its own. Still sucks. We don't get perticulerly attached to the characters, it feels completly rushed, the villains aren't that menacing and the humor sort of ruins a couple scenes.<br /><br />The movie also posses what is the books biggest critique, here's the plot. The hero is a farmboy, who loses his home and uncle, discovers he can weild a strange power, is hunted down by the bad guys, rescues a princess, loses his teacher, finds a smug and troubles sidekick, finds the revolution and helps them (dispite being outnumbered) defeat the bad guys army and top assassin. NOOOOOO not a story I've heard before at all.... STAR WARS ANYONE?<br /><br />There are just two good things about this movie, the music and Jeremy Irons as Brom. Man do I hope this either gets done properly or is just left alone.

B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Jack Reacher(released Dec/12)stars,among others,Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher,Rosamund Pike as Helen Rodin,Richard Jenkins as Alex Rodin,David Oyelowo as Emerson and Werner Herzog as Zec.I found this to be an imaginative whodunit with alot of unexpected twists and turns.The film does have a tendency to over analyze on the details but over all I found it better than expected.<br />The story starts with the \\"random\\" shooting of five individuals in an open waterfront park in Pittsburgh.The perp is picked up and brought in.The only thing he will tell them is to find one Jack Reacher.They send him to a holding cell but on the way he gets beaten up by fellow prisoners and has memory loss,winding up in a hospital bed.The police look into the perps record and Reacher's.It seems the perp is an ex army sniper and Jack is an ex military MP,who has purposely dropped off Government radar.Just as the D.A. and lead detective are having a pow wow about their next move,in walks Reacher himself.The defense attorney appointed to defend the perp is there and she happens to be the D.A.'s daughter.She grabs Reacher right away and has a good talk to him about what they know so far about the case.Reacher reveals more of his military past and it seems he once tried to convict the perp of a deliberate killing of mercenary troops,but it didn't stick as evidence and witnesses were hushed up.Reacher told the perp if he ever got in any trouble back home,he would be there to see him taken down.<br />Reacher right away cottons on to some facts of the case that don't make sense,and he is convinced the perp is innocent.Reacher agrees to help the defense attorney and this leads them both on a long and complicated search for the truth.The identification of one person,leads to another higher up and so on.Reacher at one point attends a firing range many miles out of town run by an ex military man,who at first denies he had ever seen the perp.After a small test of firing skill by Reacher,the man retracts his denial of the perp and agrees to help Reacher when push comes to shove later.<br />Reacher's extensive nosing has finally uncovered the man behind the killings in the park.His name is Zec,a Russian who spent many years in the Gulag.He runs a construction conglomerate and it was his men that took out the people in the park,not the one arrested.In fact the other four people killed were collateral damage to mask the killing of just one woman who would not sell her business to him.Reacher,with the gun range owners help,zero's in on Zec and his men at a gravel pit.They have captured the defense lawyer and are holding her as bait for Reacher.Reacher takes them down one by one,including the lead detective in the case who was Zec's patsy,until he reaches Zec,sitting behind the lawyer.He has a few short words with Zec and \\"ends\\" the conversation abruptly.As the police sirens wail in the background signalling their imminent arrival,Reacher and the gun range owner leave the defense attorney to mop up the scene of carnage left behind.<br />The film finishes as the defense lawyer interviews the now innocent sniper.Though he does not recall the shooting,he still thinks he did it.He also believes Reacher will one day show up,as promised,to prosecute him,not knowing Reacher was there already and proved his innocence.<br />The film builds to a heightened tension rapidly and manages to generally keep it there throughout the film.There are some nail biting moments throughout with Reacher being involved in car chases,shootings and fights.The only criticisms I can make of this film is that there may be a bit too much attention to detail,as the film's 130 minute running length attests to.And the final ending of the gravel pit shootout,leaving the defense attorney to come up with some plausible explanation for all the dead bodies around,seems a bit of a stretch.Considering all that has come before it it seems far too convenient and an easy way out.I was surprised to see acting vet Robert Duvall in his small but nice role as the gun range owner.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all a surprisingly good thriller/whodunit,with Mr Cruise on top of his game.The film's length is a bit of a bother as is the over attention to detail,but generally speaking it satisfies,and that's what counts.t Duvall in his small but nice role as the gun range owner.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all a surprisingly good thriller/whodunit,with Mr Cruise on top of his game.The film's length is a bit of a bother as is the over attention to detail,but generally speaking it satisfies,and that's what counts.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Great for all ages, had me cheering. I think myself & husband were doing my laughing and enjoying the movie more then our daughters. My girls love this movie. A most see!
B002NOYX54|5.0|This is some of the very best music I have ever heard. the production value as well as the talent are unmatched. If you are hesitating on whether or not to get it, get it. I can promise you'll enjoy it.
B003O7I6L6|3.0|First off I had heard the premise for this and thought it was enough to give it a blind buy. I ended up enjoying the movie for several reason, the clever script, Kurt Russel portraying a rather sneeky and more complex character, a pretty good job of portraying a future world that doesn't sound too outlandish, nice humor, good deaths and a nice ending.<br /><br />However there are a couple weaknesses the film posses. It felt like a slow movie, which isn't a good sign as the movie is actually pretty short. Dispite a good amount of stuff happening, the plot never felt like much was at stake. Kurt Russel was 24 hours to live during the movie and yet we keep forgeting that fact. It feels like the idea for this movie would work better as a film novalization rather than an actual film as we would get more from the characters and maybe have a different sense of tone (Then again I've only seen the film once).<br /><br />Finally like with other John Carpenter movies I've seen, they aren't bad at all, but I just can't like them as much as most say I should. I find that annyoing, espically since I wasn't grossed out like The Thing, and there was more plot then Halloween.<br /><br />This is not a bad movie at all, I just can't rate it higher.
B004478AS4|4.0|Although the novel had a slow start, Achebe did a great job of describing the everyday life of the Ibo people. Once things began to \\"fall apart\\", that's when the storyline took off into a cultural spin of controversy and tension.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Right from the start, this series grips your heart and doesn't let go.<br /><br />Probably the best casting I've ever seen, the characters are believable and endearing.
B00003CX5P|5.0|We are extremely happy, pleased and satisfied with this purchase.  This DVD is in the UTMOST PRISTINE GREAT CONDITION !!!! If that even is correct English !! LOL.  I am too excited to worry about grammar.....my son was the recipient of this movie, so I speak moreso on his behalf!!<br />Thank you for a wonderful shopping experience as well.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel is the kind of actor that needs a good written script as well as a good cast of actors. As a Stand alone without a good writer Denzel falls flat. There are actors that can act and do well in anything, then there are actors that can only do certain movies or do well in a poor written movie with certain great cast: Example supporting cast members. Check movies that Denzel Washington was wonderful in like; Traning Day, Malcolm X and Philadelphia. When he is in a well scripted movie and/or has a good cast that bring the best acting out of him, Denzel is amazing.
B001R22TBI|4.0|I wish there was a CD with her version of Moon River, but this has some lovely songs. If you like female folk singers, you will adore Katie.
B004ZJZPX4|5.0|What I can say about this movie that hasn't been told before? This movie is brillient all the way through, great plot, great acting between Denzil Washington and Clive Owen, interesting twists, really proves that a movie can have a slightly smaller cast but have a more complex plot and have amazing relationships between characters and an ending that was perfect.<br /><br />Now I do feel I need to give Owen his own paragraph. Owen is amazing as he plays the character that by all menas should be the bad guy, but you find yourself rooting for him. It's amazing how much he fits into his role. There are certain roles you can't imagine another actor playing (Wolverine, Willy Wonka, Han Solo, Rorshach) and this is one of them. I can not praise this preformence or movie enough.<br /><br />Sometimes I rate something 5/5 because I like it and don't have problems, and sometimes I rate it 5/5 because I love it and consider it masterful, this is the latter.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|A good book that shows why money can't necessarily buy a championship baseball team. I also learned tips that might help me out in a fantasy baseball league.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This is an amazing animation.The characters seem real in their actions.The story is great and full of action.loved everything about this film,can't wait for another installment.
B007XF4J66|5.0|this is the classic of classics..  a must have..  Bogart's best performance, his long awaited role in a romantic.. he simply knocks it out of the park.. Bergmann's expressions playing off of Bogart, no words needed to complete the point, continue the story line. This is one classic you can view again and again..
B004S9AK9U|2.0|not just i have read better books with lower rating,but also the story is too much detailed and not that interesting plot. i even skipped some pages becaue of the lack of interest in the details of other secondary characters that doesnt relate much to the story. i found some news irrelevant and just page fillers.i recommend it for a holiday read or a beach read only.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|You have to like this style of music, which has become rather trendy so chances are you do, but understand that all these songs are in the some basic sound category. If you like bluegrass and you like folk, you'll like these guys
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great story line with great actors that interact perfectly with each other. Season 2 is just as good and excited that season 3 is coming up!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I was actually terrified for the characters. It makes you think about how much control we actually have over ourselves. I thought it was neat how everyone had a job, but found it interesting how no one actually knew what was going on except one person.  I have not been able to drive by a silo without thinking about this book.  I cannot wait to start \\"Shift\\".  The author rocks!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|this movie was a joy to watch.  Suraj Sharma did an excellent acting job and you can't wait to see what's going to happen next.  Highly recommended.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|awesome..  great reflection and driving music.. one of Zimmer's best works, love it. If you like classical works by Hans Zimmer, you love the last Samurai Soundtrack..

Although I was born in the 80's, I still enjoyed many of the pop culture references and had a blast reading this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this series! Recommended reading for all! Make sure you have all three books before you start, you won't want to wait to start the next one!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Wow! Alot of reviewers are apparently not happy with this latest installment of the Predators franchise.<br />Which I find odd because this movie takes place on the Preds game reserve planet and not on boring Earth and I kinda feel as though that was the logical next step as far a venues go.<br />Also lots of people are mad that it's not like the first one and I admit Adrien Brody is no Arnold but I can't help but feel as though these people would only be truly happy if they managed to get Arnold, Carl Weathers and Jesse to scene by scene re-inacted the first movie and package it as a new Predators movie.<br />I like to call these people the Impossibles, as in impossible to please.<br />Adrien Brody did fine as the main tough guy and the rest all pulled their own acting wise.<br />I do recognize the forced in female lead aspect but got over it pretty quickly as it would appear that women have been allowed in the military for some time now.<br />Special effects are pretty good and nothing there to complain about.<br />We get a glimpse of Predator social behavior and turns out there two diffenrent types out there.<br />One we've seen in the other movies and a bigger version that almost come off as either the full grown version or just a compelety separate sub-species.<br />That wasn't explained very thouroughly but maybe in the next installment they will elaborate on that.<br />In a nutshell, I found thist to be pretty competent follow up and one last little barb at the Impossibles, and this is in direct reference to the mud shield that they are saying was a blatant copy cat of the first movie...it would appear that that would not have worked for covering up body heat...Mythbuster tested it and Busted.<br />So it would seem that the first one has it's issues with reality as well but does that mean I like the first one less?<br />Hell no, it's a frigging alien movie so go with it and enjoy the ride and stop comparing everything to the first one.<br />There can only be one first one.ne first one.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is a great re-telling of the book. It cuts out enough to keep the story streamlined and make both versions of story worth their individual attention, but it does a brillent job of holding to the feel and the heart of the story and the world. This is, almost exactly, what I pictured when I read it. The casting is superb and the art direction... wow. I just can't praise it enough.
B00000JNO1|4.0|This was Lynyrd Skynyrd's third album and maybe not the smash hit when compared to the first two this is still a very good album that is often overlooked. So have a listen to this solid and enjoyable album when cruising around or just chill'n.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Extrapolating from current trends, Bacigalupi imagines a future in which most of the technology is less advanced than that which we have today because the world has run out of oil.  Story revolves around different forms of manipulation--political and genetic.  Engaging and entirely plausible.
0385349947|5.0|I believe this to be the single best current read for women.  I was a stay at home mom that went back to school and worked part time while raising my 2 children.  This book provides great advice and support for women with both goals- working in and outside the home.  I love that the author embraces women who choose to stay home and raise their children while still motivates and supports women who choose to work outside the home.  For any woman concerned and interested in self improvement and life goal success, read this book and pass it on!

B00A8ECU24|2.0|I absolutely loved this app, however, don't get too attached or overly excited about getting that pony you've been waiting for or paid a ton of rubies for,  because as soon as they are about to arrive the game resets! I went through this twice! never again.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|easy and fast read. can't put my book down. details can be gory. i wouldn't recommend to younger children, even though i personally enjoy the intensity. all in all very entertaining!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Creepy movie with lots of good scares.  What stands out for me are the ghost effects.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this wasn't directed by del Toro, but it's clear why it appealed to him enough for him to serve as executive producer:  like &#34;The Orphanage,&#34; on which he also served as executive producer, and del Toro's earlier films &#34;Cronos&#34; and &#34;The Devil's Backbone,&#34; &#34;Mama&#34; is a good example of family horror in which children play prominent roles and understand things the adult characters don't.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great Bond movie, it had some humorous parts and yet kept to the Bond theme...Javier Bardem was an awesome villain!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very nicely done! Finally a movie with meaningful dialog and interesting relationships.  A great family series for everyone to enjoy!
B000JMKRKC|4.0|When I read Thirteenth Tale it gave me a dark creepy feeling.It was deliciously spooky!Sorta like waiting for something that goes bump in the night.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|Once again, Eric strays away from the common ground and gives a a variety of great guitar music. This entire album is a pleasure to listen to. It covers many styles and clearly demonstrates Clapton's ability to play with that unusual touch of his.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|The Tudors was entertaining, but not historically accurate. Portraying Henry as a thin young man was historically ridicules, but I still liked the series.
0786939532|4.0|First in the Legend of Drizzt fantasy series, which I think is a sub series within the Forgotten Realm series. This particular story starts in the city of Menzoberranzan in the Underdark with its twenty thousand drow.<br /><br />My Take<br />This was just nasty. Well-written in the details although it had too many incongruities that no one caught, or that Salvatore simply didn't care about in this story about a culture that prizes lying, murder, assassination, and betrayal. I really didn't want to give it a \\"4\\"; I'd have preferred a \\"3\\" or less, but it would be incredibly unfair simply because I despise the main thrust of the \\"country\\". Or because I really hate it when authors create unpronounceable names that I have to struggle over.<br /><br />I do have to give Salvatore credit for writing so well and consistently of such awful people with this engrossing culture. The story just goes on and on and on, detailing the awfulness of it. However, it's also clumsy. If Zak is the best weapons master, then how can the clerics of House DeVir not have heard of him?; why does Zak think his only choice was to kill Drizzt? Why didn't he just flee with Drizzt?<br /><br />This is stupid. Why wasn't Drizzt taught about his society and their attitudes from the start? It just seems so dumb to leave him in ignorance until he goes off to the Academy. No, Salvatore leaves all these loose ends, and it irritates me.<br /><br />I don't understand the position of a patron of the house. It sounds like a good thing, but the status of males denies that idea. Nor does Salvatore ever explain it.<br /><br />I think part of my dislike is the utter waste of it all. These drow spend all their time plotting and knifing each other in the back. Instead, they could put all that brainpower to use building their people up. It's like crooks and terrorists who spend all this money, time, and effort to destroy when if they put the same into building up...the world could be so much better.<br /><br />It's odd that I find their customs and way of raising children disgusting. That I despise the female's power over the males; it's very much as women were/are treated by our own society. I think I feel better about myself, knowing that I find inequal treatment of anyone repugnant.<br /><br />The Story<br />The plot is coming to fruition and House Do'Urden will advance in its ambitions. Small things, however, will have a bearing on total and eventual success.<br /><br />The birthed one that lives. The cruel and repugnant customs of the drow that will push their best away.<br /><br />It's of Drizzt's upbringing that we read and the slow and steady truth of his culture that he grasps.<br /><br />The Characters<br />House Do'Urden, Tenth House of Menzoberranzan<br />Drizzt Do'Urden is alive only through ambition, and his achievements as he reaches manhood are astounding. Unfortunately for his House, he is also capable of independent thought. Malice Do'Urden is the Matron Mother of Daermon N'a'shezbaernon; her daughters are Maya, a vicious bitch; Vierna, who has thrust her softer side behind her; and, Briza the worst of the daughters. Dinin is his older brother, a perfect drow: ambitious, violent, self-seeking; Nalfein is the eldest son. Zaknafein is the finest weapons master in the city, busy training their 300 troops. Rizzen is Malice's current flavor of the month.<br /><br />Alton DeVir is a son of House DeVir, the Fourth House. Matron Ginafae is his mother, but she has fallen out of favor with Lolth. Matron Baenre is of House Baenre, the First House. One of her sons is the city's chief wizard, and she doesn't hesitate to rub it in. Her daughter, Triel, is the Matron Mistress of the Academy. Berg'inyon is a son who is up against Drizzt at the Academy. The fate of House Teken'duis is yet another nail in the coffin for Drizzt, followed by the forced fight with Byuchyuch, then the behavior of Kelnozz of House Kenafin really rams home the truth of his culture. Why it took this many years for Drizzt to understand this, I'll never understand.<br /><br />House Hun'ett is the Sixth House<br />Matron SiNafay is Masoj's mother. Guenhwyvar is the panther who exists on another plane until called by Masoj, who is serving his older brother, the Faceless One, a mage at the Academy. The Faceless One is desperate for aid, and in return for it, he has contracted to kill Alton DeVir.<br /><br />Lolth is the Spider Queen who encourages chaos and backstabbing. The Matrons and their talented daughters serve her as high priestesses. The females hold all the power; the males are fodder. I can't quite figure out what the yochlol is. It appears to be a representative of the queen.<br /><br />Station is the drow religion paying homage to the Spider Queen, a deity of chaos which rewards a stab in the back while frowning upon an overt attack. A drider is a drow turned into a half-drow, half-spider for angering the queen.<br /><br />I do like Drizzt's comment:<br />Those most powerful in Menzoberranzan spend their days watching over their shoulders, defending against the daggers that would find their backs. Their deaths usually come from the front.<br /><br />The Gnomes<br />A vein of gemstones is discovered close to drow territory and Belwar and his miners are sent to mine them.<br /><br />Goblins and orcs are treated as slaves.<br /><br />Tier Breche is the Academy of the drow with three schools: Arach-Tinilith, the school of Lolth; Melee-Magthere, the school for fighters; and, Sorcere, the school of wizardry. Hatch'net is the master of Lore---think of it as propaganda.<br /><br />The Cover<br />No, I don't care for the cover either---hey, at least I'm consistent! It's shades of purple and brown as Drizzt and his friendly cat, Guenhwyvar, prowl the corridors around Menzoberranzan.<br /><br />The title is our introduction to a culture, people, and Homeland Drizzt learns to despise.ny years for Drizzt to understand this, I'll never understand.<br /><br />House Hun'ett is the Sixth House<br />Matron SiNafay is Masoj's mother.

B001KWP54S|4.0|I bought this album because I am a major fan of Eric and BB. I must have had low expectations, because I really enjoyed the entire album. It is really about two guys that respect each other, playing some great blues.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and the more I read, the more out of control things seemed to get.  It was a page turner.  I like the way the chapters alternate character points of view and the writing is good; HOWEVER, I HATED the ending.  Without giving too much away, it just left me mad and wanting a different resolution.  I was powered up for something amazing and it did not satisfy.  Overall, I would still recommend it. It definitely manipulates your point of view of the characters and second guess the next turn.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I'm sure I saw this film on TV as a kid in the 70's and I know we watched it on Netflix stream maybe two years ago. But watching the Blu Ray on a decent modern 55\\" hdtv is like experiencing a different film. The original was shot on 70mm, and the transfer is absolutely flawless, color is amazing, detail, sound, everything is like watching an actual pristine cut of the film when new. I always thought of this as some old offhand 2nd rate fun kids movie from the 60's, I really had no idea how well made a film this really was. It's nice to see an old treasure rediscovered and given it's proper due finally by the film's owners.<br /><br />I was expecting some of the effects shots to look pretty bad in HD, but mostly the masking is amazingly well done and it holds up quite well.<br /><br />It's a surprisingly long movie, and there are some slow-ish scenes like Truly's solo love song, though it is a nice song and beautifully filmed. The songs are all fun and the dance numbers are very well done. Van Dyke is a treasure. And the odd intermission with music only! It was a different era in movie making. But relax, you're not going anywhere. We watched it over two nights.<br /><br />It's a nice trip down memory lane for adults - though as I say I never saw this film in anywhere near this quality as a kid - and my 4 yo and 2 yo are still singing that song a week later.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It's just... so good. I started this during my senior spring, while writing my thesis. Still so worth it. Amazing show!

B00AFROVQC|1.0|I've read many a book that don't have very positive reviews and may have struggled with them a bit but was still able to enjoy them. This book though... was it written by a 5th grader? I think the only reason why I actually finished the book was my thinking that it had to get better at some point, it didn't. I even tried the 2nd book (A March of Kings) and only made it a chapter or 2 into it, before I gave it up as nearly unreadable.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Good quick read, practical information.<br />Would share with anyone interested,especially someone who may be shy.  Would check out at library,but not likely buy.
1604680547|5.0|I love this book.  I am a beginner at thinking up motifs for blank spots on a quilt and you will never use another book as once you use these you advance your own mind and come up with your own.  This is a wonderful starter.
1400069289|5.0|Habits are really powerful. Duhigg presents the power of habits in a very lucid way, illustrated by excellent examples. I liked the book very much for the style of writing as well as clear cut presentation of how the parts of brain help in formation of habits which can then have a huge influence in one's life or the way organizations work. I am just summarizing the key concepts and examples from the book.<br /><br />Quoting from research done by Larry Squires using a patient called Eugene (EP), he goes on to describe the habit loops and how they influence individuals, organizations, sports teams and society at large.<br /><br />EP lost a part of his brain due to some infection. He did not remember much about the layout of his house or the neighborhood he lived in. Yet, he could take his morning walks without getting lost, go to kitchen and make coffee etc. It was concluded that habits develop when a task is done frequently and gets stored in a different part of the brain called Basal Ganglia. These habits remain intact even if other parts of the brain are damaged. Newer habits can be formed in face of such damage, but is a much slower process. Examples of habits are brushing teeth, backing the car out of the garage etc.<br /><br />Larry Squires theory of habit loops consisted of a cue which instructs the brain to go into an automatic routine mode. The end result is an expected reward. Getting up in the morning is a cue, kicking off the process of brushing teeth, which results in the reward of clean teeth and good breath. When the expected reward does not materialize sometimes, craving develops.<br /><br />Claude Hopkins,the marketing genius of early twentieth century used the habit loop to sell Pepsodent, the toothpaste by saying that it removes the thin film on the teeth and results in a good smile. Later theories also revealed that the cool tingling sensation in Pepsodent actually caused a craving which in turn caused the sales to swell. Later other toothpaste makers emulated the craving effect.<br /><br />Tony Dungy took a lowly rated Tampa Bay Buccaneers to NFL playoffs in consecutive years, and won a Super Bowl for Indiana Colts in 2007 with Peyton Manning as their quarterback. He used the habit loops, taking the cue of opponents and kicking in well rehearsed routines to counter them. His philosophy was that any new thinking on the field slowed down reflexes enough and caused a team to lose. His philosophy was scorned at initially, but later gained respect as his successes showed up.<br /><br />Paul O'Neill made safety number one priority at Alcoa when he took over. People thought he was crazy. Along with safety, he also inculcated the habit of employee suggestions. And then everything else, like productivity and profits followed. Starbucks developed instructions on how to deal with inflection points like customer rage. Manuals, manager drills, role-playing are inculcated into employees to make the responses automatic.<br /><br />During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power. London Underground was reformed after the 1987 fire at Kings Cross station in which 31 people died. The cause was bickering amongst the different departments towards not doing anything beyond their individual responsibilities.<br /><br />New parents are so valuable that major retailers will do almost anything to find them, including going inside maternity wards, even if their products have nothing to do with infants. Target mined its baby shower registry database to find the buying habits of pregnant woman. Then used those traits to find pregnant woman and sent them coupons for baby merchandise. They also mixed the coupons with some random ones so as not to tell the woman that Target knows about their pregnancy !
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Compares to the other cds they put out, so if you like their other stuff you will love this cd. If you dont like their other stuff you wont like it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This novel is the perfect read for people who love suspense. It's also a great book for teens.<br /><br />It was a page turner because you just have to know what's coming next. It also had powerful messages that everyone can relate to but especially teenagers dealing with high school changes and drama.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

1476734941|5.0|We have been on the diet for one month and we both feel great.  My wife wants to loose only a few pounds so she eats more on feed days; I need to lose more so I just eat a normal 2,500 calories or so on feed days.  We are steadily losing weight at satisfactory rates and my blood sugar is under excellent control.  Most importantly, we feel good.

B000V39KDO|2.0|Disappointing portrayal of an important historical milestone. Great action, weak script, senseless nudity. Don't waste your time. Read a book, watch reruns or go to bed.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|After watching the awards show, i couldn't believe the guy I met years ago was this genius pop artist! I had to have the dvd and so I waited breathlessly for the shipment. In my eyes it couldn't come fast enough, but came as fast as I had ordered. I cherish this dvd and the excellent transaction!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Revisiting this novel is like finding a gift.  It has the magic of healing and of discovery and of transformation.  The inner dialogue was not captured in the movie, this is a true classic, and fun to read.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great acting great story lines lots of good twists and turns<br />All of the actors just keep getting better, bravo!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is well written, as was the first one!  The only problem was that I couldn't read it fast enough!  It was exciting, heart breaking, romantic and filled with pure adventure.  The characters truly come alive.....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The storyline is fantastic. The chemistry between each character is very good. High quality writing and acting. Downton Abbey is definitely a &#34;Must See&#34; and deserving of all the acclaim it's received.

B003VXMMTK|5.0|Loved it!  The role of women in society at the time was fascinating and at the same time really sad at how familiar it still is. Who wouldn't love a good Thomas Hardy novel?
B00AA03D18|5.0|This is a non-fiction book about Near Death Experiences (NDEs) and how a scientist and healer reconciled his pre NDE and post NDE lives. Dr. Alexander, a husband, father, and Academic Neurosurgeon suffered from a disease affecting 1 in 10 million adults which is almost always fatal. He was in a coma for seven days and miraculous came back from the beyond. What he experienced and learned is chronicled in this book from more of a scientific approach put as close to laymen's terms as possible. If you have a science and/or medical background it may be easy for you to understand. If not, Dr. Alexander does explain terms as he goes along.<br /><br />I've never had a NDE and could not relate to that aspect of his story. I do have an open mind when it comes to the spiritual nature of our lives. It is hard for me to speak for someone who does not already believe in these things that this book would ultimately change their minds. However, if you are undecided and need a more scientific explanation of spiritual beliefs then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Can science and spirituality co-exist my answer has always been yes. This book reinforces that to me. Check it out for yourself.

B00CL68NOG|4.0|Wonderful to see Barbara again in another funny role, she's got great comedic timing and is totally believable as an overbearing Jewish Mom, but she just clearly LOVES her little boy, awe! Good job Seth Rogan as well :)
B0068THAGY|5.0|What I like the most about this movie is the cast.  The story although unusual and does a great deal, but it is the cast that brings it to life and makes us care about them and their fate.  Any of us can imagine a year when we got together with friends for an event.  In this case they are trying to make a movie, but they could have easily been going on a night out, a picnic, a party or some other event.  All that is required is someone be using a video camera at the time to record the events.  In this case a train wreck is filmed.  Not the first time I'm sure a train wreck was filmed, and once again it could have been a truck or plane crash as well.  Then we have the typical government cover up, we have seen that many times.  In this case it takes awhile for the government to figure out a group of students filmed the event and caught sight of the creature that was being transported.  Good action thriller.  I recommend you at least rent it.  This is better than several others like this.  Good rewatchability.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B0051BVQFG Battle Los Angeles]], [[ASIN:B006RXQBJS Mimic: The Director's Cut]], [[ASIN:B0044BY98K Monsters]], [[ASIN:B001Y1PS3S Alien Raiders]], and [[ASIN:B00CDU6HZC State of Emergency]].<br /><br />CA Luster

B0041D843M|5.0|If you are looking to get healthy, stay healthy, or even tweek your health routine, this is fabulous information.  For a health book, and one based on science, I thought it would be very dry reading.  On the contrary, Dr. Campbell writes well and is the information is compelling.  I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian and have resisted my mom's push to become one.  After reading this book, the whole idea became much more appealing and reasonable.  The link between the SAD, the high levels of animal protein and our current plague of disease made much more sense after this book.
0345522478|5.0|This book is excellent! A lot of great characters, laugh out loud lines and sweet fighting action. I have never read a book quite like this one. Trust me when I say that you will not be able to put this book down. I read Hounded and now I am on book 5 of the series. Each book is great and they keep getting better. A must read and I will recommend it to all of my friends.

This book is written for a place of compassion and provides a great perspective about medical research and the potential consequences and ethical obligations.  It also provides great historical perspective as to why this may have occurred.  This is a fabulous work of literature.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|In the beginning, the solutions are fairly sinmple but at times have more than one solution. Only one solution uses ALL he spaces (which is what you are supposed to do to get the &#34;Perfect&#34; accolade.) Later on, the games get more and more difficult. It really stretches your mind when you try to &#34;see&#34; the solution before you make the first move. That's the only way to compete a game in the least amount of moves. It has an option to repeat a game so that you can go back and complete it in the least amount of moves. When you complete all the games in the first section, there are more.sections.

193700788X|1.0|if you are (excuse me WERE) a fan of this series do not waste your time with the conclusion. it is as equally disappointing as the string of poorly written books that led up to it. i plan on getting rid of the last handful because they were truly a waste of time and led me to dislike even the heroine of this story. Eric was the best male lead i have read since Rhett Butler in GWTW and what Ms. Harris has done to his character is nothing short of despicable. i really don't understand how she had this ending planned from the beginning- it felt forced, sloppy and desperately last minute. i will never buy another book from this author as long as i live.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was a good read. I am sorry that this is the end of Sookie. Guess I will start from the beginning.
B006X50OPW|5.0|If you are looking for a how to book this isn't it. Basically if you want to learn to trade well then learn from people really good in their field and that is what this is all about. I have read a lot of trading books from different authors and reading this after those helps a lot of the information in them click. Over and over again I kept saying to myself throughout the book &#34;that's what they mean by doing that&#34;. I wouldn't suggest this a a beginning book, this is one that you should read after some of the &#34;how to&#34; books so you understand what is being said from the traders. It is written in question-answer form as straight from the author and I wasn't sure how I was going to like it but once I started it grew on me. I would suggest this book to be in every investment library.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I wish I could get my money back for this rental. Terrible movie. I don't understand all the good reviews.

B003QSLW0K|5.0|Lilo and Stitch brings back the classic animation of Disney. While Pixar is great, it lacks the old fashioned feel of many Disney timeless classics. This movie brings it back along with a great storyline to boot. By the end of the movie, you will have fallen in love with Stitch!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I would totally recommend this movie especially for the children....it is an enjoyable family show full of great artistry. ...I loved it and would recommend it to anybody....love dealing with Amazon.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This was an \\"dine in\\" date night movie with my wife. We both enjoyed the movie and would reccomend watching it. Not a must see, but certainly worth the watch!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I enjoyed This movie I love stories with happy endings and the storyline with the mental illness is wonderful because people with these problems are regular people it was nice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was more than I expected! It definitely pulls at the heart strings and is relatable to so many different people. Absolutely amazing!
B0025CS2GU|5.0|Great movie and a great end to the trilogy. I hope that they make another someday but if this truly was the last then don't miss it. Mike Meyers brings in another fantastic character in Goldmember to add to the hilarious Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard characters.
B005RZB65Q|5.0|very simply written with a huge amount of substantiated information, should be read by all coaches and teachers. Teenages should also be encouraged to read this book
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I enjoy reading reviews written by principled, particular persons whom review Amazon products in amazing depth and detail. To date, I don't write reviews by such standards. I do, however, enjoy expounding on a few of the features I find unique and useful. I also like to have fun with alliteration. ^_^<br /><br />Anyhoo, I highly recommend using Alarm Clock Xtreme as a native OS clock. I like ACX because it presents a deep lineup of features that are simple to access and understand. I like that I can set as many different alarm schedules as I wish, with just as many alarm types and tones. I've never experienced the exie to become &#34;confused&#34; with an elaborate alarm schedule. That is impressive, IMHO. There are traditional, as well as optional, methods for snoozing or dismissing the alarm. For my difficult-to-wake situations, I prefer to mix up the methods so that my remaining neural cluster will reliably fire up. There is also a nicely appointed timer and an internal link to &#34;Stopwatch Xtreme Free,&#34; also found in the Amazon Appstore library.<br /><br />This exie seems to be resource-friendly and work well with a wide range of Android devices, older to newer. I'm not a fan of exies which run at startup. However, it's obviously necessary for ACX to do so in order to be a reliable alarm/chrono program. The Dev Team releases regular updates that refine the product and keep it appealing, per popular Android OS trends. For example, the UI is, IMHO, a nice hybrid of Gingerbread, Honeycomb, and Ice Cream Sandwich visual elements. At the same time, the exie is not fluffy or fancy so it executes snappily. In my experience, it runs great on my old Droid X and Droid Incredible. I've also seen it running flawlessly on a newer LG Lucid.<br /><br />I originally acquired ACX as a FAOTD and was pleased to see all of the unlocked functionality. Later on I was helping a friend with her Droid Incredible and found the ad-supported version to be identically functional. Kudos, Dev Team!s, Dev Team!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|There are no words that can completely describe the intensity of this book. It is for a more mature audience, because it does deal with a very dark subject matter.  At times, I found it very hard to read some scenes because I just could not imagine a father doing that to his own sister and child. This book is very heartbreaking and painful to read, but it is the strength, will, and heart of the characters that make this book a standout.<br /><br />It was very well written and extremely engaging and has left me completely speechless as to the talent of Colleen Hoover.  Sky is beyond brave and she is a survivor in more ways than one.  She is absolutely incredible, smart, and strong willed.  I can never imagine going through what she has gone through ever.<br /><br />Now for Dean Holder. Dean is just....There is no way to describe Holder than perfection.  He has his flaws, but everything that comes out of his mouth and everything he does for Sky just melts my heart and soul.  Certain scenes from Holder made me cry.  Certain scenes from Holder made me laugh and completely swoon for him. Certain scenes from Holder made me just want to hold him tight and NEVER LET GO.  He is just one of a kind and he is truly what Sky needed to get through her traumatic past. It also doesn't hurt that he has amazing blue eyes, lick-able dimples,is incredibly handsome, and a flirtatious tease. I just can't get enough of Holder and I don't think I ever will. He has and will always have a very special place in my heart.<br /><br />Sky and Holder's love for each other is just simply breathtaking.  Their love is unconditional and Holder is there for Sky through every revelation and truth. He shows her the path, but he never forces any decisions on her. He guides her and protects her any way that he can possibly find. It is together that they discover their painful past, and it is together that they find each other and find a kind of love that transcends time.  It is a truly beautiful and lasting love and very awe inspiring.<br /><br />I cannot wait for Dean's POV in Losing Hope. I still feel that there is more to him that I want to know and need to know and I am sure Colleen Hoover will deliver!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|Even the episodes that aren't stellar are still solid, and the great episodes are great.  A lot of good writing and well developed characters coming to a satisfying conclusion.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Loved every Wheel of Time Book. This book is the best ending for the series. I couldn't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a great way to have fun and enjoy. It keeps you focused and striving to do better next run.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Everything from the acting to the stunning cinematography sets this show apart from anything else on network tv, The food styling is so beautiful, everything is beautiful--just watch it and support the show so it get another season!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This concert overflows with talent, from the lead artists to the pit musicians. Every aspect of this concert is perfectly orchestrated and executed. Video and audio quality are top notch, camera transitions are steady and consistent. I've watched several blu-ray concerts and this is by far the BEST I've seen to date followed by Chris Botti in Boston.
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|To make this cd a perfect listen, it should have had the Richie Havens version of freedom included.Maybe take off some of the dialog,but not all.Other than that, the cd is a great blend of the different types of music and dialog that makes Quentins soundtracks some of the best.......support your favorite artists
B001EN71DQ|5.0|We love this movie.  My boys are very much into Star Wars, and enjoy having the first three episodes.  The end of the third episode would not be recommended for younger children.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|All good action and drama was drained in the 90's.  Everything is a rehash or lame attempt to recapture what other directors have already accomplished.
B006M4F67A|2.0|On the first game about half way through it crashed.<br />It is pretty, the chime getting annoying quickly.  Needs a mode where the background pieces are always grayed out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is my new favorite! I can't just choose one thing that was my favorite! Amazing story and amazing character development!!! Read now!!!!!
1402760663|5.0|The Bible of Indian history just got better.By adding more pictures to the stories you get a better feel for the plight of the American Indian tribes that you are reading about.Personal and tragic at the same time.Thank you Dee.....support your favorite authors.
B00005B1W5|5.0|Yanni's Tribute ..... Perfection ....Excellence....Absolutely hands down the BEST concert,performance, music and venue EVER !!  Only Yanni could pull something like this off. He is genius and genuine.  You can feel the love, heart, and dedication in all his work. NOTHING better out there.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson did a good job of wrapping up the series.  It made me want to turn around and start again.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Another exciting book from Dan Brown.<br />Has many twist and angles leading to an exciting ending.<br />I recommand for all Dan Brown fans.
0762445262|5.0|Small but light functions quite well, well worth the price. Book is not all that great but doubt anyone will get this for the book.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the best books over WWII that I have ever seen! Marvelous!<br />It shows the war through both side.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I don't know why people are spending and arm, leg and your friend's arm and leg for an Intel Processor.  I had this processor for about 6 months now.  Never had a single problem with it. It runs my games, and other serious applications very well. No overheating problems. Even though is has great overclocking ability, I don't need to overclock jack because it can handle all the applications I throw at it.  Great processor with great speed and great relibility.<br /><br />So I ask again. Why on Earth will I go let myself get ripped of by Intel with their processors when this fine AMD FX-6100 does everything for a cheaper price? Second question. Why should I let myself get fooled with Intel baloney of so-called &#34;second generation dual core processors&#34; when this 6-core processor does just as good or even better than Intel processors?  Look only a dummy will spend a ton of money on an Intel processor.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought the second book was better then the first book.  I liked the fact that their was more action, to keep you on your toes.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Gives you a lot of information. You can read without having to deal with a lot of talk. So different then facenook.
B003VW54QO|5.0|It's my favorite because it has a lot of my favorite stars ie Walter Brennan, Dean Martin, Angie Dickinson, Ward Bond with a little nostalgia from the Nelson family to boot.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great  game only problem is collecting  coins is a little slow and somethings are too over  priced but besides  that no complaints
0761169253|5.0|This is one of those books where you say; I should have known that... The best thing is that it will inspire and help you get off your creative backside and get busy. Great value. Don't miss it.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I enjoy all the. Bosch books.  I like solving the crimes with him.His love life is always such a mess, but he is a great cop.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I downloaded it as the free app of the day.  I like that I can have different times going at the same time.  I use it at work for different projects.  Easy to set up and use.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Trip to Bodega Bay and this is one of my classic favorites. To kill a Mocking Bird, The Birds, Jaws and then...I have not decided yet.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Was looking forward to seeing this movie, but was disappointed. Acting was good, and the movie was entertaining, but not the block buster I expected.
0545265355|5.0|I love this series and after reading the books years ago I needed to own them. The box set is convenient and fairly priced. Love it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is awesome. I finished it in one day. Kept me in total suspense. Loved it. Now my son is batting ready to play it. Keep  'em coming.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Interesting how most of the it was written through his thoughts.  Like that many things were left to your imagination until the end.  Very interesting story line.  Thought overall it was a unique approach to a book but a book I reallly enjoyed becauae of it especually the more I got into the book
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like the app.......when it works 'Sigh' it is constantly saying \\"not responding\\" and then closes. Very frustrating! I hope whatever is causing the problem gets fixed soon.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I had read the book and was anxious to see the movie. It didn't disappoint! It was true to the book and the cinematography was absolutely stunning. It's a &#34;must see.&#34;
B000GW8RX4|5.0|Very good considering that the original format wasn't anything like we have today.  The picture and sound were fine.  I am very pleased.
B004UJ81IA|4.0|I'm a huge Steinbeck fan and this was said to be one of his favorite books. It gives an interesting insight to village life in France in the 19th Century, but also give insight into Steinbeck's, Travels with Charlie, in which he explored the U.S. in a camper with a standard poodle for company.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This dictionary is the best in the world. There is a definition for every word I can think of. Thanks. Ryan Prewitt.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I can have my music on the computer, on my tablet, on my iPhone, and on my sons iPod touch and its EASY to use it truly is!!!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|it's supernatural ! always comes with new stuff...<br />Nice twist, only crux is lil too much emotions this time as sam keeps going back in past..
B001KS0THU|5.0|The way the Duke wanted it done.<br />We can only hope he is looking down and pleased.<br />Thank you all.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Now that I use LastPass to track all the hundreds of places I have to sign into, I use a different password for every one of them ... and the password is a totally random set of characters, some up to 25 characters long. The crypto technology they use has been vetted by Steve Gibson, so you know it's bulletproof.
B001QB9H10|5.0|This kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through.  I wasn't sure what to expect next.  I love his accent.  It reminds me of the Bond Adventures with Sean Connery.  They are both very handsome men.
B00C9QQBA6|3.0|This story has a interesting concept, but the author needs to do a bit more research about the time period chosen for the setting. The character voices were more like 1997 Americans then 1897. Certain plot devices (ex. A 1897 judge/father leaving his unmarried daughter alone with a strange male alien for long lengths of time ... including overnight) does not reflect even progressive 1897 thinking. Also the timeline of the book contains several inconsistencies. The author clearly states a 2 month break between certain events, but characters discuss the events as occurring \\"the other day.\\" Better editing would have increased my star rating for this book.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show became one of my favorites and definitely has many story lines which makes it interesting. No commercials or ad.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|After trying 50 levels, yes now it's really annoying that from level 38  it kept popping up add after each level finishes to download free version of cooking dash. It's annoying! Please get rid of it and i will make it 5 star.<br /><br />However, there is no in app purchasing required so far...to unlock levels.<br />There is a game play mode and challenge mode. But on the home screen, there is another little ad bar at the bottom that is annoying.<br /><br />The game works fine on my LG optimus. Just like the pc game.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Could have been a fun road movie that played off generational differences in travel - script was too predictable for this level of talent involved.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|My niece enjoyed it, and I enjoyed the music download that came with the purchase.  The price is worth it.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this app is great for minecraft pocket edition you can spawn mobs with pro version and edit your inventory great app!!!
B00000AF98|5.0|Even though I bought this CD on 2010, I am now just getting around to reviewing this album.  I would like to share my opinions of each song that's incl., here as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Crazy Crazy Nights\\"...I really enjoy EVERYTHING about this fun time party song. It is such an uplift to listen to.<br /><br />2.  \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You\\"...I think this is ONE of the most POWERFUL songs on this album. It's another tune that I love EVERYTHING about, esp. the TOUCHING words.  This could be my 2nd TOP favorite, following \\"Reason To Live\\".<br /><br />3.  \\"Bang Bang You\\"...For some reason, THIS song seemed awfully familiar as soon as I listened to this CD, for the first time.  This song is pretty good.<br /><br />4.  \\"No, No, No\\"...I won't say as much about this song, because it's NOT my favorite that's, incl., here.<br /><br />5.  \\"Hell Or High Water\\"...I love this tune a great deal. It's a PERFECT Gene Simmons song.<br /><br />6.  \\"My Way\\"...Here is another tune that I love everything about.  Musically, I feel, that this could be a song that Van Halen could be good on.<br /><br />7.  \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />8.  \\"Reason To Live\\"...It's hard to believe that this BALLAD is my TOP favorite song on this album.  Again, I love these really nice & TOUCHING words.  This could be suitable for HEART to sing, as THIS reminds me of Heart's type of song.  It could ALSO remind me, somewhat, of Kiss' 1989 hit single \\"Forever\\".<br /><br />9.  \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\"...There is nothing wrong w/ this tune, whatsoever.  It's just plain fantastic, I think.<br /><br />10. \\"Turn On The Night\\"...I could rate this song as HIGH as \\"Crazy Crazy Nights\\", due to it's fun time party lyrics. It's quite enjoyable & I wish that it was about a minute or two LONGER.<br /><br />11. \\"Thief In The Night\\"...This song is decent.<br /><br />Even though, THIS album didn't always get real high reviews, I think that I hit the Jack Pot, when I bought this album...I'mquite pleased w/ it.  This album IS surely recommended.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Best series....I only hate that it stops short of being up to date.  Wish there was more.  Why is that???
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I had always wondered how Honor got her land and titles. I enjoyed reading the early story in the series.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Classics are good reads. I would recommend this to students.  This is good for leisure reading too.  It will never disappoint.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book first and then I rented the movie.  The book is also really worth reading it is different then the movie and I think that both are AWESOME!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The Trilogy felt noble, historic, epic. The Hobbit feels like high production slapstick. But I still loved every single minute of being in that world. Freeman is perfect.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is great! I use it to remote into work when I'm away (I hate going in when I'm off). It just makes it easier.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I would recommend this book and series to anyone interested in the 1700's and who are interested in a good love story.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Waiting for the walking dead to start backup.  The show is not bad but lacks heart considering it's subject matter.  It seems to improve over time but, perhaps more $$.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I'm not sure if the secondary cast members are true actors but some were bad. I am a big fan of Jones and he has been in some great movies. This one was mediocre closer to bad than good.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a completely different way of telling a mystery story.  All the characters are quaint and somewhat twisted.  Read!
B004YXE438|4.0|The only thing I don't like is that you have to do the puzzles in order.  The pictures are beautiful. But, when I was working on one of them, the Kindle froze.  I got it working again, but have no idea how.
B001W2JWWC|5.0|Not sure how I went so long not owning this one. Quality on cloud player seems very good. Have not tried the download yet.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Even after 10 years, the story lines are still interesting and entertaining, and the characters still seem to work well together.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|On the edge of your seat good!  Tom Cruise does an excellent job as Jack Reacher.  I have recommended the movie to others.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like being able to turn the cube around any way I want to find the piece I need.  The colors are brilliant.  I can spend hours on it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|good story with twists and turns, a real page turner.  This is the first Gillian Flynn book I have read, but it<br />won't be the last.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|El stinks did not think it was funny at all it was actually stupid don't recommend it.  Don't waste ur time
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It was just a nice movie. Not overly impress.  I didn't feel the flow of the movie.  The best thing about the movie was the music.  Previous 007 much better.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Madeleine has a ‘one of a kind’ voice, and it is that voice that has carried her to recognition. Distinctive renditions of old classics, like this one on Ray Charles as well as modern tunes is a testimony to her talent. I have had the opportunity to hear Madeleine sing in French and I find her to be superb. I hope that a future endeavor in French will  be coming soon...
B000WGWQG8|5.0|well written, well made, excellent performance by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney. Very close to facts  the founders of our country were superb human beings filied with sacrifice, endurance and strong will. Love this movie love it love it.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works perfectly and feels great. Adds the oh-so important second analog stick, making underwater camera control and maneuverability a great deal less frustrating.<br />The list of titles compatible with the Circle Pad Pro is growing, and I expect to be using it for a long time.
B005R32L66|5.0|Great software to connect with people @ no cost. Feels like seeing family members personally. Help to be in touch with old friends with this software. Thank you.
B008Y79IUE|3.0|As well done and as well acted as this movie may be, you will literally be disturbed by it. The downward spiral of drugs and mental illness is so brutally expressed here you will feel it emotionally. Ellen Burstyn is nothing short of brilliant !!
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|It is okay I was a little dissapointed. Was waiting for something more how will I say profound.The performance was good but the plot was not.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great game I love it. My family and I play these games all the time. $99 is a small price to play for a 5 star game. Thanks for everyone who puts time and work into these cute games.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are the original Broadway Elphaba and G(a)linda and by far the best. Their voices blend really well. Wicked is really amazing. The soundtrack is amazing I listen to it at least once every day and some times,when I'm not to busy, four. It is much better on stage but you can't watch Wicked every day.. :(. It does not have the songs The Wizard and I (reprise), Wicked Witch of the East,and No One Mourns the Wicked (reprise). Being the Wicked addict I am I have found that they did not do Wicked Witch of the East because they didn't know how to record it, I totally under stand that because I have seen Wicked 6 times (no not live some were on youtube I wish I had seen it six times live). They also said that they thought Wicked Witch of the East would be to much of a give away for the people who has not seen it yet but are listening the the soundtrack. The Wizard and I reprise and No One Mourns the Wicked reprise are probably not on there because they are so short, but I'm not 100 percent sure on that.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Pretty good RDP program. If I had any complaint it would be manual connection is not intuitive, however, I was able to complete the connection within a reasonable amount of time
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Innocence is one if the best espionage thrillers out there. Baldacci is one of the best writers, up there with Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy, Sanford and more. He weaves excitement, intrigue, a touch of violence with outstanding characters and great writing that keeps you reading until the book is finished. All the while anticipating the next release of a sequel! Pick up this book, you won't be disappointed.
B0013FBS20|5.0|It is really hard for an actor to carry a movie single handedly for more than half the film. Will Smith and Tom Hanks before him (Castaway) both managed to do just that. great story
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I'm hooked on the series already. It was amazing. But I want Percy Jackson to come back soon. He was my favorite.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can we get a sequel? Good premise and smart story. Controls put kindle to the test<br />Better than 90% of android games I've played
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second book in the series. I know these books were written for teens but I am an adult and I enjoyed it. Several of my co-workers have also read it. This book is an easy read. Great for the beach/vacation/flights!
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Not the normal treatment of the Robin Hood saga. It follows what most believe to be the true Robin. Robin Longstride
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Standard Jack Reacher. I have been trying to read all Jack Reacher stories. I have one to go. It is $15. Waiting for $9.99
B00B935SUY|2.0|Thought it would be more interesting...  It really lacked a sense of the historical coolness that this place was.  A lot of telling, but not enough showing.  Cool, but not worth watching twice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As the last book in the series, I was sad to see the character I'd grown to love end. The ending was not what I had wished for but made sense. Read this book
B002ZG9788|5.0|Usually I do not care for remakes, i.e. Stagecoach and red River, But the special effects and story are much better than the original. The actors are much better.
B002WY64HA|5.0|Got my vinyl copy of Funeral a day early and I love it!! This is definitely Arcade Fire at their best (although I love Neon Bible and The Suburbs as well). If you are trying to decide whether or not to get this album, I say go for it. I genuinely enjoy every song and they are each so different and yet incredibly beautiful to listen to. This album is one of my all time favorites. Do yourself a favor, if you have not gotten to experience this album, get it!
B004WKH4PS|5.0|The Film Nor's of Film Noirs!  So many great one liners.  I've seen it 50 times!  Veda is so campy - she's the only one still alive - Anne Blythe!
030745455X|5.0|I bought this to read on a long flight. It was entertaining! Recommend the whole series! Read before seeing the movie
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Loved watching this movie, it's a nice family movie and interesting take on Easter bunny, Jack Frost and Tooth Fairy and others.
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|I got the vinyl of Disintegration a day before it was scheduled to arrive and it is lovely!! The 2LP set is beautiful and it sounds incredible! I'm so glad I got this classic album to add to my collection, you can't go wrong with The Cure. If you are thinking of buying this album, I highly recommend it!
B0012NO316|5.0|One of the finest melodramas ever produced!  Elizabeth Taylor's finest performance by a long shot.  Sandy Denis is superb!  Richard Burton in full mastership of his craft.  You can't buy this stuff anymore!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have enjoyed playing mahjong for kindle. Very user friendly. Easy to use. A fun little game. Would recommend to others.
B007N85POS|5.0|Children loved this game - I would sit with them when they played. I reloaded an app, but not the one for Kindle HD - starting the game all over.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great chooses of sounds.I like to fall asleep to the tickling a baby.I can't fall asleep without it.Sometimes I play the frogs when I'm bathing.makes me feel like I'm camping
B0055OK2T0|2.0|We downloaded this to watch on a long flight. I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend was appalled. I can see why. They took on a cool topic but didn't flesh out the story. It's disappointing but the people in it are good and very pretty.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved this movie and just had to have it at this great price. Happy all around. A Definite buy.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Again lost app - needs internet to play the game. Grandchildren had time to look at it once, they seem to like it
B00B7Y0206|1.0|My Kindle did not like this at all, so not a good fit for me, I went ahead and deleted it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The hallmarks of Wool are the well-developed world, good development of mufti-dimensional characters, good dialog and, especially its surprises. Read the Omnibus edition; these reflections are based on that edition. Wool really is one book in serial format.<br /><br />The plot twists are not artificial or cheap. They make sense and or organically developed (and explained) within the story. Mr. Howey doesn't need to rely on awkward monologues to provide backstory exposition; he unveils them through the narrative. The pacing is solid, the dystopian future somewhat depressing but fully-fleshed out and without artifice. Characters, their dialog and their interactions are all nicely done. There is no artifice in the construction of the people or the world. Wool shows our depravity and our desire to matter, to be part of a purpose beyond ourselves. In other words, like all of the best Science Fiction, it provides a mirror for us with a new perspective.<br /><br />****Note, some high-level story information provided - very light spoilers****<br /><br />Mr. Huey introduces us to the Silo; essentially, this single silo is the whole world available to our cast of characters. There is no life outside the silo; indeed the ultimate punishment is to be exiled to the post-apocalyptic outer world that is utterly poisonous.  The twist here is that while you carry out your death sentence of exile, they want you to clean the\\" windows\\" (the camera lenses) that provide the only view of the outside world to the inhabitants. Cheeky. Yet, everyone who has received this death sentence blithely goes through the process of cleaning the lenses with wool pads. Go figure.<br /><br />This is the backdrop to a well-ordered society made up of a literal caste system where the lower castes are the bottom dwellers whilst the upper crust lives near the surface. You are intimately identified with your caste although it is possible to move among them. Everything, including families, are regulated to ensure continued survival in a decaying silo; having babies is by lottery because everything is a zero sum game.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed and, while you are pigeon holed by your caste (job), the characters we meet are complicated. The world is complicated and twists and turns change your entire vista. The guys on \\"the bad side\\" can be good; the good guys can make unwise choices. The wicked have developed their wickedness through choices over time; vestigial goodness remains either in desire or in the story they've woven to justify their actions. This is not a morality play, but the consequences of our choices on our own character as well as on those around us is writ large on the silo's stage.<br /><br />I alternated between the Kindle and Audible versions; Minnie Goode does a masterful job narrating the story. The combination of her smooth voice, brilliant pacing and inflection and ability to convey the emotion mark her as one of the better narrators. I definitely recommend her version of what little I've hear of Amanda Sayle's. Right now, it appears that it's not on Audible right now. That's unfortunate.<br /><br />I highly commend Wool to you. While the actual craft of writing is good, I anticipate that his descriptions and dialog will only get tighter. Wool is a brilliantly conceived world, characters, set of problems and story. Well done Mr. Howey.re continued survival in a decaying silo; having babies is by lottery because everything is a zero sum game.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed and, while you are pigeon holed by your caste (job), the characters we meet are complicated.

B000FA675C|5.0|i watched the movie several times and am looking forward to reading this book. they always leave out things in the movies.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use this when I an not in my computer room and need a quick look at my email at home.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I wear it all the time, even when I crawl around when I'm working on my cars. It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My granddaughter is 5 years old and she loves it.  I like it because it keeps her occupied when I am busy with my chores
0385344228|4.0|Out of all the endings I could imagine - THAT was not one of them. I liked the book. It was easy to read. I normally get stuck in the middle of a book because I get bored and never finish it. This book was not one of those. It was interesting from the start. There were a few conversations btwn Andy and Laurie that seemed to drag on and the sudden change in pace threw me off a little but overall a great read. I have a 14yr old son so it really hit home for me. I must say the ending hit me like a ton of bricks. I wish it didn't end that way. It stuck with me for days and it really made me sad. It's not the way I want to feel when I finish reading a book so that's the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always, King is on his game .The story isn't his typical suspense or horror ,although there  moments with both.An excellent read.
B006PERRMY|3.0|I didn't not like it, it was average for that reason I say you can wait for it to be on tv.
B006903GX8|4.0|Was an interesting read with some helpful information on the running of the household and corresponding characters. To truly understand the genesis of the show however I would highly recommend &#34;To Marry and English Lord&#34;
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Turning tragedy into a positive shows the power of the human spirit.<br />This movie shares a great message of God's love and power without being preachy or over-the-top.<br />Great family movie.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Having read all the books in this series (13 in all) A Memory of Light, the final volume of the series Wheel of Time, let the reader appreciate just how important the detail of the previous books needed to be. Watching the characters grow from young country folk, especially Rand Al'Thor and his fellow Two Rivers friends, grow to powerful men and women defined the last battle to be fought. The book was exciting with many surprises, twists and turns.  The concept of good and evil has forever changed how I think about it.  Having read all of the books in this series, I can only compare it to the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great, Great book, as usual could hardly put it down. Only problem not enough books coming out, so easy to read.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|enjoyable, although sad. And as always is the case I liked the book much better than the movie. I am sure I will read this author again.
B007SPPANM|5.0|How Leonardo DiCaprio did not win an Oscar is beyond me.<br />He almost didn't even get the role and when he did he scored big time.<br />One of the best movies of the 1990's and it is timeless.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Love watching the original Star Trek series with the remastered special effects.  It is almost like watching the episodes for the first time.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|We had never heard of this movie but since it was a good price we bought it.  It is a great movie!  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until the end that we realized that it is based on a true story.  Glad we purchased it.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Downey and his beautiful co-star seemed to have a magic between them.  There were the usual villains whom Iron Man vanquished.<br />Great escapism.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Jim Carrey was born for these types of roles.<br />The Mask was brilliant.  The Grinch is right up there.<br />Physical comedy at its finest with a strong cast to back him up.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The way she writes is amazing. I will defiantly read this again very soon. Great understanding on how the views of one person  can be so different than reality
B0081BU42O|5.0|The thought of Iain Banks's mortality was much with me as I savored &#34;The Hydrogen Sonata&#34;. I'm left with two thoughts:<br /><br />First, if this is his last SF book published, it's a spectacular finish by one of the finest SF authors of all time. The rich symbolism is pretty amazing, and quite moving, as I reflect on my first read of this book.<br /><br />Second, Banks finally figured out how to write a good ending to a Culture novel.  Well done, sir.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|YOU MEET THE WHOLE CREW OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE AS THEY BEGAN.  KIRK AS A REBELLIOUS KID, SPOK AS A PUT UPON HALF-BREED VULCAN.  SCOTTY AS AN ENGINEER ON AN OUT-OF-THE WAY MINING STATION.  BONES AS A BROKE DOCTOR WHO ENLISTED IN STARFLEET BECAUSE HIS EX-WIFE TOOK HIM FOR ALL HE HAD DURING THEIR DIVORCE.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|One of my favorite versions.  I have it on my IPod touch and can't get enough! Great graphics and a great challenge.  I would definitely encourage people to pick this app.. it really is great.  Thanks
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Very very disappointing that this only works with if connected to the internet...We don't have access to the internet at home, so I download games for my boyfriends daughter to play, and she can't play it at home, because this requires the internet to play...sorry I paid money for this.
B000W9179M|5.0|Paulo Coelho did it again with this book. The way that he uses to narrate his stories is always very entertaining, simple and classy. It invites you to analyze things from a different perspective. Good read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks keeps you reading! Excellent story lines blending together into quite the read. Two huge, rotten, zombie thumbs up!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've been using this for a couple of years. It's always been good but this latest version is by far the best.  There is very little it won't do. Connects easily daily to clouds - I'm using both sky and Google drive. Also connects to my laptop easily for easy transfer of files.  Has an app manager - everything one would need.<br /><br />And, for me this is NOT a minor point - no ads!  I would have paid for this puppy.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is real drama, believable stories with believable character situations.  This is not one of those junky comedy dramas that are overtaking the good 'ole drama TV.  The characters and actors work together well and express believable emotions.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|What more can I say? It's Rush...classic rock updated with a string ensemble on some tracks. Geddy Lee has a smoother vocal sound on this album and he also sounded smoother at a recent concert I attended. Another must-have for the Rush fan.
B00838F4IE|5.0|Thought provoking look at the cosmos - hard to grasp ideas presented in concise and easy to understand language - must read for anyone interested in science and the world and universe in general
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|There is a great lesson behind the whole plot!  The story does a good job of invoking thought regarding moral issues.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was surprised again and again by all the twists and turns.  The included children's fairy tales were a plus.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|This time around it seems that DM have finally figured out how to turn off the distortion pedals on their F/X units, and focus more heavily on the one fundamental ingredient that helped make them the world's greatest synth band, the synthesizer! All kinds of vintage analogue synths on here. It sounds like the album which SHOULD have been the successor to 'Ultra'. So many good tracks on here.<br /><br />The standouts are: Soothe My Soul, Broken, Should Be Higher, Heaven, Goodbye, and Welcome To My World.<br /><br />Still falls short of recapturing their 80s and early-90s strength & swagger, but they're FINALLY back on the right track. It's nice to hear Depeche Mode trying to be Depeche Mode for once, and not trying to reinvent the wheel. If you're a long-time fan who's been disappointed with every album since 'SOFAD' or 'Ultra', this is the album to pick up to help renew your faith in them.
B004ZG5F28|3.0|With the message \\"you too can be accepted JUST the way you are.\\"  A movie like this is a breather from all the cruelty and hostility of dramas these days.  Women will laugh out loud.  Men will at least smile at some of the absurd coincidences.  Poor Bridget is just unlucky in every respect until the stars line up her way.  Everybody learns to stop judging a book by it's cover and see the \\"heart of gold\\" hidden within.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another excellent chapter. I can't wait to start the next one. Following it on JOB also, it's like the book cane to life.
