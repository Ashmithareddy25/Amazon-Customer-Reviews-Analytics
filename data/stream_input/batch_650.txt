B000HIVQK8|4.0|This album was Harrison's first chance to record an album on which the songs weren't mostly written during his last years with The Beatles. He uses the opportunity to reflect on his relationships with the other Beatles (\\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\") and to explore the intersection between his faith and the pop music audience he'd gained in The Beatles and with his previous album, All Things Must Pass. The beautiful song \\"Give Me Love\\" is his highest accomplishment in this regard, on this album or any other. \\"Give Me Love\\" includes all of Harrison's skills: his recently-honed slide guitar style, his country roots, and his lyrical tribute to love.
B00005R62N|4.0|I already owned or taped all of Judas Priest's studio albums when this came out, questioning its necessity, but the recording technology of this album was immensely improved over the sound quality of the earlier albums.  I didn't know until recently that some tracks were redone in the studio, which might partly explain why the album sounds so crisp, but Judas Priest was also at their peak musically at this time, 1979, so redoing any songs and having them sound better would make sense.  I would recommend this album over JP's three first studio albums, Rocka Rolla, Sad Wings of Destiny, and Sin After Sin, as the most relevant songs are here and sound better.  For redoing songs in the studio, there are still screwups like the intro from Rob Halford on The Sinner sounds like he saying \\"The Savage\\", at least it does on the album I own. <br /> <br />This is still 70's metal, so for those that find music recorded from that time dated or just hate it, will feel the same about this album.  But for those that like 70's hard rock and/or Judas Priest, this is a classic!
B00000IMYA|5.0|Specially, I like the long solo of Bud Gonsalves. It's really swings.
B00005R62K|5.0|Many of the other reviews give many comments on the songs etc, so I'll write about some of the esoteric stuff I haven't read here.  For those that don't know what the hard rock scene was in 1978 when this album came out, this was a time before video games were available, let alone computers, and VHS recorder/players (the predecessors of DVD's) were only at universities or other institutions that had money for the cost of these relatively rare machines of that time.  1978 is when music and the stereo ruled.  You had the turntable, receiver, and stereo speakers with 12\\" woofers and you got together with friends, put on some awesome rock album that just came out and you *listened* to the music.  This is a time when music bands and concerts ruled.  Judas Priest's Stained Class is one of the albums that ruled at that time.   <br /> <br />When Stained Class came out, the recording technology blew away anything before it.  Recording technology improved immensely during the 70's and you can hear the improved sound between this record and previous Judas Priest albums or even any early 70's progressive rock album such as that by Yes, etc.  Some may have written that the recording sounds bad, but believe me, when this record came out, it was cutting edge.  This brings up a good point.  This was for many years one of my 10 desert album discs or if you could only bring 10 albums/CD's before the planet exploded, this would have been one of them, but after multitudes of listenings, even I can say this album is somewhat dated.  So for younger listeners this may not be as awesome as some of the reviews let on, those reviews are more of a statement of the album's importance when it was released and may be more for those who were around when this came out.  For those that don't want something dated, there is a Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal that have more modern bands playing, but this too is from 1997 and also slightly dated, but there may be other more up to date tributeCD's.  From what I've heard, many bands that play JP covers, revere the band, and play great versions of the songs, albeit with their own style. <br /> <br />Stained Class was supposed to be a takeoff on the term \\"stained glass.\\"  I must have listened to the title track dozens of times, but could not understand what Rob Halford was singing on that song.  There are websites that can be found with a web-search for those that want to know the lyrics to the songs.  The lyrics, however, of the juggernaut of the album, Beyond the Realms of Death, were more or less clear.  Others have written that this song was about suicide, and to me, it was a bit more than that.  It was about someone that goes insane, or withdraws into their own mind leaving the outside world, depending on your point of view.  Whether this person kills themselves or withdraws so much into themselves that they're dead to the outside world is unclear. <br /> <br />There is also the drugginess associated with the album.  From the possible meaning from Exciter of: \\"when ignition hits you\\", to Beyond the Realms of Death where: \\"He had enough...\\" sounded to me as \\"He had an up/he couldn't take anymore.\\"  Then there's the album cover itself.  Whoa!  Again, now it may seem moot, but at the time, it was this wild up-to-date psychedelic album cover with all sorts of \\"images\\" reflected off of the supposed metallic skull, with two beams of light entering it, and one beam exiting.  This was a time when music was still released on records and the larger album art work allowed one to appreciate it more. <br /> <br />Until relatively recently I didn't know Better By You, Better Than Me was a cover song, and I much didn't care, and thought it fit in well with the style of the album.  I would recommend the remastered versions of any 70's album, as the standard CD transference missed overtones that made the songs on the album so awesome.  The two bonus tracks, I have read elsewhere, are first an outtake from the 1987 RamIt Down sessions, and the live tune from a 1990 L.A. concert.   <br /> <br />For those that might be interested in Judas Priest's three earlier albums, Rocka Rolla, Sad Wings of Destiny, and Sin After Sin, I would recommend the Live: Unleashed In the East instead.  The live album offers good performances of the songs, much tighter, crisper, and most of their relevant songs from the earlier albums.  Most of Judas Priest's subsequent albums go downhill from the Live album.  I looked for a Best of Compilation that had JP's best songs, Exciter, Stained Class, and BTROD, and there weren't any and realized that Stained Class is JP's Best Of album. <br /> <br />Enjoy!

B000002KYR|5.0|Released in 1983, ZZ Top's 8th album, Eliminator, would break them into their mainstream. Prior to this, the blues-rock band was primarily a staple of album rock radio as tunes like \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\", \\"Tush\\", \\"La Grange\\", and \\"I Thank You\\", while popular, weren't exactly the toast of the pop charts. Therefore, ZZ Top made two changes to their arsenal that would help make them superstars. The first was adding a hint of synthesizer to their sound that made their songs more danceable while not sounding poppy. The second change was more visual as they embraced MTV by producing a string of memorable videos to complement their songs. As a result, ZZ Top had gained a whole new audience while retaining most of their faithful followers, leading Eliminator to stay in the Billboard Top 40 albums for over a year and a half and become their biggest selling album.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\", which would be an MTV staple in the early-80's and continues to receive generous airplay on classic rock radio. While not released as a single, \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\" would also become a popular track that you still hear once in a while. \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" would become their second big MTV hit and is contains their most famous riff (although some would argue that \\"La Grange\\" should gain this honor). The third big MTV staple would be the catchy track \\"Legs\\" that would prove so popular that the song would become the band's first Top 10 hit. While all of these tunes have become classics, all of the remaining tracks are nearly on the same level. \\"TV Dinners\\", which also had an MTV video, would become a minor hit single while the mid-tempo \\"I Need You Tonight\\" is a great track featuring a wicked guitar solo from Billy Gibbons. Another strong track is \\"Thug\\", which sounds like a piece of space funk with its sound effects and Dusty Hill's slap bass. The remaining tracks, \\"I Got the Six\\", \\"Dirty Dog\\", \\"If I Could Only Flag Her Down\\", and \\"Bad Girl\\" are all strong hard rockers that are actually helped by the updated production. All told, Eliminator would bring ZZ Top to the masses and along with their `70s releases Tres Hombres and Deguello, is their best work.ard rockers that are actually helped by the updated production.

0671015206|5.0|What a well written and easily comprehendable book!  The author outlines specifically the world we live in and the world we should create in our own financial situations.  I am in real estate and grew up with a better than average background of finances and how to handle money.  I still fell into traps of credit card debt and spending but after reading this book and several others, I found the guidelines I needed to get back on track.  The interesting thing about this book is that after you have read about half the book, you start thinking about people you know that are the millionaires next door.  People who have their act together, who live average so that they can live above average later.  This sound philosophy is something we have to teach our own kids if any of us care about the economy, personal debt totals, and increasing credit card debt. The next generation thinks that since Mommy and Daddy drive around in brand new cars or use credit cards to pay for everything, that makes them rich.  The author cuts through todays' misconceptions that most younger people have with money and gets back to the \\"roots\\" of handling money like the world war 2 generation did and before.  Super book.
0451191153|1.0|THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a \\"passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential.\\"   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.        Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.    Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its \\"leveling effects.\\"      Here's the problem with her \\"philosophy:\\"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.       Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are \\"deep.\\"     In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today.

0767817486|4.0|Saw this a long time ago and it struck me as a 70's liberal film. (it's always easier to be outraged when the oppressor is a one dimensional third world ogre).<br /><br />The one part of the film I thought was most thought provoking was William<br /><br />Haye's statement after he found that he had been sentenced to thirty- rather- than 3 years. The arguement went something like this: crime is only a question of the will of the majority- there are no absolute categories of right and wrong. What is and is not criminal changes from time to time based on popular opinion. The people who administer this so called justice are- in classic sixties and seventies finger pointing- no better than pigs.<br /><br />The implications of this thought are manifold: had Oliver- who I admire-<br /><br />stumbled on some good acid; is justice, as in the thought of Michel Foucault- a function of historical power forces; should everything, as in DeSade, be permitted. Is there such a thing as \\"victiomless crimes?\\" And<br /><br />most importantly, is there any objective standard of right and wrong or,<br /><br />in a Nietzchean sense, good an evil.<br /><br />If we apply this logic to the \\"detainees at guantanomo bay,\\" they seem much less guilty than Billy Hayes. Also why are all the Turks portayed<br /><br />as weasals, pedarasts, and, generally subhuman. Billy's impassioned plea about the blatant unfairness of his sentence extence cannot erase the stench of half a millenium of eurocentric cultural and political imperialism. For his time (at the time of this film) Jimmy Carter was a<br /><br />great humanitarian and inspirational leader who was born to early or late to be fully appreciated.<br /><br />I don't have have an answer but perhaps this may begin productive dialogue<br /><br />in our increasingly mindless culture. One thing to be sure, Billy Hayes,<br /><br />in spite of his trangressions, is still representative of the dark side<br /><br />of cowboy capatilism and the American dream. Nevertheless, his \\"postmodern\\" arguement of moral relativism is still with us today.\\" arguement of moral relativism is still with us today. <br />

B000F1IQNC|4.0|Watching Nanny McPhee is so much fun! I really enjoyed this fresh take on a rather un-Mary-Poppins-like nanny who whips seven (that's right, SEVEN) rebellious children into shape. First of all, good for Emma Thompson, who doesn't mind donning a few warts and a fat suit to make Nanny McPhee all that she should be. The kids are adorable, Colin Firth (as their bumbling father) is endearing, and Nanny McPhee walks off with the whole show. As an added bonus, Angela Lansbury gives a hilarious supporting performance as the children's crotchety great aunt. This is a fun family film, but it is also entertaining for adults. Two thumbs up!

B000J10EQU|4.0|Superman Returns was cast pretty well. Newcomer Brandon Routh was very convincing as the Man of Steel. He certainly looks the part, and I thought he was as believable as a caped, flying, invincible man could be. Kate Bosworth was inoffensive but unremarkable as Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey turned in solid performances as Lex Luthor and Kitty Kowalski. James Marsden again plays \\"the man the leading lady doesn't love\\" as Richard White. (It's getting to be a habit with him - The Notebook, X-Men - he plays the nice, cute guy that doesn't really get the girl. Will somebody please stop typecasting this dude? James Marsden deserves love, too!! I'm tired of seeing him disappointed on the big screen!) The CGI effects were great, with scenes of Superman in space, saving airplanes, etc., being particularly visually arresting.<br /><br />I think that I had a few problems with the script, though. First of all, the movie is VERY slow to start. The first twenty minutes are awfully choppy, with WAY too much exposition. Basically, I wanted to get to the part where we see Brandon Routh in the Superman suit, to see if this new guy was going to give us a Superman we could believe. Well, I did, and he is, but the movie took far too long to get us there.<br /><br />Secondly, I think that Superman did a few things in this movie that are very contrary to the general public's idea of what Superman should be doing. First of all, it behooves me to set this up: In Superman Returns, Lois Lane is engaged to another man, and she has a son. Superman, under the cover of night, flies to her house (which she shares with her little family) and uses his X-ray vision and super-hearing to spy on a private conversation she's having in the kitchen. WHAT? Superman is NOT a peeping tom, for crying out loud! According to the iconography of the Superman myth, the story we've been telling and listening to about Superman for 50 years, this is really incompatible. Also, later, Superman visits Lois Lane on the roof of the Daily Planet building. Even though he knows she's engaged to someone else, he moves to kiss her, and she stops him. I don't think the Superman I know would be kissing on someone who is already engaged to another man. I don't know, I just felt that, in many ways, this movie tried to dismantle parts of the shiny clean image of Superman. It was incongruent, and I'm not sure I liked it.<br /><br />I think the whole point of these scenes may have been to make Superman look more human, more falliable. For example, in a scene where Superman has been weakened by Kryptonite, we see him get worked over by a few worthless henchmen. And not just a few jabs to the stomach. I mean, we see Superman crawling through dirty water, running away from these two-bit thugs. It was a very disturbing image, because the American public doesn't think of Superman that way. Director Bryan Singer really took some chances, playing with such an iconic brand like this.<br /><br />Anyway, I definitely think the movie is worth seeing, although not a slam dunk. I will bar any final judgements about this new endeavor to resurrect the Superman franchise until I see how future movies play out.Lane on the roof of the Daily Planet building.

B000J103PC|1.0|This is a dull movie about that young chick being the slave, gopher, I mean Admin. Assistant to the lady played by Streep.  The chick runs all around town getting Starbucks (yuck), fetching the dryclean, and has all sorts of mishaps in between, and in the end, gets yelled at for not doing things right.  Then she cries and acts like its the end of the world when she should have quit the first day.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.  SO many other GREAT movies out there, check out Little Miss Sunshine, for example for some good laughs and heart-warming message.
B000J103OI|4.0|While the movie is many things that critics have called it (predictable, pat, etc.), it is still worth watching because of Streep's elegant performance. Quick set up: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway), a smart journalism grad trying to make her way in the big city, is jobless and luckless. In desperation, she goes on an interview to Runway magazine, a fashion publication she's barely heard of. Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a dragonlady workaholic with a penchant for steaks and Starbucks, hires the unlikely girl as her second assistant. The movie then follows Andy and Miranda as their professional relationship continues.<br /><br />Director David Frankel had better be glad that Miranda is such a primary character in this script, because Streep elevated the material (as she always does). Many other actresses might have played Miranda as a screamer, driven by anger and a perverse pleasure in others' misery. However, Streep makes her real. She is ambitious; she works like a dog; she is exacting; and she expects no less from those who work for her. Because, time and again, the viewer sees how hard Miranda works, it's difficult to write her off as a hate-able character. After all, she doesn't ask her employees to work any harder than she's working herself. As well, I loved the calm, the feeling of business-as-usual that Streep exuded as Miranda. She never raised her voice. She rarely seemed to get emotionally involved in her business decisions. She just did her job. It's a very interesting protrait of a woman at the top in her chosen profession. I can see why Streep made many of the choices she made, and I think she was wonderful in the role.<br /><br />To boot, there are other, less noble reasons to go see The Devil Wears Prada. First, the clothes and how each character wears them make for fascinating study. Secondly, you'll discover some of the best movies lines ever while watching. (\\"I'm one stomach flu away from my goal weight,\\" mentions one character. \\"She's a sadist . . . and not in the good way,\\" opines another.

B000005RTQ|5.0|This was the first album by Saxon that I ever heard and maybe that predjudiced me towards it, but I think it is the best one that they ever recorded (not that any of their other albums were bad). From the very first lick in the prelude, the first thing that hits you is the awesome drum tracks. I mean, they have the sound and the acoustics for this entire album tuned in perfectly, but the drums, to me, just stand out. \\"Just Let Me Rock\\" is by far one of the best rock anthems, in my opinion, of all time, but there is nary a bad song in the group. As a matter of fact, all of them flat out kill. At one point in time, this cassette got stuck in my tape deck in my van (with a 3500 watt system)and I was fine with that....for all two months of it. Give it a try---you won't be dissapointed.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|My two favorite dream theater albums are Images & Words and SFAM.  I also care a great deal for the first disc of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Train of Thought is somewhat of a mixed bag.  I would say that I love roughly 80-85% of the album, whereas the other 15-20% often sounds quite unappealing.  The 85% makes up James LaBrie's soaring vocal melodies, amazing solos by Petrucci and Rudess, and some of the most crushing, tight, and imaginative jams by the band's four instrumentalists.  The bad 15-20% is made up by some rather corny, generic guitar riffs, nu-metal inspired vocals (rapping and shouting with distortion), and weak, rather unmelodic songwriting.  No song is 100% good, though there are a few songs on the album that come pretty close.  However, for the most part, I really enjoy a good portion of a song, but there are always sections that irritate me.  When you are writing ten minutes songs, however, it's difficult to keep them engaging all the way through.  I found that SDOIT suffered from this same syndrome, with very lengthy songs that often resorted to gimmickry and lack of creativity to keep the songs long. <br /> <br />Either way, Train of Thought is definitely a good album, though maybe not a great one.  It is easily the best example of the band's musicianship, showcasing especially well their ability to change time signatures and jam off of eachother in a simultaneously metal and progressive style.  Just about every song has at least one nugget of true creative and musical genius, generally instrumental.  I'd say that LaBrie is the member who actually does worst on this album, with a lot of sub-par vocal performances.  However, there are also times when he makes me remember partly why I love Dream Theater so much, as on his passionate performance during \\"In The Name of God.\\" <br /> <br />It's rare to find a band that is so full of talented musicians, with the groovy, acrobatic basslines of John Myung, the syncopated, deceptively \\"simple\\" and ever-changing drumming of Mike Portnoy, the sheer versatility and lightning-fast picking technique of John Petrucci, the surprisingly innovative keyboard flourishes of Jordan Rudess, and the deliciously over-the-top vocal performances of James LaBrie. <br /> <br />The album is solid, and aside from maybe trying to be too \\"heavy\\" in parts without having the substance to back it up, I'd recommend Train of Thought to any Dream Theater fan...Especially those who felt that they were taking a step in the right direction with their previous album, SDOIT.  This is more of similar material, though it can sometimes border on nu-metal, which is a huge turn off.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Despite the fact he's one of the most respected actors/directors around, the films that I've seen him direct haven't really been that good for me. I despised Mystic River and I didn't get why there was so much love for Million Dollar Baby. However, most people will just end up saying \\"well then watch Unforgiven\\" so not being one to dismiss something outright, I thought sure, why not? Well I don't regret it one bit. While it's certainly a different western than others I've seen, that's kind of what makes it unique as well: a character-based study set in the West as opposed to outlaws tearing up the Wild West. <br /> <br />After being ridiculed by the size of his manhood, Quick Mike cuts up a prostitute named Delilah, leaving her face scarred. Quick Mike and his partner however get punished by the town sheriff, Little Bob, by giving up some of their ponies. Outraged at the lack of severity in the punishment, the mother figure Alice gets the other women to pool their savings and offer a bounty on the 2. <br /> <br />Reluctantly answering the call is William Munny, a pig farmer living with his 2 children. It's a different life for him and one he desperately needs since not only did his wife pass but he used to be a very ruthless killer once. Since the money's too good to pass up, he goes for it and along the way, he brings his buddy Ned, who's quite the sharpshooter. Only things don't go exactly as planned since not only is a no firearm policy heavily enforced but the 2 men are actually protected. For both this is not just a simple bounty and the whole thing plays out like a morality play with no clear winners. <br /> <br />One thing that first hits you about the film is how untypical of a western it is. Unlike, let's say, Tombstone, this town almost seems eerily quiet and without life. There's a stillness that's new to me and I liked seeing it. Reminded me of visiting my grandparent's cabin where it was just you and nothing else. It's also perfectly shot with very lushcamera shots of valleys and the skies. Also, the film doesn't really have that huge gun shootout you often see. For some, it might be disappointing since gun battles are brief and not as dynamic as say, Open Range's is or other ones. It does set the film from most other ones since there's not really a melancholy but a certain relaxed feeling or a subdued feeling rather than big dynamic Wild West gunplay. <br /> <br />Acting of course is spot-on from Eastwood to Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. While Richard Harris does do a great job in his scenes, the actual character can probably be taken out and it wouldn't do a huge blow to the film. It mainly shows what happens to people who try to go for the bounty or break the no firearm policy but it's not ultimately that important. Also, there's a young sidekick William and Ned take along with them that was so irritating I wish one of them would shoot him and say \\"shut up already\\". The pacing also might get people, since as I said, it's more subdued than the more energetic Tombstone was. Besides the might-be troublesome pacing and that annoying brat, the film's quite great regardless.  <br /> <br />The film in a way isn't like most Best Picture winners where they're larger-than-life and big and epic but it's also well-made with surprising direction by Eastwood and a good message concerning guns. So far it's the best Eastwood film I've seen although I haven't seen Flags or Iwo Jima yet.

B0000042MY|5.0|When I watched the film and listened to the music I was struck by how well the music fit the film, and at the same time that the music was obviously so Celtic (confirmed by one of the tracks being performed by Clannad).  I have pondered why the Celtic music of the film fits so perfectly with a 1992 film (done in 1930s style, i.e. no sex, bad language, etc.) from a story of early 19th century classic American literature.  The reason the music works is that Celtic music is Western music of struggle, much as Russian music is.  Having been oppressed by the English for hundreds of years, the Scots and the Irish had music that reflected their difficulties.  The minor keys of the music in this film not only heighten the sense of passion between Hawkeye and Cora far more than any nude or sex scene could, but also the sense of doomed romance between them.  The main them of the film successfully conveys the sense of epic scope of the story, as the film itself is one of the very best ever made, and certainly the triump of director Michael Mann's career.<br /><br />Ignore Jerry McCulley's amazon.com review of the soundtrack.  He obviously didn't understand the film, or the period of time and place that generated the story behind it.  His lack of comprehension of the film translates into a lack of appreciation for the soundtrack.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a shame this great series got cancelled after just one season. It has a wonderful blend of action, adventure, romance and humor that is highly addictive. Just watch a couple of episodes and it will be no mystery why Firefly produced hordes of rabid fans known as Browncoats. There's a perfect balance of grit and glitz in this Old West meets the wilds of space gem. Joss Whedon lets his talent shine in this fabulous creation. The cast is probably the most cohesive group of actors I've ever seen in a sci-fi show and they work so well together that their characters are utterly real and believable. This is top notch entertainment worthy of inclusion in any sci-fi fan's collection. Double your pleasure, double your fun by getting it with the Serenity movie which is more of the same with a bigger, better budget and effects(also top-notch!).
B000244FDW|5.0|Faithfully Jane Austen. I like how Mr and Mrs Bennet are played. I also like Darcy - he really does look like he is grieving for his parents and in love at the same time. I love the letter scene and the scenes at Pemberley.
0671027387|3.0|This book created a theoretical plot that goverment and agencies fabricate the theory of global warming and are willing to go to great lengths to maintain that panic and concern. In the long term reading of Dan Browns writings, one can quickly gather that he finds fun in fantasizing about mysterious \\"high up\\" agency coverups that, if unearthed, could ultimately alter world wide thinking. I enjoyed the book but found it slow and lacking in depth, at times. There was fault in the depth of his characters, overuse in scientific terminology (what were half of those things, anyway?), a lack in developing gripping and believable situations and moments where I expected the book to delve deeper into my emotions but was sadly disappointed. Chapters of the books most \\"dangerous moments\\" of near death incidents were underdeveloped by a sudden \\"rescue\\" or \\"solution\\" without ever creating authenticity in the moment, for the reader. It is a good book for \\"bedtime\\" reading. I enjoyed the alternative way to view global concerns, but its believability is far fetched at best. I never had a problem putting it down when it was time to retire for the evening. Overall it was enjoyable but not the grab I was expecting.

B000I5X81K|5.0|Groban is one of those few artists that actually use music to write music. Using real musical notational theory to write his songs, which pleases not only the non-musical folk but the musical ones as well. The dissonances in \\"February Song\\" is enough to make a girl's heart melt into a puddle. His technique is great and his voice doesn't sound strained at all, more like dark chocolate.  <br /> <br />I would love to see him do more than popular music and hit the opera world.

B00000K413|5.0|Like Simon & Garfunkel a generation earlier the Tears for Fear duo of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith will with any luck shine bright for generations to come.  The Hurting is their best album and one of the best (top 10) from the 80s (IMHO), all songs resonate and reach deeply inside.  The opening to Pale Shelter embodies the mid-80's soaring atmospheric Alt-rock sound. While other Alt-heads were going gaga over bands like New Order, The Smiths and The Cure (yes, all great acts....U2 is a different story altogether) some of us were cheering for Alt-Alt bands like TFF, Howard Jones, The Cars, Echo & The Bunnymen {and for me all courtesy of the once great WLIR radio station in New York (now reborn and webcasting!)}.  Thank you Roland and Curt for your great gift to us.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this dvd set, boy am I sure glad I changed my mind. This dvd set rocks. From the performance to director Maryln Atkins to the camera angles everything is awesome with this Cream Reunion dvd. ERIC CLAPTON, GINGER BAKER, JACK BRUCE, HAVE NOT LOST ANYTHING!!!!The song list is simple and is played out beautifully as each track is disected right in front of you at the Royal Albert Hall. This concert is filmed in high definition and the sound even on my regular tv is incredibly loud, on my theatre system it's like having Cream live in my home. Alot of thought and effort was put into this dvd release. I read the great reviews but still was hesitant and just thought \\"Cream Live At Royal Albert Hall\\" was just another stupid, horribly produced concert video. I was so wrong. Cream has made alot of money with this concert reunion and Cream merchandise as well as this dvd. That's all fine and good, as high earning is to be expected with a band of Creams magnitude. Believe me there is no cheap production qualities with this dvd, the one thing producer James Pluta did was give the buyers of this dvd concert set their moneys worth. You get the best performances of each song from one of the four nights Cream performed. If you're not a Cream fan, you will be after this watching this dvd. I'm so glad these guys are back together. CLAPTON, BRUCE, BAKER might be older but what you are seeing is a genuine psychedelic rock band from the 1960s perform in the 21st century. \\"Cream Live At Royal Albert Hall\\" speaks volumes of great music, memories and an important era in rock music history \\"THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA\\". I can't say enough about this dvd. There are no lasers or billion dollar stage shows here, what you get is raw talent and your focus is on the musicians not a stupid high priced laser show covering up a bands limited talent. What you see is pure talent, no fillers nothing to psych you out. Watching this \\"Cream Live At Royal Albert Hall\\" is pure rock history performed right in front of your eyes. This dvd set is a well thought out and produced package.  \\"Cream Live At Royal Albert Hall\\" is highly recommended viewing, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!

B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago was raw, energetic and creative and spoke volumes of jazz, fusion, blues and above all Rock-n-Roll. The first song \\"Introduction\\" is in my opinion one of the best lead off tunes on an lp ever. The great James William Guerico produced CTA and a long line of Chicago platnium lps throughout the 1970s. \\"Beginnings\\", \\"South California Purples\\" \\"Questions 67 and 68\\", I'm A Man, every song on this cd translates to a Chicago Magnum Opus. \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" was recorded for three weeks of January 1969 at CBS/Columbia Records at the labels famed East Coast Studios in New York City. The linear literature is very interesting, the bw photos let you see a young faceless Chicago with the likes  of musicians Terry Kath, Walter Parazaider, Peter Cetera, Danny Seraphine, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, Robert Lamm. Faceless but a band that made a landmark album. I match this recording (CTA) with any Beatles or Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who,recordings, or any band of the 1960s or 1970s. I really feel the release Chicago Transit Authority was actually admired by these afore mentioned bands. Highly recommended listening to  a very influential recording. 10 STARS HANDS DOWN...................................

B00004RFCM|4.0|Before the ladies of Sex and the City had a clothing budget that rivaled Oprah's net worth, they were just four thirty-somethings focused on navigating the trials and tribulations of dating in Manhattan. The first season is pretty much verbatim from the Candace Bushnell book of columns for which the show is named, and it bears very little resemblance to the show that eventually evolved. The pilot looks very much like it was filmed in the mid-90s and seems to have been filmed months, if not years, before the following episodes. SJP's hair is a dingy brown, Kristin Davis is sporting a flipped bob haircut, Cynthia Nixon has a cell phone so huge it reminds me of Zach Morris', and Kim Cattrall has the worst hair extensions I've seen since Britney Spears. Also, the first season has a \\"man on the street\\" section where, similar to the HBO show Real Sex, the camera focuses on typical New Yorkers and asks them how they feel about the topic of Carrie's topic for the week. Carrie herself talks to the camera frequently as well, which can be disconcerting if you've only seen the later episodes. There are all sorts of little hidden gems in this original season, like the knowledge that Samantha actually had her eyes set on Big way before Carrie got him, Charlotte's been obsessed with marriage from the very beginning, and Miranda wasn't always such a workaholic. Though it's not nearly as good as the seasons that followed, the first season of Sex and the City is definitely worth watching to see the humble beginnings of a show that changed the way women view themselves, their friendships, and their relationships.
B00005JPAM|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" provides us with a fascinating glimpse into the heart of a royal - or, in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, quite possibly the void where that heart ought to be.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the weeks following the death of the beloved Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 (Diana had just recently gotten divorced from Prince Charles, so technically, she was no longer a part of the royal family). It was during this period of intense national mourning that the Queen demonstrated that she had a tin ear when it came to gauging the mood and feelings of her subjects. For many days, as the grieving multitudes gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, weeping uncontrollably and laying down a veritable sea of flowers in the Princess' memory, the Royals remained holed up on a country estate, voluntary captives to \\"protocol,\\" making not so much as a single public statement acknowledging Diana's death or providing any words of solace to a hurting nation.<br /><br />The coldness of the reaction prompted many in England to seriously consider abolishing the monarchy altogether, once and for all consigning it to the ash heap of history as a quaint relic of a bygone era, an anachronistic institution that had long since outlived its usefulness. Yet, the film is much more sympathetic in its treatment of the monarch than that barebones synopsis would suggest, for more than anything else, it sees the queen less as a heartless monster than as an old-fashioned woman ill-equipped to deal with a modern world where baring one's soul in public has become the unquestioned norm and even a dignified solemn funeral is turned into a celebrity-laden, made-for-TV spectacle. She seems genuinely baffled and stunned by the unprecedented outpouring of grief over Diana's death, partly because of the queen's own animosity towards the woman whom she felt demeaned the court by many of her actions, and partly because the queen herself hails from a time when one did one's grieving in private, and when the sole role of a leader in a time of national crisis was to project an image of \\"stiff-upper-lipped\\" stoicism and strength for her people.<br /><br />It would have been easy for writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to have concentrated exclusively on the queen's aloofness and coldness, to have turned her into a caricature of the snooty, self-absorbed, \\"let them eat cake\\" aristocrat. Instead, the filmmakers insist on seeing her as a fully rounded human being, strong willed and unemotional, yet capable of being wounded by the disapproval of her subjects and of extending a hand of compassion to others in her own uniquely subtle way.<br /><br />Small wonder that Helen Mirren has been showered with every conceivable acting honor for her incomparable portrayal of this complex woman. Mirren has been handed the challenge of illuminating a character who is, by her very nature, unimpassioned and undemonstrative. As such, the actress has had to rely almost exclusively on the subtlest of expressions and gestures to convey the brittleness, stoicism and genuine royal dignity of a woman who literally grew up in the role of one of the world's longest-serving monarchs (she notes early on in the film that the first person to serve as her Prime Minister was a certain someone named Winston Churchill). Yet, Mirren's ability to also show us the queen's compassionate and vulnerable side is what brings the character to life and engages our interest.<br /><br />Mirren is matched by the brilliant Michael Sheen, whose performance as the newly elected Tony Blair is every bit as mesmerizing as hers. Blair comes off so favorably in this film that one is tempted to suspect some sort of collusion on the part of the scriptwriter and the Prime Minister himself. As envisioned by Morgan, Blair is the perfect foil for the queen, a \\"modern\\" man who is able to ever-so-gently prod her highness into saving her royal arse by doing the right thing politically. ForBlair is, if nothing else, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, when all around him are calling for imperial heads to roll, shrewdly knows that a palace coup would not be in the best interests of England at this time.<br /><br />There are fine performances too by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mum, Alex Jennings as a very milquetoasty Prince Charles, and Helen McCrory as Blair's straightforward, no-nonsense wife who can't understand how her Labor Party husband could be so willing to help the queen extricate herself from the rather sticky wicket she's gotten herself into. The film supplies a generous helping of actual newsreel footage from the time to effectively flesh out the context of the drama.<br /><br />Almost in spite of itself, the film winds up moving us, even though, in terms of style, \\"The Queen\\" is every bit as dry, brittle - some might even say \\"stuffy\\" - as the woman who is its subject. Which is precisely why - for all us Anglophiles out here in particular - it makes for such a jolly good show at the cinema.tically.

B000I0QL82|5.0|I found this movie to be a lighthearted feel good movie with a happy ending. Good for tradidional Christmas viewing or any other time of the year for that matter. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys music, dancing and comedy. As a classic oldie it definately stands the test of time and can hold it's own against any contempory offerings
B000JJRIN4|1.0|This CD was an abomination!!  Gwen needs to get back to her roots.  Many of the tracks felt like they were just thrown together.  The songs were also aimed specifically at dance clubs, which leaves her old fans hanging out to dry.  Only 3 tracks were tolerable, \\"Sweet Escape,\\" \\"4 AM,\\" and \\"Wonderful Life.\\"  I think it is wonderful Gwen is trying to find new sounds, however, it should not be at the cost of alienating the fans who have been with her from the beginning.  Maybe the next CD should go through a focus group before hitting the store shelves.
B000H305U0|4.0|I first heard the music from this album on Ellen.  And it got burned on my brain and I couldn't make it go away.<br /><br />The music is cool and the singing is pretty good.  The only thing I wonder about is how he outsourced \\"Chop Me Up\\" to Three 6 Mafia.  That is a cool song too, it just seems mismatched to the rest of the album and that particular song is all Three 6 Mafia, not Justin.  We are going from a techno club beat to gangsta rap, then back to a techno mix.<br /><br />Good CD though, and I would recommend it as a good addition to any music collection.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Just the fact that Al Gore has been researching global warming since college, should at least make people take notice.

I already agreeded with him and other inviornmentalits telling us what we were doing to our planet. <br /> <br />He should have been elected President in 2000 (actually, he was) but even then, the Congress & their lobbist's would have still tried to sweep it all under the rug.
B000G759LW|4.0|I am not really a fan, but I saw a Behind the Music show about Christina and really gained respect for her voice.<br /><br />Her previous pieces of work did not impress me, I think, because they seem pretty juvenile and are just too much like all of the other music that is already out there.<br /><br />The content of this album, however, really showcases her musical ability and amazing voice.  There is a real variety in the types of music on this album that cover a wide range of moods and genres.  It is definitely a more appealing, grown-up piece of work than any of her previously released works and I would recommend it as a great addition to round out your music collection.
B00005JPGM|5.0|This is definitely a movie that the critics have rated correctly. Briliant film about truth of the Diamond trade in Africa.  I am always leary about watching this kind of film, thinking it may just be some hollywood producer with a politcal chip on their shoulders, but this movie is really well done and the performances are great. Leonardo Decaprio does well and deserves his Oscar Nomination, but his performance is Honestly dwarfed by Djimon Hounsou, who in my book steal the show and of the two of them will be the one holding the statue at the end of the day.  The movie is very graphic and violent, so be forwarned.  Definite movie to see. unfortunately, I don't know if even a penny from seeing it will go to remedy the situation it was written about, thats the only drawback I see, but it will make most think more than twice before looking at a Diamond and its credentials.
B000EQ47HC|4.0|It is a sad day. Brad Delp has passed on, leaving the legacy of great music for us old enough to remember when a great singer could really lift our spirits in rock. (3/10/07)<br /><br />The legendary Tom Sholz creative process took it in the chin for the second Boston album. The old cliche about having your entire life to create your debut and six months to make your second came agonizingly true to form when \\"Don't Look Back\\" began to come to life. The record company wanted more hits yesterday and Tom and the band weren't ready (at least by Sholz's exacting standards). So, three years, eight songs and a couple of legal issues later, \\"Don't Look Back\\" hit the shelves.<br /><br />It was very much from the same cloth as the debut, with that first side of the twelve inch vinyl being absolutely stunning, followed by a side two that didn't measure up - and this time, sounded like retreads. \\"Party\\" was a re-write of \\"Smokin'\\" and \\"Feeling Satisfied\\" covered the same ground as \\"Rock and Roll Band.\\" Even the new version's liner notes allude to the somewhat dissapointing response fans of the almost three year-old debut felt upon first listen to \\"Don't Look Back.\\" The stun of the new and unheard is muted by the familair strains of this second album.<br /><br />But it was those first three songs on \\"Don't Look Back\\" that made me dig the album and jump at the re-mastered version almost 30 years later. The title cut was something Sholz admitted was a left-over track from the early days. As a statement of purpose, though, it's hard to beat. As multiple Brad Delps sing \\"I'm much too strong now to compromise,\\" it could easily be a metaphor for Boston's long but intermittent release schedule. Like the first album's \\"More Than A Feeling,\\" it is the sound of rock and roll as many of us imagined it in our minds. Sholz was able to tap into that state with an almost zen clarity.<br /><br />\\"The Journey/It's Easy\\" was this album's \\"Foreplay/Long Time.\\" Space rock that complimented the meaty hooks of \\"Don't Look Back,\\" with Queenly guitars and a Beatles influenced, harmony filled chorus. The topper was the majestic \\"A Man I'll Never Be.\\" The lost love lament starts as a piano ballad that builds with guitars and thicker layered vocals until Brad Delp sounds like the church choir at Our Lady of the Holy Heartbroken. Then, on top of that, a mammoth cathedral pipe organ crashes over the final chorus to maximize the drama. Sholz not only tried to do a Phil Spector wall-of-sound, he went for the Cathedral-of-sound, and got it. It could be one of the seventies' finest six and 1/2 minutes.<br /><br />The re-mastering makes it even better. Sholz painstakingly separated all the tracks and made this version of \\"Don't Look Back\\" the best yet. I may even be one of those fans who is glad there are no bonus tracks to mar this near-classic. (Think of the cruddy \\"bonus\\" songs on Meat Loaf's \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" or Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Agents Of Fortune\\" for examples of why bigger is not always better.) What was classic on original release needs no footnotes. Some 30 years later, this album still sounds like magic.th Queenly guitars and a Beatles influenced, harmony filled chorus.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|I make it a habit every year to watch at least the five best picture nominess for the Oscars.  Sometimes I am lucky and have seen one or two already and tend to have my favorite.<br /><br />This year, however, I have yet to catch up fully.<br /><br />The first stop on the list of films is the first one I have noticed is on DVD; Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />From the get go, this movie had three things going for it already.  First: Greg Kinnear, whom I have watched since Talk Soup and have seen almost all of his movies.  He is a constant surprise when it comes to acting.<br /><br />Secondly: Steve Carrell.  When one thinks of subtle comedy being hilarious, Steve Carrell is not the first name which comes to mind.  Often he's blaring while seeming innocent.  Witness \\"Bruce Almighty\\" or \\"Anchorman.\\"<br /><br />Third: Nominated for Best Picture...and other Oscars.  For some odd reason I tend to agree with the nominees on a yearly basis.  Based upon the description of the films, and the titles, there have been times wherein I have shuddered at the thought of watching given films.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a story about a dysfunctional family.  The patriarch (Greg Kinnear) is spending all of his time and effort, along with the family's money, into a success program he has developed.  There are nine steps in this program claiming to make anyone and everyone successful.  Ironically, he's a complete failure.<br /><br />There's Uncle Frank (the subtle and hilarious Steve Carell) who is a gay, formerly world class Professor respected world wide.  He is staying with his sister's (Toni Collette) family while being watched after a failed suicide attempt.  Again, his character has a mirrored and tragic twist as he has been a complete success his entire life and fails miserably trying to end it.<br /><br />We also meet Dwayne (Paul Dano.) He's the 15 year old son refusing to utter a word until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force pilot.  He has learned everything his knows about his philosiphy in life from Nietzsche.  He is using his silence as a way of quietly dealing with his family.<br /><br />Finally, there is Grampa and Little Miss Sunshine herself, Olive (as played by Academy Award nominees Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin respectively.) Grampa has recently been kicked out of a retirement home because of his attitude and vulgar demeanor.  He spends most of his time getting high on heroin and rehearsing a pageant routine with his granddaughter, Olive.  Olive has dreams of becoming a world famous Beauty Pageant Champion while having a small potbelly, larger than normal gapped teeth, and 80's style glasses.<br /><br />The family receives a call stating a contestant from a competition Olive was involved in had to drop out.  Therefore, Olive became the next contestant in line to take the crown of \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"  From there, the family sets its track for Rodondo Beach, CA to get her to the pageant.  Needless to say, comedy and mayhem ensue.<br /><br />This movie is quite funny.  It's not the normal slapstick, crude joke, idiotic comedy which is all too popular nowadays. (Jackass, Adam Sandler's resume.) Instead, it's a heartwarming, touching, life lesson learning film of the realistic, dysfunctional family we are all a part of.  In every group of related beings, there is undoubtedly one or two, but usually all the members which have some sort of knack for getting under the skin of everyone else.<br /><br />The journey this family takes while on the road to realize Olive's dream is one filled with lessons not only from the obvious (don't kill yourself),  but to the small, albeit grand rules in life we must learn the hard way (not everything will go you way...and there's more to life than meets the eye.)<br /><br />The oddest thing about the film is how bright it is, while having some of the darkest themes I have witnessed in a 'family film.'  Although this is an \\"R\\" rated family film, it's one I think is important for families to watch, once the children are older.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I suggest everyone watches this film simply because it's heartwrenching, funny, touching, and scary all wrapped into one sunny, 103 minute package.<br /><br />Watch, and enjoy!it's one I think is important for families to watch, once the children are older.   <br /> <br />Without giving too much away, I suggest everyone watches this film simply because it's heartwrenching, funny, touching, and scary all wrapped into one sunny, 103 minute package. <br /> <br />Watch, and enjoy! <br />
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Back in 1976, if you had a car stereo and were in High School - and your car had a \\"Disco S@cks\\" bumper-sticker on it - then you likely had a copy of the first Boston album in your tape-deck. Because if you had a thing for rock and roll fantasies, this album (especially side one) fulfilled every dream you had of exactly how a rock album should sound. Tom Scholz was a rock and roll uber-nerd who retentively labored over his basement tapes until every note was pitch perfect, every solo rang true, every handclap was ready for the stadiums, and every chorus sang out to his rock and roll heart. Those first three songs, \\"More Than A Feeling,\\" \\"Peace Of Mind\\" and \\"Foreplay/Long Time,\\" echoed like the concert of your dreams.<br /><br />In the disco-drenched seventies, \\"Boston\\" was manna from the Gods. Even the weaker second half still boogied better than most of what was out then. The self-mythology of \\"Rock and Roll Band\\" spoke not only of Sholz's dream, but of countless air-guitarists that had a garage with amps in the corner. \\"Smokin'\\" was party hardy for those weekends with your pals. Even \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight,\\" with its pseudo-southern rock, sounded good in those days.<br /><br />But it remains that first trio of songs that stake this album's five star rating. \\"More Than A Feeling\\" still sounds timeless. (Nirvana even copped to wanting \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to be as amazing as this original Boston single.) Brad Delp's multiple choirboy vocals - on this song and throughout \\"Boston\\" - would make Queen proud, and Sholz's guitar sounded like no-one else out there. The remastering (by Sholz) adds to the album's luster and legend. I'm even one of those fans who is actually glad there are no bonus tracks to mar a classic. (Think of the cruddy \\"bonus\\" songs on Meat Loaf's \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" or Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Agents Of Fortune\\" for examples of why bigger is not always better.) What was classic on original release needs no footnotes. Some 30 years later, this album still sounds like magic. You know you want it. Three decades and several format changes since it was a two-sided twelve inches of vinyl, \\"Boston\\" is still more than a feeling from the best rock and roll band to explode from a techie's basement.<br /><br />(N.B.: It is a sad day.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|In this day and time, people are hungry for what's real. Especially music lovers. That's why more and more of them are discovering the blues.  <br /> <br />The only place to go for this music is to it's roots. It is well represented here by names you probably know like B.B.King, and names you may not, like Pinetop Perkins.  <br /> <br />The CD/DVD combination here represents an amazing value. The sound is great, the video is great. Going to the homes of these great Blues Legends was a stroke of genius.  <br /> <br />Kenny Wayne Shepherd is poised to keep this music alive for generations to come. Thanks to all for your hard work! <br /> <br />If this doesn't get a Grammy this year, they need to cancel the show.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|First I have to say that in no way do I agree that Mark Whalberg was the weakest in the film, I personally did not find any weak links in this movie at all.  Having grown up in Dorchester I have to say that he is the epitome of a Boston cop/detective.  And how refreshing it is to hear some authentic accents!  LOL! <br /> <br />I was blown away by DiCaprio specifically in this movie, but must note that Jack Nicholson was amazing (as always, what better villian is there?), and Matt Damon was also dead on.  It was a nice treat to see him play the baddie.   <br /> <br />I think that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and having never seen Internal Affairs, I was rendered speechless by the events at the end of the movie.  I love when something is so riveting that I just don't even see it coming, and that was the case here.   <br /> <br />Great movie!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I got this CD after seeing them perform \\"Obstacle 1\\" on T.V. back in '02. There's something about their music that's addictive. It sounds alot different from what I mainly listen to, but I love this CD. They sound very different from the popular MTV bands since the sound quality of their music is fairly low, it doesn't rely much on pop hooks, and the singer isn't a trained vocalist. Yeah, I know alot of bands have singers who aren't trained, but this one doesn't sound pretentious because it's actually his real voice. The album does have kind of a goth feel to because it's dark, but it doesn't sound like they're \\"trying\\" to sound goth and gloomy. This is a great CD overall. This band's sound actually sounds alternative, unlike alot of the alternative bands out there which sound so much alike.
B000002GWJ|4.0|\\"Blue Valentine\\" has a tendency to be dismissed as a so called \\"transitional\\" album, being that it is sandwiched into the period between Waits' critically acclaimed early albums and his mid-career foray into the unique instrumentation and free form music of his \\"Rain Dogs\\" period. In my opinion when Waits' career is viewed as whole, every one of his albums could be classified as \\"transitional\\" works, because the man is constantly moving forward with his music and moving into new territory with each record he puts out. That being said, \\"Blue Valentine\\" is a great and underrated album. In my opinion the title track is one of the most desperate songs Waits ever recorded, and the spare instrumentation and Waits' gravelly voice perfectly captures the mood of paranoia he sings of. The lyrics to the song \\"Blue Valentines\\" are one of the best examples of Waits' talent as a songwriter, as he describes a man who abandoned his lover and was tracked down by her and continues to receive her letters. The lines \\"it feels like theres a  warrant out for my arrest, you've got me checkin in my rearview mirror, and I'm always on the run, thats why I changed my name, and I didn't think you'd ever find me here\\", and his descriptions of a blind and broken heart and nights full of whiskey are true genius. The song has remained one of my favorites of his over the years. I also think that Waits' voice was at it's best on this album and \\"Heartattack and Vine\\". The grit and rasp of his pipes on these two albums are unbelievable. The other thing about \\"Blue Valentine\\" that stands out to me is \\"$29.00\\", a straight up slow blues jam that goes on for a little over eight minutes. To hear Waits use his voice in a pure blues setting is rare, and he spits out the lyrics with his acid growl in a way that would make Howlin' Wolf blush. All the instrumental solos on that song are tight, and I find myself continuing to play that song again and again. \\"Wrong Side Of The Road\\" and \\"Whistlin' Past The Graveyard\\" are two others where his voice is unbelievable. The classic \\"Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis\\" is another of Waits' tales of down and out individuals, and has a jazzy piano accompaniment. I also think that \\"Kentucky Avenue\\" is one of Waits' best ballads, and always gives a tug at my heartstrings when I hear it. To me, the only turnoff to this album is Waits' rendition of \\"Somewhere\\" from West Side Story. While it was definitely an interesting choice for him as far as cover tunes are concerned, it just never grabbed me, although I wouldn't say it's bad. While critics may say that Waits didn't break any new ground on this album lyrically or musically, I think they missed the boat. This is a solid album, and Waits melded the blues, jazz, and symphonic music onto one disc and somehow managed to tie it all together in a way that makes sense. While this may not fall into the category of essential Tom Waits, this is good music. I can't make it any simpler than that.ard\\" are two others where his voice is unbelievable.

0440180295|5.0|This book explores a nonlinear view of space/time. The main character Billy Pilgrim has become \\"unstuck\\" in time and can move from one moment in his life to another totally different moment from his past or future at will. This ability was given to him be the apppaently benign aliens know as the Tralfamadoreans who can see in the 4th dimension. The way time is presented here is much like the holistic asian view of time where everything in the past/present/future mutually arises. Nothing is created or destroyed rather everything coexists in a 4 dimensional laticework. The idea of death is meaningless when one has this perspective and the aliens refer to death perfunctorily stating simply \\"so it goes\\" when hearing someone has died. George Harrison once said,\\"You can learn from the past but you can't ever relive it. And you can hope for the future but you can't count on it being there.\\" So it is perhaps best to live in the present in the immediacy of the moment with no regrets for the past and no anxieties for the future. Unfortunately for Billy Pilgrim his post-traumatic stress disorder prevents him from travelling to the more pleasent times in his life and instead causes him to jump uncontrollably through time. The book is also about the fire bombing of Dresden by the RAF and in the closing days of WW II. Vonegut balances his outrage and cynicism with a strong appreciate for the beauty and fragility of life. Buddhism teaches that nothing is created, nothing is destroyed. Nothing is born and nothing dies. So the people of Dresden, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki perhaps did not die but moved on to so other aspect of being or someother time. And so it goes.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|This deluxe reissue of the band's classic first album features the original album remastered plus a second disc of b-sides, outtakes, demos and live tracks. The original album sounds terrific here--much warmer and with much more detail than the previous CD version and captures the feel of the original vinyl release much more accurately than the first CD version.<br /><br />The second disc consists of songs recorded as b-sides such as the classic \\"Cuban Slide\\",\\"Porcelain\\" (both of which originally appeared as both a b-side and on The Pretenders \\"Extended Play\\" release that follow this album but preceded \\"Pretenders II\\")and \\"Swinging London\\". It's missing \\"In the Sticks\\" a Martin Chambers b-side which I suspect was probably just overlooked. The two former tunes sound much better than the previous CD release on the budget import \\"Don't Get Me Wrong\\" odds and ends/hits CD. \\"The Wait\\" showed up on the boxed set previously in demo form and again here. We also get \\"The Phone Call\\", a cover \\"I Can't Control Myself\\", \\"Kid\\", \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"Tequilla\\" (which is a different earlier version with the original line up as opposed to the one from the boxed set which featured the Hynde-MacIntosh-Chambers-Foster version of the band), \\"Nervous But Shy\\". We also get five tracks recorded for a BBC radio cast. \\" I Need Somebody\\" (which has been on various bootlegs over the years), \\"Mystery Achievement\\", \\"Precious\\" (again different from the boxed set version), \\"Tatooed Love Boys\\" and James Honeyman Scott ripping through a hit for Dave Edmunds' old band Love Sculpture \\"Sabre Dance\\" as the concluding track.<br /><br />The artwork includes all the original artwork for the album as well as a booklet with a insightful essay on the origins of the band and the recording of their first album. We also get the lyrics for all the songs (a first for this album). My only complaint about the design of the packaging (which mirrors an LP sleeve although it folds out unlike the original release)is that the two CDs don't come in plastic protective covers which would prevent them from being scratched in the cardboard housing. It's a curious oversight from Rhino.<br /><br />The Pretenders debut album had it all in spades. Great songwriting, singing, production and a unique mix of a harder rock sound mixed with the melodic bands (The Kinks, The Beatles) that songwriter/singer Chrissie Hynde admired. Hynder's songwriting always struck me as much closer to someone like John Lennon in that there was an emotional directness to all of her songs (and sexuality)that made it feel as if she was connecting with the listener individually. This is a great debut album and certainly one of the top 50 albums of all time.

B000K7UBTI|4.0|Purists will no doubt be perturbed with the changes in the origin story. I enjoyed it, however.  It's fun, true to the spirit of the characters and has excellent production values. <br /> <br />The story uses the juxtaposition of the high tech world of Tony Stark against the ancient world of China to tell the origin of Iron Man. In about 83 minutes of movie, we get to see the beginnings of the character and a great battle against his enemy, Mandarin, using at least 4 Iron Man costumes. Rhodey is well featured and Pepper gets a few good scenes. <br /> <br />The film will probably change the way I read Iron Man. My imagination didn't have his suit being so noisy. It probably will, now. <br /> <br />The animation style is more subdued than the previous Ultimate Avengers films. Traditional 2D animation is used for backgrounds and people, with some CGI used for the Iron Man suits and the 5 elementals he fights. The CGI is not too overt, it just provides them with the capability for more dynamic special effects and better rotational motion. <br /> <br />The DVD also features a brief documentary about the origin of Iron Man, with interviews with the films creators and Joe Quesada. There is also a 2-3 minute clip from the upcoming Dr. Strange animated film. I'm not even sure Dr. Strange was in the clip, but that film looks pretty intense. Speaking of intense, the Iron Man film is PG-13. I'm guessing this is because there are a couple of characters that are shot and killed and there is a mild scene of Tony and a bimbette in a hot tub. Nothing that will prevent me from sending a copy to my 7 year old nephew. <br /> <br />It will be interesting to see if any elements from this film appear in the upcoming live action Iron Man film.

B00006AG5N|3.0|It seems that too many times, a collection that COULD have been great, has to have a few glaring faults included! The selections that were chosen for the \\"ultimate\\" single disc collection of Elvis hits couldn't really be much better than this...however...the mix on a lot of these songs are absolutely inferior to what I've heard on other releases (compare the mix of \\"Suspicious Minds\\" here to the fabulous mix on \\"Suspicious Minds-The 1969 Memphis Anthology\\" and you'll see what I mean!) When All Elvis' songs were originally released, the mix on every one sounded FINE to me...but over the years, they've had to mix, mix and re-mix them! Why can't they just leave them alone?! Then comes the ultimate blunder on this set...the inferior alternate versions of \\"A Fool Such As I\\" and \\"The Wonder Of You\\"! I would think it would be understood that any CD that claims to be an \\"ultimate\\" hits collection would include ALL the original hit versions...but that's not what you get here! Now, I enjoy the alternate versions that have been released over the years, but I believe they have their place...and they DON'T belong here! I think \\"The 1969 Memphis Anthology\\" could have also been better. It starts out really good...until you get to disc 2. The first disc includes all the songs that were included on \\"From Elvis In Memphis\\", and in the same great sequence...but when you get to disc 2, the remainder of the Memphis recordings have alternate takes mixed in, instead of at the end where they should be. Disc 2 should have followed the same idea as disc 1, and had all the songs from \\"Elvis-Back In Memphis\\" as the first tracks, and THEN the alternate takes on the end...but this is just another example of how a potentially good Elvis disc could have been a lot better!
0446528056|3.0|I normally like all of the books by Nicholas Sparks, and I would have liked this one, if not for the fact that my husband himself has been to Iraq and I know firsthand that wives and girlfriends are usually warned beforehand that delicate news can endanger the life of the soldier. I found it a hard sell that a girl claiming to love a man so deeply could knowingly endanger someones life, though I am sure that wasn't how it was intended. It's probably a better book for someone to read if their husband didn't return from Iraq in the last three months.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|The chief question this misguided CD raises is -- why in the world do you try to remix songs that were perfect to begin with?  The answer, of course, is that there is a new generation of money-spending boys and girls who can plunk down $25 to hear someone's garbled retake on that perfection.  That the \\"someone\\" in this case was once affiliated with The Beatles does not excuse this money-grubbing, but seems to make it all the more egregious.  For God's sake, kids, just get the real thing.  This watered down semblance gives you the the wrong idea.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Myself, my husband, Mother and adult son saw 'Love' live in Las Vegas last week and it was loved by us all. It was my son's first Cirque Du Soleil show but it was our 4th. It was as wonderful as the others, made so, in this case, by the music. I was so happy to hear that it was recorded exactly as it was in the show. I bought my copy of the CD at the show but am now purchasing 2 more for my Mom and son. My son is now hooked on Cirque Du Soleil as much as we are. We plan on going back and seeing it again, but in the meantime we can listen to the CD, close our eyes and remember.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie is by far one of the most important films I have seen. I read Al Gore's book \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" when it was released, and now seeing the movie makes it all so much more real. Global warming is truly something that needs to be paid more attention to in politics and the media. We all need to do what we can to reduce carbon emissions globally and try and solve this situation now, so our children can have the wonderful things we have grown up with and experienced, instead of a melting planet.  <br /> <br />One of the most amazing things in this video is seeing how long this has been a concern and passion for former Vice President Gore.  I wish Al Gore would run for President again - he'd have my vote in a second. He's one of the most intelligent and well-spoken people about a very complex subject and makes it simple to understand for all. <br /> <br />EXCELLENT video and WONDERFUL book - See it and read it, and pass them along to someone else so they can learn too!

0307010856|5.0|This Grover, this fine avatar of sublime enthusiasm, this sincerely furred monster, speaks to the reader in fine artistic print drawn by Jon Stone of his delight in reading; of the danger of turning pages; of his raw emotional response to the approaching end of the book. I read; I reread; I am undone. <br /> <br />The fact that this book has been continuously in print for three decades is testament to the secret that children know: turning pages is a tactile delight. Monster at the end of this book? We do not want to see it, because we have been told that monsters are bad. And yet. And yet.  <br /> <br />The page is delicious, Grover appearing both near and far, his words rendered in impossible unrestrained fonts that the artist, not the computer, has spread into and outside the margins of this stiff little book. The plot, the metaplot, rely on our participation as readers, and as parents (as readers-to-nonreaders) to construct the experience of overcoming fear. This is a bildungsroman that we the parent ask our child to write anew every night.  <br /> <br />As an artefact of the lurid seventies book-macher culture, Monster persists on the plane of \\"book\\" because it has germinated autodidactic readers-as-readers-to. Workers in the literary genre of bed, bedtime, bedroom and juvenile fiction were influenced by Stone's work and have in the majority of cases reproduced (biologically and in their own works) solely for the purpose of rereading this book to their own children. This is biology as \\"beard\\", a self-replicating viral meme that influences our species to replicate so that this book may catapault to one more metalevel of cultural influence and conquer the dimension of time; incubated in the restrictive zone of \\"bedtime\\" this metameme has demolished the project of the deconstructionists, eliding the impossibility of communication from the de facto reality of the presomnial ritual. <br /> <br />That said, I love this book.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I highly reccomend this to any lover of fairytales,disney films,animation,or who is a fan of the score from the sleeping beauty ballet. I love everything about this movie. The animation is superb,the music is absolutely beautiful and is adapted from the ballet,and the romance is very touching as in all the disney fairytales. I love how disney was able to make such gorgious songs out of the ballet score. My favorites are \\"hail to the princess aurora\\", \\"once upon a dream\\",and \\"i wonder\\" Mary costa did a supper job with the vocals for briar rose/aurora. I think sshe has the best voice of all the disney princesses. Second to this is reccomend the cannon movie tale version which is a live action film starring morgan fairchild and tahnee welch.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Much ballyhoo has been made of this super group collaboration:  Jack White from the Stripes, Brendan Benson from 60's am radio power pop fame, and two of the Greenhornes thrown in (interesting musicians in their own right...there's some good drumming to be found on Broken Boy Soldiers).  Enter the Raconteurs on the indie gone mainstream stage; MTV music awards house band, successful international tour, buzz aplenty...will they or won't they continue to be a band?  So that's who they are and what they have been doing, let's talk about the music.<br /><br />Here's a disclaimer for you, as far as tastes are aligned it seems White and Benson's styles differ.  Jack White for those uninitiated to his ways is expansive, psychedelic, hard edged blues for the modern man, Jimi Hendrix reincarnation good baby!  So I'm convinced of White's brilliance.  There it is on the table; that's where I'm coming from.  Benson's style as I've previously alluded to is more in a 60's pop vein.  His lyrics are simplistic and rhyming. His tunes are certainly memorable and hummable but the styles between the two lead artists are certainly in different if not disparate camps.<br /><br />The music is all good on \\"Broken Boy Soldiers.\\"  In fact it's probably one of my highlight releases from '06.  But here's the beef...the rub...just like a broken boy soldier, the album comes across as incoherent with some clear White influenced songs and some clear Benson influenced songs.  Where the kicker comes in is when the two styles mesh like in the all over the airwaves hit, \\"Steady as She Goes,\\" \\"Intimate Secretary,\\" and the catchiest of them all, \\"Level.\\"  This is what you hope for with an interlocking of two different styles of music...something new, interesting and unique is birthed from the two.  You don't get that here consistently.<br /><br />Sure Benson and White have no doubt been good for one another.  White jazzes and sexes up Benson's pop sensibilities.  Benson probably puts some boundaries and tames White's ability to at times go off in eccentric territories that may not appeal to broader audiences.  But some of the songs are so clearly Benson's like \\"Hands,\\" \\"Together,\\" and \\"Yellow Sun.\\" I find myself usually skipping over those tracks to get to the good stuff...making \\"Broken Boy Soldiers,\\" an ultimately uneven listen.<br /><br />There is indeed some deep musicality here.  The vocal interplay on \\"Store Bought Bones,\\" along with the pile-driving 70's accompanying organ.  The same could be said for another similar song, \\"Intimate Secretary.\\"  The album really reaches new levels when it sounds like Jack White clearly takes the lead like in the Eastern-tinged little slice of rock heaven, \\"Broken Boy Soldier,\\" and the cool blues masterpiece of \\"blue veins.\\"<br /><br />It will be interesting if this group soldiers on with additional albums to see if they can achieve a good meshing of styles.  I saw them in concert and my personal opinion is that White is holding back in order to be a good band member.  He has yet to find a good match, a good soul mate to synergize his manic crazy good brilliant musicality.  The guy is nothing short of a modern day compositional genius (though he could improve in the lyricist department here and there)...pardon the superlative.

B000K7VHQE|1.0|From all the positive reviews, I thought this would be at the very least decent. This is just a terrible film. If you think you are going to get a Chevy Chase-type \\"Vacation\\" film, forget it. The story line has a lot of potential - problem is, NONE of it is ever developed. The profanity in the film seems to be there just for profanity's sake - not to add anything. Don't waste your money on this one. Hollywood is in a sad state of affairs if this is what gets nominated for an Oscar, but then again Oscars have nothing to do with how good a film is.
B0000640SB|5.0|Ten years later, and this movie is still as funny as the first day it premiered in theaters. This movie has everything that makes a sci-fi fan drool; a great story mixed with funny characters, cool sets and fantastic looking aliens. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith definitely make the movie work as they argue between each other. Watching the movie, you can tell that this was either going to be a major blockbuster or a major disaster. I have seen this movie at least ten times and it still hasn't lost its charm. If you have never seen this movie, then this is definitely a must see. It is a really fun movie with everything that you would want out of a movie, including a great soundtrack.

B000GY729M|4.0|I was surprised at how the hooks in the music stay in my head.  I didn't know what to expect from this record, but I was extremely and pleasantly surprised when listening to it.  It rocks, it rolls and it has soul.  Definately worth a listen.  Key tracks:  \\"When you were young,\\" \\"Bones,\\" and \\"Read my Mind.\\"  Excellent!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Every character in this movie is flawlessly cast, and relatively unknown.  The acting is superb, and the storyline is very funny.  If you like smart ironic humor, you will love this movie.  If you're neither smart nor ironic, you'll probably miss the point.<br /><br />Anyone from a rural background went to school with these people.  It is like reliving your teenage hood.<br /><br />I couldn't help but notice how the reviews alternate from five stars to one star with hardly any middle ground.  Like all great movies, this one has stirred up controversy.
B000002LQR|5.0|From start to finish, Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a masterpiece with the perfect combination of funk, rock, and rap. It oozes sex with songs like Sir Psycho Sexy and Suck My Kiss. Produced by Rick Rubin, this is probably the best work the RHCP have ever done. John Frusciante's guitar playing is amazing and you can't say enough about Flea on bass. I listen to Blood Sugar Sex Magik everyday, it's extremely addicting. And to anyone who loves this record, i recommend you watch Funky Monks.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|Christian Bale is the main reason to watch this.  The good news is: it's possibly his best role.  He actually looks like The Thin White Duke on anorexia...or a concentration camp survivor.  Such is his dedication to the role.  Overall a good cast.<br /><br />The bad news is - the show is very well filmed and unfolds like a twilight zone story...strangely however, the movie is somewhat devoid of the suspense it needs to creep us, and falls short as a one-note story.  Hence, things become more predictable rather than exciting.  A neat package but not quite dark enough.  Perhaps a director's cut would improve this?
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Live at Slane Castle is by far the best concert on DVD that I've seen. John Frusciante is hypnotizing to watch throughout the entire performance and Anthony Kiedis' dance moves never get old, Flea is the God of bass and Chad is just an awesome drummer. The performance of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is amazing with them performing hits like By The Way, Scar Tissue, The Power of Equality, Californication, Give It Away, and many more. And as a bonus, John Frusciante sings a song called Maybe. The only thing that's missing in this wonderful DVD is some special features. Otherwise, you can watch and sing along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers everyday.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|When I heard this was out, I had to get it.  Superman II was indelibly etched in my mind as the best Superman I'd seen - and so the critics said.  General Zod and his gang provided the epic challenge that was worthy of Superman.  Well, that was thirty years ago.  Fast forward to the present.  It blew my mind for a moment to learn that Richard Donner had done the original shoot - to such an extent, it seemed criminal to have replaced him.  (I still would like to learn why)<br /><br />It's always painful as a director to have someone else replace you - and I understand fully how Donner feels.<br /><br />So how does this stack up to the Richard Lester version?  As the Amazon reviewer says - Lester's version was indeed punchier and stronger, but then again, Donner was perhaps not playing with a full deck.  It's hard to ascertain exactly what was different in some parts, but Donner's version is clunkier with more Brando and more (literal) explanation; as well as an ending that was constructed (it seems) in the editing room from what the making of documentary tells us.<br /><br />The ending is the telling bit - those who watch will either agree or disagree with it.  But other things remain sterling as ever: the performances of Terence Stamp as Zod - great!  And Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor - better than ever (making Kevin Spacey look like a caricature)...  Superman as played impeccably by Christopher Reeve...And of course, the theme song still stirs.<br /><br />Trivial note: The special effects were actually reconstructed to make this feel like it had been done in the spirit of the time.<br /><br />So while it remains to be seen if Brandon Routh will make a better Superman, the original producers nailed it with Christopher Reeves, who will remain the breakthrough superhero actor of his time - paving the way and setting the standards for screen superheroes to come.<br /><br />The Donner Cut is absolutely a tribute piece, and a missing link of sorts for the dedicated.  Some people probably wouldn't notice the difference.  Enjoy it as a piece of history and entertainment!  I can't give it a five star rating, but I guess I need to watch the Lester cut again... This in no way invalidates the Superman II we all know, but gives a director and the audience a chance to experience an alternate version.  Thirty years is a long time indeed.cated.

B000LC3ID8|3.0|I, probably like most people, think the Saw franchise has gotten less and less a horror/psychological movie and more into just gore. Part of the beauty of the first Saw was that there wasn't a ton of gore, it left more to the imagination, thus concentrating on the central characters. Saw II was where the gore became seemingly more important than the actual story. I won't deny, hearing that II would welcome blood and guts with arms open excited me. And while it was good, there were far more things that agrivated me than pleased me. First, I didn't care about ANY character. Second, Donnie Wahlberg.<br /><br />Saw III is where I'll most likely leave the franchise. They barely focus on the characters or their back stories for why Jigsaw wanted them. Instead they seem to concentrate on making the contraptions more intricate, bloodier deaths, and more cussing. So yeah, they definitely succeed on those fronts. The cussing is over-zealous. F-bombs are dropped like nobody's business and for no reason at all. The deaths are surely cringe-worthy, I found myself looking away at certain points (I know I know). And the contraptions are eerily complex. 'The Rack', yeah, that's the most sadistic thing I've ever seen.<br /><br />The one plus, character-wise, has been the biggest plus from the very beginning, Jigsaw himself. His reasoning behind things, especially this time around, are things you'd never think of, even while he's dropping some huge hints through the entire movie. Once he provides answer though, everything clicks, everything that didn't make sense in the beginning makes perfect sense afterward.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you don't mind the sacrifice of character developement for some insane deaths, Saw III is right up your alley. For those of us who want to actually care about who dies and who doesn't, Saw III is a big letdown. Give and take, and as always, it's your preference against mine. Enjoy!
015603283X|5.0|I will be as brief as I can. Yes, it is an erudite and cerebral entertainment.  Yes it is an involving mystery.  Yes it is very very funny.  What is truly amazing is that even in translation it can be so emotionally involving and powerful at the same time. Sometimes it can be all of these things at once in the same sentence.  I am assuming that Arturo Perez-Reverte has all these virtues in the original Spanish.  If not, Sonia Soto should quit translating and write her own novels.  Her English version is simply beautiful.  Disciplined, chiselled prose, sparing in imagery (which would be from her author), but what images there are are precisely on target for emotional impact and placed for maximum effect in English.  And the attention she pays to prose rhythms is very rare indeed in translation.  Rapid, natural and propulsive.  She immediately takes her place in my own small personal pantheon of great translators with the Winstons in German and W. S. Kuniczak in Polish.   <br />      This is my first acquaintance with Perez-Reverte's work and it was an impulse buy.  Under the circumstances that best of all surprises, a GREAT read.  I can't wait to read more by this author.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Dylan never wrote a better album than this.  His most personal and introspective work; the emotional fragility and brutal honesty of these tracks showcase a facet of Dylan's music that is too often overshadowed by his reputation as a 60s \\"protest\\" singer.  Heartbreak and rejection as the human condition are squarely on display, and should appeal to anyone who has ever loved, lost, and lived on hoping to find love again.
0767821629|5.0|Really, i'm at 99% sure that idea of Matrix came exactly from this movie.<br /><br />Most of my views on this film have already been put very effectively by other reviews. Thus: the \\"predictable\\" twists still work (and I didn't predict most of them!), the performances are well judged if subtle, and the atmosphere and production values (mostly) lift themselves above the genre and the budget. I like to say that The Thirteenth Floor is an unusually, and genuinely, moral and humanistic tale, for something that is basically entertainment.<br /><br />I cannot reveal exactly why I hold this opinion without generating plot spoilers, but this aspect should not be difficult to spot. Finally, who else thinks there is a final possible twist right the end, and why do we not see more of the delicately beautiful Gretchen Mol?
B000IU3XTM|5.0|The world waited a long time for Damien Rice's follow up to 2002's fantastically accomplished 'O'. However all of that waiting has not been in vain. Indeed it is almost certain that an album of the depth and maturity of a Damien Rice offering would need that long to be completed. <br /> <br />The equally briefly titled '9' finds Damien Rice in a more sombre mood than before. He at times allows for a bitter anger in his lyrics that was not really present before. In 'Me, My Yoke, and I' and 'Rootless Tree' there is an outward bitterness that was not allowed for previously. However this is not to say that '9' is not full of the more affectionate, tender songs that have always been Rice's forte. Indeed the opening song and single, '9 Crimes' is a delicate and intimate confession between 2 lovers that will captivate anyone with even the slightest affection for Damien Rice's music. Added to this we have the affectionate 'The Animals Were Gone' and the tragically beautiful 'Accidental Babies'. <br /> <br />Damien Rice's already huge fanbase is only likely to expand with this fantastic second offering. His long time fans may have grown somewhat frustrated during the 4 year wait for a follow up. However if the next album is anything like this, they will not mind waiting another 4 years.
7119005901|5.0|I first became familiar with the Three Kingdoms period through the video game \\"Romance VII\\" (on PS2). Through the game, I was able to understand what each charecter is capable of doing, which illustrated a clear narrative of the basic concepts involved. After playing \\"Romance VIII\\" & \\"Romance X\\", I more or less understood what the novel had to offer. After playing these games, I decided to go to the main source - the novel. While reading the novel, I started associating the images and scenarios from the games with the text. Although you will know how most events will unfold, the endless names, ranks, locations and procedures, will make sense; which without, you will be bored to death. So to sum things up, I highly recommend you play some of the romance games (in particular \\"Romance X\\") so to know how significant some events (like the meeting of the brothers, or the battle with the 'strongest man under heaven') are.
0743289412|5.0|I was hesitant to give \\"Lisey's Story\\" five stars, primarily because it took SO long to get into (the first third of the book is slow and meanders somewhat).  However, the book left me with so many indelible images and such profound sadness that I could not give it less.  Clearly this is not a horror story.  Certainly it has King's trademark fantasy oddities.  But more than that, it is, as described, a love story.  King's imagination and ability to create well-developed characters never ceases to amaze me.  I've been a fan for many years and he is once again at the top of his game.
B0002KVULG|4.0|I love this movie. It's so good, great cast, wonderful sets, fabulous music. I can watch this movie over and over aagain.This DVD is so much better than the first one that came out a few years ago. That one is almost unwatchable.  <br />My only compaint with this new one is the color is washed out compared to the original movie.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|As a Beatle maniac for most of my life, for me this CD represented a new and different way to hear their music.  The way the songs were intertwined with each other and mixed and re-mixed, it was almost like hearing a new recording from the Fab Four themselves, which made it very special for me.  If you are a diehard Beatle fan, this CD is a must have!
B000M2SM92|5.0|my favorite movie for 2006....i think it has a pretty good  shot at being best movie at the oscars....great performances by the whole cast.....
0312323867|2.0|I found \\"Something Blue\\" to be a poor follow-up to \\"Something Borrowed\\".  Borrowed introduced us to the Sex & the City world of fashion, fun, and love.  Blue turns it's back on the very thing that made Borrowed successful, but not to a pleasing conclusion.  Darcy's crises are predictable, the resolutions obvious and inevitable.  Where Borrowed presented some interesting AND entertaining challenges, Blue seeks to be the made for tv movie that ties everything up in a neat and tidy bow.  If you enjoyed Borrowed, I would let the characters live on in your imagination.
044024157X|3.0|There are a number of negative reviews on this site about The Last Juror, primarily because readers of the novel are expecting it to be something different than what it is.  This is not a legal thriller in the spirit of Grishmam's early novels.  The Last Juror has as much in common with a novel like \\"Snow on Falling Cedars\\" (although not nearly as good)as it does with \\"A Time to Kill\\".<br /><br />There is a murder and there is a trial (and they are central to the story) but Grisham appears more interested in exploring small town life in the rural south in the 1970's than he is in building action and suspense.<br /><br />Grisham compromises in The Last Juror and tries to have it both ways but unfortunately he falls short on both counts.  Suspense fans will find that the novel lacks the page turning tension they want in a legal thriller and readers looking for a novel rich in character and setting will be disappointed by an ending that feels `tacked on', as if Grisham were trying to appease suspense fans with an action packed ending.<br /><br />Grisham is an unquestionably good story teller but The Last Juror suffers from an identity crisis.  Grisham inserts a legal thriller into a character driven story about a young man who moves to rural Mississippi and takes the helm of a small town newspaper.  The result is uneven and overall, a little unsatisfying.
0140437711|5.0|The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes is a captivating set of over 20 stories of the 56 Sherlock Holmes stories ever written, described from the point of view of Watson, Sherlock Holmes's assistant, living up, if not surpassing, the expectations set by the age-old classic. Each story has a captivating plot, yet all different enough that it leaves you reading and re-reading key parts, trying to figure it out before Sherlock Holmes reveals the answer. I admit, I am yet to reliably put the clues together. As I have found, a large age group enjoys this book, making it a pleasure to share with family. Inside the story, there are plots filled with gentlemen, businesspeople, servants, witnesses, beggars, masked trespassers, and more, that unusually for a mystery book, all have the same likelihood of possibly having a hand in the crime. With stories that show weakness in character, like my personal favorite, (in which it turns out that the people who bring Sherlock there happen to be the murderers themselves!) brings a realistic image of the people involved, calling out to the reader, as if to say, \\"yes, you are here. This is what has been happening,\\" and, from the moment you begin reading, put you in their shoes.<br /><br /> Occasionally, the plot is not truly revealed, such as in A Scandal in Bohemia, when the suspect escapes before questioning can occur, and the story ends in a question, as to whether or not the villainess escaped permanently, or if her story has just begun. Best set for the advanced reader, I would not classify it as a \\"light read\\", and is best read in small pieces, thanks to not only the magnitude of the book, but by the nature of a late 1800's mystery novel. Thanks to wikipedia, I have heard that in 1964, the Sherlock Holmes books were, selling second best in the world, second only to the bible. Sherlock Holmes is one of the most influential mysteries of the 1900's, and is, over-all, a true pleasure, and something I feel everyone should read at some point in their lives.
0743201140|4.0|As a manager who regularly meets 1:1 with my team, i found this an excellent book to read, but think it is difficult to implement in practice <br />My direct reports like the feedback I provide, but don't want to meet very often. [ Meeting once a week is recommended, we meet on average once in two weeks.]  <br />On the book itself, the online test - as others have noted, one code per family would be nice, but the test itself seems somewhat arcane - not clear how it works or how accurate it is.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|Part One, classic Bacon at his finest!  Michael Gross and Reba McEntire join Bacon in turning a potentially stale monster flick into a roller coaster fun classic.  Michael Gross, the constant in the series, throws his Keaton image to the wind to create a hilarious character in an ever-evolving arc of a fine mix of thrills, chills, drama, comedy, and wickedly good effects.  The series perhaps would have been best left a trilogy, but the fourth installment, and following short-lived television show, proved a relatively simple idea, man against \\"nature,\\" can take on a life of its own and never disappoint.  Perhaps the most impressive?  These are ridiculously 50's horror in nature, but timeless in entertainment.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|Review of George Harrison's Cloud Nine<br /><br />by Mel C. Thompson.<br /><br />Typically Harrison's albums have maybe one hit, or even no hits, then maybe one or two good songs, and then a lot of pretty iffy material.<br /><br />Of course All Things Must Pass was an exception. It was, by far, the best post-Beatles album produced by any of the Beatles, and remains, by the way, the best selling of all the post-Beatle albums.<br /><br />Cloud Nine was, however, a total breakout album for a few reasons. Firstly, the album had one smash hit, Got My Mind Set On You. This hit had such staying power and came so late in Harrison's career that it got Harrison a huge non-Beatles audience, so much so that I met young kids at the time who did not know or believe Harrison had been in the Beatles and simply liked him as a solo artist. That kind of comeback is a very rare achievement for any artist.<br /><br />But also, the album has two minor hits, The Devil's Radio, and also, the best song on the album, When We Was Fab, a song that not only pokes some lighthearted and serious fun at Harrison's Beatle years, but has a tremendous musical style parody of their psychedelic era, calling to mind arrangements similar to I Am The Walrus and Strawberry Fields. It takes several listenings to really get what a masterpiece that song is.<br /><br />The Devil's Radio is great because it has a profound spiritual message without leaning in the specific doctrinal tenants of Harrison's Hinduism. I say this with mixed feelings, since I am a Buddhist-Hindu and really enjoy a lot of his very doctrinal and propagandistic works. (True critics need to be human enough to \\"fall for things,\\" even if they can be poked fun at artistically. In Harrison's case, his religion was a two-edged sword, it provided the inspiration and insight that made him a major and unique influence in the Anglo pop scene, but it also sometimes made him a bit sloppy and complacent.<br /><br />Cloud specifically said in one interview that he did not want Cloud Nine to be dominated by spirituality, and he succeeded by having the album uplifted by his religion without it being heavy handed. (All that being said, I still like the heavy-handed stuff sometimes too.) The point is, in terms of the worldwide audience, Cloud Nine was perfect for absolutely mass consumption and platinum proportions while still retaining the great philosophical insights Harrison always benefitted from.<br /><br />It also helps that he had the greatest backup band of all time. While George Harrison sang, played guitar and produced, he had Geoff Lynne coproduce and sing and play instruments, (he was the former create front-man for the Electric Light Orchestra who themselves had a massive career). Furthermore, on drums was his co-Beatle Ringo Starr. And if that weren't enough, Eric Clapton was the lead guitarist and Elton John was the Pianist (with regular contributions by Eighties Mega-Star, now often forgotten, Gary Wright). Given that backup band, it's hard to imagine how the album could go wrong.<br /><br />Cloud Nine was a masterwork of marketing timing, producing, arranging, personnel management, spirituality and good old quality pop-rock. In some sense, given that Harrison had become a pretty successful film producer by then, in his own right, Cloud Nine probably represents the real Zenith of the solo career of Harrison, because, although All Things Must Pass will always remain the truly immortal work of Harrison's, it was still very much done in the supernova halo of the Beatles. Cloud Nine had proved with time and distance Harrison was a viable artist, and probably, the most important solo artist to come from the Beatles.<br /><br />For a time it seemed that McCartney would have been by far the most important of the post-Beatles, however he fell far out of critical favor, and his solo work remains very dated and his following rather faded. Harrison fans hang on with a fervor that McCartney could not match. True,Double Fantasy represented a similar victory to Cloud Nine for John Lennon, a true breakout. And while Imagine remains Lennon's Immortal work, it too was also produced in the halo of the Beatles' recent breakup. Lennon's assassination may have prevented him from becoming the preeminent post-Beatle, since he said at the time of making Double Fantasy, that he felt like he'd just begun again and that \\"nothing's even been done yet.\\"ld not match.

B000068FWC|4.0|My friend had this album back in 1979 when it was released, played it all the time. Maybe that's why I didn't like it, I was sick of hearing it. But you know, almost 30 years later, it's not that bad of an album . . . I even own the CD . . . remastered even. The test of good music is the lasting affect it has on a person's memory growing up. One of the biggest albums of 1979, and I didn't like it back then . . . boy, how things have changed . . . for the better in this case.
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|The similarities between Ultraviolet and Underworld were similar in some respects. In that a virus changes the human species into something else. With Ultraviolet we have humans and vampires. A futuristic world with plenty of cool gadgets. The special effects in this film are the film, but the plot is really lacking. I felt somewhat empty after watching this film. With more work on the plot of the film in a potential sequel added to the intense special effects this could be a great film. You can tell the actors worked hard on their training, especially in terms of martial arts. The last battle scene is my favorite part of the film. The background music gives an \\"old world\\" feel in a futuristic world. All these fancy weapons eventually leads to swords. So elegant, so simple, the sword is a timeless weapon that appears to outshine the majority of the weapons created before and henceforth.<br /><br />Work on the plot and you have a great film. I hope there's a sequel.
6304458355|4.0|... is, I think, the best word for this film. As stated in an earlier review, most films are take-offs on dog-earred, thumb-smudged plots and tend only to restate what has been done before. This is especially true of many of today's productions where the film is an out-and-out remake of the earlier film. Often the title is not even changed.<br /><br />But this story is different. I can't remember any film which has the same idea -- of a boy finding a board game and playing it with his friend only to unleash dire results.<br /><br />The tale has been recounted in other reviews, so no need for me to restate it. Let's just say that this is a refreshing breath of air in an industry which has become stale in it's repeatition. Visuals are nice, but one can tell they are computer generated.<br /><br />Older kids and adults will enjoy the story, I think, though I would be cautious about very young children watching. The movie could easily inspire dark dreams for those under age 8 (or so).<br /><br />The film flows and has a really nice, unexpected twist at the end. Well worth the build up. I think most who watch the movie will like it. And of course it features Robin Williams.<br /><br />*** Recommended ***<br /><br />~P~
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The first installment of the Underworld series was a surprise hit and has become an instant cult classic. Now we are given a wider glimpse of the Underworld in Underworld: Evolution. A world humans were never meant to see. I can't wait to see this on blu-ray or HD-DVD. The special effects do not override the overall plot of the film. Underworld is not War and Peace, but instead a story of allegiances that shift at a moments notice. Now there are two hybrids and Selene has taken the place as the strongest of all lycans and vampires. The only point that bothered me was in Markus' death. First we see Michael able to come back from the dead. As Selene said his powers could be limitless, but what about Markus? Is Markus truly destroyed being a hybrid as well. We can only hope another installment is given to us showing a greater depth of the Underworld. I was impressed by the use of \\"blood memory\\" as a type of 'genetic memory'. It would be interesting to see what the union of Michael and Selene might produce. It would also be interesting to see another creature of the Underworld. Not bitten by bat or wolf, but something else entirely. Perhaps another creature familar to us all in both legend and life.
B000GPI2EK|4.0|I've justed finished listening to this cd and... uhmm..it's damn hard not to get a headache from the fantastic rhythm changes and riffing. So don't try too hard to discern a melody or pattern in this music buth just let it grow on you, slowly, go with the flow of the music. Cuzz I'll tell yah, this Mastodon is in a whole other league of it's own...and it's gaddamn BRILLIANT!.  <br /> <br />I read somewhere the following quote : \\"Goodbye METALLICA, hello MASTODON\\" .. the guy who wrote this should have this eardrums punctured!. Cuz this is definitely not Metallica, I mean the words 'catchy, all time classic, headbangers dream' etc. don't even apply to Mastodon's music. And the lyrics  themselves just don't stick even after repeated listenings, but why would it have to stick ?!. I mean the mere fact that they toured with THE GOD of 'alternative' metal , TOOL, in my humble opinion clearly illustrates there uniqueness and ingenuity of there songwriting (but don't try to scream along cuz you'll get lost anyway) and very complex but coherent riffing ... like someone said earlier, Mastodon is the LOTR of Metal, epic (lyrics) and heavy on the brain (riffs)...  <br /> <br />Regarding this album (finally), all I can say at this point is that this is quite a notch higher in complexity , wich is a good thing dont get me wrong, but don't expect to sing along and trash your head around like a brutal Slayer-classic would do. But who needs simplicity at this point in Metal history anyway ?? I mean 98% of the bands out there are so overly riff based that the pathetic lyrics aren't even worth listening to, thats my almost 90% of my metal cd collection is collecting dust :D ... BUT, Leviathan is a keeper with this cd , that's for sure.

Oh, and the art and CGI action were top-notch.  OK, let's admit that it's a re-imagining of the Iron Man and Mandarin stories (I've been an Iron Man fan since 1972, so I'm a true-believer), but Marvel comics and Hollywood have re-imagined things so many times with both the comic storylines and the movies (the Hulk, X-Men and Fantastic Four movies are NOTHING like the old Marvel origins) that I don't mind this revision, because it's well done.  Don't let any nattering nabobs of negativity discourage you:  This is good viewing.
B000I9U972|1.0|Everthing about this movie was bad.  The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor.  The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975.  How much did it cost them to film this movie?  50 bucks?  The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Brilliant.............MORONS need not apply. Those who differ, clearly ,are lost. Fagen deserves tremendous credit for this GEM !!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A documentary about Al Gore giving lectures on global warming? Sounds dreadfully boring, I know. In fact, it was that presumption that kept me away from the movie. But after all the buzz and word of mouth, I finally caved in and decided to watch it. I regret not watching it sooner.    For me, the film transcends global warming. It delivers a message of being the one to stand up and say enough is enough. Make a change in your own life. We don't have anymore time to spare, sitting idly on the sidelines watching the world pass us by. Get up and make a difference.    The Al Gore you see in this film is an Al Gore that you probably haven't seen before. Where was this man back in 2000? Where has he been since? It's clear by watching this film that losing the election was perhaps not a bad thing at all. You may argue that him losing the election was more important and impacting than if he had won.    I heard somewhere that if this film wins the Oscar for Best Documentary (which it should), Al Gore is going to thank President Bush. Without him, this film would have never been made.    This film is for everyone; not just Democrats, scientists, or environmentalists. This film is for us all, who perhaps unknowingly, take the Earth for granted.    [...]

B00005JKES|3.0|This would have been 5 stars but the pilot episode for the series wasn't included in the first season which makes this dvd collection feel much shorter than it should be.
B000002O51|5.0|I love this album but the question is this compact-disc everything it could be in terms of SOUND REPRODUCTION???I think not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000G3AZ|4.0|This is a cute version of Emma and I really enjoyed it. The archery scene was great for a good chuckle when Mr Knightly tells her \\" Try not to kill my dogs\\". Jeremy Northam had a completely different style in his portrayal of Mr. Knightly from Mark Strong's Mr Knightly tho I liked his as well. Yes, I have both Emmas but this one had more to offer in the cast. Ewan McGregor has a wonderful singing voice and I was overjoyed to hear him sing in the duet with Emma. This Emma had more up to date comedy that I could relate to. I would reccomend getting this version for your library.

6305907145|2.0|This is not one of my favorite movies represented by Jane Austin's writings. Maybe a remake of this story should be done.
6305907145|2.0|NOT Mansfield Park except for very general plot outlines, done as an 'adult' version that Austin surely never envisioned. For the most part the cast are all 'way too old for the parts as Austin wrote it, & the costuming & hair are also wrong. It could have turned out different - but it didn't. One thumb down.

0312323867|2.0|Basically Emily Giffin sends a horrible message about morality in both her books regarding Darcy and Rachel.  She says that if a friendship or relationship is flawed, then it's probable and even acceptable to lie and cheat.  Basically your integrity is based on outside influences and not who you are on the inside.  For people to sympathize or ally with either Darcy or Rachel makes me really question our society's values.
B00005JPAM|5.0|\\"The Queen\\" is excellent! Helen Mirren gives the best performance of her career as Queen Elizabeth II and is sure to win Best Actress at the Oscars (she did). Michael Sheen is impressive, as well, as Prime Minister Tony Blair.

B000068GA4|5.0|I think this is some excellent stuff here. I completely agree with the reviewer that said if Jim Morrison and the devil collaborated this is what it would be, because this is exactly what it sounds like. Dark, poetic lyrics with a morrison-esque voice.<br /><br />I was interested in Danzig because I remember Lacuna Coil saying they were going on tour with him and they called him a metal legend, etc. and I had never heard of them. Tried seeing if he had a myspace but he didn't so I could take a listen, then yesterday I was in a disc replay store and spotted this cd for 4 bucks and I was like, \\"what the hell? Why not?\\" and then popped it in and loved it. This is just good quality music that is trapped somewhere between rock and metal. MUST BUY!!!!
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This is one of the cutest movies I have seen in a long time. The children were priceless, the story fast and moving with hilarious episodes sprinkled here and there. The comedy of Colin Firth in the Tea Party with his bride to be had me laughing so hard I cried. Emma as Nanny McPhee was superb, how she was able to say her lines with that protubing tooth was amazing. Angela Lansbury as the aunt gave the story added zip, playing the uptight judgemental aunt with green frosting on her face, is uproarous. If you are down in the dumps, watch this, it will be enjoyed by all.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This has got to be the worst film version of an Austin story I've ever seen. The plot is only tenuously connected with the book; as for the characters, hairstyles & costumes, it should be subtitled \\"Fellini Does Austin\\" because it most closely resembles the \\"Satyricon\\" IMO. The makeup, costuming, & hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically, but downright grotesque & bizarre - and that's just the lead character, Catherine. The rest are worse. Bad acting, too. Very lame film. The Austin estate should sue BBC for turning out such a turkey & using her name.
B000065V1V|5.0|This CD is a must have. Must have if your into Bowie, it's no let down at all. As a matter a fact its a great joy to know that he is around, not playing some pop rap reliving of the 80's days, he's always doing his thing as he see's best fit. I'm very happy with this purchase. When I go on stage doing my Bowie tribute it may have Slow Burn as one of the songs, I love Bowie!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I spent 35 years in radio and television and very little impresses me but there is always the exception.  10 Days Out  in my opinion is one of the best blues albums in a decade. This is a project that not only cried out tbe done  but  was expertly done. The dvd will keep you glued to your tv. Watch it first then listen to the cd. This baby is a labor of love and it shows. One can only hope that Warner Brothers realizes what they have and cranks up the promotion.
B00005ASHM|5.0|First off, I would like to start by saying the comparison between the Beach Boys and the Beatles is a rather silly one because it was never a fair comparison to begin with. The Beatles were exclusively a studio band from 1965 on. And all four Beatles plus George Martin participated in the creation of albums. The Beach Boys were totally different. Brian Wilson was the only Beach Boy to stop touring to work in the studio. For Pet Sounds, Wilson composed all the songs, arranged the instrumental and vocal parts, sang most of the leads, and produced the whole album. He did all this while having no formal training on musical composition, studio production, or sound engineering. I never hear of a \\"John Lennon vs. Brian Wilson\\" debate, or \\"Paul McCartney vs. Brian Wilson\\", or even \\"George Martin vs. Brian Wilson\\". Individually, he was unmatched because he did it all. Sadly, he lost his sanity before being able to fulfill his new working method to create more Beach Boys albums.<br /><br />All the praises Pet Sounds gets are well-deserved. Aside from the technological feat it accomplished, all the songs are magnificent, all unified by concept and quality. Every single track on this album is a finely-crafted masterpiece: sweeping, dreamy instrumentals with warm, embracing vocal arrangements, all painting pictures of youth and naive love. The melodies are soaring and lyrics seem deceivingly simple, which is just about the point. It's heart and soul on put record, not some self-indulgent, overly-complex hogwash made for the sake of experimenting. Pet Sounds also has aged remarkably well. Those who pan this album as outdated and cheesy have probably been listening to too much grunge (ie: the reviewer below). Hm, grunge, now THAT is something that hasn't aged well.<br /><br />I own the Beatles albums Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Abbey Road. But Pet Sounds, through its delicate charm, modesty, and sincereness, gets way more rotation in my player than any of  my Beatles albums do. They don't resonate with me as much as Pet Sounds does; they are commercially popular, well done, and are classics. But that's all I get out of them. Pet Sounds' most noted competitor is Sgt. Pepper, but that album, more than anything else, is basically a collection of experiments made to top it.<br /><br />Forget the detractors and Beatles comparisons. Yes, the Beach Boys were the underdogs. WE KNOW. But the fact that one person can single-handedly influence and turn the heads of the biggest band in the world is quite extraordinary. This album will always be a true classic for the ages. Thanks Brian.<br /><br />P.S. - For those who think Pet Sounds is the Beach Boy's only great album, All Summer Long, Today!, and Friends are also terrific.ums do.

B000H5U832|5.0|This movie is wonderful for all ages.  It has a clean format and actually teaches about the proper way to relate with people and how one can make a difference. <br /> <br />I recommend it for anyone that needs a laugh, to have a pick-me-up, wants to unwind and leave the day behind, or subtlety get a message of ethics to a rock head. <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|4.0|My intake on this version of P&P was Colin Firth outshone Jennifer Ehle in protraying the give and take romance. I thought her looking too old for 21 and not much fire as Lizzie. Colin used his emotions with his fabulous eyes in  showing his feelings. The love that was showed in them in the piano scene with Lizzie and his sister left no doubt of his love for Lizzie. I also did not care for the shrieking mother, she grated on my nerves like sqeaky chalk, and I moved the scenes around so I did not have to endure her. Wickum looked like he was in his 40s tho he was supposed to be of the same age as Darcy. All in all, it was ok but I would not have bought and watched this if not for Colin Firth
B000HIVO64|5.0|The Information: It's been said that this album is Beck's return to form, and<br /><br />it's also been said that he's a day late and a dollar short and this album is<br /><br />a bus departing on a trip to nowhere. To imply that the imprint left by<br /><br />Beck's influence is now gone, would be a grave inaccuracy. If you are really<br /><br />paying attention, then you may notice that The Information rises up amidst<br /><br />labels like Mush and Anticon who have been selling Beck's formula, albeit<br /><br />quite altered, for some time now. In fact this marketing campaign is almost<br /><br />flawless when you put on the right eyes. With Guero, Beck left his avid fans<br /><br />excited that he brought the beat back and didn't make another slow record; he<br /><br />made us excited to see Dust Brother again, but ultimately Guero's downfall<br /><br />was in how poorly the songs themselves aged, as they ultimately lacked his<br /><br />full potential regarding both headphone depth and dancefloor grandeur. Now,<br /><br />we see him return to the recording team he worked with on his slow albums,<br /><br />but delivering a dancefloor assault that seems to effortlessly give the Dust<br /><br />Brothers a run for their money. I was very interested in the remix album<br /><br />Guerolito, and in fact I often refer to it as an upgrade from the original (a<br /><br />questionable view, I admit). However, looking back on those releases, The<br /><br />Information seems to have a great relationship to those works, and they even<br /><br />seem to contain some unsaid message when compared to each other. Really they<br /><br />all contain the same ingredients, and yet they all feel vastly different,<br /><br />despite how familiar Beck's approach might be becoming. Also important to<br /><br />note, are the artists Beck hand picked to remix for the Guerolito project,<br /><br />because they further acknowledge that Beck has not missed the bus, but in<br /><br />fact the context of this work is vast and fresh. There are parts of this<br /><br />album which also place him in the context of artists like Badly Drawn Boy,<br /><br />Bright Eyes, and even the artists on the Thrill Jockey label. So, considering<br /><br />what is happening in the landscape of lo-fi electronica, indie folk, emo hip<br /><br />hop, and the whole unsaid pantheon of left-field post hip-hop (IE: Busdriver,<br /><br />Paul Barman, Sage Francis, and possibly even Saul Williams), I would say that<br /><br />the suggestion that Beck's core sound belongs back in the 90's, where it came<br /><br />from, is absurd. At times you can even hear the cross inspiration between<br /><br />Beck and Air. Also, considering how we have to reintroduce everything good<br /><br />from the past to each new batch of kids, time only seems to be barely<br /><br />catching up with this man who was always ahead of his time. Now, thanks to<br /><br />him, we have folk-hop, lo-fi indie poetry rap, and about a million sublets<br /><br />for mixing a drum machine with an acoustic guitar. Beck was never perfect,<br /><br />but he always knows how to just be himself and, within the range of what he<br /><br />has always aimed to do, he continues to evolve. You can't deny how much<br /><br />better this album works than the last two, although I bet all three would<br /><br />make a mean randomized play list. It's kind of ridiculous what has been said<br /><br />about this album, because Beck gave us two departures, in both Sea Change and<br /><br />a few albums before that, in Mutations, and he has not returned to form<br /><br />without being very informed by these departures, as well as all of his other<br /><br />ventures (to some degree even Midnight Vultures could be considered a<br /><br />stylistic departure). The long experimental ending of this album should not<br /><br />go without mention either, starting off sounding like Herbie Hancock's<br /><br />Headhunters and ending up sounding more like Meat Beat Manifesto on the<br /><br />experimental side of Subliminal Sandwhich. ALL HAIL THE INFORMATION!<br /><br />PS: this doesn't mean I'm not mad about the delux edition being released so soon!
B000002OZY|3.0|As many others, this is the first Who album I was exposed to and first I loved it. As I got more and more into the band's music my fondness for it began to fall, not only because of the mostly absurd lyrics but also due to the flat production. I can see why Kit Lambert wanted more an orchestra feel than a rock a roll one, but in most of the songs the classical Who punch is absent (being Sparks one of the most obvious examples). For a more faithful sample of the real Tommy check out the live versions from either Live At Leeds or Isle of Wight.    I can see why it's so highly regarded. After all, it came in a moment where The who seemed to be bound to call it quits, but it's not the masterpiece that's said to be.     The one track I really skip is Underture and I'm sure I'm not the only listener who does. Overlong and decidedly filler, it either should have been drastically shortened or directly dropped.    Highlights for me include:    -Overture.  -Amazing journey.  -The Acid Queen.  -Pinball Wizard.  -Go To The Mirror.  -Tommy Can You Hear Me.  -I'm Free.  -We're Not Gonna Take It.    3/5.
B00004W52U|5.0|That pretty much sums it up right there. this great album is sadly now out of print. I Love this whole album and opivy was one of the greats with their belief in peace and unity. Their antiwar pro peace songs were the best. If you like this then check out common rider. Go, now look at common rider, now!!!!!!!
0060989157|5.0|I love this book!  It is a must read for any Motley Crue fans.  I really enjoyed the way it was written, each band member giving his own perspectives throught out the book.  I was a kid when Motley Crue was at the height of their success, so I found this book both entertaining and informative - a true rock & roll story!  Without a doubt, worth reading and owning.

B00006RCNJ|5.0|I have many Andre Rieu DVD's...every one of them is fantastic. I will soon have one of each that has been released.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I only have 2 small issues with this 2-Disc Special Edition.  First, that the 2nd 'extras' disc, though having a most wonderful little 'making of' feauturing cast & crew... doesn't have too much else to go along with it.  It doesn't seem like QUITE enough to warrent the second disc.<br /><br />Second, even though I love most of the extra scenes added back in... the one where Mozart (drunk) returns to 'Dog man' to beg for patronage... is just too painfully pathetic and completely unnecessary. It doesn't even match-up well to how Mozart was portrayed immediately before or after, and sticks out like a sore-spot on the movie. It reminds one that some things are left OUT for very good reason.  Other than this point (which can be corrected with swift use of a fast-forward button)  this movie, as before, is simply timeless and highly recommended.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard an Evanescence song was in Mexico about four years ago. I was watching Daredevil and the songs Bring me to Life and My Immortal were on it. I could tell that they were by the same person, so I got on the internet and looked up the band. Thus started my Evanescence addiction. I bought Fallen and it was firmly settled. EVANESCENCE IS AWESOME!!! 110% recommended!!!!
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I have to say that this was even better than I thought. I loved the storyline and I think the whole movie was sit on the edge of your seat good. I love all genres of movies but I really love movies like this. It was Dark, Hot, and Top Notch. The actors did a great job at protraying their characters and the effects of the powers displayed in this movie are just awesome. I personally recommend this movie. It is a must have.
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|The only commercial radio I ever listen to is Radio Nova, Paris, which is where I discovered this gem. Fantastic album, incredible voice, and she's a really strong songwriter. Also, she's a foxy Jewish naughty girl who manages to \\"sing black\\" without being coming off affected. <br /> <br />I hope she doesn't wreck her life and career with alcohol, though -- seems like a serious risk. She may turn out to be as talented as that other brilliant transgressive alcoholic Jewish songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, who more or less destroyed himself with drink and tobacco.
0553296981|3.0|My expectations for this book were pretty high. I have read a few other holocaust books and I was curious to see how this one would measure up to the rest. My expectations were fulfilled. I thoroughly enjoyed this diary. Having just read 'Night' by Elie Wiesel, I saw how completely different this book was. The main characters in both novels were dealing with the holocaust but in Anne's case she was not living in a concentration camp, so it was interesting to compare the two accounts. As the reader, I believe the biggest strength of this book was the ability to easily be transported into Anne's world. Her stories were witty and personable but at the same time it is hard to even imagine the fear that she lived with. I would say the one weakness of the book is that some of the entries and stories that she told didn't grab my attention as well as others did. At certain points in the book I almost felt bored and ready to skip over entries that were not interesting to me. Overall, this book left me with a bittersweet feeling. It was devastating to know that after that last entry Anne did not go on to live the rest of her life. However, at the same time she learned so much about herself and those who she lived with while she was in hiding, and she completes her diary with a hopeful outlook of the future.
0740748475|5.0|A definite 'must have'! And Amazon takes care of excellent delivery. Just look up 'Calvin & Hobbes' online, read a few of them, fall in love and order the entire collection!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Do NOT right this movie off because of the first 15 minutes.  It's a slow start, probably because you're supposed to be introduced to all the characters.  The boredom continues while the family sits at the dinner table eating chicken.  But, as soon as this scene is over, the movie improves drastically. <br /> <br />As you've heard by now, Little Miss Sunshine is about a dysfunctional family who has to travel to a beauty pageant together for their 7-year old daughter.  Each member of the family has their own wacky problems, and you will find out about them as the movie rolls along.  You have to be patient and pay attention or else it won't seem like a very funny  move.  Trust me, it is.  Good writing truly makes this movie a winner.
0156027321|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of Pi's adventure.  His solution to what church to join was perfect. It's such a big question for all of us. I found Richard Parker the most sympathetic character, but did not understand why until the surprising end.  Poor Pi, and poor untameable Richard Parker.  They made me cry.  It's a good book for both deep thinking and also for those who want something lighter.  I'll be looking for more from this author.  More about Pi would also be nice.
0393061434|3.0|I really wanted to like this book.  Woz is a geek icon, after all, and the early stories of his life and inventions are the stuff of legend.  They had to be better coming straight from the horse's mouth, right?   <br /> <br />The stories themselves are interesting: redesigning commercial devices on paper to reduce the number of chips, why colour was so important to him, knocking together Breakout in a few sleepless days, making the Apple I.  And there's all of Woz's pranks over the years.   <br /> <br />But the problem is, Woz just doesn't have the gift of storytelling.  All through the book, I felt like I was simply reading a transcription of stories that he's been telling in person every time he speaks for the past 20 years.  (Reading the afterword, I'm pretty sure that I'm right on this regard.)  Okay, so they were scrubbed for um and ah, but that's about it.  It gives the book a conversational tone that makes me feel like he's skipping over all the really interesting stuff. <br /> <br />With the loving touch of a good editor, this could have been a much better book.  It was immensely repetitive, with Woz re-telling stories multiple times.  There wasn't nearly enough about the early days of Apple, nor about Woz's departure from the company.  The tone of the book was entirely too self-congratulatory, with hardly a page going by where Woz didn't say how clever he is.  It trails off post-Apple. <br /> <br />If you're interested in the history of computing, and specifically Woz's contribution to it, there are many other places to start that will give you a much better picture.  Read this book only after you've read those.
1881273628|5.0|i've read a number of relationship books and they seem to follow the same formula:  he's selfish, she's a nag; get over it and then you might get what YOU want. <br /> <br />this book is nothing like that.  chapman points out that we don't all speak the same love language.  he draws the analogy that this is like one person speaking english and another chinese.  the book instructs the reader on how to understand the mates language, which enables communication like never before.  it is so simple and yet highly relevant. <br /> <br />between the intro and the chapters which start to detail the love languages the book gets bogged down.  i suggest people skip this section or only read the first sentence of each paragraph within this portion of the book. <br /> <br />very readable and appropriate for adults of all ages.  a good book for those who need help or those who want to make things better.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Like watching a Mexican telenovela, only not as interesting.  (And I don't speak Spanish!) <br /> <br />Riddled with stereotypes!  For example, what Mexican wedding would be complete without a liquored up Mexican shooting a gun in the air?  And don't forget the chicken with its head cut off.   <br /> <br />Does Brad Pitt hate Mexico?  In his earlier movie, The Mexican, there were burros at the Mexico City airport!  Ever been to the airport in Mexico City?  It makes LaGuardia look like it services provincial rubes.   <br /> <br />And what Moroccan prepubescent boy doesn't masturbate thinking of his naked sister?  Good grief.  Is this what elites really think of the so-called \\"third world\\"?   <br /> <br />And how many times does the film have to go silent so that we know what the deaf Japanese girl with hot pants experiences? <br />
B000F1IQN2|3.0|Not the movie, but the Middle East, nay, the whole friggin' world. <br />Brutish Neanderthal madness run amok. Say your prayers ,kids, because <br />Santa and the Easter Bunny ain't gonna wave their magic wands to deliver us from our own ignorance. The highlight of the movie was seeing Peter Green's \\"Black Magic Woman\\" performed in some Middle Eastern language. <br />Was it Arabic? The guitarist nails the solo, although you don't really get a close up view of the band. The Great Greenie is listed as \\"Peter Alan Green\\" in the credits. An above average movie. It had it's moments of inspiration and insight... and too many unecessary scenes. What's with the bloody naked chick dying in her chair? Sheesh! I suppose that scene is meant to draw in the women haters, or maybe to show how violence leads to the most repulsive acts. Thanks for the reminder, Mr. Speilberg.
0441008615|4.0|I never thought that it would be possible to describe the apocalypse as riotously funny, but Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett have pulled off that mean feat in \\"Good Omens,\\" a comical take on the end of days. What's so funny and unique about it? The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have updated their image, becoming the Four Motorcyclists of the Apocalypse instead. A hospital mix-up has the Antichrist sent home with the wrong family, causing a lot of confusion for him and the hapless human boy who is raised in his place. Along the way the wayfaring angels and demons caught in the build-up to doomsday must contend with the equally outrageous cast of human characters as well as the prophecies of the old, aptly named witch Agnes Nutter, whose crazed ramblings have a way of coming true. I don't want to spoil the lot of the twists and turns this novel takes because part of the joy is seeing how the end of the world goes so spectacularly wrong for yourself, so the last bit I'll mention is how, in one particularly inspired moment, the Hell-hound that is sent to serve the Antichrist (who has been raised as a normal boy thanks to the aforementioned mix-up) in all of his evil machinations is reduced to playing fetch and chasing cats like any run-of-the-mill pooch.<br /><br />I first read this book about five years ago and it hasn't lost its ability to make me chuckle in the passing years, and now I've picked it up and am re-reading it with the same level of enjoyment that I got the first time. Gaiman and Pratchett's creative twists and manic hilarity make for an excellent read, and I would highly recommend this book: read it for the inspired satire or read it for sheer entertainment, just get thee a copy and dive in!
B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman traveled to his distant home after scientists on Earth had thought that they had discovered the far-away planet with a telescope.  When Superman got there, all that remained was a graveyard.  He came to the final conclusion that HE is all that was left from his civilization.  With this is mind, he had no where to go but back to Earth.    Unfortunately, in the mean time, the sinister Lex Luthor discovered the strange, almost magical crystals that came from Superman's planet.  He leaned how to harness them for his own evil ends.  He also commandeers the recordings that Superman's deceased father had created, and listens to them in order to understand the extent of his new found powers.  He creates a continent, a continent that will cause global flooding and kill billions.  He steals kryptonite and makes it a fundamental piece of the new continent so that Superman cannot interfere!    Meanwhile, in Superman's personal life, the lovely Lois Lane is engaged to marry and now has a son.  Superman now has a forminable enemy and a larger void in his personal life.  The movie shows how Superman uses his wit and attempts to get around the problem of a Kryptonite laced continent and still defeat Lex Luthor.    Aside from the main plot that involves an evil new continent and love for Lois Lane, Superman also goes back to his old ways of saving lives and fighitng crime.  There are several scenes that show him dominate and subdue common criminals.  He defeats things such as machineguns and catches falling innocents.  There is also a somewhat-related scene, when he tries to save a spaceship and and airplane.  In this particular scene, there are great special effects.    If you are somewhat attached to the original Superman, you will be pleased, as those who did the casting did a pretty good job in selecting characters to this sequel.  The Special Effects are really off the hook, especially during the daring plane rescue.  The plot is solid enough to keep you interesting throughout this fun movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
0618680004|5.0|\\"Perhaps Dawkins' understanding of religion is limited to his obedience to a Christian preacher as a child.\\" <br /> <br />What Dawkins criticizes mainly is Christianity, because that's the predominant religion of his culture, after which, he generalizes that all gods are bad, all religions potentially harmful. He understands this better than they do. Most religious followers may be peaceful all their lives, but they're in a dormant state, from where, if for whatever reason, they all got angry, they have more than enough justification to commit mass murder, because their books all contain explicit passages, though brief, advocating murder in the name of god. If, under extremely hostile conditions, they were told by a religious authority that their god says it's okay, they won't be able to argue otherwise. They were trained only to be obedient. This pertains to all major religions.   <br /> <br />Indeed, religious followers don't seem to be capable of arguing at all, as is explicitly shown by the irrelevant criticism made by the owner of the quote above. Of course, this pertains to almost all religions as well. If their followers could think rationally, religion wouldn't exist. Fortunately, however, evolution is the great equalizer, favoring only the most rational and efficient. Irrational arguments lead to irrational choices. As demonstrated by Ted Haggard, who, perhaps, may be taken as a representative of those deeply religious followers, who fail to reconcile the difference between good and evil, they are destroying themselves. <br /> <br />When they get angry, they destroy each other, too. Evolution always wins.  <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is quick cuz I gotta go. I got this cd a long time a go and listen to it almost every day while I'm doing my work. The greatest metal cd of all time. The guitars and drums and bass players are freaking prodigies. The singer has a huge range and almost a whiny but great voice. Its new and refreshing. Buy this now. (Also reccomend their sophomore album more then their debut)

B000IFQLLY|5.0|Any DM fan is already saturated with the songs included in this compilation. If you are new to DM, this is the wrong place to start, go buy Violator, Songs of Faith and Devotion, Ultra, etc ...  <br /> <br />What is really worth here is the new amazing DM track called 'Martyr' ... it reminded of 'ol times when they were perhaps more dark, subtle and powerful. A 5 star just for that one song!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|If you are not sure weather to spend your hard earned dollars on this cd...think no longer and buy it. If you are a fan of metal and a slight electronic sound mixed together WELL, this is for you. I bought this around five months after hearing their first single, and was no where near disappointed. I love all rock music, and this is one of the best albums I own. Its different and refreshing to hear after hearing so much rap and punk rock and hip hop that clogs the radio channels.  <br /> <br />Attack: Amazing song with really a really powerful chourus. <br />Beautiful Lie: Never heard anything like this before, its awesome. <br />The Kill: Their biggest song right now, and if you havent seen the video, then see it.  <br />Was it a dream?: More of a ballad with no screaming, still good. <br />Fantasy: Probably the best song on here next to Attack and From Yesterday. <br />Savior: One of the best songs I've ever heard. <br />From Yesterday: While this song is maybe the best song on here, U2 fans will be very mad...(The Streets have no name INTRO anyone??) <br />The Story: Another new sound, really good song <br />R-Evolve: you will find yourself randomly humming this song if you hear it a few times. Real catchy. <br />A modern myth: The acoustic song, real good, kind of short but its still sweet. <br />Bonus tracks include a remake of some bjork song called hunter.  <br />A battle of one: Even though its really short, its pretty intense. <br /> <br />YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU BOUGHT THIS ALBUM! <br />
B000F39M9W|3.0|The hype surrounding this recording is somewhat unwarranted.  The Walt Disney Concert Hall provides acoustics that are superior to those of any other venue, and this recording captures that sound wonderfully.  The deep booming bass and superb dynamic contrasts are the uniquely pleasurable aspects of this recording.  But great sound doesn't equal great performance.  I've always been somewhat disappointed in the way Esa-Pekka conducts early 20th century music from Eastern Europe.  Salonen always imbues these pieces with a kind of Boulezian gloss that obscures the primitivism that defines the music of Stravinsky, Bartok, and others of the \\"countryside to concert hall\\" school.  What we're left with are perfectly performed versions of the Rite and the Miraculous Mandarin that lack the excitement and force found in other recordings.  Despite the less than stellar sound, I'd take Dorati's version of the complete Miraculous Mandarin any day over this version.  And we don't have to sacrifce sound for a great performance of the Rite, thanks to Valery Gergiev's magnificent recording that evokes all of the necessary primitivism in one of the most exciting performances on record.  The Mussorgsky piece might be worth the price of admission, due to the relative obscurity of this version.  But depending on how interested you are in hearing the original version of the piece, the price tag may still be too steep.  I should add that since I've never heard another performance of this version, I can't honestly determine whether this is an excellent performance or just an average one.  But if you're buying this for the Rite or the Miraculous Mandarin, I'd say look elsewhere.  You can find better versions for less.
B00005JPDJ|3.0|jack black was an out-of-place miscast. he acted very badly in this movie. maybe because before this movie, he never seriously played a romantic figure. it resulted him acting so poorly just with his comic funny pretentious facial movements. the californian part in this movie was weaker than the part in england. contrite, cliched and boring, like watching a goodwill charity show. assisting the old screenwriter part was like watching social security's program to fill up an hollow and empty storyline. there's no way to imagine the english woman would have possibly fall for that comedian-like guy. there's no chemistry at all between them, both just acting dutifully to fulfill the mismatched cast. kate winslet obviously felt jack black's embarrassing miscast and showed some struggles to follow the script. she tried so hard to perform a role out of a bad script. i too, felt embarrassed every time when she got to play out the scenes with jack black. the scene shot in the blockbuster was such a stupid and totally unnecessary part that should be deleted.<br /><br />the reason why i decided to watch this movie was because i just curiously wondered why with such  strong cast, the general movie critics still thought it sucked big time. but then i totally understood why it's just marginally watchable. this is a very unbalanced movie with two strong & weak parts, further weakened by overly long blahblahblah script and the jack black miscast. a movie that would be only possible for you to sit through in x'mas.

0743289412|5.0|This was a nice change from King's usual type of writing.  The story was interesting enough to enthrall all the thriller needs of a usual King fan, but it had a tenderness to it that was unexpected.  I really enjoyed this book more than expected. I expected to be entertained by it, just not as much as I was.  I love Stephen King's previous works, but I think with this novel, he really has gone to the next level.
0553266306|5.0|This was unfortunate for Freddie Forsyth, because he was never able to match it. But then, neither was anyone else. Set in the aftermath of the Algerian crisis in the early 1960s in which an entire Foreign Legion paratroop regiment mutinied and formed the OAS (Secret Army Organisation), there was an attempt on the life of French President Charles de Gaulle and France trembled on the edge of civil war, the story is meticulously put together and excitingly told, with a bit of repetition of language (Mr. Forsyth seems to like trains; several times he described the demolition of someone's expectations or his person as if hit by a train). The Jackal, hired by the OAS to assassinate De Gaulle, is a cold-blooded killer who's in it purely for the money, yet curiously you find yourself rooting just a little for him. And you KNOW that Charles de Gaulle died in his bed in Colombey Les Deux &Eacute;glises in 1969, so the Jackal can't possibly succeed, yet the book keeps you reading right to the end - and the O. Henry-type twist that has become somewhat of a Forsyth trademark. By the way, most of the French politicians mentioned were real people in De Gaulle's government.<br /><br />All in all, a brilliantly-conceived and -presented thriller. I have yet to find a better one. (For what it's worth, Fred Zinneman's film of the novel, with Edward Fox as the Jackal, is also excellent. Avoid like the plague the appalling US remake starring Bruce Willis).
0618680004|4.0|No matter where you stand (or are stuck, or lie)this book is a must read.  Red meat for atheists.  Anathema to fundamentalists.  Ho hum for the rest of us?  Not exactly!  To Dawkins faith of any kind (except belief in evolution as the be-all and end-all of human existence) enables the evil perpetrated in the name of religion.  He conflates evolution and atheism, giving short shrift to those who accept evolution and are comfortable with traditional religious expression; those who exercise both faith and reason.  For centuries theologians have held that God is \\"beyond human understanding\\".  Dawkins writes (page 125) \\"...however little we know about God, the one thing we can be sure of is that He would have to be very, very complex and presumably irreducibly so.\\"  Exactly!    Oh, Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens too;  I don't think you have a clue!  You don't see him anywhere,  Not skin not bone not hide nor hair.  You didn't see him yesterday.  You wont see him again today.  God almighty!  Can't you see?  He's all around us; you and me.  Don't you wish He'd go away?
1559408855|5.0|This film is Pier Paolo Pasolini's testament. It has not aged one iota and is even probably better now than it used to be. The first strong element is that it has to do with sex, the body and the use of the body for all kinds of sexual activities and pleasures. But onanism is out. Sex is always an activity that connects at least two people, more often than less a lot more than two if you include the voyeurs. The film is turning our voyeurism into a saturated mental ability though strangely enough the film remains extremely prudish as for actually showing the sexual intercourse and the torturing that is to come sooner or later. In fact when he wants for us to « see » the men with erections he keeps them trousered so that you can only see a form which is not an organ per se. Only one erection is really shown but because it is the slave who has an erection after having given anal sex to his master and torturer turned here into the dominated partner. This erection is not like in all other draped or wrapped up cases the evidence of the pleasure of some men in front of some humiliation imposed to other boys and girls, hence a sadistic though passive pleasure. In this case it is the domination of the master by the slave who could have strangled him in a couple of minutes and didn't because he does not need to rebel : he has already conquered real power over the master for conquering his backside. In other words Pasolini still plays a tremendous lot with our voyeurism by not showing the real thing, but still keeping the act itself covered up, dissimulated, hidden. Note this dimension of seeing the physical excitement of the young boys and girls strutting in front of us in the nude and quasi-nude on the screen is only possible with the boys for very organic reasons. But the second level of the film is the political fable or parable. Yes fascism is tremendously present in our consciousness and life. But probably not this kind of fascism which is to alienate a human being to the point when he has lost all existence in society and thus can become raw material with which you can play at leisure in three stages : passions, excrements and fatal suffering. Note the passions are those of the masters imposed onto the slaves who are shown as mostly moving along and even getting into the game with quite a lot of willingness. There are many slaves who are happy in the society that makes them slaves. Note the excrements can come from anywhere and it is a pleasure for the masters to eat them and to impose their being eaten to the slaves and here again, maybe in a more difficult way, some slaves take to it, clearly this time in some kind of resilient desire to survive if it requires such a drastic diet. It is true that a kiss of two male mouths that have both eaten some feces has some kind of a pungent taste and even attractiveness in its very kinkiness. Note fatal suffering, torturing someone to death is this time definitely one way : the masters are torturing some of the slaves and using the others to help them achieve their pleasure. This time you find out that some will be totally willing to take part in the torture of another one if it enables them to avoid the torture for themselves. This is definitely a heritage from the Shoah and how the Nazis had managed to make prisoners their anciliary servants in the very task of eliminating them all. It is by the way the only reason why there were some survivors. Among slaves there will always be some who will collaborate with the masters even in the torturing and killing of the others provided it protects them from the same fate, or at least pushes that fate slightly forward into the future. There Pasolini becomes prophetic. And when the film stops on two surviving fifteen year old boys dancing together on some American sounding music and exchanging the names of their girlfriends we have a sad gospel about the true nature of humanity. Domination, power, cruelty, brutality are one side of all human beings. This side will be dominant as soon as circumstances permit. Then the majority who will be deprived of this power will divide easily between those who will collaborate to survive a little bit longer and those who will not or will be chosen not to resist at all and will become the raw material of the desires of the powerful. So these boys and girls will not sound or look as what their age should make them sound and look. They will have been transformed in our consciousness into some kind of lurking monsters who are roaming in the back of each man's skull and definitely on the retinas of all our eyes. We are all ready to accept suffering if it means pleasure and we are all ready to inflict suffering and death to others because it will mean pleasure for us. Pasolini had a tremendously sombre vision of humanity and it is a good thing this film has come back to life after nearly thirty years of clandestinity.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnengs.

B000305912|1.0|This was an impulsive purchase to complete my Emperor discography. Yet, I highly recommend avoiding this at all costs or at least hearing it first before making my mistake. Some people love a production that is so poor you can't make out anything worthwhile, I'm not one of them. The entire disc sounds like it was recorded on a 4 track, the vocals are too loud, the drums sound like a drum machine, the guitars you can't make out other than that strange barely audible buzzing through each track.<br /><br />AVOID AVOID AVOID.<br /><br />I'm so thankful this band progressed to much greater heights than this.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine, the little indie film that could, is in my opinion one of the best films of the year. extremly funny, quirky characters, and a simple plot that makes it work. the story is about this really dysfunctional family, the father and wife always argue, the grandpa spews profanity, the son refusses to talk, and the gay uncle tried to kill himself. however, the only normal one in the family Olive, has just been informed that she has entered the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. and with that, the family piles into a huge yellow bus and there off to California were as you can excpect things never go right. the family slowly but surley come together because of this pageant and though there far from perfect, at least there better then they started. whats best is this transformation isent shoved down our throats but is done in a very subtle yet prominent way. the humor is definently the funniest i have heard in a while but the most hilarious part is definently the pageant. i thought i was going to die laughing. the performances are also top notched, the best definently being Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, and Abigail Breslin, they just shine in the film but Breslin is the standout. i was pretty shocked that Alan Arkin won the oscar for Supporting Actor but, he's also a very nice choice though i still think Eddie should have got it. so if you want to see the most funny and dysfunctional family since the Burnhams, then this Sundance approved film is definently for you.
B0000214F0|5.0|Whereas the 97 minute rated edition is absolutely meaningless, the 155 minute un-rated version has a full unity, a full flow of meaning and a deep signification. We see the character of Caligula develop his paranoid schizophrenia into what the world permits and authorizes: a murdering frenzy growing out of a sexual perverse cornucopia of impulses crying for and imposing their satisfaction in the flesh of every one else around. The first thing clearly shown is that this Roman world is based on 80% of slaves. These are not even animals. They are furniture, facilities, commodities, and you can do what you want with them, just as if they were some pieces of un-assorted trash. But the film does not concentrate on these slaves that are just a decor, even a decoration, that can easily spread and sprinkle its blood on the walls or on the floors. The film concentrates on the \\"people\\" who are free, even at times citizens. Tiberius shows how he picks one soldier of his own guard to play with him by having him forcefully filled with wine and then emptying him by directly puncturing his stomach with a sword. Just out of a caprice or for a transient impulse for sadistic pleasure. Note in those days it was not even sadistic. It was just normal. The Emperor could do what he wanted. Caligula will reach summits and records along that line, even with senators and their wives. He systematically exploited not the minds of people but the bodies of people and there was no end to his pleasure in blood, or any bodily fluid or orifice you could imagine. And when there was no door, he could always carve one with his sword. I must admit the standard death penalty and execution was a real pleasure for the onlookers that could throw oranges at the lively heads jutting out of the ground just before the reaping machine slowly came and cut off those terrorized heads like outgrowing grass. Quite more impressive than any lethal injection. But the film shows another element of that supposedly pagan Rome. Sex was in no way restricted by any rule or law. A daily activity you practiced just the same way as eating or drinking, or should I name more physiological functions, except that you did not need a taster for poison. You just took what you wanted, at any time, in any place, and very often it was all organized or even staged as part of the daily life of everyone. And there again slaves were a commodity, even if everyone could be the toy of their neighbours without being able or willing to protest. Just as they overfed themselves in banquets, even to the point of visiting the vomitarium, they over-consumed the bodies of their surrounding human beings and the men could always use a slave to do what they could not do anymore, and then get rid of the slave for good measure and as the cherry topping the whip-cream of the a la mode pastry. After a while you discover the ambition of the film. We are in 37-41 after Christ. The Christian faith and civilizing influence had still to come to cover up this deeply animal nature of man, though few animals kill for pleasure. But do not believe man has changed. Man has just learned how to hide this deep nature that can come out at any time, particularly in war time or when decency disappears in the name of some absolute rule, be it a moral or religious rule, be it the rule of a dictator or whatever. El Ghraib is a common field of realization of human barbaric impulses that have never been eradicated from man because they just cannot be eradicated. And don't tell me women would be different. These impulses are part of the very soil that nurtures, feeds and breeds the civilized or so they call it education of modern human beings. This film is a remake of sorts of Pasolini's Salo as a big expensive super-show peplum film that justifies excesses, not with the word fascism, but with the word paganism. But where is the difference, where is it different? The name does not matter when you have the same mixture of blood, wine and sperm.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne<br /> <br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne <br />

0552998486|5.0|Years after seeing Chocolat the movie, I have finally read Chocolat the book.  As usual, the book was way better than the movie.  While Chocolat the movie implies that Vianne is a witch, the book makes it abundantly clear that Vianne has magical powers.  She turns the small French town on its head when she opens a chocolate shop.  The book focuses much more on the issue of Lent and giving up chocolate.  Another key difference is that the book features two or three short chapters told from Vianne's point of view and then one short chapter told from the priest's point of view.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good women's fiction, especially those featuring a bit of magic.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Clint Eastwood has proven himself (if there was ever any doubt after Million Dollar Baby) to be a master filmmaker.  With Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby under his belt (2 bonafide masterpieces), one wondered how he would top them.  His answer was to direct not only one but TWO films about WWII (the other being Letters from Iwo Jima).  This film generally got mixed reviews from critics, and many were disappointed.  I wasn't.  I think this is a magnificent film, truthful, sad, cynical, heartbreaking, and yet, somehow uplifting in some ways.  It centers on the offical lies about the famous Iwo Jima photograph.  We find out the exact circumstances as to why this photo was rendered, and we find out on the 3 servicemen who were exploited by the Roosevelt Administration (showing that exploiting servicemen is a bipartisan enterprise) and how they were pretty much jettisoned after the government had no further use for them.  In many Eastwood films, there are a few bad performances in the minor roles.  Here that isn't the case.  The trio of lead actors, Adam Beach, Ryan Phillipe, and Jesse Bradford, are superb.  There isn't a false note or performance in the entire film.  One of the best aspects about this film is how it's edited.  The film has graphic war footage, but it's interpersed in the film in an interesting way.  The war footage, unlike other overly graphic war films like Saving Private Ryan, doesn't revel in its cruelty.  It's there to move the film along.  This film also really gives you a sense of the battle for Iwo Jima.  You see the military strategy in how they take the island, painful step by painful step.  The military people here are not the stupid, gung ho types that often are portrayed in Hollywood films.  They are much more down to earth and real.  Regardless about your feelings about war and the cause of, you can't help but feel for all soldiers after seeing this film (and its companion Letters).  The ending of this film is one of the more beautiful that I've seen.  It flashes back to a rather simple scene that ends up being unexpectedly poignant.  This is a great film, and should be seen in tangent with Letters from Iwo Jima....that I've seen.  It flashes back to a rather simple scene that ends up being unexpectedly poignant.  This is a great film, and should be seen in tangent with Letters from Iwo Jima....
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, is off-the-bat incredible. Going in with virtually no expectations, except being told from multiple people how excellent it was, I was more than pleasantly suprised. The book is well written, intellectual, and very insightful. The biggest weakness is the reader's inability to comprehend and realize the messages portrayed. The author's style is fluid and clear. The book is fast-paced enough so it is not dry but very much followable. I have yet to read other Coelho books but I every intention of doing so. I walked positively from this novel looking at my life in a different alomst spiritual way and wanting more life altering books. Definetly a must-read!

B000KJU1MS|5.0|Wow...habe nun endlich das Material von Kissology gesichtet und ich muss sagen, dass ich beeindruckt bin! Natürlich habe ich seit Jahren die entsprechenden Bootlegs, aber nicht zusammengefasst auf zwei bzw. drei DVDs (inklusive Bonus Disc). Es wurde dazu auch schon viel geschrieben und ich möchte nur das Wichtigste hervorheben, was unter Umständen ins Gewicht fällt, wenn man eine Kaufentscheidung treffen möchte. Kissology kommt in einem attraktiven Papschuber daher und sieht sehr gut aus. Tolle Fotos in der Innenseite! Dazu liegt natürlich ein entsprechendes Booklet bei, das wirklich schönes Fotos beinhaltet und dazu Kommentare zu den einzelnen Performences von Gene und Paul, teilweise sogar von Ace!!! <br />Einige interessante Auftritte sind vertreten, doch am wichtigsten ist die Tatsache, dass man vier fast komplette Konzerte bewundern kann, wobei die Bildqualität natürlich variiert. Am besten schneidet das Budokan-Konzert ab, mit der besten Bildqualität. Der Ton ist etwas dumpf. Dann folgt das Summit-Konzert, was eigentlich nicht schlechter ist. Leider etwas dunkel, aber das liegt wohl daran, dass das Konzert nicht optimal beleuchtet war. Also kein Fehler vom Mastertape! Leider ist das Cobohall-Konzert qualitativ nicht ganz so gut, aber immer noch top. Macht schon wirklich viel Spaß, die Band zur Alive-Tour in Aktion zu sehen. Gerade Gene und Paul merkt man an, wie hungrig auf Rock 'n' Roll sie wohl damals waren. Zum guten Schluss kommt das Winterland Konzert, etwas schlechter als die anderen, aber auch noch gut genug (viele Dropouts und \\"Ameisen\\" haben sich eingschlichen). Das Bild ist aber scharf und das Konzert wurde gut beleuchtet. Der Sound ist etwas \\"gewöhnungsbedürftig\\", stört aber nie! alles im allen ein tolles Paket, was keinen Kiss-fan enttäuschen wird. Darauf haben wir jahrzehnte gewartet. 5 Sterne von mir! kaufen!!!!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Brothers in Arms was the album that put Dire Straits securely on the map. However that 'map' was in terms of commercial success. While that is a good album, Making Movies is a great album. This is the Dire Straits that came to prominence with two outstanding records. This is Dire Straits finest record as this was a band  that  could only improve, thus this was the  culmination of their output together. Funny how a three piece  band really hit it on their third  record. Buy this and enjoy,  no doubt you will.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Stargate Atlantis is much like SG-1 with a different cast but it still rocks. The first season is great. It begins with epic pilot and has an epic cliffhanger at the end. The new environment is interesting and offers a lot of possibilities for the writers to play with. The cast is good even though I don't like Weir as much as Hammond of Texas. The humour is still there and it's an important part of Stargate.

Plus songs that I didn't have but would have wanted to include in it. It may not be perfect, it may be missing some songs you would like to see on it, but it's a good collection to represent the history of one of the best bands ever.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This album is by far the best Alternative Rock composition I've ever heard. I can't stop listening to it, and I've owned it for nearly a year. It is amazingly haunting, and the classical aspects of Muse's sound is a great balance with the darker aspects of it. Great percussion, bass and electric guitar, piano, strings.... I just can't get over this. During some cuts, I feel empowered as I listen to them, while during others, I'm wonderfully emotional (if is there is such a thing). I'll use one of the cuts as a soundtrack for a skydive jump I'll do shortly. \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\" would be very appropriate. Buy this album. No regrets... I promise you.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|This film was given one star only because it is the lowest available. Normally I'm a big fan of Brad Pitt (as an actor), but his pathetic attempts to channel Russell Crowe in Gladiator are painful to watch. Yes, there's a lot of action, but that certainly doesn't make up for the wooden acting, not to mention the desperate grasping for that one memorable catch-phrase (\\"Is there no one else?!\\" comes to mind, among others). Bleh. Not to mention the fact that you should never try to outdo perfection; although this is an adaptation, it seems like a bad high school production. The Iliad is a masterpiece, and Pitt has only managed to mangle it with his hopes of being remembered as an \\"action hero\\". The only redeeming quality this movie has is Eric Bana's portrayal of Hector. Perhaps he should have been given the lead.
0743298020|5.0|Talk about gifted writers...when is her next book coming out?!   A breath of fresh air amongst the stale selection of novels proported to be best sellers. Diane Setterfield definitely sets the bar to new heights.  Thank you for such an amazing story that will undoubtedly be enjoyed for generations to come!
B000M4RG42|2.0|I read the book before the movie came out, so I have something to compare it to.  As a previous review stated, the tone of the movie was erratic and uncohesive.  As with most movies from books, the book was a lot better.  The only real interesteing parts are the ones with the Jesse Bradford(Rene Gagnon), he did a good job of what I pictured the real guy was like from the book.  Adam Beach(Ira Hayes) was okay in the crying scene, nowhere else.  Ex-Mr Reese Witherspoon(James Bradley)was wooden all the way through.  Although from the book, he was reserved most of his life. <br /> <br />The movie did not take the same approach as the book, which is where it fails miserably.  The movie chronology is where the biggest mistake was made.  The actor playing the author(was it him?) in the end did not go with the tone again.  Too bad.  I like all things Clint, don't get me wrong, but Spielberg should have done this one, even if it was going to be compared to Saving Private Ryan.  It was going to be anyway no matter who directed it.  SPR was better in the tone and narrative.  A big, aweful, dissapointment.  I was in the military, so I really wanted to like this, but just couldn't.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|A very cute, teen movie.  It is kind of a combination of previous dance/romance movies, but with enough of an updated twist to find interesting.  I really enjoyed it, and it didn't hurt that you have Channing Tatum to look at during the whole movie :-)
B00004YMRZ|5.0|This version has gotten bashed really bad by a lot of people, but I have to say it is my favorite of all.  Despite what some people think, the happy ending is what really makes it all worth watching - there's nothing ambiguous about it.  It bugs me that somebody out there didn't think to save that version for DVD, because a lot of us out here want to see it again.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD was surprisingly good. I had not heard it before I bought this CD. I was not expecting so many great songs on a CD. Mariah did a great job---truly! I would recommend this CD, not just if you like Mariah's voice and style, but if you like upbeat and romantic music combinations.<br /><br /> I've played this CD over and over again.
B00005ATZT|3.0|...that is the message from this rather illogical but fast-moving film. Poor old (wrongly convicted) Dr. Richard Kimble escapes from State Prison, and through some inexplicable legal quirk, the Federal Government takes jurisdiction for capturing him. Good thing too, since (according to this film) all state cops and other State and Local authorities are venal idiots, and the Feds, by contrast, are hyper-competent and masterful Law Enforcement Professionals (capital letters). I love the scene where Tommy Lee Jones (a Federal Marshal, no less) almost captures Kimble (Harrison Ford)... Get Down On Your Knees Richard, if you don't want to get shot!... (you can almost hear him think: \\"this is the proper position for ANYONE when in the presence of the all-mighty Federal Government...\\" By the way, fugitive Richard Kimble has not committed the ultimate crime of criticizing an incumbent politician within 30 days of an election in violation of McCain-Feingold. No, he is (wrongly) convicted of murdering his wife.<br /><br />When referring to a large drug company, Tommy Lee Jones (embodying the Federal Government) remarks \\"that company does nine billion dollars in sales a year... it is a monster\\" ... you can almost hear him say \\"...the kind of monster that Bill and Hillary have been fighting all their lives.\\"<br /><br />Despite the heavy-handed portrayal as the Federal Government as the rightful Master of Us All, this is a fast-paced action film that holds the viewer's interest. Harrison Ford is as appealing as always, and Tommy Lee Jones shows us that we don't really need laws or judges to restrain the Federal Government, because it has contempt for these things anyway. After all, as Jones points out, he wants wiretaps on everyone, including Kimball's lawyer, and he will justify this later, \\"if I'm in a good mood.\\" Hey, who needs the Constitution?<br /><br />Yes, I admit it, I've got an attitude about this film. I still enjoyed it though. Go figure.
0385335482|5.0|I've never read much chic-lit, so this was a new experience for me. While I did get a bit confused (I don't know too much about British department stores and how much things cost there), I still thoroughly enjoyed the book. For the first two hundred pages, the main character, Rebecca Bloomwood, lost my respect. I saw her as irresponsible and frivolous. However, in the final hundred pages, she redeemed herself in my mind, making this book worth five stars. I thought this book was great fun, and I'm not even that into shopping!
0783114893|5.0|No other film has incurred the ire of prolific critic Roger Ebert more than 1986's The Hitcher.  \\"...diseased and corrupt...showing a deep sickness at the screenplay stage...a reprehensible film.\\"  Ouch.  Since its release in 1986, to little fan fare and nearly universal critical distaste, The Hitcher has since garnered the admiration of genre fans the world over.  It is a tricky thriller, fast-paced, action-packed, brutal, stylish, beautifully photographed and scored.  The film raises questions it in no way begins to answer.  The relationship between the protagonist and villain being a dandy of an enigma.  There is no sub plot and little back story.  In the end, The Hitcher leaves a feeling of distance in the viewer, a palpable numbness, which to some will invariably revolt, even sicken, for others will chill to the bone.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I gave this movie four stars because I found it extremely entertaining.  The acting was really top notch and what sets the film apart.  The story was amusing.  For the amount of sight gags involved, I didn't expect the very dramatic and almost sad side of the movie.  Overall I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys dark comedy and is not easily offended.  There are a couple of parts of the movie that are pretty sick, even obscene.  Just watch, and you will know what I mean.  Abigail Breslin was really outstanding as the contest entrant.  Her energetic personality was a perfect contrast to the stark despair that existed in many of the other characters.  Steve Carell was great (as usual).  The movie's theme is best summarized in a Proust quote that Carell delivers in a very poignant moment towards the end of the film.
B000005HFH|5.0|There's this kid who worked for me some 40 years ago. i said \\"Chet Baker is in town. if you dont go hear him, you're fired,\\" he's still thanking me.

Parker came back from the coast after playing with Chetty for a few weeks. he says to Miles, \\"theres a white boy out there who's going to blow you away.\\" Chet has been blowing & singing some of the Best ever since!!! buy this or you're fired.
0375831002|5.0|This is a brilliant, beautiful book for a mature teen who can appreciate 550 pages of extraordinary writing and handle its difficult subject matter.  In amazing detail and through memorable characters, Zusak tells the story of a starving, illiterate German girl named Liesel who, at 10 years old in 1939, is left by her mother with foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann.  The story follows Liesel's life during the war.  We see what happens to her, her foster family, her friends, and her neighbors in Molching, near Munich on the road to Dachau.  Most of the characters are Christian, but there is a key Jewish character with a major impact on Liesel, Jewish prisoners are marched through the town, and the book focuses on what some Germans could do to maintain their humanity in spite of Nazi horrors.  The narrator of the story is Death.  Death does not kill; he collects the souls of the dead and is portrayed as sad and tired, desolate in the face of the losses of war and the Nazi regime. But the story is not all misery.  There is friendship, love, kindness, soccer games, and the joys of reading. <br /> <br />Two main themes emerge:  First, the reality and importance of words, which bring Liesel to life as she learns to read and eventually save her life when she is writing her biography in the basement as her house is bombed.  Over and over again, the author writes of words as real things, e.g. \\"Burning words were torn from their sentences\\" and \\"A single word leaned against the girl.\\"  Second, this is a book about morality.  In dire circumstances, is it moral to steal food, break the law by hiding a Jew, escape death while others die, join the Nazi Party to protect one's family and livelihood, or ask others to risk their lives for you?  In the end, it is also a story about \\"the contradictory human being - so much good, so much evil.\\" REVIEWED BY SUSAN BERSON (DENVER, CO) <br />
B00004YYDI|5.0|This uncut version of \\"The Professional\\" adds more depth and character to an already great movie.  I don't understand why initial screenings of US audiences gave \\"mixed reactions\\" for the cut portions.  The uncut version does, indeed, show participation of Natalie Portman as a 12-year old girl aiding in \\"hits\\" but those scenes are not bloody - violent, and are not gratuitous - they are an integral part of the story development.  And there is some further development of Natalie Portman's character's romantic interest in Jean Reno's character.  But that also adds more depth to the story development and is done in good taste.  I feel Ms Portman and Mr. Reno turn in superb performances throughout the movie.  The straightforward depiction of the romantic interest of a 12-year old girl - an age where many girls start going through something like that - for a much older man, and the way that affects Leon as well as the way he handles it (very much the moral high-ground though he is obviously emotionally impacted) is well and tastefully done.  So in addition to the intrinsic value of seeing more of Natalie Portman, to repeat, the additional scenes flesh out the movie and make an even better movie out of an already excellent one.  I highly recommend this uncut version.  It is well worth purchasing even if one already owns the cut version.  The actual DVD was in excellent condition with good sound and picture as expected.
B00005JPDS|5.0|Will Smith, as Chris Gardner, and Jaden Smith, as his son Christopher, give outstanding performances in this inspiring movie based on the true story of a man who kept getting up when life knocked him down and overcame adversity to find success and, more important, \\"happyness.\\"<br /><br />  Gardner never loses his bearing. He never complains. Never makes excuses. He never blames other people, his hard circumstances or bad luck. The words \\"if only\\" never once come out of his mouth. He holds on to his vision. He keeps his priorities -- his son and being a good parent -- straight. He cannot control the big outcome that he wants, but he can control how he reacts to what's happening right now, and that's the key to fulfilling his vision. Because he makes good small choices more often than not, he ultimately finds what he's looking for. He has stamina, persistance and stubbornness. There are no guarantees any of it will get him what he wants, but he chooses to keep trying.<br /><br />  Gardner doesn't always make perfect choices (bone density scanners?) but he also doesn't add to his burdens by making rotten choices such as escapism, sitting in a depressed heap watching TV for hours every night, chain smoking, drowning his miseries each evening at the local bar or developing a drug habit.<br /><br />  The key moment is when Gardner goes out of his way to apologize for being late for a meeting. Though he still faces struggles, this is the turning point. It's this action that sets him apart -- not this specific action, but the fact that he does this kind of thing when few others would. His choice to make the apology results in an accumulation of opened doors that helps him save himself.<br /><br />  All of this rings true to real life which -- given that it's based on the true story of a man who had it even harder than the movie version -- is because it is real life.<br /><br />  Strengths of the movie include that it shows how thin the line is between shelter, food, warmth and comfort for so many people and homelessness and serious challenges without getting preachy, whiny or political. It shows how slight the safety net is. And its strengths include the high value the movie places on being a responsible parent.<br /><br />  Gardner is out for financial success, there's no doubt about that -- but the movie never suggests that this goal is any more important to him than being a good father and having a loving relationship with his child. The relationship between father and son is beautifully portrayed by the Smiths.<br /><br />  Another of the movie's strengths is that nothing is overplayed. When Gardner finds some success, he almost cries -- but he doesn't actually cry. The moment is played just right.<br /><br />  This movie is about how one man confronts the actual hard challenge of life and how the choices he makes help him succeed. Yes, it is a story that has been told many times before. But -- given all the negativity, pessimism and naysayers readily available to us all on a daily basis -- it's a story that cannot be overtold. It is the American story, and we need to keep hearing it.<br /><br />  Here was my favorite thing about this movie: The theater was packed and in the latter stages of the movie I snapped out of the trance Will and Jaden Smith had me in for long enough to notice that some of the people around me were clapping, cheering and crying. I haven't seen a movie in a long time that got the audience that involved.<br /><br />  Will Smith deserves all the awards he gets for this one.people and homelessness and serious challenges without getting preachy, whiny or political.

B00007KWHN|5.0|The album that hooked me and many other Yes fans still holds up as their masterpiece. Every track is a classic, even the seldom played A Venture is strong. Get this CD if you can only afford one Yes Album, this is the one folks and it still sounds as fresh as it did in 1971.
0783114893|5.0|Why Hollywood remakes movies such as \\"The Hitcher,\\" \\"Psycho\\" or \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" defies explanation. All of these should be seen in their original versions, not as remakes.<br /><br />  Every review I've read of the 2007 version of \\"The Hitcher\\" has been horrible, and I don't plan on wasting my money on it.<br /><br />  See this 1986 version. The combination of C. Thomas Howell, Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh; plus the landscape, music and lighting; plus Robert Harmon's direction made for a must-see thriller/horror classic. It is a work of art. If you like reading pulp/noir/crime fiction, you'll love watching this cult classic which succeeds as much because of perfect casting and perfect choices of locations as anything else.<br /><br />  But remaking this is like repainting classic art or rewriting Shakespeare -- I mean, it's just downright stupid and also doomed from the get-go.<br /><br />  [Five stars for the movie; I'm not rating the quality of this DVD (see reviews below).]
B000002UAU|4.0|Lennon is tired, he only contributes 3 songs and Beatlemania has taken it's toll. Paul steps in and practically makes a solo album in all but name. He writes 70% of the songs, invents the concept, cover and plays most of the guitar in Georges absense. Paul deserves more credit for this.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|What an awful movie.  From an entertainment standpoint what can be more boring then Al Gore standing in front of an audience lecturing for 90 minutes.  I was expecting a documentary in the vein of \\"Who Killed The Electric Car\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 911.\\"  The information about global warming is there but it is presented in such an analytical form that all the numbers seem to just not make sense after a while.  This movie also seems to be a bit of an ego trip for Al Gore.  Half the movie is about his personal life which I truly couldn't give a rats a** about.  Al Gore also seems like a bit of a hypocrite.  While talking about saving the earth, Al Gore drives around his ranch in a truck and flies around the world in highly pollutant airplanes.  I just didn't enjoy this movie.  If its on TV and you have an No-Doz capsule available try giving it a viewing.  If not, you don't have half a chance of staying awake through the whole movie.
B00009Z576|5.0|No matter how you look at it, this is a great Yes album. Every song here is good and the core of Howe, Squire and White are at their absolute peak. <br />Geoff Downes is great too here.
1582701709|4.0|this was a gift for X-mas and they are enjoying the book a lot.
B000002UA9|4.0|Straight from Hamburg, the little known at the time beat band plays their current stage set in the Abbey Road studio and records their first album in ONE 12 hour session, what an amazing beginning.
B000GPIPD8|4.0|No song really sticks out to me, but it's a good cd all the way through
B000002OX3|4.0|Pete only writes 3 songs Run Run Run,    So Sad About Us     & A Quick One, While He's Away    for this record, but they are all classics and John writes 2 of his best ever, Whiskey Man and Boris the Spider. This album is very good and Roger's Don't Look Away is very good for someone who's not considered a songwriter.
1582701709|3.0|..to those of us who have read and studied \\"Think And Grow Rich\\" by Napoleon Hill and \\"Psycho-Cybernetics\\" by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.    The heavy hitters that Ms Byrne interviews for the audio edition of the book certainly didn't learn the Law Of Attraction from her. They learned it from Maltz, Hill, Stone, Mandino, Clason, The Bible, etc.    In the beginning she cites how this law contributed to the success of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, etc. Along with many others.     She is pretty much giving credit where credit is due right there without entirely tipping her hat. Hill interviewed Edison extensively for \\"Think And Grow Rich\\" and the whole idea for the book \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" was Carnegie's idea given to Hill when he was still a teenager. Hill took 25 years to write \\"Think And Grow Rich\\" after interviweing 500 of the most successful people in America at the beginning of the 20th century. In fact, the subtitle of older editions is even called \\"The Carnegie Secret for Creating Wealth.\\" And it's the same Secret.    I must say the cover even reminds me of \\"The Success System That Never Fails\\" by W. Clement Stone. Stone was an associate and friend of Napoleon Hill and his books are most worthwhile, too.    Nonetheless, if this new-agey, highly glossy, and Oprah-endorsed book helps people learn what other wealthy and successful people have learned, then so be it.     And I hope it opens the door to you reading other books. I would recommend the above listed titles to start reading the moment you finish reading \\"The Secret.\\"
B000002UAX|5.0|A fan favorite and the best stuff they ever did. They put everything they had into this one and the music speaks for itself. It had something for everyone but it is everything for the true fans. The most diverse record ever made. From avant-garde to ragtime to rock to folk to show-tunes etc. etc. etc.
B0002UOK04|5.0|I heard these guys a little bit on youtube. They sounded pretty cool by what I could tell.  <br /> <br />This cd is very good, as it has most that I look for being fast, melodic, and epic. The singer sings normal, death (growling), and even a little narration, which adds diversity. The music itself is relatively fast, and barely lets up, which could get kind of annoying and make you want to switch cd's some times. But, if fast is your thing, you won't be disappointed with Wintersun. They seem to have elements of bands like Death, Rhapsody, and Bal-Sagoth, but with a hint of folk.  <br /> <br />This is one of my more favorite albums at the moment. Just about every song has something in it that you look forward to. Making the album good in it's entirety. If you liked \\"Death\\" these guys are just bigger and also have some regular singing with backup that really makes you feel like you're in some lost wintery temple.
B000002UB3|4.0|At last it was over and they played and sang their hearts out on this one and the music speaks for itself, the last 2 years of the Beatles were hell according to all 4 of them, but they managed to pull off a good closer to end an era. RIP Beatles...
B00006LPER|5.0|Bound to become a classic of world cinema, 'the piano teacher', is Michael Haneke's most perfect film.. It tells the story of a women so repressed and abused by her mother that she explodes with sexual tension..<br /><br />it comes out in her music.. and in a sort of chaotic relationship with one of her students.. at times incestuous and at times perverse this is a truly disturbed women who is as rigid as her own philosophy of music- this is a must see - a modern classic from a powerful new cinematic voice..
B000002OZY|5.0|The rock opera needs no introduction. The 2 disc reissue has many bonus tracks but I only listened to them once, I wanted the original album remastered most of all and they did a superb job on this!
B000009RC2|4.0|while i am not a big fan of john mcLaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i cannot deny that they really had something with this album.. It is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory...  There is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music.
B000002IST|4.0|In some ways, this is the Genesis White Album. It contains 50% killer songs and even a few modern prog classics \\"Last Spike\\" and \\"Fading Lights\\" it also has about 50% filler too but overall it's a good enjoyable record and one of their better efforts in retrospect, a great way to end an era.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|If this is an example of hollywood film-making wow.. I guess i should pack my bags and move to France.. 'covenant' loses on all counts - acting, plot, special effects.. I was so bored if i wasn't seeing it with a friend i would have left the theatre about 10 min into the show. I waited for some redeamable quality but i couldn't find one shread to hang on to - what has become of american cinema?
B000002J1S|5.0|This record is the absolute peak of early Genesis and I always thought Peter was smart to leave while still on top, a very brave thing to do and an artistic move in retrospect. It's pointless to name the highlights here, it's all classic Genesis at the top of their game and being very prog.,  doing what they do best.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Greg Kinnear, steve carrell and Arkin are a gass in this very funny film.. <br />We have seen this dysfunctional family plot a million times - but somehow it is made fresh here.. I think we all have experienced similar family trips to this one.. the gag where they push the van is very good.. A bright spot in an otherwise bleak year for cinema.
B000002NZO|5.0|Wow! What an improvement from the first record. Genesis grow up fast and produce a classic prog masterpiece. Anthony Phillips is a big part of this record and they knew it, they almost broke up after he quit shortly after this record was released.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Master director Spike Lee (who for some reason gets completely ignored by the oscars) is back at it again - this time with a seemless suspense film.<br /><br />Denzel is great as always, and the supporting cast is marvelous.. This is not even close to being one of Spike's best, it is a little too reminiscent of other classic noir thrillers, but it is done with a masterful touch - not to be missed..
B00007LTIA|5.0|My favorite Yes album has only improved over the years. I gotta admit it took me a LONG time to get into this record, ultimately it is the most rewarding Yes album and has a lot to offer. Warning, you won't like this record until after 4 or 5 listens all the way through, that is why it gets torn up in the reviews, it has to \\"grow\\" on you like algae.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This is another excellent CD by Loreena Mckennit. She takes us on a journey into the past, through ancient Turkey and along the Silk Road. Different, exotic, more Middle Eastern than Celtic, but a musical adventure to good to pass up.
B000002J1M|5.0|This album is a big moment for Genesis as a peak for the Gabriel era group as a writing team. Everyone is at the top of their game. The album still sounds fresh after 35 years.
0618680004|5.0|Finally - a voice of sanity.  Unputdownable.  This should be required reading.
B000002J27|5.0|Genesis gets even better here. Phil pulls off a miracle by singing lead even though he and the band were still not sure he could do it on the '75-'76 tour even after the album was finished!  <br />This album is the best album Genesis ever made, even though the band may disagree with that statement.
B00069YE0W|4.0|I love John Frusciante, and he's my favorite member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This album is great, although it has a strong melencholy theme. The best song on here is definitely Past Recedes, and the others are also good. If you love John Frusciante you must buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B000002J1O|4.0|This album is good, but I don't think it's their best effort and I think it's their worst effort with Peter Gabriel. Although Firth of Fifth and Battle of Epping Forest are 2 personal favorites of mine, the album loses steam halfway through side 2.
B00023B1A8|2.0|I was disappointed, The audio quality was poor and the instrumentation sparse. I am a fan of Crosby, Stills and Nash, but this is not one of their better performances.
B000002P6R|5.0|This is Who are you part. 2, more songs about growing old in a youthful world of rock. These are some of Pete's best songs since Who by Numbers. He was drinking heavily but still very prolific, amazing!
B00004HYLF|5.0|This recording was undoubtedly the best fusion recording of it's time, maybe ever. Kudos to Chick Corea for bringing together probably the hottest group of modern jazz players ever and letting them shine. Al Di Meola is my absolute favorite fusion guitar player. Stanley Clarke is baddest bass player on the planet and  Lenny White is the funkiest, grooving, slamming drummer I've ever heard. Not to mention Chick's pure keyboard genius. Each of them contribute compositions to this recording and the personalities comes through loud and clear.
B000002UB6|5.0|I think Spector did a fine job on these tapes. He managed to put out a good album out of miles and miles of tape and he should get credit. Came out AFTER Abbey Road but recorded the year before. The Beatles weren't getting along, but managed to still sound great and write some great classic tunes. The end of an era indeed. Let it Be...
0446677450|4.0|Go to school.  Study hard.  Get a good job. That's great advice for a youngster, right?  Wrong!  Not according to Robert Kiyosaki.  The most important thing to teach a child is financial literacy.  The former is a recipe for remaining poor or middle class and getting caught in the rat race.  The latter is a way to make money work for you and to gain financial freedom.   <br /> <br />Robert dispels many myths about money and gives practical advice on how to think about money.  He does so through stories about his 2 fathers - his biological father, who lacks financial acumen, and his best friend's father who teaches him how to unleash his financial genius.  The key is to exercise self-discipline and buy up assets that generate income, rather than buying up liabilities to keep up with the Joneses. <br /> <br />I would have preferred a little more meat on the making money piece.  Robert does give a couple of high level examples of what he has done to accumulate wealth.  He then encourages the reader to find his/her own way by becoming educated on basic financials and financial systems.  <br /> <br />Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper  <br />
B000002UDB|5.0|Includes the Sgt. Pepper era single Strawberry Fields / Penny Lane. For those 2 songs alone it's highly recommended! More of Paul taking most of the spotlight here, Johns I am the Walrus is his best work since Rubber Soul.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I really appreciate the hopefully great impact that Mr. Gore is making with this movie. The science in the movie is compelling and the world needs to pay attention. I found the personal history of Mr. Gore intertwined with the movie to be a big distraction and not focused enough on the really big story that needs to be told - global warming and the need to respond to these issues by the world. Everyone should see this movie, then make their global contributions locally - Conserve energy, reduce emissions, vote for energy alternatives.
B00007LTIB|5.0|The Yes album that drips of Jazz fusion is a fan favorite. Patrick Moraz does a great job following Wakeman, not an easy task. \\"Gates\\" is a Jon Anderson epic. To be Over sounds like \\"Topographic Oceans Part 2\\" and thats a high compliment.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth just keeps getting better and better.  When I heard that Steve Wilson was not the producer of this album I was a little worried.  He had added something special to the band's style and I was concerned that it would be lost.  But my fears were unfounded: This is Opeth's best album yet.<br /><br />The addition of a keyboard player and the style in which he plays was a perfect complement to Opeth's sound.  The album is just a heavy as previous albums but more musical.  If you find that hard to get your wits around then just buy the album and you'll hear what I mean.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what they have in store for us on their next album.<br /><br />My Review? The short version \\"Rocks!\\".  The long version: \\"It Rocks!\\"
B000002UAF|5.0|Johns songs here are getting darker and the band wrote an unprecedented 14 songs for this strong third album. Paul also shows his darker side on Things we said today.
B00005JOCS|5.0|Okay, everyone talked about the storyline, which is awesome.  What made me decide to actually see this movie at the spur of the moment was the knowtion of seeing Eddie Murphy play a dramatic role.  I had heard so much about his performance in the movie, which does deserve Oscar attention.  I also heard about Jennifer Hudson's performance as well and had already downloaded her spine-chilling version of \\"And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)\\".  She practically made that song her's.   <br /> <br />I was thoroughly impressed with all aspects of this film.  Some people have actually complained about the film's length.  To me, the film's length was a necessary asset to the story.  Also, the acting was top-notch.  It's been a long time since I've seen a musical that not only shines in the music but, also shine in the acting as well. <br /> <br />I recommend everyone to see this film.  I will definitely see it again before it goes to DVD.  I'll probably end up seeing it again today, truth be told.
B000002OX5|5.0|A great concept album and Pete is back with a plethora of good songs, many are among his best. The bonus tracks are superb here also. A real treat for the fans. Casual fans should stay away and get Who's Next instead.
0895260131|5.0|I read this book here in Brazil.In just two days, I read this book. <br />This book is an excellent introduction, about this subject.Dozens of left-wings frauds, about islam, are exposed as bogus. <br />You could see that when you see the reviews, about this abook, almost all of them are 5 stars, and a little of them are one star. <br />I must tell you that anybody who gave 1 star, showed a single fraud on this book.The are simple buffoons, lying.Don't believe in american mullah's friends. <br />Everything in this book is correct. <br />This book is nothing more than an introduction, about this subject. <br />If you want to read with more deep, there's better options.The book itself gaves you sugestions, in avery chapter. <br />Even so, if you want to read and introduction, 100% correct, about this subject, this book must be read.
B0007SMD3W|4.0|This is real good stuff considering they were only 17, 18 years old and right out of prep school. If you like early Bee Gee's (Odessa) you'll like this.
B000BNI95Y|5.0|I've had this album for only a few days, have listened to it end to end maybe three times.. and all I can say, is that it's completely freakin' brilliant. Gypsy alternative folk rock, gently patinated with punk & flamenco.  Singer-songwriter dance-pop.  Simply sublime.<br /><br />Dug up some bio info that'll I share (save you the google): Bebe- aka Nieves Rebolledo Vila - was born in Valencia Spain in 1978.  Her parents are members of the Extremaduran folk group Surberina. So she grew up surrounded by music & musicians, and got into the music scene in Madrid as a teen.  This is her first big album, though, and it's made her a star in the Latin music scene.  She was nominated for five Latin Emmies for this, and the aforemention Malo was a huge international hit single.<br /><br />She sounds a lot like Natalia LaFourcade (but with rather better pop hooks,) with Julieta Venegas' hipness.. Her lyrics and themes can be edgy and political.  'Malo,' her big hit (though not, by my lights, the best song on this album) is a bit of a bruiser.<br /><br />And as for those titillating forbidden lyrics, they're all en Espanol folks, in keeping with the themes rather than gratuitous (at least to my sensiblities.)  Put it this way: this isn't Too Live Kru or Muttly Crew or anything untarded & paleoanderthal like that.  If you can handle, say, Alanis Morissette, this material won't annoy you.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />But no mind.. this girl is class, she's tart & smart, a tad saucy bout the edges.<br /><br />Summation: Lo Quiero Mucho.  Dig it lots, and this is just the beginning.  This is in the near vicinity of Simon & Garfunkel or James Taylor good.  (In all seriousness, she's in that good: classic, catchy pop; interesting themes; musically thematically complex & varied, with good lyrics..) It will probably take at least a decade and a half of constant pummeling before I get sick of it.  I look forward to the mauling.<br /><br />Buy it.  Pronto.  Cinquo estrellas +++.
B000002J1L|4.0|This album is great, contains stellar Songs like Musical Box, Return of the Giant Hogweed, Seven Stones, Fountain of Salmacis.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|The theme revisited throughout this film is that conventional male-female relationships are somehow \\"wrong\\" or leave females \\"taken advantage of.\\"    Joan throws away the possibility of Yale for marriage and family with a guy who seems nice but more than a little clueless about his wife who does his homework for him.   <br /> <br />Betty and Gisele argue early in the film about Gisele's promiscuity.  Gisele promptly disses Betty about her fiance's lack of ardor for her.  Betty's cold response \\"Spencer is a gentleman\\" is countered by Gisele's witty \\"And even gentlemen have (slang term for genitalia).\\"  Later, Gisele's take on the subject is proved true as Spencer neglects his young wife for an adulterous relationship.  What an underlying message for a PG-13 chick flick!  If you're a nice girl and don't engage in sex with your fiance, then your fiance must not really want you and is probably cheating on you.     <br /> <br />Gisele herself is no better off as the good-time-girl, setting her sights upon flings with married older men, including a school instructor.  When she is not doing this she is cozying up in over the top touchie-feelie sessions with her college buddies that might pass for innocent childish exuberance were she not portrayed as such a worldly woman. <br /> <br />Three different women in the film are either abbandoned by boyfriends or divorced by their husbands during separations induced by World War II.  Honestly!  Did no woman ever divorce a husband or move on to a new boyfriend when her old steady shipped out for a tour of duty?  <br /> <br />The one relationship that seems to have possibilities is Connie's blossoming romance with a loveable nerdy type and even that relationship is affected by Connie's insecurity and doubts of his sincere interest in her.  It seems every female in the film is either involved is a dysfunctional relationship, humoring a mediocre relationship, or sabotaging a positive relationship. <br /> <br />Is this what Hollywoodhas been reduced to writing and producing for entertainment purposes?  While I don't expect to see four young women and their instructor find true love and marry right out of college it would have been nice to see SOME positive notes towards the growth and development of the various characters.
B000002UAC|5.0|John and Paul are writing better songs and the band sounds tighter on this one and less nervous.
0553804367|5.0|I have the utmost respect for Mr Hawking's theory's and his ability to question his own theory's, this book was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in time and stuff. <br />  Time for instance it was years ago that I was taught how to use firearms by my father and Grandfather. They were both very strict and would often yell obscenities when I would aim the gun towards any where but the ground away from them. My Grandfather was a wildlife protector (game warden) back in the early thirties at Lake Mattamuskeet in North Carolina. Game wardens were not well received back then, they being a new branch of government control and what right did they have to make them buy a license to hunt for waterfowl? LakeMattamuskeet to this day is a very remote and rural area, so new ideas are not snapped up like in New York or Kokomo. As I was saying whenever I was holding a rifle, my grandfather would chastise me regularly, he had been shot by accident in his life so he took firearms seriously, people are careless he was careless so he bore a scare on his leg and shoulder from mistakes. He instilled in me a deep respect that makes me a nervous wreck when I am around people who have a firearm and handle it with little caution. This reminds me of the old saying ... You can give and infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of firearms and eventually one of them will  not shoot himself or colleague. <br />   Well I have a few problems with this theory.... <br />1. Who counts the monkeys to make sure they are infinite in numbers. <br />2. Where does on keep an infinite number of monkeys with firearms. Earth would pile up with them pretty fast, the final frontier would have to be utilized. Space suits would be required and modified firearms that would fire in a vacuum not to mention without the benefit of oxygen to ignite the gunpowder. <br />3.You would need and infinite number of banana trees to feed the monkeys, which would require an infinite amount of arableland and workers to cultivate and ship to the monkeys their dietary needs. <br />4. Where are the monkeys to throw their scat, a really advanced sanitary system would be needed to deal with all the monkey pitching. <br />5.So we need an infinite number of space suits, referees to document whether a monkey is injured, an infinite number of rifles for the monkeys and lanyards so they would not loose them in space while they slept. <br />6. There would need to be an infinite number of begetting monkeys to produce the infinite number of monkeys.. <br />7. I have nearly an infinite number of question regarding this theory, but do not have the time or space... <br />   In conclusion I still respect Mr Hawkings theory's , but I do wonder if he has avoided the Spiraling Monkey Theory in Infinite Space. These are questions that need to be asked, which I just did so now these are questions I would like to be answered.
B00007KWHP|4.0|This is the album that contains Roundabout, Long Distance Runaround, South Side Of the Sky and Heart of the Sunrise and you can't argue that those songs alone make it a classic. The rest of the album is padded out with \\"solo\\" songs from the group due to lack of group material at the time of release. The new CD is a huge improvement on the original, especially on Rick's Cans and Brahams that was previously distorted.
0452286379|3.0|Conformity vs. Nonconformity plays a paramount role in Rand's novel, with Howard Roark, a man who does not want to \\"sell out\\" his ideals to be the next best thing in architecture. The basic premise illustrated within Rand's work is the question and morality of how important it is to stand alone in the crowd despite what others think, to \\"stick to your guns\\" and avoid non-conformity in a society that shuns that concept.  <br /> <br />Architecture is the vehicle and player for the characters within the novel, but it seemingly is only used to project the major theme of Rand's ultimate philosophy--objectivism. In Rand's own words in the book's afterward, she describes the essence of objectivism as being \\"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" Perhaps her philosophy is a bit outdated in certain respects and controversial in others, but she is able to depict an overall story of good guy versus villain in the architecture world.  <br /> <br />Roark is probably the closest thing to being a poster child for Rand's objectivism, yet the book's many heroes and villains, and the issues they stand for, give the novel its utmost substance. There is Peter Keating, who is shallow, jealous, and fueled by status and fame oriented goals, and has a deep hatred for Roark even though they went to school together and even though Roark bails him out twice in the novel. Keating and Roark are the epitomes of opposite because of what they come to symbolize. Roark has an inner willpower which allows him to be untouched by others despite the monetary and material rewards that may come--he would rather be the \\"starving artist\\" of the architecture world doing what he was meant to do then compromising; Keating, on the other hand, needs acceptance from peers, a feeling of importance, and the feeling that he is significantly better than others. Another of themain cast, Ellsworth Toohey, the novel's main antagonist, despises everything Roark stands for; he wants to eradicate any notion of individual achievement and expression in a world he believes is collective. Dominique Francon, who seems to straddle both sides of the good and bad fence, is a distinct force in the novel because she finally meets her match in Roark, who does not allow her beauty or power to control him. Finally, Gail Wynand is a character who is somewhat transformed by Roark because he is able to see the integrity of not only what Roark builds, but his character as well.  <br /> <br />This book can at certain points become a tad long-winded in dialogue and plot, but Rand makes up for this in certain respects with unique characters and a strong finish. Certainly the ideals expressed from the point of view of characters are Rand's own, but she is able to create a unique (and imperfect) character in Roark, making the journey to the end much more enjoyable. While this book is probably not for those seeking a \\"page turner\\", this is a book that is quite original when read with an open mind.  <br /> <br />3 ½ stars
B000002J2B|4.0|This followup to Trick of the Tail sounds like that album and you won't be dissapointed if you like Trick. Steve Hackett claims he tried to get \\"Please Don't Touch\\" and \\"Inside and Out\\" on this record but was often the victim to the bands overruling.  <br />In retrospect his \\"Please Don't Touch\\" and \\"Inside and Out\\" would of been better than the songs they chose instead \\"Wot Gorilla\\" and \\"All in a Mouses Night\\" <br />and would of made it a 5 star record and maybe then he would of stayed with the group?
B000F48CD8|5.0|I discovered the Raconteurs when I saw them open for Bob Dylan.  I really don't listen to a lot of new music - it seems too test-marketed - but this whole album seems genuine and, more importantly, it F'n rocks!  It's hard to place exactly but this band feels like they were plucked out of the 1967-1972 era, put into a modern recording studio with a modern producer and this album is the result.  Nothing seems worn-out, tired or cliche about it but it definitely feels like it's from that era.  The most surprising influence I noticed was Deep Purple since they're considered a ponderous dinosaur these days yet this band presents plenty of Purple-ish elements (mostly overdriven Hammond B3 sounds) here with fresh vitality.  I also picked up on some Led Zepplin-style use of a Leslie effect and a hint of early Pink Floyd.  I was most shocked to hear not only a tasty, melodic lead guitar solo but a tasty, melodic DOUBLE-LEAD!  Anyone remember Boston?  I really still can't call them \\"retro.\\"  It's more like they've picked up where hard rock left off when it got derailed by disco, punk and a preoccupation with ultra-virtuosity in the mid-'70s and taken the first step in a long time to push it forward in a good direction.<br /><br />I also like their sense of humor.  They're a little light in the lyric department (I've got a rabbit it likes to hop/I've got a girl and she likes to shop/The other foot looks like it won't drop/I had an uncle but he got shot) yet their name implies they're storytellers.  Hmmmmm....<br /><br />If you wish there was more classic rock to discover, try this album out.  It's fresh and new now in exactly the same way that stuff was 35-40 years ago.  Very tasty stuff.
B000002J1Y|4.0|All the Best songs at the time for Yes live in 1973. Performances are high with energy and in some cases like \\"Close to The Edge\\" and \\"Perpetual Change w/ Bill's drum solo\\" they are better than the studio versions. I would have liked to hear more of the \\"then\\" recently departed for King Crimson Bill Bruford, he only is on 2 songs here, the rest is the new drummer at the time Alan White.
B000J103N4|4.0|The price of the cd alone is $10.99 and if you get the DVD Audio you pay $22.88.  When it says an audio DVD it means it as there is not a whit of video on the DVD.  If you have an outstanding audio system it may be worth the extra bang in bucks to you other wise just stick to the cd.  Awesome music either way.  The new book on the Cros is worth the money as well.  Since Then. <br /> <br />G Walter
B00007KWI9|4.0|<br />The \\"first\\" Yes album is full of some strong harmony vocals and some great rock/jazz organ and guitar from Tony Kaye and Peter Banks respectively. <br />Overall this is a strong debut and was mainly made up of the songs from their live act at the time. Early strengths are Beyond and Before, Harold Land, Survival, and the majestic Something's Coming. Also I See You features an unaccompanied Jazzy guitar solo from underrated Peter Banks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
078324228X|5.0|There is no denying that this is a great movie. From the acting, to the way the plot plays out, and of course the ending, which does a great job of describing the aftermath of the film's characters. Denzel Washington gets a ten out of ten for his performance. I find it interesting that many people question the validity of this film, but in my opinion why would a successful prize-fighter want to murder anyone, let alone commit a crime when he clearly had something to lose (not to mention he had already been in jail so why would he do ANYTHING to risk going back). It makes sense that the prosecution was corrupt, and that many people became successful from putting Mr. Carter in jail. Overall, the film gave me hope that with all the horrible things going on in the world, there still can be justice. Thanks to \\"the Hurricane\\" I am planning to read his book. This film is a must see!!!!
B000002UAI|5.0|The Beatles are at their best here singing about darkness, Babys in Black, No Reply, I'm a Loser, I don't want to Spoil The Party, What you're Doing (I'm in Ruin)  and all the Beatlemaniacs didn't even notice. <br />That's genious.
B000002J2F|4.0|The trio get even better at writing short songs here and they even get into the hit parade. I never understood why the Genesis purists would hate them for that. Whats the problem, they are good songwriters and they got lucky and made a little money. In exchange for the fans they lost,  they gained even more fans, change is good. If the purists didn't notice, this is a semi-concept album and Dukes travels is one of the most progressive things they've ever done.
0618680004|5.0|Dwarkins main criticism of religion seems to be an aesthetic one. He tells the stories of a number of people who brought up as Catholics were tormented by the irrationality of the notion of hell either for themselves or others. He sees religion as a form of child abuse which seeks to close the mine of children and to stop them being thinkers. Linked to this is that religion is trying to make a come back to public life. In the east some followers of Islam have been trying to set up theocratic states. In Afghanistan under the Taliban the death penalty was instituted for homosexuals and art works of great antiquity were destroyed for religious reasons. In America the most religious of the western democracies a powerful religious block has been trying to re-stigmatize homosexuality, ban abortion and peddle the anti rational doctrine of creationism.  <br /> <br />Most of the works either arguing for atheism or against religious belief come from philosophers. One prominent atheist is for instance Michael Martin who has written what are rather technical works suggesting that religious thought is irrational. Dwarkins is a scientist by trade and his book is more approachable than those of the philosophical tradition. Like most of these works it will probably read not by the target audience but by those who are skeptics or unbelievers. When they read the book it will give them comfort and bolster their self confidence but one does not imagine it converting many of the believers.  <br /> <br />The book covers a number of issues but broadly these are: <br /> <br />1. Is a belief in God rational? <br />2. Why do people believe in God? <br />3. Is morality possible without God? <br />4. What is wrong with believing in God? <br /> <br />In the middle ages Christian philosophers came up with a number of proofs of God's existence based on deductive reasoning. These \\" proofs\\" were pretty much sidelined when philosophy was over time shown to be a valueless enterprise. The developmentof inductive reasoning produced advances in human knowledge which actually were useful. Medicine nowdays can help people. The medicine developed by Galen based on deductive reasoning was either ineffectual or helped kill people. The ancient and medieval theories of the universe of the nature of combustion and matter were all simply wrong. In the same way the old proofs of God are in the words of Karl Popper empty essentialism. Dwarkins actually tried to argue that the old proofs are wrong according to their own logic. This is not bad but one wonders why bother. He then tries to argue that the notion of God is illogical because it is basically an attempt to explain things for which there is a better explanation. If we look at things we have an explanation for the existence of plants and animals. It is evolution and evolution is backed up by evidence. The suggestion that a powerful being did it all is more likely to be a man made myth than a logical presumption. Later in the book Dwarkins also argues more strongly that the basis of religion is a dualist notion of identity. That is that what we are is not a body but a soul which operates a body. The soul lives and the body dies. However it is simply more logical to think that our identity is brought about by our body and there is no soul. If this is the case there is no afterlife and no God. <br /> <br />Being an evolutionist Dwarkins is worried about the belief in God. Evolutionists are of the view that societies are in competition and that useless things should count against you. He thus goes on a bit about why people believe in religion. He comes up with the answer that one of the skills of humans is the ability for us to learn skills so that we can deal with situations using learned knowledge. Our parents thus teach us things like don't touch hot stoves, don't jump into lion's cages and the like. We tent do accept these sorts of things and they become internalized. Dwarkins suggests that whilst we internalize thesethings we can also pick up useless bits of knowledge like sacrifice some goats every spring or it won't rain.  <br /> <br />Dwarkins is on stronger ground when he argues about religion and morality. Modern religion is not that old. Christianity is about 2,000 years old Buddism a bit older , Islam rather younger with Hinduism being the oldest. Prior to the development of these religions belief systems about gods were not tied up with morals. Yet it is clear that morality existed thus is pre-dates religious systems. Dwarkins goes on to argue that the actual morality that is practiced in societies is at variance with scriptural teachings and gives some good examples.  <br />In talking about what is wrong with believing in God he talks about the effect on children and runs his child abuse argument while at the same time talking about what may would see as the excesses of religion. The people who kill abortion doctors, the Taliban and Catholic teaching orders who were cruel to the children they taught.  <br /> <br />Overall the book starts a bit slow but it is more readable than the usual books produced by the philosophy school.  <br />
B000002P2W|5.0|Pete was a mess, the Who were a mess. This album works though, it reads like Pete's autobiography in 1975 \\"However much I booze, their ain't no way out\\" He would put out a solo album in 1980 called Empty Glass and it seems like these songs are the embryo of that album.
B000784WMW|3.0|I'm sorry, but being accurate to the book does not a great film make.  <br /> <br />And the production company is to be seen everywhere! The difference in exteriors shot on film and interiors shot on video is glaring! The interiors are lit like stage sets and look like stage sets [nicely designed however]. There is zero ambient noise on the sets too, which immediately let's us know we're on a sound stage. The costumes [also well designed] are hot off the sewing machines and look like they're being worn for the 1st time. They are very accurate, but don't look like clothes. <br />We might as well see the boom above the actor's heads and grips in the background! No doubt budget and time played a great role in this failure to make it believable. <br /> <br />Give me Granada Television over this any day! In their productions like \\"Prime Suspect\\" or \\"Jewel in the Crown\\" or \\"Traffik\\" you really are like a fly on the wall watching actual events happen. In reality they too are lit, and on sets and wearing costumes, but done right for film and made to look real. It's an art unto itself. Hats off the those often forgotten art directors and the artisans, the set dressers, costume makers and DPs who can keep us believing in what we see!

1572815108|5.0|I like this one over the larger version as the cards are easier for me to handle, plus the quality of the card art is more vibrant.  This is one of four tarot decks that I own, and one that I have found is best used on a more intuitive level.  This is a deck that not many people will be able to use unless they read Aleister Crowley's \\"Book of Thoth\\" first...for me it is best to get the facts straight from the man himself than have someone else explain it.  This is a deck that I reserve for those certain times where my regular deck just won't cut it.  It helps me look within myself through the artwork, and I am always surprised at what I find.

B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies (mine and my husband's).  The end is a little confusing the first time you see it, but the movie is excellent.  In 2004, I watched it three times in one weekend while writing a paper for a Lit class, and still loved it on Monday.  The deadpan delivery of Kevin Spacey is perfection.  When he catches his wife cheating and says \\"...you don't get to tell me what to do--ever again.\\"  He could not have said it better.   <br />Kevin Spacey portrays perfectly the average suburban man who is BORED with his life and is at the point at which he doesn't care who knows it. <br />See this movie!

B00003OO3O|5.0|UFO had reinvented themselves on their third studio album 'Phenomenon' but they were not quite a great band yet. What they needed to do was to utterly lay to waste their dopey space rock origins and dive bomb into the early metal years. On 'Force It', released in June 1975, the band created the first of their many stellar hard rock albums. With Michael Schenker fighting a language barrier that isolated him from his English bandmates you would think that album #2 would slip in quality but in fact 'Force It' leaves it in the dust. The songs are amazing and the classics are true classics, just as \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" and \\"Rock Bottom\\" are. The record kicks off with \\"Let It Roll\\", an absolute loud and obnoxious monster which begins with Michael's trademark sustained tone and launched into riffs galore!. \\"Shoot Shoot\\" is probably my alltime favorite UFO song, good boy meets bad woman and pays the price, the song is a masterful, commercial hard rock song! Even the ballads are outstanding including \\"Out in the Street\\" which includes another amazing lead break from Mr. Schenker plus a great emotional vocal from Phil Mogg. The lyrical quality of many of these songs is also a huge step above what the band had accomplished thus far. \\"Love Lost Love\\" is much is the same vein as \\"Shoot\\" with great guitar melody and chorus, \\"Mother Mary\\" (a riff monster in the tradition of Sabbath) and \\"This Kid's\\", the album closer and set favorite (like about half the songs here) are intense with their crunch and strut. Quiet times \\"High Flyer\\" and \\"Between the Walls\\" take nothing away from the sonic brilliance of this amazing record. Easily my favorite UFO disc and probably the most unsung great album in the history of seventies heavy metal. By the way, love how the remastered version put a t-shirt on the girl, my version has the faded picture where she is obviously nude. All in good taste and fun!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Truly fascinating, we have moved from a stage of science fiction to science fact about global warming. Al-Gore needs all the accolades in his effort to bring this stark reality in to common man's living rooms and I guess this is his true calling. Well done and great job.I remember a movie that I watched in the 70's about organ trade, a movie called Solvent Green, those days it seemed like pure fiction, today it is a common occurrence . In the same sense what maybe was fiction (according to the knowledgeable scientists) even a couple of years is now staring at us in the face.Unlike the movie, here the entire mankind is face to face with this reality! <br /> <br />Balakrishna Jayasimha <br />Bangalore <br />India
B000DZIGDU|3.0|From my time in the Navy, I always knew Marines were crazy characters.  This movie validates that!  There's nothing like macho and usually morbid Marine Corps humor to get me laughing, and this film offers a great deal of that!<br /><br />This is what I could call a somewhat unconventional war movie.  Most of the film is centered around Operation Desert Shield.  Instead of most war movies where we see charcters trying to accomplish a particular objective(s) while encased in the fog of war, this movie approaches war from a different angle.  It's mostly about the anticipation of fighting was Saddam Insane called the \\"Mother of all battles\\" (a battle which, of course, never did materialize).<br /><br />Instead of dodging bombs & bullets, the Marines have to deal with 6 months of tedious drills, getting Dear John letters, worrying about getting Dear John letters, having their nerves frayed by living in close-quarters with others, coping with the harsh desert environment and having to overcome the sheer boredom of it all.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of depicting just how mundane it can be to be a soldier on the supposed \\"front lines\\" in this day & age.  The Marine Snipers in the movie were among the first to land in Saudi Arabia, and yet they only get to flirt with actual combat duties.  There is certainly an irony in that.<br /><br />Jamie Fox portrays one of those gung-ho Marine Staff Sergeants who it's easy to poke fun at.  While I was in the Navy there was a running joke that 20 years of sea duty turned men's minds to mush. Sailors start to actually worship the Navy after all of that time deployed, and the military becomes a sort of obession.  Looks like the same sort of thing happens in the other services as well!<br /><br />If you want a \\"traditional\\" war movie, this one may not be for you.  One of the scenes, just before the Marines were deployed, showed them watching APOCOLYPSE NOW in a theatre.  I believe that scene was put in to show the contrast between a \\"dramatic\\" war movie & what the real-life ordeal of a soldier would be like in Desert Storm.<br /><br /> If you're a fan of military movies in general or if you have been in the military, I believe you'll find this movie to your liking.  It's not a great movie, but it is a curious one.the contrast between a \\"dramatic\\" war movie & what the real-life ordeal of a soldier would be like in Desert Storm.   <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of military movies in general or if you have been in the military, I believe you'll find this movie to your liking.

1853751960|5.0|When I first read this book many years ago, I was working briefly in advertising and had had it recommended to me by my boss.  I thought I'd be bored out of my skull, but in fact, I found it fascinating and extremely useful.  Although my advertising job was short-lived, I have found myself remembering and regularly using things I learned from David Ogilvy.   <br /> <br />Two of his best pieces of advice concern the look of a typeface.  He makes the point that white type should be used sparingly, if ever, as the human brain has evolved to better understand dark symbols on a light background.  Not just for tradition's sake is this the case--our brains are wired this way!  Similarly, he points out that sans-serif fonts (those fonts like Helvetica or Arial, which don't have the little finishing touches called serifs at the end of each line of a letter) are much better suited to large text areas, like headlines, than they are to the main body of text.  That's because--once again, evolution steps in--our eyes are more able to visually \\"grab\\" the text when the serifs give us a kind of visual traction.   <br /> <br />There's a lot of fascinating stuff in here, and the best part is that it's useful by anyone wishing to make themselves clear and understood--not just those folks who actually work in advertising.
0684135051|4.0|This is not a \\"learn to knit\\" book at all.  I would encourage anyone considering the book to make sure you can at least make something that requires some shaping (increases, decreases and all that) before picking it up.<br /><br />But *after* that?<br /><br />Get it! Get it! Getit!<br /><br />If nothing else, it's a funny read.  When discussing how to make steeks (she doesn't use the term, but it is a technique in which you make a sweater in the round and then *cut* your precious knitting to sew in the sleeves), she advises, \\"Cut on the basting, then lie down in a darkened room for fifteen minutes to recover.\\"  The book is loaded with little comments like that.<br /><br />Mrs. Zimmerman saw knitting as an art and a creative process and did not feel that being creative was a trait reserved for the elite.  She constantly encourages one to \\"cheat\\" to fix problems, or find solutions to make the garment work.<br /><br />I share Mrs. Zimmerman's dislike of seaming sweaters, so the techniques she has taught for knitting them in the round make me very happy, indeed!
B0000399WI|5.0|Time flies. I always forget this is a movie first released on 1994. Nevertheless, I can clearly remember that everytime I am down or depressed or persecuted, this movie would come out of nowhere (normally  on TV, of course) and lift me up for a while, giving me some shots of patience, courage, resilience, perservance and so on. Many parts of it are real dark and sad. Yet, the ending still offers hope. Great performance by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Incredible story and screenplay by Stephen King (yes, \\"that\\" Stephen King). Definitely one of the ten best movies of all time, IMHO. Dont miss it!<br /><br />p.s. The most memorable script to me: Either you get busy living, or you get busy dying.
B000HOJDBQ|5.0|I have heard three tracks from the fourth coming album \\"United Abominations\\" do out very soon in early 2007. \\"Gears of War\\", \\"Sleepwalker\\" and \\"Washington is Next\\", and both are very reminiscent of the Rust in Peace years of sound, so old time megadeth fans, and a new batch of rattleheads, get ready, brace yourselves, this is going to be an excellent album.  Dave and his crew are staying true to what they know best, thrashing metal fun!!!  Update:  This album is out now, and I was not wrong.  Megadeth is in full swing again. With the crispness of Rust in Piece, the Grittyness of Peace Sells, United Abominations rips through it's twelve tracks with no appologies.  The Drover brothers and Lomenzo play together like they have been in this band like the past 20 years.  This is a great introduction for new Megadeth fans to jump aboard, and a must have at all cost for all megadeth fans.  Blistering tracks like Washington is Next and Play For Blood are classic thrash, Gears of War a great single, and the Title Track is full blown Peace sells, let the politicians know what dave thinks.  A tout le monde is a nice re-do of an old classic, but a song like \\"Black Rain\\" could have been placed here, and this a bonus track.  That is my only small quirp. Other tracks like Amerikhatan, very funny and dripping with sarcasm and scinicism, and Burn Ice another great song about the hazards of drugs. Sleepwalker was a great track to open with, nice guitar work. This album should easily be everyone's top metal pick of the year, baring a reunion of pantera with all of it's original members...(that's how good this is). Get This Album!!!  Update 10-26-2011:  Recently I stumbled across a \\"tour editon\\" of this album that had three bonus tracks.  Those tracks are \\"Out On Tile\\" a Led Zepplin cover that was on the Japanese pressing which I have, Black Swan (which will be featured on the upcoming album TH1RT3EN re-recorded, and apparently was a pre-order bonus song from best buy or somewhere whenthis album came out) and the elusive track \\"The Bodies Left Behind\\" that I have not found anywhere else.  For collectors, go digging, find this version, it's worth it.
B00005JOCS|5.0|Ya me urge que pongan a la venta el DVD y la musica de DREAMGIRLS.Con poco temor de ser juzgado como cursi les diré que me provocó un par de accesos de llanto -bueno, tal vez 3-, que me emocionó vivamente y sali absolutamente fascinado. Creo que Bill Condon el escritor y director de Kinsey y que entre otros trabajos suyos (nada menos) está el guión de Chicago, la película, se anotó un gran logro y junto con el extraordinario equipo que liderea supo honrar la memoria de Michael Bennett el creador de este musical. La película está basada en el musical de Broadway del mismo nombre y éste a su vez INSPIRADO en la vida de las Supremes y Diana Ross, y recalco el INSPIRADO porque a la mejor manera broadwayana maquilla la <br />trágica realidad de este grupo para darnos el consabido GRAN FINAL de <br />este tipo de obras y si bien esta película no es tan espectacular y <br />deli-darketa como Chicago, si contiene una gran dosis de emotividad y <br />los codiaciados méritos de una gran realización: Una partitura <br />envidiable, voces dignas de ser encapsuladas en un frasquito mágico <br />para escucharlas de por vida y un equipo creativo en TODAS LAS ÁREAS <br />de primerísimo nivel. Y como no todo es miel sobre hojuelas, ni se me <br />da el aplauso incondicional, sólo tengo un amargo reproche para el <br />número musical \\"And I'm telling you I'm not going\\" interpretado por <br />Jennifer Hudson (Effie White) y es que resulta que todo el glamour de la <br />película se va al traste al enfocar las rodillas percudidas de la <br />excepcional cantante y los encuadres de esta mujer durante esta <br />secuencia los realizó su peor enemigo (ya lo verán si asisten a <br />verla) y esta ruptura estética no es lo más grave: El director de <br />escena la dejó volcar la Lupita D'Alessio interior que Jennifer <br />alberga y ésta se puso a señalar hombres imaginarios como si <br />hubiera perdido la brújula... Esta dotada cantante \\"perdió las <br />cabras\\" y el número en vez de conmover inspira lástima por el <br />exceso de temperamento... Bueno, ya no los aburro y los invito a ver la <br />cinta y disfrutar de Beyoncé Knowles quien está exquisita en su <br />MUY MEJORADA versión de Diana Ross.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This was a better than average, pleasent surprise when I saw it in theaters, and was descent when I saw it again.  Aston Kutcher plays a kid who has had several bumps in the road over the years, but discovers a special \\"gift\\" while studying late at night.  He findsa that he is able to travel back to times of high emotions in his life where he can have a chance to alter the course that his life takes.  Soon he discovers there is more behind this gift that what he could ever imagine.    This is a reasonable film that was just fun to watch, and the dvd has a lot of extras, including an alternate ending that I am very glad the hollywood producers did not make the original ending.  Check this out, chances are you will be surprised too.
B00005JPEG|5.0|Everyone has a movie or two that captures the imagination and transports them away from the everyday and to a place of pure magic. \\"Miss Potter\\" is a near perfect film. When the showing finished on a recent Friday evening screening in Dallas, no one moved from their seats. Yes, the audience was an older, experienced group of folks, but I was moved by how many people apparently felt just as I did -- \\"This is what movies should be like!\\" <br /> <br />See it, and you too will likely be spreading the word with an almost missionary zeal. I haven't enjoyed a film this much in 20 years!
B00001OH7M|3.0|This is David Bowie's first \\"rock\\" album, and his second album overall.  That first album cast him as a Bob Dylan wannabe, and the less said about it, the better.  Recorded several years before the title track became a hit in the U.S., Space Oddity marks the emergence of a different beast, a slippery rock & roll chameleon.  Aside from the alien resonance of \\"Space Oddity\\", the album flounders amid indistinct writing and playing.  The album does have it's moments, especially on \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\", \\"Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud\\" and \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\"; but Bowie is still trying too hard to emulate Dylan, rather then developing his own style.  A decent album, but better things came later from Bowie.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Everyone keeps saying how this is their best album ever, but I have to disagree. <br /> <br />Now, don't get me wrong, because I am a HUGE MCR fan, and this CD does have some great tracks-\\"Dead\\" is my favorite, + \\"Teenagers\\", \\"The Sharpest Lives\\", and of course-\\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\". <br /> <br />But, it just dosn't have the same overall appeal as their first two. With Bullets and 3 Cheers I can listen to the whole thing, but The Black Parade has a lot of mediocre tracks I just skip through. <br /> <br />I have to congradulate MCR for trying a new sound though, and not just doing what made them money. But I just love their old sound, and their songs of death and vampires, and it's no coincidence my favorite songs on TBP are the most similar to that. <br /> <br />All that being said, this album DOES have a GREAT concept. The Patient, Mother War, The Black Parade, and the band's new black band uniforms almost make up for the mediocre songs. I wouldn't call this an overall great album, but I would definately recomend buying it (and get 3 Cheers while you're at it!).
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I was a little apprehensive that the movie would be in a raw edited state, but I was thoroughly satisfied after watching the movie.  The makers did a fine job of editing and the movie flows very well.  They obviously must have been well into the production when the director was replaced.  A must have for any fan of Superman.

0142000671|4.0|Steinbeck was a celebrated american author and nobel laureate. This tale is short but provocative ideally suited for a light read before bedtime. <br /> <br />The author's style is simple, in the spirit of Hemingway, and narrative like Faulkner. Interwoven in the story are themes of isolation, racism and euthanasia told in the relations between two drifters, George and the mentally challenged Lennie, looking for farm work. <br /> <br />The story is captivating and tragic with an uncanny realism allowing the reader to identify with the characters and their emotional state.
B000063DGC|5.0|The songs on here, especially Crazy Train, sound a lot better to me than on the studio albums. The audience is going nuts, and the guitars sound more raw and into it, which makes it that much better. If you haven't heard Crazy Train on this album, you haven't heard it. Ozzy even made a music video from this recording. All the songs sound good here, but others that stand out are Iron Man, and Steal Away The Night. You get a heck of a lot of good music for less than $20. This is the PERFECT album if you have someone that you are trying to ease into liking heavy metal. It was my first real metal album, and my brother's, too. Highly recommended.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I saw this film for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006.  It seems to have a weird start for a comedy but give it a minuet and you will be laughing.  Great & funny human interest story and what a great ending!  Highly recommend this film.
B000002H33|5.0|If you want to get into heavy metal, this is a very good starting point. All the songs are good, but I particularly like Leper Messiah, and The Thing That Should Not Be. There's nothing trendy or wussy here, just fierce, powerful, monster metal. Not for a sensitive metrosexual liberal thinking of moving to France.

0307275639|1.0|This book is a sorry affair. Mitch Albom found a gold mine: one of his (many, and certainly forgotten) college professors, who by all means was a sweet, nice guy (and probably a good or great teacher too) is dying a slow, painful death. Albom gets back in touch with Morrie, the professor, and feels (I am willing to concede) true compassion. Then he holds weekly conversations with the dying man, so that later he can share with the rest of the world Morrie's wisdom. Morrie gives, on a weekly basis, lessons on \\"life.\\"<br /><br />You can't go wrong with such a story, given that so many of us are eager to find ultimate truths, and invest our lives with purpose and meaning. Most of us can feel relieved to see that this dying man, in all his unquestionable wisdom, stands for love, peace, family, compassion and a better world, thus confirming the principles we stand for. See? It's not just Jesus. Now Morrie has confirmed for us that this is the true way of life.<br /><br />The cold reality, however, is that a slow and painful death does not give Morrie's view, or anyone's, legitimacy. While I am all for love, peace, and so on, I cannot find anything particularly fascinating about Morrie's dying Gospel. At the beginning of the book I thought this could be an interesting story. Mid-way through my reading, however, I was extremely annoyed. The book relies on the \\"wisdom-of-the-dying-man fallacy\\" and, once you get past the touchy-feely content that Albom so keenly stresses over and over, you wonder: Is there anything of value in this book? Is there any difference between reading this or listening to the average priest or pastor's sermon on Sunday or listening to what any good fellow has to say?<br /><br />When people know they are dying, they change. Maybe Morrie was always a saint, but it's no wonder that everything that can possibly come out of his mouth now is benevolent, compassionate, and loving. He's been blessed with a wonderful family who takes care of him to the end. And Albom himself deserves some credit: by appearing once a week to make sure Morrie's thoughts and feelings remain with us after his death, he undoubtedly helped Morrie die a happier death. Morrie's ideas, however, are plain, and always conservative. For example, he recommends us to form families, because without a family, he \\"could not go through this.\\" Fear of ALS does not strike me as a great reason to start a family.<br /><br />Albom is a terrible writer. His grammar is poor (e.g. \\" 'Why, I asked?' \\", misplacing the question mark, instead of \\" 'Why?' I asked \\"), he has no further thought to add to what Morrie says, and he does not bring any outsider into the lecture either. Whatever Morrie says is sacred, legitimate by virtue of the slow death of a virtuous man.<br /><br />Furthermore, and the reader too absorbed in the main message (where Albom directs him/her) may not notice, Albom knows virtually nothing about Morrie. If you do the math, you realize that Morrie became a college professor late in life, in his 40s or 50s. His life before that is summarized in a paragraph or two that are way too sketchy. At some point, Albom tells us that Morrie loves to dance and that he dances by himself, free and wholesome. Later, he refers to Morrie's many \\"dance partners.\\" The book is not about Morrie at all. Albom knows almost nothing about Morrie's life, and he certainly could not care less about it. Why? Because he doesn't need Morrie's life story. His slow and cruel death, plus bits and pieces that show us that he is, in his final weeks and without information about his past, a nice and loving man, is all he needs to invest Morrie with the wisdom of a prophet.<br /><br />I read this book after someone recommended it to me because I am a college professor myself. The recommender thought that I would love the glorious story of a professor's wisdom. If some students remember me after years have gone by, I would very much prefer that they do so on account of whatever they got from me in the classroom--things like challenging arguments, intellectual engagement and tools to examine our social world--rather than for being a nice guy who says nice things about life.  If I happen to die a slow, cruel death, and some Mitch Albom wants to make it more bearable for me by coming to see me every week, so be it, and thank you. But please don't bother to read the posthumous book. I'll be dead and I won't care.ot from me in the classroom--things like challenging arguments, intellectual engagement and tools to examine our social world--rather than for being a nice guy who says nice things about life.

B0002V7ODI|3.0|As far as most comic-book movies go, they usually follow the same-old path of showing us the origins of whatever hero for about 45 minutes before getting into a real (but usually superficial) plot. This can lead to a never-ending list of deadbeats such Hulk, Spider-Man and Catwoman and rarely ends up with a good movie (Batman Begins is one rare example). Guillermo Del Toro seems to make a compromise of introducing Baby Hellboy during the end of WWII and then flashing forward 60 years to adult HB (though genetically he's barely out of his 20s) working for the Government.<br /><br />The Bureau of Paranormal Research uses Hellboy as a weapon against the forces of evil. Being a demon from Hell himself, but preferring to fight for the good side, HB works with Abe Sabien (a very likable sort of fish-man) and his pyro-kinetic would-be girlfriend Liz. Raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) he regularly has fallings out with his human father and even hides his cigarette smoking from him. I find the stroppy teenager attitude a unique character quirk that works well. What's even cooler is HB fondness for cats. Which not a typical characteristic of a demon born in Hell.<br /><br />The world's last living super-evil Nazis resurrect the mad-monk Grigori Rasputin and aim to bring about Armageddon by awakening sleeping Lovecraftian Gods, frozen in time at the edge of the universe. A tough job, even for HB, but it's all in a days work for the Bureau of Paranormal Research.<br /><br />Del Toro works wonders in bringing to life atmospheric sets (check out the flooded subway station) and horrific creatures but stops short of making Hellboy a dark epic. The CGI is impressive and the visions of Hell are interesting but there's just some intangible element that seems to be missing and the film feels incomplete. Even the Director's Cut still feels a bit alienating.<br /><br />However the action and humor is quite entertaining and the villains (especially 107-year-old, crazed assassin Kroenen) are definitely the kind you want to see die horribly. Enjoy it for what it is, even if you feel it's not entirely wholesome by the end.<br /><br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with DTS 5.1 sound and a zillion extras.ant to see die horribly.

B000002KO3|5.0|'Remain in Light' is arguably the Talking Heads' best album ever.  Steeped in primitive, African rhthyms, but sent with the trajectory of advanced technology, the album harnesses a mesmerizing and formidable set of sounds and images.  It is easily Talking Heads' most avant garde work of their whole career.  Think of tribal music generated from a computer, and you get 'Remain in Light'.     What used to be known as side one has mainly more progressive songs, and the second half is more subdued, but all of it is brilliant.  There's \\"Born Under Punches,\\" where David Byrne warbles, \\"I'm a tumbler...I'm a government man.\\"  Like many songs before it, he takes the everyman through the cross-hairs of everyday, struggling existence.  \\"Cross-eyed and Painless\\" is pedestrian, but contains some riveting funk, and \\"The Great Curve\\" is hypnotic with the most dancey song from the album.  \\"Houses in Motion\\" takes the funk where \\"Cross-eyed..\\" left off, but, understandably, given the title, takes a slower groove.  (I've often wondered if the song is about the homeless.)  Anyway, nuances give way to thoughtful songs like \\"Seen and Not Seen\\" and \\"Listening Wind\\".  The finale is truly magnificent.  Perhaps a song about calamity as big as Armageddon, \\"The Overload\\" is a chilling song that envelops the listener with its ominous development.    Still, a classic after all these years, 'Remain in Light' sounds just as innovative and modern as it did upon its release.  Having a troubadour song, \\"Once in a Lifetime,\\" complete with synthesizers that simulate flowing water, has kept them on the radio for a number of years with the most moving, and yet, \\"normal\\" song from the whole album.
B000MCH5TK|5.0|Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo Arriaga (who have sadly had a falling-out) may be one of the most formidable creative teams in the industry. Without resorting to cheap sentiments or preaching, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu crafts a quietly compelling follow-up to \\"21 Grams,\\" with an introspective look at the interlaced lives after a tragedy.<br /><br />Two boys in Morocco buy a rifle, and while testing it out, they strike a passing tourist bus. Unfortunately, the bullet strikes a vacationing American woman (Cate Blanchett), in the middle of a rural area with no real medical facilities. Unable to be transported, the woman and her husband (Brad Pitt) are dropped off in a rural village, to await help.<br /><br />Unknowingly, the boys have triggered off shattering events in other people's lives across the world -- a troubled, deaf Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) causes a commotion, and the police find that this neglected, lonely teen is the daughter of the man who originally had the boys' rifle. And the American couple's nanny (Adriana Barraza) is delayed going to her son's wedding, and attempts to bring the children into Mexico with her -- with disastrous results.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is like a series of completely different photographs, but with the same person in the background. These haunting looks at how lives can be changed in an instant -- and the effects of violence, whether malicious or careless -- makes up the last volume of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga's \\"Death Trilogy.\\" It illustrates death with the fragility of life.<br /><br />But it's also about the difficulty of communicating in the modern world. You can talk to someone across the world, but sometimes never communicate -- cultures, languages, race, and disabilities can divide people, such as when the border police rush to rescue the American kids, but are callous to the kindly nanny merely because she is not a citizen.<br /><br />And I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu knows how to capture the right feel for the movie, even to giving it shaky, rough cinematography. There's a feeling of powerful emotion even in small scenes, such as Pitt starting to crumble as he makes a phone call. And the movie moves seamlessly from the rocky, dusty Morocco to the flashy, frenetic Tokyo to the relaxed San Diego.<br /><br />Blanchett and Pitt are at the center of the movie (in that order), and both are excellent. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt acquits himself well as her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress. Blanchett's performance should definitely garner her an Oscar next year -- and heads should roll if she isn't even nominated!<br /><br />But the supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Kikuchi as the rebellious teenager, who feels isolated from the world around her, and is still grieving from her mother's tragic death. So she acts out sexually. And Barraza gives a solid performance as the nanny, in a nightmarish situation that is particularly haunting because it really happens.<br /><br />It may comment on the lack of communication between cultures and people, but \\"Babel\\" is so compelling in its acting and visuals that it could easily have been a silent film.

B00005JP9V|3.0|(3 1/2 *'s) How refreshing it is to get a nightmare science fiction movie.  It's been a long time since we've seen a disutopian novel put on the screen.  'Children of Men' takes place in 2026, not too far in the future.  The planet has become infertile, and baby Diego, the youngest member of the planet has been killed in a terrorist attack in London.  Theo Farran (Clive Owen) is caught between the polarities of that world:  There's the military arm of the government, keeping immigrants in the equivalent of concentration camps.  Then, there's the underground resistance.  Theo's a pedestrian.  He cares about keeping as much stability in the chaos and out of as much trouble as possible.  His love interest is for Jillian who's a part of that underground, and his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), is an elderly hippie who lives out in the country and maintains a mild mannered, but mature dissenter.  As an insider, Theo has what the resistance needs, a program to support their cause.  They give him an offer he can't refuse.  More interesting is someone under their wings, a Fuji woman who is pregnant and in hiding.  Theo has mission impossible, he must, significantly enough, evade both the police state and the rebel radicals while bringing the woman and her baby to safety.    Messages galore come out from the movie.  The infertility part is certainly extrapolation, but little else is.  (Merely blowing up tendencies of today is an essential ingredient of science fiction, however.)  The mounting of counter-terrorism in a war at civilization's footstep doesn't try to bring the future too many leaps forward.  The composite picture is an ominous urban nightmare with dilapidated buildings, broken glass, and villains with submachine guns everywhere.  While I think 'Children of Men' is a good diversion from the usual movie fare, I sometimes thought as skillfully as the battle scenes are delivered, and the speeches are being made, that maybe the dialogue and a greater variety of developments would have made it a better picture.  Still, I must concede the movie still haunted me long after I left the theatre.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|The only thing I thought I knew about Shakira was that she was some Latin pop diva on the order of non-Latin pop diva Mariah Carey, whose faux-sexy image has sold millions of records. So I'm in this Gap store in the mall and \\"Don't Bother\\" is rocking through the ceiling speakers. Stop everything. That voice, those guitars, those lyrics. I went over to the salesgirl and asked who was singing. My wife says, \\"Isn't that Shakira,\\" and I say, \\"No, really?\\" The salesgirl confirms it and I end up ordering a couple of CD's through Amazon. Forget the marketing. Sure, sex sells, but unlike Mariah Carey, Shakira has talent beneath the facade. She wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on this album and belts them out like a locomotive. The lyrics are sardonic and ironic, and the voice that wraps itself around them knows what it's doing. Recommended without reservation.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great book to read. The book sports an airy flow that allows for instant engrossment in the story Chbosky unfolds. The story also allows for an inside view to the life of all highschool students. I thoroughly recomend this book.
038572179X|3.0|No question that McEwan is a tremendously talented writer; the passages about Briony as budding (and autumnal) writer are almost miraculous in their clarity. The first section has some of the most spellbinding writing I have read, but from the climactic parting of lovers (witnessed by Briony in the morning light), there is really no place to go but down. McEwan's writing about the war shows less conviction and confidence, and its function within the larger story is rather unclear - the impact of Briony's betrayal goes without saying, and casting Robbie's sufferings into those of a typecast \\"soldier as estranged lover caught in nightmare\\" diminishes the singularity of his suffering. Same goes for the third section, where attempts to portray Briony's guilt are obscured by over-reliance on detail and lack of narrative trajectory. Though the endpoint may be for us to experience the effects of Briony's lack of \\"backbone,\\" we shouldn't have to feel the same about the novel itself.
0465092756|4.0|If Dr. Woit knows so much about physics, then how come I haven't seen him on Charlie Rose?  Or how come I haven't seen him explaining how smart Einstein was on some Nova PBS special?  The fact is, there is a well established heirarchy for physics experts who want to talk to the public, and Woit has cut in line by publishing this book.  In doing so he undermines the authority of the Hollywood physics establishment and sows disunity in the field, emboldening it's foes. Did he ever stop and think the kind of damage this book could do if it got into the hands of some beaurocrat in the National Science Foundation?  Did he ever stop to think what would become of modern theoretical physics if deference to authority figures was called into question?
1594200823|5.0|The writer below calls this book a 'flawed masterpiece,' because it relies heavily on the lessons taught by the intensive --read that 'intelligent'-- management of a Virginia farm.  But what the writer fails to acknowledge is that in those places where the lessons aren't easily applied (the arrid West), perhaps we shouldn't be intensively grazing cattle in land that is incapable of rapid regeneration. <br /> <br />I thought this was an excellent book that captures better than any other the looming consequences of a petroluem-based agricultural economy that is on the verge of running out of cheap oil. <br /> <br />We must find a better way.  This book is a most eloquent call to arms. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000024UH|5.0|I first heard this in high school, and I could not believe the musical depth.  The emotions that sprang from the music worked its hypnotic spell on everyone in the room.  I had never heard instruments sing this way: both in perfect harmony, yet with a biting edge that kept you wanting more. I immediately bought the album, and have treasured it ever since.
0156027321|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  I listen to books on tape.  This one was slow in places but hey consider where he is? <br />It is one of those books that is completely different the second time you read it.  Great writing.  and the narrorator was really interesting.  Loved his accent.  <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is always talked about as being an anti-drug movie.  That may be true but I cannot say for sure.  The director is not known for being outspoken about drugs.  He has probably used before.  I really have no idea.  Maybe the reason I don't find this to be an anti-drug movie is because I have never had problems with drugs.  Maybe it would have hit me as pure trash.  I have known people that have had problems but I think that the thing people need to realize going into this, IT IS A MOVIE!  Watch it as a movie.  Don't show it to your kids as a message against drugs.  They will probably think it is a really cool movie and possibly think about using drugs because the film is so good.  When I say it is good I mean you may watch it 20 or 30 times like it has caused me to do.  Most movies I can do other things while watching but I just can't do it with this.  I have to watch it in it's entirety and I can never look away.  So again, just watch it as a movie and don't read too much about it before you see it.<br /><br />Sorry to sort of go off on a rant but all I hear is how this should be considered a documentary and some people even say a bad one at that.  Maybe these people don't watch real movies with great acting performances regularly.  Marlon Wayans will totally blow you away with how you will believe every bad thing that happens to him.  Ellen Burstyn probably gives the best performance overall.  All of the charcters have a drug problem.  Burstyn's character is addicted to weight loss drugs and her son(Jared Leto), his girlfirend, and best friend are heroine addicts.  The movie starts out well enough and drugs seem to be helping them out but when there is a dry spell and no drugs are around, things do not go so well.<br /><br />The cinematography in this movie is one of the most amazing pieces of art I have ever seen on film.  There is a scene where Jared Leto and his girlfriend(Jennifer Connely) are very desperate for money so they decide for Connely to go spend some time with a man who has been wanting to pay for her time for a while.  This is a disturbing part of the film but it becomes one of the most unique moments I have ever seen in a movie.  I would consider this the best score I have ever heard in a movie and it helps out when Connoly has a scene leaving the place of the man who paid for her company and the camera truly makes you feel what she is feeling.  You will have to find out for yourself what she is feeling and it is kind of a scary moment the camera creates.  It was very unique.  I have never experienced a feeling like that in  movie and never have sinced.<br /><br />I have done the best I can to explain this movie.  It is one of my favorites films of all time and I just had to say that and let it out of my system.  Words cannot describe how good the movie is but I have tried.  Every scene from start to finish is absolutely outstanding and yes the ending will hit you hard.  It is tragic, and it is just plain amazing.  I will admit that I would never think of EVER shooting up after seeing this, even if I wasn't scared out of my mind of needles in the first place, but this is one of my top 20 favs ever even if it is seen as an anti-drug movie.e with a man who has been wanting to pay for her time for a while.

0061122416|2.0|Though prettied up in an appealingly innocuous package, this story of a young boy's journey to find his \\"treasure\\" is a rather insidious form of propaganda for a particular and particularly inimical point of view. The New Age myth of the personal dream which must be pursued in order to fulfill one's destiny is custom-made to instill dissatisfaction in the average person trying to find joy and fulfillment in life's every-day normality. The risk of such an approach is that those foolish enough to follow it without extreme caution may well abandon those things which will indeed give true happiness in favor of the pursuit of some pipedream which never will. The fragile psyche will be particularly vulnerable to such influence. We make a grave mistake if we believe that literature cannot be such a powerful force; it can be and is. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B000002JKA|5.0|After the surprise success of \\"Images And Words\\" the band tried to follow it up with an album that appears to be geared a bit more towards radio and MTV airplay.  The album is not what I would call commercial, but it does appear that they were trying to move in a particular direction.  The music on the disc is significantly heavier than on its predecessor, for the most part and is probably their most metal oriented album until \\"Train Of Thought\\" a decade later.  The single \\"Lie\\" got some airplay, but not nearly as much as \\"Pull Me Under\\" had.  It would pretty much be the last time Dream Theater would be heard on radio or MTV having been snubbed ever since.   Listening to this album again after a long layoff I find that it has really aged quite well.  I remember when it came out being somewhat disappointed with it, but it really does contains some outstanding work and it may be more a reflection of my musical taste at the time than the contents of the album.  As mentioned previously there is much heaviness to be found here and many of the lyrics are dark \\"6:00\\", \\"Erotomania\\", \\"The Mirror\\" , \\"Lie\\" and \\"Scarred\\" all rock hard.  Lighter moments appear on \\"Silent Man\\", \\"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream\\".  Other highlights include \\"Caught In A Web\\", \\"Voices\\", and the album closer the creepy \\"Space Dye Vest\\".  Instrumentally........well this is dream theater so everything is top notch incredible playing.  As I have seen some others mention this is probably not the album to purchase if you are looking to explore Dream Theater as a starter, but it is a must own for all fans of the band.
B000LC3ID8|2.0|I like Saw and horror movies in general but the Saw movies are so so over the top and unrealistic. The chick and and old man like Jigsaw are able to kidnap all these women and men. And while Jigsaw was sick, the chick happened to kidnap all these big and buff male victims in Part 2 & 3. Stupid. Come on. And how do they know all the backgrounds of the victims you have to be some FBI or stock people all day long 24/7 to figure out their backgrounds. Some i'm assuming Jigsaw doesn't have a job because he's to busy following and stocking his victims. And how the hell can Jigsaw or the chick design all the elaborate death traps. Give me a freakin break. You have to be an engineer to design all the traps. Even if you could,  where are you going to get all the parts. And how did the chick kidnap the doctor in the hospital??? There's camera surveillance in all hospitals 24/7. These Saw movies are so stupid. More stupid then Freddy or Jason or Michael Myers coming back to life 100 times. At least Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers are portrayed as supernatural demons or zombies that can't be killed. Saw movies try to make it seem this can happen in real life. Give me a break.
B000000WCA|5.0|Here I will rate each song out of 10. Please enjoy.<br /><br />Wannabe - 10/10<br /><br />Their biggest hit ever! It was very popular! To me, it never gets old. It's sassy, and bubblegum pop sound is irresistable!<br /><br />Say You'll Be There - 9/10<br /><br />Can be boring at some parts, but it's still good. It sounds sort of oldies/country/pop!<br /><br />2 Become 1 - 10/10<br /><br />A song about sex, but not in a crude way at all. Very sweet, candy, teeneager sounding, but it's a slow, nice song.<br /><br />Love Thing - 8/10<br /><br />They should have released this! It's really catchy and sort of techno! For some reason, I think it sounds like a Macy Gray song. Very good.<br /><br />Last Time Lover - 10/10<br /><br />This song, is perfect in every way! It's sexy, catchy, and great! In a way, I'm glad that they didn't release it because that would have been weird. It's one of those songs that makes you glad that you bought the album.<br /><br />Mama - 9.5/10<br /><br />Very touching. A very popular mother's day song. It would be great to sing on Mother's day to your mom! (haha!) Some might think it's boring, so I was forced to take off half a point...! Definitely worth listening to, and it's a very long song.<br /><br />Who Do You Think You Are - 7/10<br /><br />Sort of catchy, and very loud sounding. Song with lots of energy! Just not even close to the best song on here. It didn't really deserve any higher than a 7.<br /><br />Something Kinda Funny - 8/10<br /><br />Great song. It's sort of boring, though. You'd have to listen to it 15 times before it gets stuck in your head!<br /><br />Naked - 99/10<br /><br />BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM! This is my topped played song on my iPod! The should have released it!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sexy song, very, very, very catchy. Great for long car rides! It's very serious sounding, and full of bass. Slow song at beginning, but then it speeds up. Great.<br /><br />If U Can't Dance - 6/10<br /><br />Every album has it's weak point, and for this album...it's this song. I still like this song, but it's just that song that you try to like so much, that you end up not liking it even more in the end. They sound like tone-deaf robots in the beginning. You should listen to it, and maybe you'll think differently. It's kind of like a dance song, but the beat is slightly slower than most.<br /><br />That was my review of the Spice Girls' debut album, 'Spice'! Hope it helped! ^_^.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones is back, and she is making a statement with her third record, Not Too Late, an album that features no covers and Jones writing or co-writing every song. <br /> <br />For all of those New York indie-club frequenters who may have witnessed Jones' experimentation take full force over the past few years with the guitar, she gives up the piano in favor of what she claimed was an easier instrument for her to write songs to while on the road. The usual suspects are all here--Lee Alexander, Andy Borger, Adam Levy, Daru Oda. And hey, Come Away With Me fans!--just when you thought he might be too into his own career now to care about you or have time to guest on his old buddy's latest record, your favorite singer/songwriter Jesse Harris is back too, playing on the first five songs of this new record and making them beautiful as only he can do. <br /> <br />While I had heard some early live versions of a few of these numbers as well as the single, I tried to clear my mind of making any judgments before listening to this record and tried to forget that this artist had already made two records prior to this. Then I hit play. <br /> <br />Immediately I am hit with the sweet acoustic strings of Harris, and as Norah's voice kicks in, it seems as though suddenly I am whisked back to the days of \\"Don't Know Why.\\" But as I notice the complete lack of piano, I see other huge, huge, huge differences here as well. This time Norah has written the song, this time there is a point, and this time there is even a story. In four minutes, Norah and her longest-running collaborator, drenched in a musical halo of cellos, tell the story of Annie, who has made the devastating mistake of falling in love with a soldier only to lose him to his duty, and amongst all this sadness Norah even conjures up the possibility of a love triangle existing. While I have heard \\"Wish I Could\\" before live, finally hearing the lyrics clearly and replacing flutes with violins completely alters the feel of the song and makes you feel like you are discovering this gem for the first time. This should seriously be the anthem of all soldiers' wives--lines like \\"He was my man but they didn't care/Sent him far away from here\\" will have even big lugs like me rubbing at their eyes pretending that we have an itch. <br /> <br />The epic feel of the album seems to musically come down a few notches, as \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" is next, a song that Norah claimed was recorded when all the musicians were buzzed/tipsy/drunk. As I hear the trombone kick in, it almost sounds like Louie Armstrong shouting \\"yeah yeah yeah.\\" M. Ward pitches in with a background vocal guest appearance near the end of the song. This song has a very quirky vibe to it, but you can also argue that this song evokes images of a cabaret performing their hearts out. While this is the only song that Jones did not write the majority of, I have to wonder, who is the \\"captain\\" that she is talking about that causes the boat to sink? Could it have anything to do with the war discussed in the previous song? Hmm...I wonder. <br /> <br />At first, \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" brings back memories of songs from the Come Away With Me era for me. But lyrically I find it is a whole `nother story, as Norah tells a story from the point of view of a fugitive's lover who is too caught up in the present to worry about long-term implications of the acts her significant other commits. Also, halfway through the song Adam Levy kicks in and contributes a tasty guitar solo that definitely does not remind me of any of Norah's past works. <br /> <br />\\"Until The End\\" is an open letter to someone that Norah knows, and while it's unclear if this is someone she really knows or is someone she has watched break down, once again it features Norah as the reporter of this individual's anguish--comparing this \\"apple queen's\\" situation to that of her own, and considering how tempting it would be to \\"relax a little.\\" But in the end Norah resigns herself to the fact that both her and this other person will always \\"stay the same.\\" Yes, this track might have you aching to wonder who Norah is talking about in this song, kind of how everyone went crazy when Evanescence put out \\"Everybody's Fool.\\" Again, an Adam Levy electric solo is one of the highlights of this song. <br /> <br />By this point in the album, a theme is starting to come to light. The majority of these songs focus on relationships caught in the middle of an external conflict, and the listener will find himself/herself listening to Norah the reporter to find out what happens. But allow yourself to get too sucked into the story and you might be surprised by not getting a clear-cut ending--some of these songs end almost abruptly, like the seemingly soothing \\"Not My Friend,\\" which actually seems to focus on a victim of domestic abuse and hints at how she might resolve the problem in the end--but this ending is left open-ended as the song abruptly comes to a close. <br /> <br />The next song, \\"Thinking About You\\" is one Norah wrote when she was still a member of the funk-jazz-fusion band Wax Poetic, with its frontman Ilhan Ersahin, and for those fans familiar with Norah's previous work with that band this will be a definite treat. Norah sings about indecision and flightiness in love here, as in one verse we hear her calling for someone to give her \\"cold hands a warm warm touch\\" and then in the next verse as she gets those hands she is already guessing it is \\"time for me to let you go.\\" But by the end as she has let go she asks to \\"smile a little smile for me,\\" seemingly having fallen back in love again. \\"Make up your mind!\\" is what I'm sure numerous people were yelling when they first heard this song, which was the first single off this album. OK, not really, but this is probably as safe and as jazzy as it will get on this album for most \\"Norah regulars.\\" <br /> <br />We shift away from the love-amidst-conflict theme for a moment as Norah focuses on a \\"Broken\\" individual, and this song features Norah on the electric guitar. While I think Norah does a decent job, I actually had an opportunity to hear Adam Levy play this song live on the banjo instead, and I prefer that stripped down version a lot more as it fits with the description we are given of this fellow. <br /> <br />All the conflict finally comes to a head in \\"My Dear Country,\\" where Norah rails against the system. Yes, I can't believe my ears, but Norah has gone political. Before you all go crazy against me, no she doesn't say anything about Bush. Rather, this has got to be one of the most tasteful political protest songs that has been recorded in a long time--she comments on the current uselessness of the American election system, but after some consideration decides that despite this horrible flaw, our \\"dear country\\" is not that bad after all--at least Americans are free, and since that is all she knows for sure she will just exercise her freedom to sing. Good call, NJ! <br /> <br />On \\"Wake Me Up\\" a 3-piece band fronted by Norah on guitar, featuring Andy on drums and Lee on bass, makes its debut here. We are presented with a song which comments on the tendency of people to want to ignore major problems in the world, as they are so stuck in their own daydreams, and the last few lines \\"I will still feel it later on, but for now I'd rather be asleep\\" sum up the apathetic tendencies of our generation to a tee. <br /> <br />Norah's fellow Little Willies bandmate Richard Julian drops by in \\"Be My Somebody\\" to do what he does best when he usually teams up with Norah--be her vocal foil. It would have been much nicer had his voice been higher up in the mix, but nevertheless this song can easily be mistaken for a poppy Little Willies outtake and is quite good. The symbolism here is interesting, as Norah uses items that were presumably thrown around in a fight interchangeably to describe herself, and then reduces herself to begging for her partner to stay. <br /> <br />Suddenly,you hear Norah counting off, and the acoustics of the album slightly change momentarily. One has to keep in mind that this album was recorded in a home studio, and therefore tracks like \\"Little Room\\" could have been easily recorded in a smaller room in the same residence, in order to reduce echo. This track features Norah on guitar, Lee on bass and Daru on whistles. Yeah--whistles! The girl should have just brought her flute for this one, but her call. Norah also wrote this song upon her arrival to New York, and the lyrics are actually somewhat of a foil to the \\"cute\\"-sounding music--summing up the theme of love amongst conflict more simply than any other song on the record--\\"And if there were a fire/We'd burn up for sure/But that's just fine with me/Because we'd be together ever more.\\" <br /> <br />In \\"Rosie's Lullaby,\\" we follow a girl who seems to have nothing left but her dreams, and as she looks upwards for some sort of answer it is the sea that responds, telling her to close her eyes and dream--and eventually, we find that she is calling to the \\"big ships\\" presumably because she is drowning, but \\"they just pass her by.\\" The point here seems to be to act on your dreams as soon as possible, or it may be too late. Adam Levy comes back with another performance on the electric guitar and contributes vocals, and long-time collaborator Robbie McIntosh also joins with an electric. <br /> <br />But with the last track of the album, Norah seems to contradict this--saying that \\"it's not too late for love.\\" This song features Norah on piano, Borger on minimal drumming, and bass from Lee--and this is basically the summary of the entire album right here. After placing love relationships in different scenarios and commenting on conflict that is occurring and managing to almost always find hope at the end of every situation or conflict, or always finding the good in something that may seem completely bleak, Norah has come to the conclusion that it is \\"Not Too Late\\" to changethe way we are living our lives--while \\"it isn't easy,\\" \\"nothing worth the time ever is.\\" <br /> <br />And on this high note of hope, Norah closes the album. For those of you in Japan, however, you get one more treat--the adorable \\"2 Men,\\" which features Norah commenting on the irony of the fact that she has wound up in a bar with 2 men whom she was involved with at one time--it's just Norah and the piano, a very short, very sassy little ditty that can also be found as the B-Side to the Thinking About You single. <br /> <br />With this album, Norah Jones has taken her music into her own hands. She has not just made an album full of love songs, but has painted pictures in every single song, setting each in a backdrop of conflict, and then presenting a different outcome in every different situation. In the end, she is able to sum up the content of her album in a universal message of hope and belief in humanity, not falling prey to the pessimistic portrayal of the world that so many artists, even those who are much more experienced than her, tend to have in their music. <br /> <br />It is this successfully navigated, emotional yet restrained observation of the human experience in this day in age that leads me to rate Not Too Late a perfect 5/5.

0810945797|5.0|I love the artwork of Brian Froud and have for years. The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth are two of my most favourite movies. I own several of Froud's other books, including Good Faeries/Bad Faeries. The World of the Dark Crystal is just as beautiful as any of his other works. It's absolutely mesmerizing. The thought put in to the history of this world is amazing, although some of the text can be a bit long winded, it's nevertheless an enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Froud's artwork and/or the Dark Crystal.

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|When you can put on an album and just sit back and do nothing, just let the music take you on an emotional and powerful journey, it's really something special about it. There are very few albums that have the same effect on me like Marbles have. Its melodic and professional, sometimes relaxing, sometimes upbeat music takes you through a delightful darkness with a colourful brightness and a loving atmosphere. Not in the same musical style as Misplaced Childhood, but it still brings the question; \\"Can music be any better than this\\".
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini series is excellent. Although graphic it is true to the soldiers story and I love the actual soldiers telling their view of real events.
1883217040|4.0|I purchased this book along with another book by Mark Levine.  The books are very similar and both are more advanced than I would have liked.  I will need to use this book at a very slow and easy rate.<br /><br />This book will someday be a great help to my dreams of learning to master that Jazz music.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban has a beatiful voice. He is down to earth. I husband was very suprised how good a voice he has for such a young guy.  <br />His voice makes me forget my problems if only for a minute.
B000JLTRKE|2.0|I thought the movie was just okay ... I was distracted by the actors trying too hard to capture the New York and North Jersey accents - seemed exaggerated not natural.  The story itself could be about ANY two people trapped in ANY horrific catastrophe and ANY family's ordeal (boring); reminded me of the miners' rescue.  Most interesting fact:  out of the 20 people that were rescued these two guys were #18 and #19 making me want to know more or remembering from the news about the other 18 and their experiences.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|To say that this family is imperfect would be an understatement.  Much is revealed about the family members in the first minute of the movie.  Olive dreams of being a beauty queen.  Brother Dwayne has an ambition too, to be an Air Force jet pilot.  Dad makes a living as a motivational speaker helping others succeed in their ambition although ironically he is not very successful at this.  Grandpa's only real goal is to enjoy the \\"finer\\" things in life no matter how much they are frowned upon by society.    I enjoyed watching the family dynamics throughout this movie.  One of my favorite moments was when Olive found out early in the movie that she won a pageant by default.  Indeed this is only one of several moments that had me bursting out laughing.      After much debate and negotiation, they all pile into a hippie van and head from their New Mexico home to the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in California.  Like many other reviewers, I too found the movie to be uplifting.  Dwayne writes a message that he hates everyone including his family but does not necessarily live that.  He encourages Olive to hug Mom at a moment when she is experiencing grief.    The family does not condone what Olive did at the end of the movie but feels that it is not any more crass and obscene than the excessive makeup and primming and general excessiveness of child beauty pageants.  The feeling was shared by myself and others who appreciate this film.
0679720200|3.0|Okay, so I know it's a \\"masterpiece,\\" but I didn't take to this book like I thought I would (more importantly, should).  It's probably just me, but in the end, I needed there to be more to it... to some, therein lies the beauty.    In The Stranger, Meursault is a man of dull-character who lives a life that we can all relate to.  He holds a job, has a girlfriend, has an apartment and has a friend or two.  But what he lacks is the importance of it all.  Had he not been so devoid of any complexity his life would have taken another direction... and in the end, his existential way of life was ultimately his demise.    It's an easy read with a linear path... you'll gobble it up in a day or two as I did.  I'll read it again in about a year with the hopes that I'll get something more meaningful out of it.    Have fun,    David Tobias  Redondo Beach, CA
B000M4RG42|5.0|It's not often that one leaves a movie theatre with a whole new outlook on history...  I'll never look at the famous photo from Imo Jima in the same way again, perhaps the only WWII photo we Americans immediately recognize--the six men raising the flag on Mount Suribachi.  I walked into the theatre ashamedly uneducated about the bloody history and truth behind the glory...  I left in tears, moved and speechless.  Funny how the media, even in the 1940s, took control and turned those tumultuous years into a full-out war bonds marketing strategy.  This is one of the most important, realistic and significant WWII films out there.  Looking forward to reading the book and seeing Eastwood's counterpoint film, Letters from Imo Jima.
1599219751|1.0|This story is a complete fabrication.  The BBC did some investigative reporting and uncovered lots of documents that prove this story is not true.  You can read all about it here:    [...]  Sure, it's a fun read, full of action and adventure, with heart-warming characters, scary bad guys, sad moments, happy moments and an uplifting ending.  It gives you faith in the human spirit and warms your soul.      But, unfortunately, none of it is true. And no matter how many people there are who want to believe it's true, that is still not going to make it a true story.    So, I would give this book four stars if the author was not a liar.  And it would still be a great story if it was advertised as fiction, which is the genre in which it belongs.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Sylvester Stallone did an outstanding job not only acting in this movie, but directing it too. I thought that this new version would be a fluke after seeing part 5. I was thinking that Rocky would get his a** kicked being so old. But after seeing this new version I was pleasantly surprised... Even though he is 62 in the storyboard, Rocky definetely  <br />proves that the last thing to age on any human being is the heart. How amazing is that?  I bought the \\"Rocky\\" collectors edition on DVD and it came with a free ticket to go and see Rocky Balboa so I took a friend of mine to go see it. This movie is incredible! It has even more heart than the original from 1976 and is by far the best Rocky movie in the whole series. An amazing fact to point out about this film is that Antonio Tarver is a real life fighter just as Tommy Morrison was a real boxer used for part 5.  <br /> <br />What makes this film interesting is that the end fight sequences are as real as real can get. Every single punch that Rocky Balboa and Mason \\"The Line' Dixon throw is a real one. HBO borrows the blueprint for a realistic fight sequence and seeing this in the theater was like getting a courtside seat to a boxing match. Special guest appearances by 'Iron Mike' Tyson, referee Joe Cortez, and Larry Greene from HBO Sports was an awesome touch. <br /> <br />The plot sees Rocky as a retired boxer living in the same philly neighborhood running an upscale restaurant named after his wife Adrian, who dies for reasons unknown. After a virtual television match puts rocky against the current heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon that's botched by reporters & managers, the two agree to set up a charity exhibition match in Las Vegas. 'Skill vs. Will' The thing I loved the most about this movie is that it has a good message about following your dreams and not letting life get you down no matter how hard things hit you or stand in your way. As Stallone says, \\"It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about howhard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done.\\" I highly recommend this movie to anybody... It will help inspire you to become the best person that you can be.  <br /> <br />Yo Adrian, we did it! We did it...
B000B7HZXM|5.0|IV is great.  Each volume was better than the last; if that could be possible.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Even though I own this DVD, I haven't opened up the package yet (have had it for a few months).  One thing I noticed about the early theatre version of the little mermaid versus the later version was that changed the scenes at the beginning and at the end a little bit.  Doesn't make a whole lot of difference, but I actually preferred the original.  I guess some might prefer the \\"edited\\" version.  I'll just have to see which version(s) they put on here. <br />One of my favorite movies, along with a clockwork orange (although that movie is definately not for kids).
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is the best show on TV since Friends!!  I love it!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I finally purchased this Chili Peppers cd a couple weeks ago and it is awesome. Way better than I expected! I was hesitant due to the price and the fact I have not been a big fan of the band in the past. I have never bought a RHCP cd but I would always borrow my friends and listen to them. Still I couldn't really get into much of their music. Just a few songs stood out. But after listening to this Stadium Arcadium cd I can't get enough of it. This band in my opinion has evolved, matured and have written one of the best cd's I've heard in a LONG time. What I think is great is the fact they run the entire gamut of sounds on this double cd. They held true to their style with some really cool funky sounding tracks like Charlie, Warlocks, 21st Century and Storm in a Teacup which are all great songs. But they have some great ballads that are beautifully written such as Hard to Concentrate and IF. Then they kick it up on a few tracks as well. A couple examples that are my favorites are Readymade and Torture me. And of course there are the popular ones like Dani California, Snow, and another favorite of mine, Tell me baby. I have bought a ton of cd's in the past from other bands that have on average 12-13 tracks with only 2 or 3 great songs on it. There are 28 songs on this double cd and I can honestly say that most of them (90%) are outstanding with some great bass playing, guitar licks and lyrics. With that said, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have served their fans (and new fans like myself) with an outstanding cd that's well worth the money! And let's face it, do they not have some of the best music video's as well? They know how to make a great video that's a bunch of fun to watch! Don't hesitate like I did, go buy Stadium Arcadium and enjoy it!
B000J103PC|3.0|With the winning cast and all the hype, I had expected so much more.  Yes, the clothes were breath-taking, but the storyline and dialogue fell flat.  I didn't see any kind of growth on the part of Andie's character--not that she had to.  I felt that her boyfriend and friends were simply rebelling against a image-conscious society and were, therefore, guilty of the same crime they accuse Andie of: viewing only an outer image, not the person beneath.  The story had such potential, but was just . . . well . . . blah. <br /> <br />
B000AP2ZDK|4.0|J Dilla - Donuts (Stones Throw, 2006)    I admit that I wasn't a fan of hip-hop instrumental albums before Donuts. Usually a beat will go on and on with no elaboration and it would lead to boredom. But when I listened to this album, I never got that feeling. Most of the songs are under two minutes long so if you get bored with a certain track, another one quickly starts. However, it is very difficult to get bored here when you witness all of the ways that J Dilla chopped up samples. \\"Time: The Donut of the Heart\\", for example, manipulates \\"All I Do is Think of You\\" by The Jackson 5 perfectly; The Roots must think so too since they used it for \\"Can't Stop This\\" on Game Theory. Another artist to use Dilla's beats from here is Ghostface Killah: \\"One for Ghost\\" (as it is so aptly titled) and \\"Hi.\\" were used for his Fishscale.     True, there are a few moments where a beat is so dope that you expect a rapper to jump in somewhere (see \\"Stop\\") but most of the songs don't need an MC. \\"Mash\\" is excellent, for example, and even the looping of that classic Mountain sample on \\"Stepson of the Clapper\\" is pretty clever. It was while listening to these songs where I realized that Dilla is no longer with us and how I'll miss hearing moments like those. -EJR
B000000WF0|4.0|Firstly, just to correct \\"Morten Vindberg\\", Jagger and Richards only received a credit for \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" because of the orchestra bits. The rest is pure Verve. <br /> <br />A very good album, containing such fantastic songs as \\"Sonnet\\", \\"Lucky Man\\" and my favourite, the closer, \\"Come On\\". I love the way this songs builds and builds and almost transports you to that \\"Mad Richard\\" place. <br /> <br />I don't think this album is stuck in its time - I think this album will be enjoyed and appreciated for many years to come.
0143034901|5.0|This book is filled with twists and turns that you do not expect.  Zafron has a way of writing that feels as if you are swallowed by a jar of honey.  His style will stick with you forever.  This will be a classic.  There is no doubt in my mind.
B000002LSV|4.0|While Greatest Hits is the most definitive single disc compilation for ZZ Top on the market, it is missing some of their best songs and doesn't hold up to their best work. 12 of the collection's 18 songs come from 1983 and later with two of the tracks being the \\"new\\" songs you often get with a greatest hits set. The four tracks included from Eliminator (\\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\", \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", and \\"Legs\\", the last of which is a remixed version) are all top notch and deserve to be here. The three tracks included from Afterburner include the big hits \\"Sleeping Bag\\" and \\"Rough Boy\\" and the album track, \\"Planet of Women.\\" While the first two should be included, the excellent hit single, \\"Stages\\", is not included. From the lackluster Recycler, we have \\"Doubleback\\", \\"My Head's In Mississippi\\", and \\"Give It Up\\", which are probably the best three songs from the album. The two new tracks include a remake of Elvis Presley's \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", which is so full of synths and electronic drums that it may as well have been recorded with The Art of Noise, and the forgettable minor hit \\"Gun Love.\\" As for the pre-Eliminator tracks, we get 6 in \\"Tush\\", \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\", \\"La Grange\\", \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\\", \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\", and \\"Pearl Necklace\\", all great songs that are now AOR staples. While this is a good compilation that hits most of the high notes, more of the `70s stuff like \\"Waiting For The Bus\\"/\\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\", \\"Heard It On The X\\", and \\"I Thank You\\", along with the `80s hit \\"Stages\\", should have been included and the weaker tracks \\"Give it Up\\", \\"Planet of Women\\", and especially the two \\"new\\" tracks should have been left alone. While discs such as Tres Hombres, Deguello, Eliminator, and Fandango! are better albums overall, Greatest Hits will do if you only want the hits.
B000002L99|5.0|I'll get it out of the way right at the start: I never liked David Lee Roth. He's a 'vocalist', not a singer.  And his 'vocalizing', as well as his sophomoric lyrics, always kept me from really enjoying Van Halen until he was gone, and one of my favorite hard rock vocalists (even before he stepped into VH), Sammy Hagar, replaced him.  I was 15 when 5150 was released in 1986, and to my ears songs like \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" and \\"Love Walks In\\" provided both a showcase for Eddie Van Halen's stellar guitar chops as well as a vehicle for the broadening of this band's horizons.  And for those who said Van Halen couldn't rock without Roth, I say--what are you smoking?  \\"Get Up\\" rocks harder than anything the band ever RECORDED with Roth.  I remember hearing that song for the first time--it was the flip side of the single 'Why Can't This Be Love', yes, back in the days of vinyl singles with flip sides--and thinking 'damn, Van Halen's gone metal' ;)  I love metal, too :) <br /> <br />Anyway...that's enough reviewing and reminiscing.  Buy this album--it's Van Halen's finest hour.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris' book \\"The End Of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason\\" takes an unflinching look at faith and comes to the following conclusion:  \\"The idea that any one of our religions represents the infallible word of the One True God requires an encyclopedic ignorance of history, mythology, and art even to be entertained...\\"  This conclusion, drawn on page 16, leaves Harris with the next 221 pages to burn his point into the readers mind.  In these early pages Harris wonders why it is considered impolite to question a person's faith but it is acceptable to question a persons understanding of math, physics, or biology.  Harris decides to abandon politeness.<br /><br />At the beginning of chapter four Harris explains that his arguments in his book are aimed at faith itself.  At times the author may appear politically naïve, yet, when he keeps focused on faith, his arguments are insightful and salient and there is much to value in this book.  Harris' assertion that it is time that the human race replaces unprovable notions of God with reason are made pointedly through numerous examples in the book.  For most, this book will not be a comfortable read.  If one believes in a God then much within this book is sure to offend.  But the central message of the book is that we must begin to accept some disturbing news about faith and be prepared to alter our thinking if human beings are going to survive on this planet.  Harris writes that as \\"long as it is acceptable for a person to believe that he knows how God wants everyone on earth to live, we will continue to murder one another on account of our myths.\\"
B000LC3ID8|5.0|The story and screenplay are fantastic.  This movie I found to be the most disturbing of the three.  If you have children, BEWARE of this one!  This movie got inside my head like no other movie I have seen before.  (Will there be a 4?)!
0446677450|3.0|This book, like so many others along with the tiresome infomertials, conventions and 'investor' seminars all contributed to an era that may very well lead right into another 80's style economic recession. The author makes it sound all too easy: Buy a house, turn around and sell it for more than you paid.  <br /> <br />  Basic and rudimentary economics are used as the foundation behind the book's premise. Supply, demand, 'safe' investments, and so on are all used to generate the image of instant and easy wealth for the average soccer mom or shoe salesman. If making money were to be so easy, then perhaps we should all be rich, right? <br /> <br />  Unfortunately, many people took books like these at face value and did invest very heavily in Real Estate. Most did not have the funds to even do that and as a result, close to 40% of all the homes sold in the last several years were investment homes. Of those bought, most were done so using exotic loans; ( no money down, interest only, ARM, etc etc) So in esssence, the entire industry at this point is one gigantic negative cash flow mess, which ironically goes against the initial premise of the book's own lame advice. Simply put, the nation's focus went from actual industry that produces positive cash flow to yet one more entirely speculative economy not unlike the dot-com of the late 90's. <br /> <br />We as a country will likely be paying for the financial mistakes of those who played this game for years to come. Some of us already are in the form of unbelievably overpriced housing, particularly in the east and west coasts. <br /> <br />  As far as \\"insider information\\" I can't think of any such information that could be gleaned from the RE industry other than the NAR and respective state agencies which get their own projections from the national association of Realtors, which in of itself is simply one giant sales machine bent on making real estate look positive no matter how high the foreclosure rates and defaults onpayments rise. if this is insider information, then I fail to see how it serves to be a benefit. <br /> <br />  This said, I do not doubt the business savvy of Mr. Kiyosaki, who likely made quite a bit of money on this book. But as for those thinking that they too can become fabulously rich flipping houses, please use more common sense.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I watched this production of Jane Eyre with a somewhat skeptical outlook at the beginning, but I was soon transported and transfixed...It was satisfying and enjoyable on every level. Some of the scenes were so powerful, I am still thinking about them. I have to say I was surprised to read some of the negative comments on a few of these reviews regarding the casting and acting, which I thought was superb. Toby Stephens brought a Mr. Rochester to life that I had not seen before...for once, I could see warmth and humor seep out from under all the guilt and self-loathing that had overtaken his life, and could see the sparks and understand the deep connection that Jane felt with him. I loved this Mr. Rochester and I loved this Jane - it's that simple. Was this a completely faithful adaptation of the book?  No, and if you are looking for that, you might be disappointed. It focused on the love story, and did not fully address some of the other themes in the book. (It's only four hours, after all.)  But was it a great and powerful viewing experience?  Without a doubt.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes quality period dramas - I can't wait to watch it again.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Spoofing 50's animation and sci-fi invasion epics from \\"War Of The Worlds\\" to \\"Signs\\" to \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Chicken Little\\" is Disney trying to prove they could match the artistry of Pixar without actually working with them. Frankly, not even close. Barely making it past an hour's running time, this DVD rates none of the action or suspense of \\"The Incredibles\\" and fails miserably at trying to sneak in adult humor ala Dreamworks' \\"Shrek\\" films.<br /><br />Not for lack of trying. There are a couple of funny scenes here, like when Runt's mother threatens to ground him from his Streisand albums (\\"Leave Barbara out of this,\\" the oversized pig squeals...). But for the most part, the forced pop culture references - like the R.E.M. song - seem overwrought. The \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" ending was a clever touch, though. The voice cast commits themselves well (Zach Braff, Gerry Marshall and Amy Sedaris in particular). Too bad the critters aren't really attractive visually.<br /><br />The CGI seems more than a little harsh looking. There is little of the smoothness of \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"The Incredibles\\" to be had here. The Chicken Little character reminds me a little of the geeky chick that used to one-up Foghorn Leghorn in the old WB cartoons, and Fish Out of Water struck me as a G-rated version of South Park's Kenny (albeit he was still funny). Which means: Not much by way of original development here. Seems Disney maybe needed Pixar more then the opposite.<br /><br />Also, the level of violence may be a bit much for the under six set. Prominent characters are getting zapped by the aliens during the invasion section, and although they do return, you may have to do a little explaining (ala Bambi's Mom). The use of name calling seems a bit over-the-top as well, even if the principal offender gets her come-uppance by the finale. Closer to 2 & 1/2 stars than three, \\"Chicken Little\\" is more a McNugget than a Disney Classic.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It isn't surprising that almost every review for this album makes reference to Radiohead.  Muse is obviously very influenced by that OTHER brilliant British neo-prog band, and Thom Yorke comparisons for the vocals are almost inevitable.  However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If one is looking for great modern influences, there is really no better band to look to than Radiohead.  And, despite several similarities, Muse actually has a unique sound and \\"Absolution\\" is an absolutely astounding album on its own terms.  I have been listening to this album steadily since its release and it remains one of my very favorite albums- sitting alongside the Beatles, the Clash, the Strokes and, of course, Radiohead.   <br /> <br />With \\"Absolution,\\" Muse has created an emotionally devastating masterpiece.  The combination of vocals, lyrics, guitar tone and pure energy is heavenly and the result is a collection of some of the most interesting and powerful songs written in recent years.  The songs can rock convincingly, as seen in songs like \\"Time is Running Out,\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" but I am equally interested in the quieter and more introspective pieces.  My personal pick for the best song on the album is the closer, \\"Ruled By Secrecy\\" which has one of the most beautiful sonic build ups I have ever heard.  The moment those piano chords come crashing in...well, if the hair on the back of your neck doesn't stand up then you aren't listening close enough.   <br /> <br />This is a truly amazing album that should really belong in the collection of any fan of modern rock music.  It is one of the pinnacles of modern music and Muse has continued their creativity and innovation with last year's \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" (isn't \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" one of the greatest things you've ever heard?)  Trust me on this one.  Get over your Radiohead comparisons and enjoy this absolutely astonishing album.
B000001YOW|5.0|I never really understood all the hoopla that had been swirling around Porcupine Tree.  I read the Amazon reviews, listened to the sound snippets, took the advice of all the people that supposedly were 'in the know.'  I bought \\"Deadwing\\" and \\"In Absentia,\\" but I just didn't get it.  Those records certainly had their moments, but comparisons to prog icons like Pink Floyd were a real stretch.  The heaviest parts of those two albums were just noise to my ears.  The more melodic parts bore an uncanny resemblance to an '80's Christian rock band called The Choir (if you can get your hands on a copy of \\"Shake the Tree\\" or \\"Circle Slide,\\" you will swear you are listening to \\"In Absentia.\\")  That is not entirely bad, but certainly nothing to get all worked into a lather over. <br /> <br />So I listen to \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" every now and then, but I can't say I have ever recommended either to a friend, and I thought I would certainly never go out of my way to buy anything else PT has put out. <br /> <br />Then in a weak moment (and with an Amazon gift card, so I had nothing to lose) I bought \\"Signify.\\"              ******GULP******           Now THAT is a great record! <br /> <br />\\"Signify\\" is a much more instrumental, almost ambient record.  Whereas the songs on \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" seem to have lyrics because songs are supposed to have lyrics, on \\"Signify\\" the songs carry on without vocals until they are necessary and actually add something to the overall feeling of the music. <br /> <br />In my rating system, a record gets 5 stars when I always want to hear the entire record in one sitting, and \\"Signify\\" is one of those.  I don't want to skip a note, and I feel cheated if I can't listen to the whole thing all the way through.  And if I really want to treat myself, I replay the closing track \\"Dark Matter\\" a couple times, when I have the time.

B0002Y4TM4|4.0|I had given Marillion every chance to keep my interest in the post-Fish era, but had found the band to maddeningly inconsistent.  \\"Season's End\\" was pretty good, but included a couple of la-la-la love songs that were completely out of place.  \\"Brave\\" had its moments, in spite of the fact that it just seemed like the band was just trying too hard.  Other than that, there has been nothing in the Hogarth era that I could stomach.  The lyrics had completely deteriorated to over-used metaphors that any heartbroken teenager could have written (i.e. these chains....  yucch.) <br /> <br />In the fall of 2004 Marillion came to Cleveland.  I went to see the show, not knowing they had a new album out (since I had long since stopped paying any attention.)  I figured it would be worthwhile to sit through a few sing-alongs to get a dose of Steve Rothery's masterful guitar work. <br /> <br />As the concert got underway and gained momentum, the two things that completely struck me were that I did not recognize any of the songs, and that I was really really enjoying the show.  I came to the conclusion that these songs must have been the best of the albums that I had never given a proper chance, or had never bought in the first place.  And evidently I wondered this aloud to a stranger next to me, and he was nice enough to bring me up to speed.  What they had been playing was the new album, \\"Marbles,\\" in its entirety.  Really?  This could change everything, I thought to myself.  And that thought had no sooner crossed my mind when the first haunting notes of \\"Neverland\\" washed over the audience.  The song lasted 10 minutes, and at the end I remember trembling as though I had just experienced something spiritual. <br /> <br />The next day I went to the local indie music store and bought my copy of \\"Marbles.\\"  This is a pretty good record.  The first song (\\"The Invisible Man\\") and the last song (\\"Neverland\\") are the strength of the record, both powerful prog rockers featuring changes intempo and volume.  If you have 22 minutes to kill, playing just these two songs at substantial volume would be a wonderful use of your time. <br /> <br />The record also includes a few pop toe-tappers (\\"Don't Hurt Yourself,\\" \\"Fantastic Place\\" and \\"You're Gone\\").  I find that I will listen to these if for no other reason than to allow myself to catch my breath after \\"Invisible Man\\" has ended and waiting for \\"Neverland\\" to start.  If had only the time to listen to the toe-tappers and was not able to hear either or both of the bookends, I would be left feeling cheated. <br /> <br />The rest of the record I tend to skip over.  \\"Marbles I-IV\\" was cute the first time or two, but now seems like an interruption.  \\"Angelina\\" bores me, and \\"Drilling Holes\\" is an irritating bit of noise. <br /> <br />Without \\"The Invisible Man\\" and \\"Neverland,\\" \\"Marbles\\" would still be an improvement over most of the work Marillion has put out in the last 15 years, but that isn't saying much.  With those two songs, and in spite of \\"Drilling Holes,\\" my rating for this record jumps to 4 stars.  Unfortunately, I bought the single disk version at a store instead of the double disk version from the Marillion website (which includes another epic, \\"Ocean Cloud,\\" a fantastic song that I have since heard on their live DVD \\"Marbles on the Road\\").  \\"Marbles\\" would have gotten 4 1/2 stars if \\"Ocean Cloud\\" would have replaced \\"Drilling Holes\\" on the single disk.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I briefly browsed through the reviews, and the most disturbing ones are the people that actually enjoyed this movie, saying that it felt like they were in the room with the torturers. That is disgusting and inhuman. There's nothing wrong with curiosity and empathy and perhaps imagining feeling the pain, but to say that one enjoys it and to praise the actor's performances of getting chopped and sliced is truly one of the most depraved things I've ever read. I would have definitely given this movie 0 stars if I could have. It is pretty much a sick gorefest/killfest, however you want to call it. It teaches a little about human trafficking, but it doesn't present it in a way to enlighten one's mind, and it doesn't implore one to help in any way - the whole thing is for entertainemnt value in the most primitive sense. Point blank, it's just disgusting and pointless. Subjectively, it doesn't even fulfill the goals of a horror movie - it isn't scary or suspenseful in any way. Actually, the only thing horrifying about it is the person or persons that came up with the idea of making it and the people that enjoy such scenes of humans torturing other humans.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This is a stellar version of a beautiful book, my very favorite in fact. Like most people, I am most often very disapointed when novels I love are adapted to the screen This film is one of the rare exceptions. Faithful to the book, Beautifully shot, expertly casted. Ralf Fiennes is the perfect Heathcliff,brooding, morose,obssesive, magnetic, jelous on an almost demented level. Juliet Binoche is Kathy flawlessly, wild and determined, together their chemistry is explosive.<br /><br />Jason Riddington's performance as Hareton Earnshaw is heart breaking. this alone makes the movie worth watching. My only complaint and it's a small one, is that Juliet Binoche plays both Kathy Earshaw and Katherine Linton. It's slightly disconcerting, not to say she doesn't play it well. It's just a little hard to buy. However, it doesn't really hurt the story. This is all and all a fabulous treat of a film, whether you love romance, historical, or dramatic films it's perfct.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It was so superbly high-class with all the beautiful sets, 1900's carriages and recreated buildings that looked so fabulously real. And the music~ Bravo! The wardrobe of the cast was impeccable, Edward Norton did a first rate job, seemingly ever so made for this part and Sophie made a lovely princess that begged a very clever scheme to divert her attention from the villanous Prince Leopold. I loved the scenes where Eisenheim conjured the spirits of people from \\"The other side\\" it was completely thrilling and so realistic. Edward Norton was so handsome in The Illusionist, seems he was born for this part bringing to the screen such taste and elegence, his wardrobe was awesome, completely  like that time period, his hair and demeanor was totally believable he even rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt like they did in that time and his accent was so much that of turn of the century Vienna. I loved the ending as well, Sophie and Eisenheim running off to Prague to a snow-caped mountainous alp-like farm  like The Sound of Music. I had to watch the film twice to figure out all the twists and turns. This picture will grace my film archive with my other treasured films like Cold Mountain and King Kong. This is excellent entertainment for any memeber of the family. For me it is a \\"Must Watch\\" Makes me want to run away and live in Vienna in the early 1900's. I was shocked to learn it only is up for one nomintion at the Academy Awards 2007
B000002UJQ|4.0|Alright, lets get this out of the way before I begin. I was never a huge fan of Radiohead and I'm still not, but I actually found this album to be pretty good. I only ended up listening to it because of a friend of mine kept persuading me after liking \\"Karma Police\\". He kept telling me how \\"amazing\\" it was and I said well hey why not, the single was good. So after work one night I put it on in the car on the way home. I had just left work feeling tired with a headache. I found myself almost absorbed by the music. It was pretty cool, It actually got rid of my headache, and I'm dead serious. Not only was it a pain reliever but It was good music as well. lol. Anyway, I thought it was good so I went out and purchased it later that week. I do however feel that the first half of the cd is a little better than the second. It just seems more intricate early on. My favorite songs would have to be \\"Airbag\\" , \\"Paranoid Android\\", \\"Karma Police\\", and \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\". Here's the track ratings...<br /><br />1. Airbag - 10/10<br />2. Paranoid Android - 10/10<br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien - 9.5/10<br />4. Exit Music (For A Film) - 9/10<br />5. Let Down - 6.5/10<br />6. Karma Police - 10/10<br />8. Electioneering - 9.5/10<br />9. Climbing Up The Walls - 10/10<br />10. No Surprises - 6/10<br />11. Lucky - 9/10<br />12. Tourist, The - 8.5/10<br /><br />Overall: 89% B+<br /><br />Anyway, it was a good album by a band I normally dont listen too. This in my opinion is the bands best stuff as I don't like much of anything else they have done. If you're a fan of the style however I'm sure you will love this. I mean if I just like it, you may just love it.
B00003CWOL|5.0|In this review, I just want to briefly point out what appears to be a very amusing anomaly in the repertoire of George Carlin...  HE ISN'T SWEARING/CURSING!!!  in every stand-up routine of his that I've seen, he spouts foul language in every other sentence.  his performance here is extra good just because of his eerie lack of profanity alone, let alone all of the other marvelous gems, especially when you take into consideration that most of the other characters are swearing like proverbial sailors!
B000GG4KTU|5.0|As others have rightly said, Krall seemed to come terribly close to falling into the banal and mainstream.<br /><br />Girl in the Other Room, a collaboration with husband Elvis C. is an easy listening little record - some really good tunes with a few insightful & skilful moments.<br /><br />Krall feels to have come into what she likes and does best - the genius of Berlin, Heusen, Porter and George and Ira Gershwin.<br /><br />These are incredible songs, lyrics like no other or since, capturing the sad heart, the troubled mind and the pure joy of love.<br /><br />My favourite composers of that era: Richard Rogers & Lorenze Hart with their cruel yet beautiful love song, Little Girl Blue.<br /><br />\\"You can count on raindrops that fall on you...<br /><br />We need little boy blue to cheer up, Little Girl Blue.\\"<br /><br />Bloom and Mercer: Day in Day Out - a classic song wonderfully done by her excellent group of musicians.<br /><br />Krall and her producer, Tommy LiPuma, chose these tunes that suit Krall and also timeless in their composition. She feels comfortable with these songs, relaxed, right at home.<br /><br />This is a record that should be listened to at least a couple of times, absorbing the time and places they were written and first performed.<br /><br />American songbook tunes that will never ever be forgoten.<br /><br />A pleasure - Hey! -'Come and Dance with Me' seeing you across a crowded floor...<br /><br />Great record.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|These women are amazing in that they have the ability to always hit the <br />pitch of the note correctly without sliding up into it as is common. <br />The voices are beautiful and the orchestrations are excellent also. <br />Very pleased with this DVD.
B00000DCH9|4.0|What is all this talk about \\"Ain't No Crime\\" being a weak song?  It's my favorite Billy Joel song ever!  And I've never heard it on the radio.  No one ever talks about it, though I might mention that I haven't read too far in these reviews. I have to say that I think it runs circles around \\"Travelin' Prayer,\\" \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" (with all that Elmer Bernstein western hokum) and \\"You're My Home.\\"  The back-up singers are on fire, the energy is fantastic, the song simply rules!
0743289412|2.0|If I could explain this book with one word it would be this: LONG. Personally if I was the editior I would have shaved off about 200 pages and streamlined it more. I know that may sound strange because most of the best SK novels I've read were very long but they were also very engaging. This story did not grab me and reading the first 300 pages were like treading water.<br /><br />This book, about a successful writer's widow was a bit over run with words that, for me, took away from the story. Words like \\"icunk\\" (still not sure what that means), \\"strap it on\\", \\"bool\\" and especially \\"smuck\\" were used too much. It also felt more like it should have been titled \\"Scott's Story\\" because it came off as a story about widow that had been overshadowed by her husband's successful career and sadly, two years later still was. Very disjointed and slow moving (all Lisey does is talk to herself the first 4 chapters)so much that I had to re-read a few paragraphs just to see where I was at. There was one point in the book where Lisey is remembering when Scott got shot by a crazed fan that made me want to scream. It took 20 pages for him to describe it. Was he trying to write about it like it was happening in slow motion? I kept saying to myself, \\"Get to the point, already Stephen!\\"<br /><br />I miss and long for SK's Shining, Misery, Gerald's Game and Bag of Bones days and wish he would just stick with what he's good at. I would not recommend this book.
B000HIVO64|5.0|I like this album's broad considerations of songs, namely interesting lyrics and pretty interesting musical edges.  I have read some criticism of Scientology, but if the sum exceeds the parts, then the music should be the focus here--I think that some people overreact to the Scientology angle and it detracts from the music (I am not a Scientologist and don't know much about it, granted).  If Scientology's impact on the music is not manipulating someone or causing destruction, then is it any worse than Christianity or Islam, Judaism or Hinduism? Give that some thought in early 2007 [Iraq 2.0, neverending remix] <br /> <br />I saw Beck perform outdoors last Fall or Summer in Downtown LA and it was one of the more entertaining shows at that festival.  Beck is a really interesting artist and I look forward to his artistic growth--I think that many artists make personal choices that aren't manifest in their art.  People should give the guy a break, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br />I have fun listening to the album, so I'll leave it at that.
B000784WMW|2.0|I've watched this adaptation many times, and am always moved by Timothy Daltons performance.  Zelah Clarkes interpretation of this character is VERY ANEMIC. Very poorly cast.  Mr Daltons portrayal of Mr. Rochester was excellent, he gets a full 5 stars, but unfortunately Zelah Clarkes very pale acting for a part that requires such fine tuned emotions fell very, very short of expections for those who love the book and its main character.
0307277887|4.0|I loved the TV series and bought this as a result. As a stand alone book it's very good. Great characters and excellent dialogue. We get a few more specifics on Dexter, including his number of kills. We also learn more about his inner voice.  <br /> <br />It is perhaps unfair to compare this relatively short book with the series. It tells more or less the same story but at a much faster pace. Without any of the subplots that fleshed out the people in Dexters life. None the less there are enough differences and twists to keep you hooked.  <br /> <br />Worth recommending, but fans of the TV series may find it a little disappointing. <br />
0345410025|5.0|The authors present useful, practical explanations and methods of improving memory. When learning how to improve your memory is spelled out as clearly and cogently as they are in this book, their application to the real world becomes self-evident. The authors do a good job of presenting the memory improvement techniques in an easy to read and understand manner that is both useful and practical to all those that are interested in successful mastering their memory. Novices will be provided a path whilst the seasoned practitioners will find affirmation.<br /><br />Of the various books I have read on the subject, I found this to be the best. The book presents a fast and easy way to boost your memory power. I can now better remember names, details, and facts although I still have some way to go to reach perfection. Whether you are trying to remember names, phone numbers, dates, appointments, lists, or other items, it is easy once you have mastered the techniques presented in the book.<br /><br />The book will not result in instant memory improvement, but does provide the reader with the tools and techniques to remember anything you have a desire to recall. Within a short time (say two weeks) you can gain enough expertise to have a considerably better memory. If you are serious enough to master the techniques then they will serve you the rest of your life (although you need to keep reviewing regularly to prevent memory decay) and you will be sure to astound others with your ability to recall just about anything you desire to remember.<br /><br />This is a practical book that I return to often. This is a valuable book for anyone who is having problems in remembering things.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I would give this album 6 stars. Harvest is great, yes. After the Gold Rush, Tonights the Night, the list of epic Neil Young albums could go on for days, but nothing is as complete as On the Beach. I can't say enough about this album. If I ever have children, this will be the first thing they hear. And maybe the only thing. There is no better album. If you fancy yourself a Neil Young fan, you don't need to think twice about purchasing this album. It will make your day again and again.

B00008BXJG|5.0|It's great to know that our young kids are still listening to the music of our generation.  Is there truly \\"nothing new under the sun?\\"  There is so much that my 14-year old likes that was popular when I was growing up, it makes a nice way to cross a bridge and bond.  Although he may play it a little louder than I now would, I can still remember Mom yelling at me to \\"turn it down, you'll damage your eardrums.\\" It must be true, my 14-year old hardly hears (pays attention to) some things I say?????<br /><br />Oh yeah, back to AC/DC. While this may not be my favorite of their albums, it has some great cuts, like \\"Shot Down in Flames.\\"  It still transports the listener.  Walk All Over You\\" is consummate AC/DC, and Angus melts the notes at every turn.  And, what would AC/DC be without its definitive signature song of \\"Highway to Hell?\\"  Well, they'd still be a great band and I'd still be buying their albums!!?  Highly recommended for all ages, but remember to share it with your parents!

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Very good, the best of any Batman movie in my opinion.  Christian Bale is fabulous. <br /> <br />
B000ETQPYM|2.0|The premise for the story is good.  But, the writing is amateurish, too silly and not believable.  Worse, there is no character development.  Got halfway through and couldn't finish it.  There are too many good writers to spend time with this one.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Over the years I have grown to know all Yanni's musicians by name, as he picks out the world's BEST, no doubt about it! I missed Charlie Adams playing drums on the Tribute tour but he is back!  When this concert started I was shocked not to see Karen Griggs on violin. But these violinists were equally amazing. That one guy  hit a high note that I know no violin has ever hit before!! And Yanni can make the most obscure instruments the center of his music! The hammered dulcimer. I LOVE it! The digeridoo (??) COOL! But that guy with the harp! You know, the \\"heavenly angel\\" instrument? Yea, right! You have to SEE this guy play! I still think Tribute will always be my favorite tour, if only for the Niki Nana song but the performances in this show are unsurpassed. Yanni's concerts almost need to be SEEN to be appreciated. I thought the laser light show was a bit over the top though.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This is a more melodic approach than SOAD's first album. It mixes elements of metal with melodic softer parts in the majority of songs, and these are the strongest. 'Chic n stu' has a melodic soft section, which makes the song shine, 'Mr Jack' is one of the slower and instantly likeable songs. The last six songs are really effective. 'Highway song' is extremely melodic and 'f@ck the system' is straight ahead metal, but effective. 'Ego brain' has a nice eastern feel and mixes tuneful with heavier parts. 'Streamline' has excellent ascending and amazing vocal passages, with orchestral overtones. 'Roulette' is an acoustic driven ballad. The melody and backing guitars/violins is exceptional, but the vocals are completely out of tune, the higher vocals are comletely flat ruining the effects and listen to the very end where they both sing 'around you' the high voice goes at least a semi tone out of key, and Serj seems to run out of breath and does an uneccessary pitch wobble. This is clearly a demo, and should have been polished more, as it would have been a standout. <br />'36', 'Pictures' and 'A.D.D.' are rather heavy and unmelodic.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|It pretty much stuck to the \\"original\\" King Kong storyline!  You just couldn't help but love/feel sorry the big gorilla! :)
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I'll admit, Love.Angel.Music.Baby. was a better album.  It took some growing on me, but this CD has fufilled the Gwen dance craze once again. Providing poppy songs like \\"Orange County Girl\\", \\"Sweet Escape feat. Akon\\" (&lt;--which btw is the best song on the album), and \\"Wind It Up\\", you can really move to them and fulfill the clubbanger in you.  Other songs like \\"Yummy\\" are pretty humorous, in the sense that she pokes fun at herself, (something she also does in \\"Orange County Girl\\").  The best heart-felt songs, never lacking from a Gwen album (like \\"Cool\\" from LAMB), are right up there matched greatly with her unique vocals like in \\"4 In The Morning\\".  It is definitely a buy for good 2007 music.
1573229725|5.0|I have read everything Sarah Waters has written and FINGERSMITH is, by far the very best.  This is a good uncorsetted Victorian romp in three parts with twists and turns that make the reader backup to be sure not a word was missed.  The best part is simply finding wout what happens next.  An excellent read.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|This film is about a dysfunctional family who travels together in a van to California to take their 8 year old daughter to a Little Miss Sunshine children's pageant. The grandpa is a coke addict, the father is a failed motivational speaker (an oxymoron in itself), the rebellious son has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of becoming an Air Force pilot, the mom is a loving provider who is trying mightily to hold the family together, and her brother is a professor who failed in trying to kill himself over a gay relationship with a grad student gone sour. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, there's the girl, who on first glance seems to be the most \\"normal\\" of the bunch. Over the course of the film, the characters learn that it's OK to be yourself, to chase after your dreams, and who cares what other people think. The film has a lot of bad language, and the grandfather in particular passes a lot of advice to his grandson that is downright immoral, but the overall message of Little Miss Sunshine is a positive one: Don't let others stand in the way of your dreams. Be yourself. Be true to you.  <br /> <br />I liked the movie, but the characters are a little grating at timers, except the darling Olive. Recommended for mature audiences.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|I have listened to this album straight about 5 times.  Now I am not the biggest Eminem fan nor am I the Biggest 50 Cent fan but I can appreciate this album.  It has diversity of artist and production.  It does exactly what it was created and that is to show off the new Blood and also give shine to the entire Shady/Aftermath artist.  Now not every artist on the Label is on it but D-12 (Including a snippet from Proof R.I.P), Obie Trice, \\"Mix tape Savage\\" Stat Quo, and new artist Bobby Creekwater and Cashis.  The songs are good enough to listen to from beginning to end.  There are obviously some tracks that are not as good like some of the track by new artist Bobby Creekwater and Cashis but this is strong attributed to the fact I personally haven't heard much of their material but they all carry their flow well and this is a fair showing on their behalf.  I don't normally write review but after reading some of these I gotta comment \\"I would rather buy Justing Timberlake or K-F%d\\"  First off Justin Timberlakes album is amazing musicly that kid is doing amazing things to disrespect him in the same line or even the same discussion with K-F%d show you really are missing a point. And the other review about Buying Ghost Face is right this album is a commercial release and is not Grimey Gritty street banger like Pretty Tony's album Supreme Clientele not Fish Scale.  So to the hardcore rap fan who loves strong lyrics and doesn't care for production or huge names there is still some stuff to appreciate.  Check my Rap sheets I love hip-Hop this is not the strongest showing of the new year but it is definitely a decent showing of Shady and the diversity if its Artist.  4 Stars it was better than average and it worth the buy to listen to some artist Spit some decent music that carry a beat and have a flow. It is worth the pick up. Listen to the snippets of the songs and you will find yourself bumping your head and after that open your ears and listen to the lyrics Fifty and Em haven't fallen off as others would accuse and Obie Is so underrated its a crime.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen many versions of Jane Eyre and I have to say none of them have left me a sense that Jane was in the same eschelon as Elizabeth Bennett or Anne Elliot until now.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens have brought true life into these dark stade characters.  I'm glad Rochester is not brooding and angy all the time.  He has a huge heart, ego, and sense of humor besides the darkness within.  Jane is passionate, lively, and strong despite the horrors of her childhood.  To see the two become kindred spirits and watch the sparks fly was incredible.  I'm glad that for once the \\"polite wooing\\" of other victorian productions was set to the side to show two people passionatly kissing and holding eachother.  I know that some liberties were taken from the book but I feel over all this production kept the feel of the story.  I'd rather see these liberties taken than in the recent 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice.  I'm sorry Elizabeth Bennett would never talk back to her parents, walk around Mr. Collins' house in her nightgown, and Bingly would not just walk into a female guest's room while she's in her nighty. I can go on and on about how horrible that movie is.   A production is bad when you agree with Lady Catherine de Bourgh \\"Are the shades of Pemberly to be thus polluted?\\"   <br />Here here to the BBC for giving us a Jane and Rochester I can believe and relate to.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I'm going to go against the flow, and risk getting flamed, by saying I think the movie is better than the series.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the series, and was upset when it got cancelled.  I own the box set.  However, I think that by wrapping things up in the theatrical format made Whedon focus more on the nuts and bolts of his story, and gave us a very tightly written and intensely satisfying film. <br /> <br />Yes, a lot of scenes in the movie could have been drawn out for weeks in a series, but then it would have felt like a lot of filler/fluff was put in place where it wasn't needed.   <br /> <br />I equate this movie to a modern day Star Wars.  It was done on a shoestring budget.  It has the edgie feel that Star Wars had when it first came out.  It surpassed most peoples expectations in quality and viewing enjoyment. <br /> <br />Serenity is similar enough to other sci-fi movies to make the viewer comfortable, yet original enough to keep the viewer engaged. <br /> <br />I love this movie, and I think any true sci-fi fan will as well.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Watched the second half of the two part of Jane Eyre this evening. I am a big fan of BBC period dramas. This one caught my eye and I am glad I watched it. Both the castle and location was incredible and the perfect atmosphere. The acting was incredible. BBC dramas always seem to have top notch actors and actresses and always finding new talents to keep things fresh. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens had a believable chemistry for the story. He is older and brooding from his disappointing life and she is young, very self conscious, and sad. Somehow these two people so very different and opposites end up finding kindred spirits in each other. It was a coming of age for Jane but my attention was on how Edward Rochester changed and grew so very much himself. I was fascinated watching this very self absorbed, mistrusting, angry man slowly change and eventually allow himself to trust and love in another person with all his heart. For this very strong man to break down and beg Jane to stay throwing away his pride and arrogance really touched me. When he cried I believed him.   This I will have to buy along with Pride and Prejudice (another favorite). Bravo BBC. Keep making these classic quality movies for us to enjoy.
B000001GXI|4.0|I'm going to limit my comments to Roberta Peters. Hers is the sort of voice I want to hear as The Queen. I have no idea what Mozart wanted but I can't believe he wanted a fairy-piper sort of sound. I'm not denigrating Koeth nor Battle, nor... nor.... nor.<br /><br />For me, I want Peters, a more determined Queen, not a light sound. Alan Blyth finds her sound not to his liking. Okay, I do. I want a Queen with GUTS.
0061150142|5.0|Two families were the closest of friends.  Their children, Christopher Harte and Emily Gold, both age 17, had grown up together and started dating each other at age 13.  On one fateful night, that all changed when Emily is found dead from a gunshot wound and Chris claims it was a suicide pact.  The prosecutor claims murder and now these two supposedly ideal families will be ripped apart as they grapple with what happened and why. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult's powerful story will leave the reader reeling from the overwhelming emotions conveyed.  Ms. Picoult demonstrates a solid grasp of her subject matter as her characters struggle with the notion of Emily's suicide versus Chris being her murderer.  THE PACT: A LOVE STORY is thought provoking, albeit painful at times. <br /> <br />     Jodi Picoult deftly interweaves the past and present in this poignant family drama.  Suicide is an extremely sensitive subject and this topic may disturb some readers.  Ms. Picoult handles the topic exceptionally well, however, remaining sensitive to all of the issues and parties involved in THE PACT: A LOVE STORY. <br /> <br />     THE PACT: A LOVE STORY is not an easy read, but it is a book well worth reading more for the questions Ms. Picoult asks than for any real answers.  As the story unfolds, readers will find themselves completely immersed into this deeply moving and heart wrenching tale.  THE PACT: A LOVE STORY is a very realistic portrayal of the aftermath of a suicide, particularly one under such questionable circumstances, and as such will be both loved and hated at the same time.  Kudos to Ms. Picoult for daring to venture into this territory and for being so compassionate in the process. <br /> <br />COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES
B000E33VWW|4.0|As a reporter for the *New Yorker*, Truman Capote boards a train to Holcomb, Kansas to report on a horrible crime where an entire family was murdered.  He is joined by his assistant and best friend, Nelle Harper Lee, who later wrote *To Kill a Mockingbird*.<br /><br />Perry Smith and Richard Hickock were soon captured in Las Vegas and brought back to Holcome to answer for the murders.  Capote befriends them both to write his article.  However, Capote develops some chemistry with Smith and decides to write a book instead.<br /><br />This goal to write a book causes a strain on Capote's relationship with his lover, who was also a writer.  Anyways, the relationship between Capote and Smith is interesting.  Capote needs Smith to retell the night of the murder.  Instead, Smith talks about everything else.  In retaliation, Capote withholds information whenver Smith inquires about the book.<br /><br />It takes Capote four years to write this book.  Initially, Capote is excited about this prospect.  However, as time goes by, he becomes depressed, especially when Smith and Hickock lose their appeal, with the Supreme Court, from execution.  He's so depressed that can't even put aside his feelings and offer congratulations to Lee on her new novel.<br /><br />When all is done, Capote manages to complete his book, *In Cold Blood*.  He never wrote another book afterwards.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman did a good job as Capote.  I liked him the moment I first saw him in *Talented Mr. Ripley*.  He has never disappointed me since.  This was indeed his best film yet.
1569242739|5.0|Well, I got the cookbook yesterday in the mail, went to Whole Foods that night for ingredients, and made wonderful cupcakes when I got home.  They turned out fantastic.  Even if the cookbook didn't have it's delightful humor and beautiful images it would still be a fabulous cookbook. <br /> <br />Now months ago when I heard about Vegan Cupcakes Take over the World I dismissed it even though I had heard all positive reviews.  It seemed like a cookbook with too small a niche to ever be useful.  Am I ever going to need that many cupcake recipes?  But then after the New York Times review I said to myself, 'ok, enough.  apparently I need to have this book.'  And then...it was mine.  Although you will only find cupcake recipes in there, they are fabulous and there are so many different kinds that you can appease any craving.   <br /> <br />I also bought it so that when I go to my husbands family events I can bring these precious vegan cupcakes and feel like a little piece of myself is represented amongst the dairy colony of other deserts. <br /> <br />My recommendation to someone who buys this book is to treat yourself to good ingrediants. Don't buy the cheapest vanilla extract- buy a good vanilla extract.  Take pleasure in making your cupcakes.  And then take even more pleasure in sharing them and eating them.  Whether you eat dairy or not, these cupcakes rock.

I can see the power of The Secret manifesting itself in my life all the time.<br /><br />Edited to add: I guess I was feeling a bit more positive back then. After a year of trying to apply the methods in my life, not much has changed.
B000001F2E|5.0|I recall once telling Mike Godwin that this was one of my favorite albums, to which his reply was, \\"But you can't dance to it.\\" I'm not sure if he was being facetious at the time, referring of course to the traditional rating comment on American Bandstand, but it's a comment that's lived with me to this day. Of course you can't dance to Rush--it's progressive, \\"arty,\\" rock, that's meant to be listened to, and somewhat closely at that, kind of like Take Five in the jazz world. Moving Pictures is Rush at their best, full of time and key changes, masterful interplay between lead and bass guitar, innovative synth sounds and production, and the best drumming in modern rock. While Geddy Lee's high-pitched nasally voice is not for all, this is an album where his screetches are somewhat muted, and he often sings in mid-range rather than the higher register that characterized earlier albums (as he has aged, he's lowered the range at which he sings on each successive Rush album it seems). The lyrics are an overview of the classic Rush themes: science fiction (\\"Red Barchetta\\"), the disillusionment of youth (\\"Tom Sawyer\\"), fantasy (\\"Witch Hunt\\"), science (\\"Vital Signs\\"), fame or the life of an artist (or at least, being in the spotlight, as in \\"The Camera Eye\\" and \\"Limelight\\"). Nothing was that new here, in comparison to Rush's previous albums, but here it was presented in more manageable chunks (unlike, say, the Cygnus tunes that take up entire LP sides) with radio-friendly production.<br /><br />\\"Tom Sawyer\\" is probably the most played Rush song and it sounds as fresh today as when I first heard it in the 80s. The lyrics are nonsensical to some degree, almost as much as \\"Burning Down the House\\" by Talking Heads, another big some of the time, where the lyrics are more of a style than necessarily trying to tell a story or make a point. For Rush, that was something of a novelty. Most of Neil Peart's lyricism was based on stories, such as the previously mentioned Cygnus songs, or the side-long epic \\"2112.\\" When they didn't tell stories, they were fairly clear what the songs were about, such as \\"Spirit of Radio\\" being about the business of music radio or \\"The Trees\\" being a warning about bigotry. But there are moments of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" where you just wonder what the hell Peart was smoking to come up with \\"The world is, the world is/Love and life are deep/Maybe as his skies are wide.\\" But the song works, and the sense you get from it is that Tom, Mark Twain's rebel child, still exists today.<br /><br />Much more like their normal songs is \\"Red Barchetta,\\" based on a science fiction story. In it, the protagonist talks about escaping the stultifying confines of the modern city to escape to his uncle's farm in the country, where his uncle keeps an old automobile that the protagonist then takes out, \\"commit[ing] his weekly crime.\\" It's basically the same story as \\"2112,\\" except made much more palatable by not being about music, but about cars, and clocking in at a decent Album Oriented Rock single time limit. The chase sequence between the government aircars and the old automobile gives Lee and Alex Lifeson another opportunity to play dueling guitars, something they've liked to do since \\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\\" from the Fly By Night album.<br /><br />\\"YYZ,\\" the instrumental on the album, is named after the airport code for Toronto Pearson International Airport, a code that Rush, being Canadian, were always happy to see, because it meant they were headed home. What's interesting about the opening to it is that the guitar part plays out the letters YYZ in morse code. \\"Limelight\\" and \\"The Camera Eye\\" are companion pieces of a sort, although the former talks about being the focus of the camera while the latter is a descriptive piece that tries to put into words what is being caught by the camera as it is being used. Of the songs on this album, \\"The Camera Eye\\" is probably my least favorite, but that's really no fault of its own, but just how it palesin comparison to the other six songs.<br /><br />The final two songs are as strong as the opening two. \\"Witch Hunt\\" repeats a motif originally used by Peart in the Cygnus pair, wherein he compares something in the past to something in the present. Here, the Salem witch trials to modern discrimination. It's pretentious and would have collapsed under its conceit if not for the moody nature of the music that fits the general paranoia and tension that Peart is trying to say go hand-in-hand between the two time periods. (Interestingly enough, for a band and an album that has always been the bane of the Christian right--something about their pentangle in a circle symbol has always made the more paranoid fundamentalists brand Rush as a satanic band--this is the only song on the album that refers to anything actually otherworldly. Most of the songs are about technology or modern life, not cavorting demons.) The album ends with \\"Vital Signs,\\" which should have been as big a hit as \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" and is one of my all-time favorite Rush tracks. It begins with a repeated synthesizer sequence that musically represents a EKG graph, with a very stacatto Lifeson guitar part. The lyrics are wonderful, with some quite strange words being placed together in a rock song, such as in the opening, \\"Unstable condition/A symptom of life/In mental and environmental change/Atmospheric disturbance/The feverish flux/Of human interface and interchange.\\" This is a far cry from what rock and roll was originally about--i.e., sex, or at least romance--and for me typifies why I was drawn to them, because they weren't afraid to be intelligent.<br /><br />This is an album that I've listened to since high school, and it has continued to hold up for me over the years. While I can still listen to many of the other bands that I first started listening to at that time, including Styx, Journey, Genesis, and Yes, I consider many of those guilty pleasures, perhaps not something I'd mention as a favorite to a new acquaintance. I'm not embarrassed by this album, though. Genesis and Yes may have had the same musicianship and intelligence, but their songs didn't have the hooks that Rush had, and while Styx and Journey may have had the hooks, their music is actually quite simple and formulaic, more obvious in retrospect than it was for me at the time.

B000LPQ6DE|2.0|The most blatant flaw with this production was the casting:  The handsome Toby Stephens (like the gorgeous Timothy Dalton in the earlier BBC production) is totally inappropriate because Bronte depicts Rochester as an ugly, Vulcan-like man of medium height.  (Also, Stephens' acting (he's not convincing as a man who has lived in empty misery for 15 years) is mediocre, so he's not credible on that score, either.)  In the novel Jane is a small woman with irregular features.  Ruth Wilson is a tall beauty.  One of the things Rochester and Jane understand about one another is how it feels to be considered ugly relative to the population at large.  As a couple, Wilson and Stephens would easily fit in at a Hollywood party.  Clearly the idolatry of the modern age influenced the director, who, given the BBC's reputation for quality television should have known better.  The cynical view is that Stephens' status as the son of renowned British actress Dame Maggie Smith influenced his casting.     A lot of time was spent highlighting the romance scenes between Rochester and Jane, Celine and Rochester, St. John and Miss Oliver, and even Bertha and Rochester. I believe this was done to attract young women viewers who will love these scenes -- and buy the DVD.  We don't, however, see much of (1) Bronte's criticism of the Church (i.e., St. John's coldness of heart, and its inconsistency with Jesus' character, or Mr. Brocklehurst's cruelty), or (2) the persistence of good in an evil environment (as displayed in Bessie, Ms. Temple, Helen Burns), both major themes in the novel.  Clearly, commercial appeal won out over artistic quality and the author's intent.    Though the production is not embarrassing (notwithstanding the acting of several characters is not of the caliber one expects in a BBC production), it is disappointing in its blatant refusal to honor the key features of the novel (i.e., ugly people can find love, too; hypocrisy and cruelty in the Church of England; child abuse; Christian duty to do right when life has been hard).  (Again, these themes won't sell DVDs.) The Sorcha Cusack/Michael Jayston production (1973) is the most faithful to the novel and an absolute delight to watch.  This and the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke production are the best versions of the great story.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and look forward to many more.  Bond became a real person in this one.  Gadgets were left on hold for most purposes and the person that Bond is evolves.  You feel he has entered a world where there is no one else but him to do the job.  How it ends was a surprise.  Craig did the job perfectly.  Renewed my long lost interest in the character.  I look forward to the next!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I was very surprised at the different songs he sung on this album.  I love Lady Blacksmith Mambazo, and when I heard them singing with Josh, well, absolutely fabulous.  Every song on this album evokes a different emotion and feeling.  And I recommend this album to anyone who likes to listen to different genres.  This album makes you aware that music can speak to you in different ways.
0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama is a powerful new blip on the screen of the American Dream.  His clarity, insightful and even-handed approach to what this country was meant to be and can be, is fresh and welcome by this reviewer.  Sen. Obama may or may not run for President in 2008, but he should. He presents a clear head on bi-partisan politics.  However, be that as it may, ANYONE who is concerned as to where this country is headed should read this book.   <br /> <br />Black, white, red, yellow, brown, rich, poor, upper-middle or middle-lower we all have a stake in what happens next and from what I get from the book we all need to get a paddle and start paddeling.  Obama has me seeing that. although the politicians are making the decisions,  we are the ones with the choices and if we don't start choosing now, we may have to look for a new definitions for the USA.   <br /> <br />A powerful, insightful and thoughtful book that is easy to read and makes you want to vote again.
B000002GIE|3.0|OK, if your reading this review you probably know the Extreme story to some extent, how they started off as a fairly generic but fun hair metal mob and wound up going on a journey into far more interesting (intellectually and musically) areas that were, alas, barren of commercial payoffs.<br /><br />So what do we get on this debut?<br /><br />Firstly you get a huge pop metal supernova with musical ability above the norm for this sort of dross. Led of course by the obscenely talented Mr Nuno Bettencourt and the super smooth vocalisations of Gary Cherone. And bonus points to the band for producing a few tracks themselves, though most of the tunes on offer here were knob-jobbed by someone or something going by the name of Mack. Um yeah whatever.....<br /><br />Secondly as the album unfolds you realise that the band have played to their strenght, which increases the listeners respect. Tunes like Wind Me Up are good time party rockers and along with tunes like Kid Ego are what the prospective listener should try to listen to a sample of before buying this disc as they so perfectly encapsulate the happy happy joy joy metal the band were purveying at this point in their career. And the funky touches provided by the rhythm section with tasty intrusions by Nunos guitar are well done, though funk may not be to everyones taste. A good example of this toe tapping inducing funk side to the band would be Teachers Pet.<br /><br />But as much as I enjoyed a number of Extreme releases and have always kicked myself for missing them live (did catch a Nuno solo tour though) there are a couple of downsides to this album.<br /><br />These would include the slightly too juvenile approach. Stuff like Little Girls is a bit embarrassing and some of the other tunes walk just to the wrong side of the very thin line between cool silly and uncool silly such as Big Boys Don't Cry. All through the album I find myself hankering for their more accomplished Pornograffiti album.<br /><br />If your an Extreme fan you really should pick this up. It shows a band struggling against the limitations of their chosen genre, partying on and actually offering something a little different from some of their competitors of the time. It's all well played and it's always a pleasure to hear the blazing six string of Nuno who is on particularly fine form on Kid Ego and Play With Me - the latter a perfect example of everything that is right and wrong with this album (and was actually featured on the first Bill & Ted's movie soundtrack).>If your an Extreme fan you really should pick this up.

0307237699|5.0|The buzz surrounding Senator Barak Obama seems reminiscent of the combined excitement for John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. In this articulate manifesto, Obama shows he can do more than deliver fine speeches. He can deliver the goods intellectually and emotionally.  From a philosophical, political and even literary perspective, Obama seems to be the real deal.<br /><br />The most significant element of his book, in my view, is Obama's insistence that hope must have a pragmatic basis. His repetition of this theme seems a bit pedantic, at times, and his devotion to realism may frustrate the idealists who would have the world transformed in an instant. Obama makes it clear, however, that magical thinking will not feed the hungry, house the homeless, uplift the downtrodden, or bring peace to our war-ravaged world.<br /><br />Obama's emphasis on grounded hope mirrors the practical idealism in my own book, Global Sense. Where I'm talking about how our natural global interactivity empowers each of us to change the world by changing our daily choices, Obama goes into specifics on those daily choices. He shows us where we can take concrete actions to produce concrete results.<br /><br />For those who want a rescuer to save them, Obama echoes the sentiments of John Kennedy that here on earth, God's work must truly be our own. For those who want to idolize Obama and make him their savior, he says they need to find within the hope and faith to save themselves.<br /><br />So, if you are willing to claim your individual power and do the daily work of personal and social transformation, Obama's book will inspire you to go out and do what you already know inside must be done. He's written a good book. Now it's our turn to prove that his trust in our courage is justified.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|Hugh Jackman could breathe life into the new James Bond as Pierce Brosnan did during his Bond reign! Daniel Craig is a bland dummy- just a cardboard character actor and Hugh Jackman would have been eye candy! <br /> I say let's see Hugh Jackman in a jet pack as Bond in a precredit action sequence over Seattle's Space Needle! Bring back Michelle Yeoh as Chinese agent Wai Lin and team up with Bond to stop General Chang(from Tomorrow Never Dies- he escaped from Beijing when Eliott Carver(Jonathan Pryce) could make him the next Premier of China by bombing Beijing with a nuclear missile from his stealth boat! Have General Chang have a new ambition on invading Taiwan! What a great movie that would be!

But as she walks around the neighborhood, she discovers all the strange things happening to the housewives in the neighborhood including a naked woman in the bush, a sexy car washer who intentionally soaks her breast to get attention, a neighbor burying a corpse, a mother yelling at her spoiled children, a housewife having sex with an underage gardener, and a note that says \\"I know what you did. it makes me sick. I am going to tell.\\" Oprah thinks the note was intended for her and says to her husband \\"Oh my God, somebody knows what we buried under the jacuzzi back in Chicago\\" and get the hell out of Wyteria Lane. I think that gotta be the funniest episode of all. Ha ha ha. You guys should see it!
B000HCO83Q|5.0|Well, what can I say. Awesome from start to finish. <br /> <br />Of the 3 movies, I would say that this one ranks well above the 2nd yet trailing the 3rd. For those true XMen fans, you will find some discrepencies between the comic book character of the Phoenix and the Phoenix portrayed in the movie.  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the movie holds its entertainement value and is certainly 5 stars. Even good people die (Don't worry...I won't say who;-) )!!! And what can you say about the Juggernaut...true to his form. <br /> <br />If you have not yet seen the first 2 XMen, make sure that you do before seeing this one as you will find yourself asking questions throughout. <br /> <br />A must see for all action/adventure fans!!
0060934913|2.0|Kitchen Confidential seems to inspire two camps: a smaller admiring group, and a majority crew who find Mr. Bourdain boorish and irritating. Count me among the eye rollers.     As evidenced by his no-slouch-here writing, Mr. Bourdain seems to have a brain. Therefore, the book's big page-turner question is: *why doesn't he use it?* We keep expecting him to wake up from this macho posturing (that borders on self parody) and say *ah ha! catharsis time*. I read the book the whole way through and kept hoping for the turn, as they say in Texas Hold em. Surely this chef guy is going to hit some unexpected twist in his cook's tale and realize there's a larger vision of all this kitchen locker-room BS.    But rather than moving to a higher level, the book just spiraled downward. From hints dropped, we gather that the oh-so-busy Mr. Bourdain writes his books on his one day off from the restaurant. It has the feel of one foot in front of another, like an all-night march (it's he who loves to invoke military metaphors for his approach to kitchen management), wake up, pull on the boots, what chapter will it be today? We need a general in charge of this operation.    I'm not asking that Bourdain become the spokesman for NA and start playing Japanese bamboo flute on his kitchen's PA instead of Led Zepplin. But if your credo is drugs, sex, and rock n roll, after a while, we're ready for more than just concert footage. We want some writerly insight -it can be Lou Reed writerly, or Henry Rollins writerly, but just *some kind* of writer however-outlaw-- who can help us understand why this life that most of the country regards as a crazed waste actually has some redeeming grace. But Bourdain just hauls out another \\"simulated corpse in the deep freeze\\" anecdote, some more frat house humor, and we're left wondering ...    Bourdain has become enraptured with portraying himself as a sort of chef anti-hero, a Gingerman of the kitchen. (When I look at his cover photo, looking all serious with his chef's whites and knife, I think - *aren't you embarrassed? *) If he was just a schlock wordsman, I wouldn't take the trouble to complain - the dude doesn't have the chops, oh well. But he's a good enough writer (and you'll note just about every last negative commentator finished the book, myself included) that we expect more.    There is a sweet-and-sour pleasure in having the lofty terrain of the upscale kitchen revealed to be the bawdy and, at times, far from appetizing place Bourdain portrays. But this sardonic friction is not enough to carry an entire book; the naughty-boy nose-thumbing only takes us so far. (Also, on an entirely different note, Bourdain seems completely uninterested in the value of food as a component of health.)    Bourdain is at his best in Kerouac-esque descriptions of the first real kitchen crew he aspired to join, in party-hardy Provincetown. His rollicking portrayal of that pirate crew is rich and gargantuan, and the hyperbole appropriate since this is understood to be seen through awestruck teenage eyes. But the book's unstated theme seems to be \\"I can be just as badass as those guys. I can! I can! I can!\\" To which this reader's response is, \\"OK you can, big deal.\\"
0380002930|5.0|I didn't read the book first.  I saw an animated version of the book back in the early eighties.  When I saw this version as a child it kind of scared me, especially the bloody scenes with the dog and the mean rabbits.  But still I was mesmerized.  This story has a spiritual quality unlike children's books I've read before.  I felt my soul was being fed when I read some of the rabbit myths in the book.  The ending was incredible.  Reminded me that like humans, animals have a place in the hereafter.  This was actually the third book that I've read more than twice by myself.  Excellent use of myth, legends, character development and adventure.
0679746323|5.0|It is quite apparent from looking at some of the comments in this forum that pro Chinese Government or pro Maoists have launched a rather infantile campaign to discredit this book. Reviewers who criticise the book - even when using vacuous non existant insight or tortured logic (like women got equal rights) somehow get 80% positive feed back and readers who praise the book - regardless as to the quality of their comments get 80% negative. Thus Amazon - as a source of objective feed back has been compromised. Therefore any one trying to figure out whether they should read this book should rely more heavily upon the professional critics of major newpapers etc.    That being said, this is an extraordinary tale. A must read. This story puts so much of the 20th Century history into a new perspective and the moral of the tale must be that we all need to be better informed - especially our Governments when it comes to foreign policy.    I have reviewed the criticism - and much nonsense has been espoused. This is an easy book to read and once it gets going, really grabs ones attention. If gruesome torture took place - then I want to know about it!     The only type of criticism that would have any relevance would be to suggest that the book is significantly inacurate. On this score the only specific issue raised, being the refutation of the claim that a certain Nationalist General was a Communist spy. The evidence provided by the book, though mainly circumstantial seemed perfectly rational. But I can not claim to know the answer. However because the critic focused on that one issue and did not provide any substance - I am inclined to discard that specific criticism.     On so many issues such as Chiang not destroying the Red Army etc - the evidence seemed overwhelming.    Therefore the efforts, in this forum atleast, to discredit the  avalanche of researched material appear to have insignificant substance. Thus - like a Scientific theory that is not disproved, the assertions against Mao still hold true.    If the assertions against Mao hold true, then the Chinese Government must recant before they can go forward. A society built upon a lie - is not a society that the world community can trust. This is also a lesson for the American people, in that the Iraq war was built upon a lie and until America recants - the world community will not be interested in hearing what America has to say.    Is there any evidence that any of Mao's family, his wives or close collaberators had any thing positive to say about him? Surely he did starve his people while giving away food and focusing on weapons programs? Who was not scared of this man? Who gained after his decades of rule? At what point did he show concern about the peasants?     Atleast Hitler did not try and destroy everyone. He was no doubt quite fond his of the kids in the Hitler youth, amongst others. Who did Mao care about? Defending Mao would appear to a kin to claiming the Holocaust did not happen. If the book is a poor portrayal - show me some grouping that would relish his return. The authors have apparently devoted a huge effort in uncovering who Mao was - so I will await a critic that can come close to providing a rebuttal with substance. The themes running through the book stand tall.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Since there are already 203 reviews of \\"Miller's Crossing here,\\" I'll skip the plot summaries, raves about performances, references to Dashiell Hammett, etc., knowing the odds of my repeating at least one review on file are better than they are that one of Tom's bets will finally come in. <br /> <br />I'll save you some time: If you want a traditional shoot 'em up crime pic, all action and no brains,  <br />keep walking. This ain't your picture. <br /> <br />I mean, this is a great gangster movie, make no mistake about it. It's got all the necessary ingredients: lots of violence (explosions, machine guns, arson), exuberantly shot; multiple, incestuous betrayals (professional, romantic, sexual); even a little love . . . . But none to spare. Nobody will ever accuse this movie of sentimentality. <br /> <br />Miller's Crossing is definitely more aimed at the head than the heart. That said, the film has some real emotional depth, with bonds of all sorts--professional, familial, romantic--straining, twisting, crossing, breaking, doublecrossing. There's a lot more feeling here than is obvious at first glance. <br /> <br />But the Coens are, as is their wont, riffing on a genre. They write characters like Johnny Casper (Jon Polito), a choleric little fireplug who muses about the nature of right and wrong (\\"an interesting ethical question . . . \\") as he's sending his lieutenants out to murder his enemies or, when things get out of hand, doing the job himself.  <br /> <br />Also, Joel and Ethan are so in love with the gorgeous lingo of the hard-boiled period gangster pic that they make it a featured player. If you share their love of language in general, and American slang in particular, Miller's Crossing will thrill you with its virtuosic wordplay. <br /> <br />Here's a question: How many times does world-weary Tom (Gabriel Byrne), the still water at the center of Miller's Crossing, get beat up? And how many times does he lose his hat? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
030716327X|5.0|This book, especially with the Plush bunny, makes a great gift for a newborn. My daughter and I chose together to purchase the set. We shared some wonderful memories of reading it together and doing the activities in it when she was young (she just turned 22) and we thought that other mothers and daughters would also enjoy sharing it. The toy gives it another part and we thought it was a very authentic representation of the bunny in the book. It makes the gift even more appealing.
0743298020|5.0|Take it from a true lover of literature...this is the most captivating and well written work of fiction by a contemporary author in many many years. It is no small feat for a new author to be compared to the likes of Jane Austen and the Bronte sister, but Setterfield delivers! I was not able to put this book down and read it in two sittings! The use of language in this book is absolutely beautiful. The experience of reading this novel can only be compared to an art lover seeing a Monet for the fist time. A must read.  <br /> <br />
0312995423|3.0|I picked up this book because I had read the DaVinci Code and I found Dan Brown's style of writing to be entertaining and he brought in new ideas that challenged you to defend what you believe. This book however did not live up to expectations. <br /> <br />I won't go into too much detail regarding the plot since others have, only enough to say it is about the NSA's cryptography department and an unbreakable encryption algorithm that will prevent anyone from being able to read items encrypted with it. <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, this plot by itself is intrigueing but Brown fails to delve into the dilemmas that it creates. Is it right for a government agency to read private emails if it means saving buildings from being bombed and therefore saving lives? What should happen when privacy and security cross paths? So often he comes close to this topic yet he always backs off. I also thought there might be more discussed regarding the technologies available to the NSA and once again I was disappointed, the only technologies that are truly discussed are a computer called TRANSLTR that can read all encrypted messages, a mercenary who uses a computer that he wears, and the unbreakable encryption program, Digital Fortress. <br /> <br />In the DaVinci Code the reader is frequently presented with mind games that the character has to solve in order to get closer to revealing the mystery. This didn't really happen until about the last 30 pages of the book. <br /> <br />Overall, I found the book entertaining, but I prefer books where I feel that I gained something by reading it and I gained nothing by reading this. I also was expecting something closer to the caliber of Davince and this was not it. <br /> <br />For those considering buying it, if you want an entertaining weekend read this is good for that, if you really want to learn more about the NSA or read an intellectual thriller that compares to Da Vinci, look elsewhere, this is not it.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|When they first appeared, people referred to the Pogues as an 'Irish punk' outfit. Since then I've heard them recategorized half a dozen times. But nomenclature aside, there's no disputing what the Pogues brought to music in the eighties and nineties.<br /><br />Few artists communicate as effectively as Shane MacGowan, few voices in music are as immediately recognizeable as his. His lyrical gifts outpace even our most prolific songwriters. When MacGowan writes for himself, he ultimately writes for all of us.<br /><br />I'm not one of those hyphenated Americans that need go back eight generations for an identity, but when I hear this music, it calls to something inside of me, something I suspect not even Ellis Island can fully erase.
B0007M22TI|5.0|There is something emotive about Celtic music - a sort of underlying sadness that makes it tear at our hearts, yet it contains a strong sense of hope and destiny that causes us to feel stronger for hearing it.  This DVD really captures the wonderful voices, faces, musicianship, and orchestration of the performance - what an awesome event to watch and share with someone else who feels the same.  We first saw Celtic Women on PBS and we immediately fell in love - that was over a year ago - recently, my father-in-law called to let us know Celtic Women was on TV and we should turn it on right away because it was so good - after letting him know we had seen the performance and liked it he mentioned their desire to find it in DVD.  I immediately searched and found it on Amazon - purchased 5 copies, one for everyone in the family, and my wife delivered their copy the next day.  We have since received more than one call letting us know how much they are enjoying their DVD, but their only disappointment is that the setting is not the castle they originally saw in the PBS performance.  Maybe there will be another DVD made which includes the castle - we can only wait and hope.  Overall - great DVD to own and watch over and over again! <br />
B0002S943O|5.0|To me this ranks as the best Depeche Mode Concert DVD... the mix of songs is fabulous and the stage setup, mix of instruments and overall enthusiasm of the audience is unmatched.  If you don't own this one, I highly recommend it!
0634022296|5.0|I just bought this in 2007 after years of having Beatles songbooks. The original golden Beatles songbooks used one page per song, so I never had to worry about turning pages. More recent album songbooks often had a new set of music for old hits in the back of the book. I loved trying to play \\"Eight Days a Week\\" and \\"She's a Woman\\" in keys that I had not tried before. After all these years, when I am given a new set of chords for the song, I still like having a melody line written out so I know what note to start singing on. All 194 songs do not have tunes that are familiar enough for me to remember where the melody is supposed to be in relation to the chords, but people who have learned to function musically with just words and chords from the internet should be pleased.<br /><br />Books that offered me a complete piano part made \\"Her Majesty,\\" a little ditty at the end of Abbey Road, special for me for having a bass line that seemed better than what I could hear on the record. Page 118 retains the descending notes in the first few lines by calling the chords:<br /><br />D  D/C#  D/B  D/A  E7  A  D<br /><br />After \\"a lot to say,\\" there should be a quick run back up from A to D before the pattern repeats to the line, \\"But she changes from day to day.\\" I am so used to the bass line now as the foundation for the song that the attempt to produce a chord structure complicated enough after the opening to mimic everything that is going on in that song might be considered a train wreck at the Bsus2 chord, trying to end the line \\"I wanna tell her that I love her a lot,\\" with too much discord not being resolved fast enough for those of us used to straight rhythm guitar concepts, but few things in life that are written down can approach the speed at which things happen in a good Beatles song.<br /><br />\\"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\\" even had some guitar notes for picking the distinctive tune of the accompaniment in an earlier version, the songbook for Sgt. Pepper. The chord fingerings shown for the introduction of `Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds' might make it possible for a person who remembers the notes well from hearing the recording to pick the strings shown at the right time to produce the melodic pattern I remember, but I am not talented enough musically to just make chords and pick something like that out on my own.<br /><br />The back cover gives Rikky Rooksby credit for arranging the songs in this book, and the 400 pages contain a massive amount of information that is much easier to keep track of in book form than my own large stack of songbooks. The big shock for me on the back cover was a Hal Leonard price: U.S. $24.95, which could be what a music store would charge for it, but the price on the internet is much closer to what the price of a used copy would be, even though I bought it new.fingerings shown for the introduction of `Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds' might make it possible for a person who remembers the notes well from hearing the recording to pick the strings shown at the right time to produce the melodic pattern I remember, but I am not talented enough musically to just make chords and pick something like that out on my own.<br /><br />The back cover gives Rikky Rooksby credit for arranging the songs in this book, and the 400 pages contain a massive amount of information that is much easier to keep track of in book form than my own large stack of songbooks.

B000E1YVZU|2.0|The actors do a more-or-less good job and appear quite dedicated to the project. Most of them sing pretty well with a notable exception of the headliners Diggs and Dawson - they're painful and I wished they just lipsynced to someone with a voice.  <br /> <br />The movie, however, left me cold. What bugged me most is the Hollywood schmaltz laid thick all over what is purpotedly the late 80s' NY. What was a gritty, sick, and extremely creative scene has been transformed out into cutesy entertainment. In this Starbucks version of late 80s East Village, junkies and AIDS sufferers feature cool clothes, perfect bodies, clear skin, and neat haircuts. Their suffering is largely outside the camera shot. Not only the whole farce felt cheap, it seemed to cheapen the experience of those who lived, died, and created on that scene.
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram, I'm willing to bet, will be one of the few novels still being read a hundred years from now (if anybody is still reading).  It has everything.  I listened to it on audio and would go on binges of listening.  It is almost impossible to put down once started... and the only reason I ever did was to save more for later and to make sure I was fresh and attentive so I didn't miss anything.  Roberts is a generous, adventurous, transcendent writer.  There are so many wonderful characters in this book that I will have to read it again, just to re-acquaint myself with them. <br />Lets hope to God that if it gets to the screen, it will be as a tv series that will do its length and complexity justice.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|The merits of this album need not be discussed here. This Year's Model has been widely regarded as a rock classic for over twenty years now. What does need addressing, however, is the sound Rhino has acheived in rendering this recording on cd.<br /><br />The 'remastering' game that has been going on for the past decade has yielded mixed results. Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics. Lucky for us, that's hardly the case with Rhino's treatment of Elvis Costello's back catalog.<br /><br />This Year's Model is what every fan hopes for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns. The sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly. It is as if the Attractions have set up shop in your living room. Seriously, the immediacy of this recording is so impressive that I had to play it on the cheapest stereo in my house just to make sure I wasn't imagining it.<br /><br />Revisit a classic and hear what you missed the first time around. This Rhino series will be the death of our pocketbooks.
0618526412|2.0|I had to read this entire book, 357 pages in all, in one weekend for a college class just recently.  After reading for close to 14 hours straight I had finished and was sorely dissapointed with the impression I had recieved from the novel.   <br /> <br />First off, if you enjoy compelling or believable characters then this isn't for you.  THe black doctor is typecasted to the point that he names his son Karl Marx.  His sadness appears contrived and the relationships with his family are stupidly played out.  And his speech on Christmas Day about Marx just doesn't work.  The other characters are pretty pathetic as well.  More pages are wasted telling us about how the main character Mick feels than us actually being shown that she is changing and growing.  The deaf-mute, Singer, is plain boring.   <br /> <br />And nothing happens.  A girl is shot, Mick loses her virginity, another character loses his legs.  But even as McCullers introduces action, she resolves it and pushes it out of the way of the rest of the story, her incessant and boring as hell character study.   <br /> <br />The story ends by re-examining each of the characters a final time, and has found that they are all still lonely, and all still pathetic.  And instead of a healthy conclusion, she ends on Biff, the most stagnant and unrealistic character in the entire novel, whose femininity might be unmatched by any other character. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time reading this overwrought novel.  Beyond all the issues with it being boring, the writing is just plain sentimental, trite, and nice.  It's obvious that a 23 year old women developed each and every one of these characters.
B000I5X81A|3.0|Hardly any Claypton on this CD, disappointed. If your new to Cale, good CD but I am already a fan and he repeated too many of previously recorded cuts so for me it was a waste of money...as I said if your a new fan, it is good...
B00030590I|4.0|This movie is a clever telling of three different versions of an assasination plot set in ancient China. Jet Li plays an assasin (whose name is unknown), whom is brought before the emperor of Qin to tell the story of a plot to assasinate him with three other assasins accused of being his accomplices. The first telling of the story is done by Jet Li's character, intended to hide facts and decieve the emperor. The emperor not being fooled, rebuts with the second version of this story that he believes to be true. Jet Li's character is then forced to come clean with the truth in what proves to be an intelligent climactic end.<br /><br />Unlike most martial art movies, this movie has a lot of substance in the storyline and acting department. Which is this movies strongest point.<br /><br />However, it is hard for me to qualify this as a martial arts movie. The action in this movie is done primarily with wirework and cinematography creating real visual beauty but no realistic impact is felt in the fight scenes. The action is almost too fake to feel that this can be called a martial art film. The action does have a real visual beauty but obviously pushes it too far at times. The swordfight scene on the lake was a little too far and sort of just.....lost me. Being a martial artist myself and a tough reviewer my opinion may seem a little biased, however this movie obviously wanted to create a visually stunning film to attract a more mainstream audience. So if your looking for a more realistic, hard hitting martial arts film you might want to look elsewhere. I would recommend 'Ong Bak' or even Jet Li's \\" Fearless'.<br /><br />But definately watch this movie for the story. Having said that, watch the sub-titled version NOT the dubbed version. Since dubbed versions always lose much of a films substance in the dialogue, watch the subtitled version as you will need it in this film.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Let's be honest, after \\"The Lost World\\" did anyone have high hopes for the third installment?  I certainly didn't.  I came late to the Jurassic Park movies, only seeing them a few years ago, so I don't have any real attachment to the first movie.  I enjoyed it but I couldn't stand the child actors and enough with the Chaos Theory, Jeff Goldbum.  For me, number three was the best.  It was fun and entertaining.  Don't get my wrong, I understand why the Emmys overlooked this movie.  However, I thought that the actors were good; the story was well thought out and it was overall an enjoyable, exciting movie.  Don't get caught up comparing it to the original, because odds are you like that one best.  Feel free to compare it to the \\"The Lost World,\\" because odds are you don't like that better... than anything.  In closing, let me say this: \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is worth your time and money and at the very least it will get the horrible taste that is \\"The Lost World\\" out of your mouth.
156898443X|4.0|Interesting story about the author's evolution into an artist. The entire book is made up of his sketches and writings during a particularly challenging time in his life.  It is essentially his private art journal copied and put in a book.
B000022TSH|5.0|It's a mystery, wrapped in an enigmatic love story, riddled with corruption.  For a third of a century, Chinatown has ALWAYS been on my list of top five movies of all time, often at the top.  According to producer Robert Evans, he offered Robert Towne $175K to write a screenplay for the Great Gatsby.  Towne demurred, but asked for $25K to write Chinatown.  It's his best script, and elicited Jack Nicholson's finest performance. <br /> <br />DVD has remastered DD 5.1 audio, plus 25th anniversary interviews with producer Robert Evans, director Roman Polanski, & writer Robert Towne. <br /> <br />Richard Bakalyan plays but a minor role as Detective Loach, hardly more significant (certainly less memorable) than the cameo by director Roman Polanski, as the knife wielding midget.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is the true story of the struggle to survive the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto of Polish Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman.<br /><br />It tells how he survived against the odds , hiding in various parts of the city , before his life was saved by a German officer , who despised the Nazis brutality and genocide , a true righteous gentile , Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.<br />Unlike many personal holocaust accounts , which are of concentration and death camps , this one is an account of life and death in the Warsaw ghetto.<br /><br />The movie portrays  life and death in the ghetto : the disease , the starvation and the Nazi mass murders of hundreds of thousands of men , women and children. The imagery of the ghetto is brough to life, with heartrending scenes of the Jews being herded into and out of the ghetto and of Nazi brutality. REcreated scenes, will stay with the viewer, like a young woman being shot in the head for asking the Nazi guard where the Nazis are taking them, a mother holding a small boy who is dying of thirst, and begging for water for her child.<br />A little girl, holding an empty bird cage, and crying because she cannot find her family.<br />Roman Polanski has showed his flare for directing once again, and brilliant acting by Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, Emilia Fox as his gentile female friend Dorota, and Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.<br />A story of one man's quest for survival, among the cruel genocide of millions.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This has to be for me one of Dillans BEST...I love all the cuts on the CD and highly recommend this one. He waited a long time to record and boy, was it worth the wait. I love each and every track which is a rarity for any CD....
B00008PX8P|5.0|<br />\\"Led Zeppelin\\"... You know the name & the song remains the same.......  <br /> <br />This is one of Zeps best DVD and the music even sounds better if that's possible.  <br /> <br />One of the best VIDEO & AUDIO edited concerts I have had the pleasure to view in some time.  <br /> <br />If you are of discerning taste or on a tight budget, this is your best BANG for the Buck.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This movie is my favorite. It shows so many aspects to loyalty, greed, family, trust and betrayel. The performances are amazing and I can watch this repeatedly and never tire of it. The bonus discs are chocked full of behind the scenes and historical information on Rome and the making of the movie. It is worth upgrading to this 3 disc set instead of only buying the movie alone.
B0009RP3ME|2.0|Since no one has any info posted on this release, I figured I'd just add in some info.  This is the same exact \\"With Teeth\\" everyone knows and either hates or loves, and it's the same Japanese Import \\"With Teeth\\".  For those not familiar with this version, it includes the following extra tracks: <br /> <br />First 13 Original Songs plus: <br /> <br />14.  Home <br />15.  The Hand That Feeds (Ruff Mix) <br />16.  Right Where It Belongs (v2) <br /> <br />It also includes a discography DVD, which was available at some videogame stores, which basically contains some clips of NIN's music videos and their discography.  Nothing special, and really not worth $40 bucks, in my opinion.  You can easily find the other three tracks on singles, or just online. <br /> <br />\\"Home\\" is a decent song, just a WT leftover. <br />\\"The Hand That Feeds (Ruff Mix)\\" is just a plain old remix of the first single. <br />\\"Right Where It Belongs (v2)\\" is the same exact song as the original, the only difference is that the crowd noise at the end is removed and it's mastered a little differently. <br /> <br />Like I said, okay, but not worth it.  The DVD doesn't have full music videos, and the songs are just okay or different versions.  Find them somewhere else, and save your money.  Yes, Japanese import CDs look nice with the packaging, but this is NOTHING SPECIAL.  SAVE YOUR MONEY. <br /> <br />It's still a great album, though.
B00005JPE0|4.0|This is an excellent spy film that is not in the James Bond style. The drama and subplots are probably mixed with real life events that happened with the CIA prior to its current incarnation which makes it a believable story. The movie follows the life of the lead character Edward Wilson as an US foreign ops agent. It is very well written and directed. The plot is deep and the visuals are very detailed. <br /> <br />This rates as 7 on the good movie scale, 3 on the bad movie scale, and is worthy of being added to my dvd collection. If I were to rate this on Yahoo! movies, it'd get an A-/B+ rating. <br /> <br />It does get points on the bad movie scale because I thought that the role Edward's son was very disjointed. I disbelieved that by his meek, fearful, and lack of a distinct personality alone, he wouldn't be able to get into Yale or the exclusive Skull & Bones secret society, or even had the chance to fall madly in love with a black Russian operative during that time period (pre-civil rights movement). Edward's son is an all-too convenient plot device for how the movie resolves in the end.
B000JVT1U0|4.0|It was a decent movie, the remake was of course better in the updated filming, but besides that they were both equally interesting.

0064430170|5.0|BEWARE! you will have to read this book a minimum of 2,000 times once your toddler hears it. All 3 of my children have loved this book until it is worn out, and we have bought at least 4 Goodnight Moons.<br /><br />It can be a wonderfully interactive book once they have heard it enough times to anticipate what is coming. With a little help they will have a wonderful time pointing to the items in the pictures, and finishing the sentences for you. Each of mine memorized the entire book. You cannot go wrong with this book!!
087349976X|2.0|I was very excited when I received this book.  It has interesting and different designs and the projects are pretty.  However, I have had trouble trying to replicate these projects with my own hands. I have been working with wire for a couple of years, and I would classify myself in an intermdiate skill level.   I felt like the projects that were listed as an intermediate difficulty were actually pretty hard, which has intimidated me and made me feel like I will never be able to do the advanced projects.
B000IFS0HM|5.0|Brilliant. I have to keep the book out of site so i dont over read it. Frank McCourt deserves all the praise he's gotten.  <br /> <br /> <br />Nevadamistermom wouldnt know a good book if it sailed in from Limerick and slapped her across the face. I mean seriously. Mistermom? Obvious confusion there. Ive never seen a more delusional name in all my life. Not to mention review.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It reminds us of what went on at ground zero when the cowards , aka terrorists, attacked us on our soil, but in doing so united us together, stronger... as well as taught us in the war against terror we need to bring the fight to the enemy. Great acting & a few real touching moments towards the end. The fallen NYPD & FDNY will never be forgotten - I admire their courage. The human spirit & will to survive are portrayed well in this movie. Brother helping brother no matter what the risk may be. God Bless the USA
B000EDWKXS|2.0|Maybe my expectations were a little high.  I never saw this movie in the theaters so I recently watched this extended edition on DVD.  Nicholas Cage has a terrible southern accent throughout the movie - why - I'm not sure as his character doesn't need to be from the south.  And I thought the law enforcement was a bit over the top with the macho, kill everyone, innocents be damn attitude and in fighting.  There was a lot a action but most of the time I thought it was just stupid.  For example, an under cover cop posing as a con had a concealed gun and the second he was released he pulled it out instead of waiting until he could get the ring leader who had the only other gun.  Overall I was disappointed in this movie.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is a remarkably good, if rather depressing film. Director Inarritu masterfully interweaves four stories (each fully capable of standing on its own as a feature) into a series of connected experiences and shows how events in each person's life effects others.<br /><br />All four stories are extremely distinct, and not just because of the different languages and locations, but the way the filmmakers have chosen to portray each situation. At the very core, Babel is a story about how as humans we have lost the ability to communicate with each other successfully. This is shown in all levels, from the obvious (language barriers, governmental red tape) down to the more discreet (emotional confusion, sexual angst). The lives in each story revolve around personal communication and trying to break the barriers that prevent us from expressing ourselves to others.<br /><br />In the end, the film may leave you feeling depressed and a bit confused, but Babel isn't offering any solutions to the issues it brings up, merely presenting them. And for creative storytelling and remarkable acting, look no further than this continent-spanning epic on the minutiae of communication.<br /><br />Brief rant:<br />The trailer for Bable is misleading, as is the poster. Both prominently feature Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, and seem to market the film as a star vehicle for the two *name* actors. Babel is nothing of the sort. Not that their characters aren't important, or their acting brilliant, but as you can tell from the Oscar nominations (Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi, both for Best Supporting Actress), the film isn't all about Blanchett and Pitt. While I definitely admire them for being part of this film, it could have been marketed more for its dynamic story rather than for its stars.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|Until seeing this version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" on Masterpiece Theatre, I would have said that it was impossible to make a worse version of this classic than the 1934 film with Virginia Bruce & Colin Clive.  Even the 50s TV production was superior.  But the record has been broken.  Although this production has beautiful settings and costumes, it suffers from poor casting: Rochester is is too handsome & far from brooding; Adele is a tall gangling gowk; Jane is plain enough but scowls her way through it all.  Major plot elements are either done away with or dumbed down.  And to make matters worse, the makers evidently decided today's audience was too stupid to deal with the beautiful language of the book and so stripped it all away, leaving us with stilted conversations that could be heard in any shopping mall or high school parking lot.  The BBC did \\"Jane Eyre\\" perfectly in 1973 with the Michael Jayston & Sorcha Cusack.  They slid downhill with the 1983 version with Dalton & Clarke.  And they hit rock bottom with this production.
B000JBXLOM|5.0|If you're like me, and you thought the B-side of Abbey Road was the best side of an album ever, this album is like that - only for 73 minutes.  You'll recognize every bit of the music, but it's arranged differently.  I've had this for a month, and it's still all I'm listening to.  Have fun.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|In this flick, we have Scorsese going back to his traditional roots. The movie keeps you to the edge of your seat from the very first scene. The antipodal characterization of Costigan and Sullivan, played by Leonardo and Matt Damon, respectively, serves to be the template for the plot of the movie. The setting-up of the characters is very well done, but the real thrill starts when the two lead actors have to find each other out. DiCaprio's magnificent performance, along with equally admirable performances given by Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, and Vera Farmiga, this movie is a must see. Personally, I think it was Matt Damon's performance that had me. Coupled with Scorsese's poignant direction, this is definitely an Oscar contender. I loved it.
6305972591|3.0|Like the majority of adapted Stephen King stories, this 80's horror flick falls short of the source material, although it's pretty cool to actually see the source material on the screen. (Literally, a paperback copy of Night Shift is on the dashboard in front of Linda Hamilton in the opening driving sequence).<br /><br />The original story is only 30 pages long and a little different from the movie, but again, like the majority of King's work, it just doesn't transfer directly to the screen. The story is slightly modified, but not terribly so. One day the children in a small town decide to rise up and kill all the adults in the town in order to worship HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS. This plot-line goes back to one of King's semi-obsessions: the idea that there are small towns out there so remote that no one would even notice when an entire town is massacred and deserted... that is, until a pair of unsuspecting travelers happen upon it.<br /><br />Rating this movie based on special-effects and film quality standards of today would hardly be fair, and I have a feeling that for the 80's this was a quality film, but obviously, today the climactic scenes, and some stuff leading up to that are pretty \\"corny\\"... I knew I'd have to say that.<br /><br />I haven't seen any of the sequels, and I suspect they're not that great, but this film is worth the time to watch if you're into horror movies. The kids playing Isaac and Malakai are definitely creepy and poor special effects are forgivable if you have creepy kids backing it up.
B00000K2W1|5.0|This is an extraordinary CD. Janis' rendition of \\"Maybe\\" gives me goose bumps. She really could belt out a song and had outstanding range before the drugs and alcohol took over. I enjoyed every song, and until I purchased this CD, failed to realize the extraordinary talent of Janis Joplin. <br /> <br />What a shame that she left us so early.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I love this movie.  It is a great way to send the message that the lease likely, possibly the most weak can have great power if they have a good heart.
1932100385|5.0|Including 750 scientific studies over 40 years, this complete study of nutrition and disease shows overwhelming proof that a Western diet of dairy products and meat is killing us.  If you are not immediately moved to completely change your diet and lifestyle, then consider where your current resources of information about diet and nutrition have truly been acquired.  I was turned on to this book by a friend who is a surgeon, and who has been following a similar dietary lifestyle for years, and is one of the healthiest people I know.  She, in turn, gave a copy to her Cardiologist friend, who immediately changed her diet and her practice based on the evidence supported in this book.  It's truly THE book that will change your life!  You NEED this book!
B000E5N62U|4.0|Once I heard about the new release I have ordered. After the first listen to the work, I felt a little bit frustrated; but as it happens with the best albums, the perception of the work goes up everytime I listen, and now I place it at a similar level of previous works. <br />Joan
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I was plesantly surprised by this version of \\"Jane Eyre\\".  It was nice to see more passion between Jane and Rochester with kissing and hugging.  While this is not true to the book it made for a better movie in this day and age.  I also was pleased they did not spend so much time at the orphanage as they had done in previous versions.  I highly recommend this version.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Amazing concert. The lighting and sound come together nearly perfectly. My 20-year-old son watched this (he is a Korn, Metallica etc fan) and was simply amazed by it. He said he has never seen or heard anything like it. The Run Like Hell finale is stunning. To hear and see that kind of end to a concert and then see these older guys and band members wearing sweaters and ties was something else!
B0000024TT|5.0|I got the urge to listen to this disc today.  It's been a long time since I've listened to it in its entirety.  Collected here are some of Cohen's strongest songs, the ones he will be remembered for: \\"Suzanne,\\" \\"So Long, Marianne,\\" \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,\\" and \\"The Stranger Song.\\"  Cohen, in his world-weary way, sounds so young on these songs!  <br /> <br />\\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" was my first introduction to Cohen's music.  I bought a used LP at a thrift shop for fifty cents and I became hooked.  Cohen's words and music are penetrating, and took root in my soul.  That's how affecting some of his songs are.  Simply and tastefully produced by John Simon, this album is timeless.

There is a cohesion to the sound, the songs and her delivery that create her own unique realm and once you breathe the air you don't wanna leave. <br /> <br />I'm understating this; the album is a tour de force, a revelation and should, if there is any justice in this age of darkness, propel her to international superstardom. <br /> <br />Buy it. <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|Not only one of the best versions of Austin I've ever seen, but a wonderful film on it's own. Costuming, hair, settings, etc. are dead-on and as accurate as I've ever seen or am likely to see. Acting is excellent - the whole movie is excellent. If you only buy one Austin, this is the one to get. Very faithful to the book - in fact, I liked this movie better than the book.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is the best depeche mode album. This is especially so for those who prefer their dance-oriented songs over songs of theirs like the ones on Ultra.<br /><br />I have to say, hearing \\"Personal Jesus\\" did not inspire me to pay attention to this band or this cd.  When I heard the song \\"Precious\\" from their Playing the Angel cd, I began getting into this band.  I was especially taken with this album.  Three of my five favorite Depeche Mode songs (Precious, Macrovision, Enjoy the Silence, Policy of Truth, and World in My Eyes)are on this album.  This is their most solid and consistent cd as well.  Also, for those of you who just want a piece of history, this was a very popular album.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|One of the first (and probably only one) of it's kind, this movie does not rely on gore or special effects to get the 'horror' across. Well deserved of its cult status, this movie still is not for everyone. Over 20 years old yet it remains relivent for today. It is simultaneously creepy, scary, and what makes it truly remarkable - probable! Definitely worth owning for all cult/horror/suspense fan's collection. This is certainly no slasher flick!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having seen the movie first I expected a hashed up series. The episodes followed in order without ruining the potential for a great movie. I watched them one after another, having to do it in 2 sittings ;). Then the Serenity movie afterwards. <br />Very highly reccomended. <br /> <br />    Rikk
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I was introduced to the genius of John on his Room For Squares album and I have been hooked ever since.  Although Continuum is not my favorite of his, it certainly demand full attention when played.  I gave it to my cousin after I treated her to a John Mayer concert for the first time.  She bought the Continuum CD and plays it constantly in her husbands waiting room dentists' office.   Thanks John for giving us such pleasure!!
074356619X|5.0|I absolutely cherish this audio,it is all that I believe in,it just keeps me in this positive state of mind.I listen to it while getting ready for my day.
B0002ZMITY|3.0|Pretty funny.  Not the same as Ali G in his \\"natural\\" glory, but hilarious nonetheless.  Includes a Borat cameo.
0316776963|4.0|I came to ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY by David Sedaris after first reading his DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM then NAKED.  Like those collections of stories drawn from his life, the author and frequent NPR contributor begins with childhood experiences and progresses into adulthood.  Each collection is loosely organized around a theme, and ME TALK's is just what it sounds like, the ability to communicate oneself to the world.  As in those other collections, Sedaris is scathingly funny and frequently bratty but he has his somber moments.  Playing off the absurdity of his personal history he connects with universal truths about being human.  Several of the stories are about being an expatriot in France, which bequeaths lessons in American identity and how we are perceived by others in general. <br />  <br />I gave the other two collections 5 stars each.  I'm nicking this book just one, only because by comparison it just does not seem quite as tightly knit as the others, though the individual stories have his usual spit and polish.  <br />
B000C79UKC|5.0|I would have to say that reading this book was one the most enjoyable book reading experiences of my life. I can't think of too many books that kept me in such a constant state of total immersion and pure enjoyment then this one. Everything about it sings out originality and, as mentioned, enjoyment. Seekers of deep reading pleasure need look no further, I have your book.
1400064287|5.0|This is an amazing book, very interesting, with clear explanations, real cases and very instructive, very well structured and the type of book that you start to read and don't finish till almost the end. <br /> <br />A must have book that can apply both to business and real life.
B000957O82|3.0|I guess my opinion of \\"Hitch\\" could be colored by the fact that I watched it at 3am, under the influence of a nice dose of Aleve Cold and Sinus during a recent bout of the common cold.  You see, despite a charming story and adorable actors, I didn't especially love it, and I'm not sure why, considering my love for anything featuring Will Smith. <br /> <br />Will Smith plays the sexy, self-confident lead role of Hitch, a date doctor who only takes on clients who are truly infatuated with a woman for all the right reasons.  Despite playing Cupid for others, he has yet to be in a serious relationship.  Eva Mendes plays opposite as Sara, the sexy, self-confident reporter who leads such a rewarding life reporting on celebrities and socialites that she doesn't need a deep meaningful relationship, either.  Naturally, they're born for each other. <br /> <br />What follows is a fluffy, romantic comedy where the date doctor who can get just about anyone to fall in love repeatedly falls flat on his face in his own efforts to woo Sara.  And I'll admit, it was cute and I enjoyed it for the most part.  But it felt like it went on forever.  (Again, maybe it was just the medication, but at 133 minutes long, I don't think so.)  Overall, I'm glad I watched it, because it was sweet, and I'm a sucker for a cute love story.  But I'm really glad I didn't buy it, because in the end, I don't want to watch it a second time, even if it does have Will Smith in it.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie was great.  It is uplifting and fun!  Everyone should watch it!  ...Parents, you just might want to watch it first before letting your kids, to see if there is something you do not want them learning just quite yet!
0375413405|5.0|I have been using this book for 35 years & am on my third copy, the first two having dropped to pieces. I have also given copies to three near & dear ones. I can do no better than quote Elizabeth David, the doyenne of English cookery writers : \\"In the English language there can be no cookery book so conscientious & methodical since Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery appeared 130 years ago.\\"
0446528056|4.0|Soldiers in World War 2 called them \\"Dear Johns\\" - letters written from wives or girlfriends back home who couldn't wait or had found someone else. It's no surprise the \\"Dear John\\" from author Nicholas Sparks is filled with distance, longing, and broken hearts.<br /><br />John Tyree is a rowdy type from North Carolina who straightens out his life by joining the US Army, then tangles it back up on leave when he meets college student Savannah Lynn Curtis. She's a near-perfect straight arrow, and in typical Nicholas Sparks fashion, they manage to exchange an \\"I love you\\" by the third date.<br /><br />Their two week romance consists of walking tours, cheeseburgers, and surfing lessons, but by the time John is packing his suitcase to return overseas, they are vowing eternal love. John promises to write regularly, email, and call when he can, and Savannah promises to wait. Their pledges are easy to keep in the beginning, but - as in the case of many long distance loves - eventually the two start drifting apart.<br /><br />The \\"Dear John\\" letter from Savannah still comes as a surprise to him, but rather than trying to contact his lost love, John signs up for another tour of duty. It takes his father's funeral to bring him back to North Carolina.<br /><br />Sparks sets up the reunion of the two in a scenario that is rife with possibilities. Savannah's husband isn't home and she surprises John with an offer to cook dinner. In a situation reminiscent of the ill-fated scene in Ethan Frome, the two are alone in the house with all the tension of the love they once shared.<br /><br />Suffice to say, Edith Wharton would have played it differently - but \\"Dear John\\" will satisfy fans of Nicholas Sparks with its short simple style, easy prose, and trademark poignant moments.
B000002AOD|5.0|I have owned this CD since its release back in 1994. Tonight I put it in my CD deck for the first time in a while. I have just been reminded of what an amazing masterpiece of an album this is. I have loved it since I first heard it and loved it once again tonight! <br />The musicianship, the writing and arranging, the sonic quality, the complexity of the music, the UNBELIEVABLE level of professional playing here and everything else you could say about this fabulous record! <br />If you are a fan of big band jazz and you haven't had the opportunity to hear this record, do not wait any longer! Get one of these discs before you can't. It's already 13 years old but it sounds like it was done current day. It is timeless. <br />I am surprised we don't hear more about the drummer Cliff Almond. Spectacular drumming here! \\"Smitty\\" does a great job too! <br />Looks like ten bucks buys this here on Amazon. What are you waiting for????
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|this movie is awesome its the best one yet i love it its such a trip <br />the animation is awesome
B00004XONN|4.0|Invention, intelligence, the guts and the genius necessary to push the envelope: these can all be ascribed to Radiohead.  Although their albums may vary widely in tone and intent, one thing is always for certain -- what you hear will be new, will be unusual, and may, in fact, be brilliant.<br /><br />For critics and listeners who have a love for Radiohead (and, indeed, for the passion and creative energy it takes to break down musical boundaries), will find \\"Kid A\\" yet another refreshing change of pace for this oft-lauded, sometimes-decried experimental band.  Thom Yorke's haunting voice flows through the songs like a dark fog, as always, espousing a cryptic but notably disconcerting message of ambivalence, purpose lost.<br /><br />This time around, though, his words dance over abrasive electronic waves and a jazzy agitation of saxophones and trumpets.  It was reported that, prior to the release of this record, Yorke was battling depression.  If that's true, it's certainly evident in this album in which the sound has the consistency of a heart rate monitor viewed in slo-mo.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; the lush rise and fall of sound is invigorating in the same measure that it is dream-inducing.  Songs like \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" \\"How to Disappear Completely,\\" and \\"In Limbo\\" skate gracefully over lakes of icy-cool electronica, describing peaceful and elegant choral curves.  Others, like \\"Optimistic,\\" \\"The National Anthem,\\" and \\"Morning Bell,\\" utilize a powerful transcendent urgency to create a sort of fireworks display of sound, something burning, chaotic and gorgeous.<br /><br />Wonderfully hot and liquidly cool though most of it is, there are still parts that are just plain weird and trying.  The title track is a schizophrenic, atonal mess that is hurt even more by its overly-digitized vocals.  \\"Treefingers\\" is a plain-Jane New Age track that is both indistinct and unoriginal.  And no matter how many times I give it a chance to grow on me, \\"Idioteque\\" remains, to me, a supremely annoying song, an aggravating mixture of scabby, over-active beats and mostly toneless vocals.<br /><br />I respect the effort involved though, even if sometimes it churns out something unpleasant.  After all, if it takes a few failed experiments in sound to produce this many powerful successes, I'll accept them as part of the process.  It's quite telling that even if there are a few songs that I hate, there are that many more that I love.\\"Idioteque\\" remains, to me, a supremely annoying song, an aggravating mixture of scabby, over-active beats and mostly toneless vocals. <br /> <br />I respect the effort involved though, even if sometimes it churns out something unpleasant.

B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt.peppers is the coolest Beatles disc. it always cheers me up. i think the white album is better but this is just a ray of sunshine a playful puppy. A day inthe life is my favorite Beatles song i think Within without you is the best of Georges indian songs. The sound and feel of Sgt.peppers is amazing and cheerful.A great piece for every music collection.
B00005JPBD|3.0|I may not be really qualified to review this film, which I attended with the missus. I slept through almost all of it. Apparently I didn't miss much other than Cruz singing. I had fairly guessed all the major plot issues 20 minutes in. The popcorn was awful also.  What I do remember though, is that the actresses were all quite beliveable. Cruz radiates like Sophia Loren - unlike every American [..], like say Anniston, Cruz is actually believable in a role as a working woman. The trouble with this film is that you expect certain very odd plot twists with Almodovar, so it becomes quite easy to guess where this is going once the tableaux is set.  I'll stick with TALK TO HER. There was everything to love about that film. As for this, well..... I had a great nap.
B00006AW2S|5.0|The Stones released a series of really good, trendy albums throughout the 60's, when Brian Jones was still alive and contributing.  The first few were heavy on R&B covers, with Jagger-Richards compositions increasing as time went by.  \\"Out Of Our Heads\\" boasts only 4 Jagger-Richards songs:  \\"Satisfaction\\", one of the greatest rock songs ever and the one that began the Stones' elevation to rock royalty;  \\"The Last Time\\", an excellent early rocker that preceded \\"Satisfaction\\" on American radio;  \\"The Spider And The Fly\\", a sly, clever tune about infidelity on the road;  and \\"One More Try\\", a decent rocker.  Two of the best cuts on the album are credited to Nanker Phelge.  Who was that?  I didn't know, so I looked it up.  It was a pseudonym for songs written by all 5 band members.  Those 2 cuts are \\"The Under Assistant West Coast Promo Man\\", an amusing roots-rock tale about the life of the title character, and \\"Play With Fire\\", a ballad that is serious as a heart attack.  Of the R&B covers, I like \\"Mercy, Mercy\\" and \\"Cry To Me\\" the best.  I think they most effectively show off the Stones' talent.  As for the remastered sound, it is quite incredible if you were used to listening to old vinyl LP's, as I was.  \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"The Last Time\\" and \\"Play With Fire\\" sound especially good.  To sum up, a fine effort from a rapidly developing band, and of course we now know that the best was yet to come.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|As much as I liked \\"O\\" (The movie \\"Closer\\" and Natalie Portman will always be associated with \\"The Blowers Daughter\\"), I think this album built and improved upon his debut. The opening song \\"9 Crimes\\" is wonderful and eerie and the melody has a haunting effect that frames the album perfectly. I also loved the songs \\"Dogs\\" and \\"Coconut Skins.\\" What I think makes this album so refreshing is the way that Rice has made the chorus matter again. I've found that music in recent years has suffered from a long-standing want for choruses that aren't nonsense and superficial gunk. I wish I could say more about why this album is so good, but you'll have to listen for yourself. It's well worth the money, especially for fans of Alexi Murdoch, Badly Drawn Boy, and David Grey.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|You may have heard and/or read the same mix of reviews that I had before I had seen The Illusionist. Some people could nod their heads at it and tell you it was entertaining. Others would hesitate, only to be polite, and say it just wasn't worth seeing. In my experience, not many people had very strong feelings one way or the other. And many people preferred to focus on whether or not it was better than The Prestige instead of discussing the movie on its own merits. I won't claim the moral high-ground, admittedly I have not seen The Prestige; all I have to go on is The Illusionist. And I liked it.<br /><br />The casting is better than luke-warm. The movie features the on-the-rise career of Paul Giamatti and the long-overdue return of Ed Norton. Giamatti acted his way onto the map with a highly praised performance in American Splendor, though he is probably most well-known for his role in the Sideways. If you have read my reviews before, this may not be the first time you see me point to the movie Confidence. It is the movie to which I would say Paul Giamatti's role is most comparable (and one of my favorite movies). In both movies he toes the line between the moral and immoral, while bringing a strong breadth of character. In the Illusionist he has a larger part, so you are able to enjoy his very-likeable personality in greater supply.<br /><br />Edward Norton has delivered some very noteworthy performances over his career. I can only wish for him to get more work; I enjoy what he does. He does not seem to work at the same pace as many in-demand actors today. Maybe he prefers more time off, or maybe I am the lone voice of support for his career. Either way, I thought he did a great job as lead in The Illusionist, where he brought the same \\"I'm better than you\\" arrogance that he gave us in Rounders. It seemed effortless as he settled into a character who is not too over-the-top. Knowledge is power, and his character knew what others did not.<br /><br />The story was a new flavor of an old dish. The creators here took the often-used template for a crescendo of suspense which carries you safely into the heart of an exhilarating plot twist. What they added was magic, literally. (Sure it was good, but you know what I mean.) I really enjoy magicians and their craft. I liked the way the creative team for The Illusionist was able to bring this story to life. The only thing I longed for was more magic. A few more slight-of-hand tricks would have made me very happy, though I understand that there wasn't necessarily any good place for them to be added.<br /><br />I hope that you are neither too proud of yourself, nor disappointed should you predict the twist. The strength of the movie is less in the surprise and more in the execution. The Illusionist is not a movie you will love, but I think if you give it a fair chance, you will be entertained.ory was a new flavor of an old dish.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|Growing up in the late 80's & early 90's I followed new rock groups closely.  However, over the past 10 years all the new artists sounded the same so I stopped listening to anything new and only listened to classic rock.  Three Days Grace has helped change that.  They are one of the few bands whose music has an edge that is worth listening to.  On the other hand, their music isn't too heavy so it just sounds like noise.  One X has many great tunes such as Riot, Pain and Animal I have Become, but the best song on the album that no one talks about is Get Out Alive.  It starts out a little more mellow than others on the CD, but builds to a fantastic guitar riff with all the headbanging power you can muster.  A must have CD.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Horror is my favourite genre - but it is so rarely done well.  Supernatural gets everything right - the well known urban legends, the situations, the resolutions - this is good horror done well.  However, it's not really scary as such; rather it revels in all of the viewers expectations of the genre and likes to add a few smart twists. <br /> <br />The series is really made great by superb performances from Jensen Ackles as a ghost hunter and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as his taciturn father.  The family relationships and the strong character development really unfold in the second half of season one, making you desperate for the season 2 DVD.  <br /> <br />This DVD also has some great special features that really enhance your enjoyment of the series.
B000051VWW|4.0|This cd is great to sit and relax and maybe do some light reading.  It also sets the mood when you and your significant other want to heat things up!  Very Enjoyable!
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Loved it, but not as much as Delicate Sound of Thunder(DSoT). Nothing against the band, but DSoT was just so much better produced as a video. All in all, Pulse was quite enjoyable, and had I not seen DSoT I would have rated this as a five. IMHO of course.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I borrowed this DVD set at the insistence from a friend, and I'm so glad that I did. It was hard to find 4 hours time to finish the whole thing, but after the first hour, it was a necessity to finish it! I haven't watched much from BBC, but I do plan to watch more now. The movie was beautifully made, with the camera work and the costume and set design. There's so much of the upper class portrayed in most period films, but they went into great detail to show the lower working class in its reality. The two main characters were the obvious stars, though I think Daniela Denby-Ashe lacked in showing emotions as an actress, while Richard Armitage blew me away with his passion and grit. While each of the side characters were also masterful actors and mostly endearing, (aside from Mrs. Thornton) I instantly fell in love with Mr. Bell, Mr. Higgins and Fanny Thornton.<br /><br />I was so impressed with this mini-series. I had never heard of Elizabeth Gaskell before, but I look forward to reading her novel now. The plot was so intricate and detailed yet carefully written, and the characters were so loveable and realistic to the time. When the movie first opened, I didn't like Margaret or Mr. Thornton; she was too snooty and he was too crass. But as the story wore on and the characters grew and developed, I found affection for both of them, though especially for Mr. Thornton. He is the epitome of the tall, dark and handsome man, brooding and emotionless; a heavy heart waiting for a beautiful young woman to step into his life and fill it with love and happiness.<br /><br />After months of trials and tribulation, of miscommunication and pure angst, the end is tied up beautifully. I'm such a sucker for romances, and this movie did not disappoint. An uptight and broody Mr. Thornton is now lax and smiling as he meets Margaret again, and she is no longer the stubborn and sheltered young woman from before. She is now wise and affectionate, and offers a \\"business deal\\" to Mr. Thornton to get what she wants - what they both want. I couldn't picture a happier ending, and I was very pleased to be so delightedly treated after my four-hour endeavor.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history, or to any of the hopeless romantics like myself. I only wish that more people knew about this beautiful piece of work. It was different from any \\"movie\\" I had ever seen, but it was a refreshing change. It's worth the money to buy and keep, and worth the four hours time it takes to watch.wants - what they both want.

B000002KIT|5.0|This item is great to have on CD...  I've been wearing it out on my old 8 Track player.  I was afraid that it might break.  This item brings back so many great memories.  It is one of the best tracks that I have ever heard (start to finish)...
B00005ATQH|4.0|Humbert Humbert is a professor of English about to lecture at an Ohio college when he rents a room at the New Hampshire home of a sex-starved widow whose nubile blonde daughter is not at all famished in that department. The daughter's name is \\"Lolita,\\" and Stanley Kubrick's film. loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel, starts off with a literal bang as the oddly named professor, obsessed with the title nymphet, guns down the eccentric playwright who initiated the willing Lolita into the ways of the flesh, and later blew the whistle on the professor for his pedophilia.<br /><br />This very odd and lengthy film is exquisitely cast with James Mason as the professor and Sue Lyon as Lolita each scoring a bulls-eye. Mason wonderfully displays the humiliation that Humbert suffers as his dignified exterior crumbles away to reveal the pathetic soul underneath. Lyon is perfect as the nymphet, still cracking gum and blowing bubbles while luring men with her womanly charms. Shelley Winters as her mother, the woman Humbert marries only to possess her daughter, is their match.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Peter Sellers as the playwright is a bit of a disappointment, ably conveying the odd quality of his character, but failing to suggest the \\"genius\\" that Lolita attributes to him. Perhaps Lolita was still too immature to distinguish between genius and a nut case. Then again, Sellers, more mimic than actor at this point, may have lacked the ability to portray such a multi-layered character.<br /><br />\\"Lolita\\"'s finest moments occur in the first hour, and a better film would have resulted had the final 90 minutes been trimmed by half. When the conclusion finally comes, it's anti-climactic. But this remains good, if not top-flight, Kubrick.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks
B000HKCRW2|5.0|The Rapture's latest release \\"Pieces of the People We Love\\" is unobjectionably one of the danciest albums of 2006. What makes this release so great is that Luke Jenner really went the extra mile to show every bit of his sassy and surprisingly rangy voice. The music is more refined and has much better sound quality, coinciding no doubt with their growing popularity. So while the album's completion took much longer than expected, it was well worth the wait. This CD is all about making anyone who hears have the unshakable urge to get up and dance. It delivers on its intent with funky bass riffs, incredible vocals, great dance beats and more cowbell then you will ever know what to do with. This album is worth every penny of your money; you will be not be disappointed. Lookout for tracks 1,3,4 and 6; they are some of the Rapture's best work to date.
0790731002|3.0|It took the James Bond series seventeen years to really descend into self-parody and foolishness with \\"Moonraker.\\" Batman did it in six.<br /><br />Warner Bros.' third Dark Knight opus, \\"Batman Forever,\\" would make a good companion piece to the same studio's \\"Superman III.\\" That film pitted the Man of Steel against comedian Richard Pryor with dire results. \\"Batman Forever\\" pits the Caped Crusader against comic Jim Carrey for an adventure that is more laughs than thrills. Carrey, as his character The Riddler says, is \\"over the top,\\" and so is Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face. And for those who prefer their Batman movies dark and brooding, the introduction of sidekick Robin (Chris O' Donnell) is most unwelcome. On the other hand, Val Kilmer as Batman plays his role so straight he might as well be auditioning to replace the late Jack Webb in a revival of \\"Dragnet.\\"<br /><br />As directed by Joel Schumacher, \\"Batman Forever\\" looks great. It's filled with striking sets, cinematography, and day-glo colors, and that, along with the presence of Nicole Kidman and Drew Barrymore, make it easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks
B000056TKC|5.0|Yes, I will speak only about the Egmont overture.    I have listened closely to at least six others.  This recording shares the top prize with one other (\\"#1 Beethoven Album\\" by DECCA).  Don't let the 1958 date scare you!  The sound quality is amazing -- not \\"for 1958\\", just amazing period.  The sound quality blows away all the other recordings.  The strings are not far away and distant.  The sound is not thin.  The brass doesn't blare obnoxiuously and out-of-control and hurt your ears.  But the brass is nuanced and close -- just like the strings.  Nuance abounds -- in EVERY instrument.  Balance is superb.  Timbre is superb.  Now for the musical interpretation...    Musically, Fricsay did absolute wonders.  There is profundity in EVERY PHRASE of the Egmont.  Whereas others give the feeling of \\"let's do this phrase so we can then get to the good stuff\\", Fricsay shows you how it is ALL good stuff.  It is all profound.  Every phrase of Egmont has profundity!  You didn't know that with other recordings; you do here (and hear).  Fricsay also shows that there are contrasts in kinds of profundity.  So the Egmont has more differentiation of mood that others give it.  Sure some think there is only trivial stuff and the good stuff, but even my 2nd favorite recording (below) keeps only a single mood.  Not so Fricsay.  His masterful recording cannot be surpassed:  profundity abounds, contrasts in KINDS OF profundity are abundant, musicianship is impeccable.  Yes, Fricsay is slow.  But do not let that scare you!  The profundity and nuance and musicianship guarantee that slow is not boring!  And remember:  the sound quality is stupendous!  Really!!  The \\"original bitmap... blah blah blah\\" is not some marketing hype at all.  All classical on CD should sound at least close to this good.    If you must have a less slow-paced recording, your best choice is \\"#1 Beethoven Album\\" by DECCA.  (A second choice is Beethoven: Complete incidental music to Egmont, Op.84, and The Ruins of Athens, Op.113 whose liner notes are the best to be found anywhere.  The Egmont & Ruins recording does not trivialize any of Egmont overture, but the profudity is of one type and does not show mood contrasts.)    What NOT to get:  do NOT get Karajan.  Slow without any profundity.  Seems rather foolish really.  Bad distant thin sound quality too.    Do NOT get: Composer: Ludwig van Beethoven Conductor: Kurt Masur   Orchestra: New York Philharmonic Audio CD (February 19, 2002) Label: Teldec  ASIN: B00005MO9N.   Atocious!!!   Thin, distant, overly BBLLAARREE when brass comes in, zilch for profundity; perfunctory is more like it.  This recording is absolutely atrocious despite the NY Philharmonic on PBS in 2006 being outstandingly good.  This CD was actually recorded in 1992, by the way.    Do NOT get: Daniel Harding, and Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie    The Egmont is too light-weight here.  Delicacy does not befit Beethoven or Egmont.  But the last two minutes (of the 7½) is rather nice.  There is one incredibly nifty thing here, so if you must hear it for yourself get this CD for this reason:  you will never in your life hear a sforzando like Harding makes his violinists do.  It's like an athletic feat or shooting billiards or something:  How lightly can you bow the string and still make it make a sound immediately after having really wacked the bleep out of the string on the same note?   ZZZZZZZZHHHHHHHUUUMMMM  m   (the last lower case 'm' is meant to be a note played ultra-mega pianissimo a millisecond or two after wacking the string for ZZZZZZHHHHHHMMMMM).  This contrast doesn't hurt your ears, but it is just so immensely exaggerated that it becomes an [athletic?] effect rather than music.  Cool, but not serving Egmont because of its over-done-ness being a distraction.    You want the most magnificent Egmont, the most respectful Egmont, the biggest Egmont, the most profound Egmont, the most moodful Egmont, the best sound quality in Classical recording?   Get the FRICSAYrecording.  Or, for a very very close second at not such a very slow pace as FRICSAY, get the \\"#1 Beethoven Album\\" by DECCA.  That Egmont is probably optimal paced with good profundity and variation in mood -- and good sound quality too.
B00005ATQD|5.0|\\"Bill, suppose I told you that everything that happened to you there...suppose I said that all of that was staged, that it was a kind of charade? That it was fake?\\"<br /><br />Victor Ziegler's words explaining away the bizarre orgy that his friend, Dr. Bill Harford, crashed the night before might be a more accurate description of Warner Bros' marketing campaign for Stanley Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\"<br /><br />After Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then a real-life couple, were cast in the lead roles, the media hype was that Kubrick's final film was about sex, jealousy, infidelity, and the pitfalls of temptation, all of which certainly seemed to be the theme judging by the trailer over which Chris Isaak was heard singing \\"Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing.\\" Most critics and the public swallowed the bait and saw the film with their own eyes wide shut.<br /><br />\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is not really about sex at all, nor is it about \\"the elusive ambiguity of dream and reality,\\" as the back cover of the published screenplay claims.<br /><br />LIke most of Kubrick's films, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is so rich and multi-layered that it requires multiple viewings before its meaning becomes clear. Even then, much of it remains mystifying. But this much can be understood: \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is an expose of the world's elite and the occultic rituals they engage in on a regular basis. The bizarre ritual that Tom Cruise's character witnesses is more than mere hedonism, hence the cloaks, the masks, and the bizarre, almost churchly music. It is a Satanic ritual, and Ziegler is right when he tells Harford he wouldn't sleep so well if he knew the names of those participating.<br /><br />Just as Ziegler tried to white-wash the events, the media deliberately tried to control the public's perception of Kubrick's film. Ziegler is a little more honest. He prefaces his remarks with the word \\"suppose,\\" a hint to Harford and the audience that he's telling Harford a bit of fiction in the hope of dissuading him from pursuing the matter further.<br /><br />And what are we to make of Alice Harford's \\"dreams\\"? And what about the daugher of Milich, the costume shop proprietor, whose father doubles as her pimp?<br /><br />Alice's dreams are more likely flashbacks to real incidents when she was victimized by the government's MK-Ultra mind control program that was exposed in Congressional hearings and which Kubrick touched on in his 1971 film of Anthony Burgess' novel, \\"Clockwork Orange.\\"<br /><br />One question is how did Kubrick ever manage to make \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" for a studio which is believed to be controlled by the very kind of people he was exposing?<br /><br />Following the success of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" Kubrick was in an enviable position. Warner Bros. lured the world's most innovative filmmaker to their stable by offering him carte blanche. Kubrick's clout was such that he could even convince the studio to withdraw the very profitable and critically acclaimed \\"Clockwork Orange\\" from UK cinemas when he feared his family would be targets of violence from those who misunderstood the film. Kubrick was free to make the films of his choosing without interference from the studio, and always worked under strict security, keeping the nature of his work a secret even from those who were providing the budget. It's doubtful Warner Bros. realized what Kubrick had achieved with \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" until they saw the finished film four months before its release. But like Cruise's Dr. Harford, Kubrick may have wandered out of his depth. On March 7, 1999, only four days after Warner Bros. got its first glimpse at the much ballyhooed production, Kubrick unexpectedly died, exactly 666 days before the dawn of 2001, the year he made famous with his landmark 1968 film.<br /><br />Yes, 666 as in the mark of the beast.<br /><br />Coincidence? Conspiracy?<br /><br />Aside from its themes, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" is as impressive as all of Kubrick's films. The production design, cinematography, and musicare as flawless as they are unforgettable. The performances are also top notch. Tom Cruise, whose acting skills are often dismissed, is at his best here, playing a man whose jealousy leads him down a path where he learns much more than he suspected about the circles in which he socializes. Kidman is good, too, though she has some early moments when she unconvincingly overacts. Pollock as Ziegler shows he's still a better actor than a director (though he's not too shabby behind the camera either), and there's Leon Vitali, who played Lord Bullingdon in \\"Barry Lyndon\\" before working behind-the-scenes on Kubrick's last three films, as the sinister Red Cloak.<br /><br />\\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" may be Kubrick's most daring work. It is certainly one of his finest. If your own eyes remain shut to the truths of this film, it's recommended you see it again, this time as a double feature with Alex Jones' \\"Inside Bohemian Grove,\\" available on DVD with the equally informative \\"Order of Death.\\"<br /><br />Brian W.

0743298020|5.0|This was an audio book I couldn't put down!  When it first began, I thought it was going to be a story that would drag out and be dull.  Was I wrong!  It was a slow start for me but once the author got into the main story and past the initial background information, it just kept getting better and better.<br /><br />Vida Winter is an author who is sought for the mystery of her missing thirteenth tale.  She has kept her past life a secret from every biographer and newspaper reporter that has ever interviewed her.  Oh, she would give them a story but it was jus that, a story.  Each and every one was different.  No one knew the truth of her past life.  She is now dying and wants to tell the true story for future generations.<br /><br />Margaret Lea is the daughter of a book store owner and has a secret in her own past.  She receives a letter from Vida asking her to write her biography.  Margaret goes to Vida's home and, at first, is unwilling to write the story.  But Vida has a way with words and persuades Margaret to change her mind.  Vida has only one rule, no jumping ahead or asking questions.  A very strange but Margaret agrees and takes up residence at Vida's home.<br /><br />Each day, the two spend a few hours together as Vida spins her story of the Angelfield family.  What a story it is!  A ghost, a governess and a devastating fire is enough to keep anyone's attention.  But there is even more as the story is also about twins.  Margaret discovers that this is something that Vida's biography and her own life have in common.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Margaret begins to believe there is more than she is hearing and her curiosity sets in.  She writes for help from a private investigator to find out if certain things Vida is telling her are really true.  The answer is that the story is true and Margaret takes a holiday to visit the Angelfield home.  There she finds the burned out remains of the family home, Aurelius Love and a woman and her two children.  What does all this have to do with the story?  Just wait, it all comes together so well.<br /><br />Diane Setterfield writes a story that is a story within a story within a story and if you don't pay attention, you miss the clues she leaves you along the way.  She writes in a clear and easy to follow manner and holds your attention so intently that you can't wait for the next twist or turn.  She even had me guessing what would happen next and some times I was even right!<br /><br />The two readers, Jill Tanner as Vida Winter and Bianca Amato as Margaret Lea are wonderful to listen to and give the story which is set in England a true English feeling with their respective accents.  Each makes their respective character come to life.  Ms. Tanner gives Vida's character the voice of an elderly person who is gravely ill and makes it believable.  Ms. Amato gives Margaret's character the incredulous sound of someone who is not quite sure she is being told the truth and of one who is determined to know it.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is a tale that I would read again.  I hope Ms. Setterfield plans on writing more as I would be sure to read any she writes.at does all this have to do with the story?

B0007PALZ2|5.0|This is a remake of the French film « La Jet&eacute;e », and yet it is completely different. The film kept the time-travelling dimension, the catastrophe that killed five billions  human beings and forced the survivors to live underground in some kind of medically managed prison for everyone. The time-traveller is a volunteer in this prison who is trying to reduce his time by volunteering to the surface to pick insects and samples of life out there, and also to the past to find out what happened in 1996, and eventually prevent the catastrophe. But that is about all, except for the boy at the airport and the man killed there with the same twitch in the punchline as in « La Jet&eacute;e ». But the film develops three other dimensions. The first one is the reaction of the world of the past when confronted to this time-traveller from their future. They just put him away in some asylum where he meets the woman of his dream as one of the doctors there. This reaction reveals the strange blindness of humanity because they consider anyone who is in anyway different, divergent as one says, as being insane. In this world you have to conform to the little box where fate, in fact social determination, has put you. You can be normal, or you can be a deranged preacher, or you can be a whore or pimp, or you can be a homeless bum, or you can be a criminal, but beyond there you are insane. That makes society absolutely blind to anything that is slightly off the line because they refuse to see it. This is perfectly examplified with this army of the 12 monkeys, a clandestine criminal organization that has stolen some dangerous bacterial germ and is going to spread it in half a dozen cities in the world. The film also develops the relation between the time-traveller and the lady of his dream. It is a real relation. Medical at first, then it is an abduction, then it becomes some kind of love or cooperation. The lady then is no longer dead like in the French model. She sure is alive and she ends up believing him about what was or is supposed to happen on December 13th. But they fail or rather fate, history, destiny succeed. He dies and she runs after him and the criminal with his bacteriological samples can escape. The world is doomed. This is the third development of the French model. You cannot change history. This already was in H.G. Wells's « The Time Machine ». But this time it is central in the film. At the same time he plays on two embodiments of the same character in the same scene but duplicated by one who is time-travelling. This is an essential element of the trilogy « Back to the Future ». But you cannot change history that follows its own rules and cannot be tampered with. What is to happen has to happen. Total fatality. Strangely enough it does not have the same meaning as in H.G. Wells. No sentimentality about it. Just the brutal realization that humanity has vainly thought and believed they could make history. This new idea was common in H.G. Wells's time. Today it has become some oddity from our marxist positivistic past, some oddity that very few people believe in any more. History is going its own way along its own rails with its own reasons and any human being in this history has to follow the flow. They can swim or they can let themselves be carried by the current, or they can sink in a way or another. But they will not stop the stream nor change its course. A river has never been able to go up the hills : it has to follow rules that have little to do with us, such as gravity and slope.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonneup believing him about what was or is supposed to happen on December 13th.

1591841216|1.0|This \\"book\\" can be read in two hours (and probably took less time to \\"write\\"). It is extrememly unoriginal: I've seen a mountain of \\"advice books\\" of this sort; if you're curious, stop by the graphics design section of your proverbial favourite local bookstore and look for pocket-size \\"creativity guides\\": you're sure to find a couple of equivalents.  <br /> <br />The formula seems to be as follows: every spread bears one Important Thought, which is communicated by way of a playfully typographed statement or paragraph, with the rest of the space (about 2/3s) occupied by some pretentious collage or doodle. This, at best, does not allow for much substance, but even within the, er... let us say, confines of the genre, this book is quite fatuous.  <br /> <br />To be specific, what the author says is either very unoriginal, or not necessarily true (or definitely not true) -- or all of the above. An example, off the top of my head -- advice: dont' go to college, pick a job instead. Well, the problem, dear Sir, is this may or may not be a good idea.  <br /> <br />Yes, going to college w/ no goal is a waste of time -- in terms of curriculum, but not necessarily in all respects. You see, when in college you tend to have a lot of time on your hands (for example, you can skip lectures w/o any negative consequences). Is taking a job better? Yes, if you happen to pick the (or a) right job, at least in some way. But, a person who doesn't know what to do with himself is just as likely to pick a wrong job as he is to start at a wrong college, yet, with a job, you'll have no time flexibility what-so-freakin-ever (compared to college). Yes, it sucks to find yourself with a wrong diploma at twenty eight. But it also sucks to find yourself in a wrong job at forty. Both can happen. Both are likely to happen to people w/o a clear sense of purpose. In fact, let me offer my own observation: it is better to take a job than to go to college only for those who DO HAVE this sense of purpose. See? Get it? Think of it; it's not too hard, even purely logically.  <br /> <br />OK, I could go on and on, but that's enough to give a taste of what I'm talking about. The book holds a small amount of completely gratuitous drivel (some of which, like a broken watch twice a day, MAY HAPPEN to be relevant, or even right -- depending on a zillion other things the very existence of which the author does not do so much as acknowledge). In reality, what the author offers is facile (and irresponsible) simulation of advice: which is easy when you care more about selling books than actual helpfulness of your advisories. Either that, or he's honestly stupid, which I doubt.  <br /> <br />To summarize: this little booklet is more of a cute printing job than a book; reading it is a complete waste of time -- so much so, it's even hard to figure why someone bothered writing it. Give it a pass, truthfully; there's nothing to it.
0140157352|4.0|I read this book this weekend.  Although I agree with a previous reviewer who commented that the author could have written the book using fewer words, I still found it easy to read.  The suggestions offered make sense.  As the author points out, most of them are \\"common sense\\" ideas we'd have anyway, but the book helps lay them out in a logical way.  I did get the impression toward the end that the author was trying to fill space by repeating previously-discussed suggestions.  Then again, repetition is the key to learning, so maybe that was his intent :-). <br /> <br />One thing I liked about the writing style used in this book is that there were examples illustrating the major points, but they were kept simple.  I've read other books where just understanding the details of the examples was an exercise in and of itself.  The simple and to-the-point examples really helped make this book easy to read and understand quickly. <br /> <br />I'd recommend the book to others looking for advice on negotiating. <br />

Blood Diamond definitely furthered that view and hopefully it changed the minds of a few greedy people that have fallen hook line and sinker for the DeBeers 3 months salary engagement ring garbage.<br /><br />Now that my political statement is out of the way, on to the movie.<br /><br />Blood Diamond is set in the context of Sierra Leone's civil war--with of course the diamond trade being the central theme.  It shows how the diamond trade has affected the life of one man and his family and how a diamond smuggler works this system for his own adventure and the monetary gain of others.  Their paths intertwine, along with a crusading journalist, and we have an exciting movie full of scenes showing us how ridiculous we all must be to covet such a silly little rock.  Sorry, can't keep my disgust for the diamond out of this review.  Anyway, see the movie and decide for yourself.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|CHILDREN OF MEN is a deep, dark, dreary, and dynamic film that offers the possibility of hope in a dystopian future. It is a moving and thought-provoking film, full of social commentary and could very well be Alfonso Cuaron's best movie, yet.<br /><br />The movie takes place in Britain in the year 2027. The film opens with Theo Faron (Clive Owen) purchasing coffee at a local shop as the television broadcasts the death of the world's youngest person: an 18-year-old boy named Baby Diego (Jaun Gabriel Yacuzzi). For eighteen years women have been unable to bear any children. The government sponsors all sorts of activities to promote sex and promiscuity, but it has been to no avail. As Theo leaves the coffee shop and walks down the trash-filled streets, a bomb goes off destroying the very shop Theo had just left moments before.<br /><br />Needing a break Theo takes the day off work and takes the train to visit his friend Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine), passing caged illegal immigrants along the way. Jasper was an award-winning political cartoonist married to an award-winning journalist. However, when the chaos began his wife was captured by the government and returned as a vegetable. Jasper cheers Theo up and offers him a perspective about the whole thing. The next day things seem &#34;normal&#34; but as Theo is on is way to work he is kidnapped by the terrorist group FISH. He soon learns that the group is being led by his wife, Julian (Julianne Moore). The group wants to transport a young refugee to the coast so she can be picked up by a ship. The girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), needs papers and Theo has connections. However, Theo is also one of the only people that Julian trusts left in the world. Theo is able to get the papers, but he has to escort Kee. Along the way the group is attacked and has to take refuge. Theo learns that Kee is pregnant and that Julian had very serious reasons for only trusting Theo. Knowing that the hope of the world lies with Kee he sets out to escort her to the coast where she can meet the Human Project, a secret organization that has supposedly a safe haven and is working on a cure for the human infertility problem.<br /><br />The acting of CHILDREN OF MEN is top-notch. I've only seen a handful of film Clive Owen has acted in and I've enjoyed them all. He is a classy actor and one whose star will continue to rise. I really like Julianne Moore and even though she isn't on screen for a very long time, her presence lights up every scene she is in. Michael Caine is another actor who makes every film he's in just better by being in it and he works his magic in CHILDREN OF MEN (it's also kind of funny seeing Caine make fart jokes and rambling about weed). Claire-Hope Ashitey is virtually a newcomer to the bigscreen and in her first major role she shines brightly. The rest of the cast of CHILDREN OF MEN is multi-national and each actor and actress is excellent in their roles. No one, not even the extras, seem out of place or abnormal.<br /><br />The cinematography in CHILDREN OF MEN is amazing. Cuaron does some amazing things with the camera. There are two long, one-camera shots that particular stick out to me: the car scene was done all in one-long take with one camera and the scene where Theo is escorting Kee out of a building where the terrorists are fighting the government forces was all done in one camera in one take. These are incredibly long shots (the car scene is almost five minutes in length) and to have them turn out so effectively with so much going on is almost unheard of. It requires incredible direction and foresight to do such shots, let alone do them effectively.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is an incredibly dark film. It's probably too dark and bleak for some people to deal with. There is a lot of violence, but much of it occurs off screen; people are shot but we only see them falling down from a distance or they are killed off screen with only a spot of blood speckling the camera lens to illustrate what has happened. The movie is also an incredibly deep social commentary. Racism, illegal immigration, terrorism, national security, sanitation policies, sex education, euthanasia, media manipulation, and the importance of life are all issues that the film deals with. Some might be mistaken to believe that the film is anti-government and pro-terrorists (or insurgents). This isn't the case because the film clearly shows that neither the government nor the terrorists are completely right or wrong; they are fighting a circular war that won't end until one is able to wipe out the other.<br /><br />Despite this bleak view of the humanity and the future, CHILDREN OF MEN is a movie full of hope. The world can be an incredible dark and dreary place, but hope remains and that changes everything, something I have been reminded of several times lately. There are some who will not like the film's ending because it doesn't seem to bring closure. However, in the mood and tone of the film it fits and it doesn't end in despair, but in hope.<br /><br />I found CHILDREN OF MEN to be an incredibly moving picture. At times it was almost brutal to watch. Throughout it was a fascinating and riveting piece of cinema. There are several scenes that have stuck in my mind and I find myself dwelling on during the day. For instance, in a short, but important scene in the film Theo is having lunch with his cousin and is trying to convince him to get him the papers he needs to escort the girl to the coast. Sitting at the table is his cousin's son. The boy is in his mid-twenties and though physically he might be a man, he is really a boy. He sits at the table eating with one hand while using the other to play with an interactive electronic device attached to his fingers and head. The boy is so absorbed in what he is doing that he has no idea what is occurring around him, he doesn't even realize that he is eating and his father has to yell at him to get him to put his fork down and take his pill. The scene is ironic because Theo's cousin has been doing everything he can to save and restore the world's great pieces of art and culture. Theo asks him why he does it when in thirty years none of it will matter and he replies that it doesn't matter because he doesn't think about that. There is so much in that scene that can be taken away; so much to think about. Theo's cousin might not think about the future, but we need to.lustrate what has happened. The movie is also an incredibly deep social commentary. Racism, illegal immigration, terrorism, national security, sanitation policies, sex education, euthanasia, media manipulation, and the importance of life are all issues that the film deals with.

Theo asks him why he does it when in thirty years none of it will matter and he replies that it doesn't matter because he doesn't think about that. There is so much in that scene that can be taken away; so much to think about. Theo's cousin might not think about the future, but we need to.

0743289412|4.0|There are the people who dismiss Stephen King outright--those who may have read his earlier works or perhaps did not, yet either way discredit him as a peddler of gore and soporific pop fiction. (And they are wrong, of course, but I don't trouble myself with them, and I'm guessing Mr. King doesn't much, either.) <br /> <br />And there are the people who are King fans because they enjoy the written word; because they have a passion for language, for deftly written stories that unwind like a skein of yarn--sometimes jerkily, sometimes smoothly, sometimes with unexpected kinks and turns, but always with a brilliant whorl of word-color. They read his work because they take delight in meeting for characters who stumble and shuffle and dance and curse just like normal folk. <br /> <br />And then, well, then there are the people who are King fans...but only if he \\"keeps himself where he belongs.\\" In other words, firmly entrenched in the Pop Horror genre with Dean Koontz, Robin Cook, and the like.  <br /> <br />And it is perhaps these people with whom I disagree the most. <br /> <br />The outright doubters and critics? I can't change their minds--no one can. It's the same kind of mindset that makes people insist the world should be run a certain way because \\"the Bible says so.\\" Or the same kind of thinking that makes a six-year old sit at the dinner table long past twilight because he refuses to eat his tuna casserole. It is. He is. And they are. The end. And, as I said, no skin off my nose. <br /> <br />But the others...well, it's a shame, really. That one can discount a book because it isn't \\"the kind of stuff he [being King] is *supposed* to write,\\" as opposed to judging it on its own merit.  But then again, I suppose this shouldn't be any skin off my nose either--because it probably is the least of Mr. King's worries as well, and if he doesn't take offense...well, why should I on his behalf? <br /> <br />Lisey's story is long. It's difficult in places, and at times makes us want to dig our fingernails into our palms and shout \\"getonwithitalready!\\" But then again, so is love, and loss, and grief, and that inexplicable-only-experienceable place we're forced to go to when a loved one dies. <br /> <br />Lisey isn't Tabby King, but I'm sure the worlds are ones inhabited by Mr. King, nonetheless. In this book he has written what Tim O'Brien would call \\"a true story...full of story truth.\\" Story truth, not real-world truth, but real, emotional truth. And King does it in a way that only he can. <br /> <br />There are many voices of Stephen King--not all people like all of them, and a great many of them only like one, or two, at the most. I, well, I unabashedly like all of them. Even when I DON'T like his work, I appreciate it, and I can learn from what I don't like (Sayyuh, true.). <br /> <br />In many ways, I found reading Lisey's Story much like reading all seven books of the Dark Tower--you can tell both are redolent with meaning for King, personal and at times painful journeys (for both him, and, occasionally us as readers), but with characters who emerge gradually, in their own time, and in their own ways. There are parts that drag, parts that are a bit OVERBURDENED with dialect, and parts where Mr. King pops up a bit too much, perhaps... but they are works that make you FEEL. They are not easy reads, but they are full of their own languages, places, and emotions. They both make you feel the full weight of \\"story truth.\\" <br /> <br />This book is about love and grief and that searing, catching, burning hole left behind when someone leaves us--but never quite goes away. Despite its fantastical elements, the story is raw, simple, and homespun...it's *true* in its details. <br /> <br />I had my doubts when I started reading, but am infinitely glad I stayed with it. It isn't The Stand. Or The shining. Or It, Misery, Cujo, or anything else you may want it to be... it is what it is, and whether that's good enough for you, dear reader, depends entirely on you. <br /> <br />Bool! <br />The End!

B00005Q45W|3.0|This CD is about on par with Dear Heather, except it is more somber and dirge-like.  It could use at least one song with an upbeat tempo, and the heavy use of synthetic sound gives it a sterile feeling.  I long to hear a new Cohen CD where his guitar is the central instrument again and there is actually a live band backing him up.  The songs worth repeat listening are: \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep,\\" \\"In My Secret Life,\\" \\"Alexandra Leaving,\\" and \\"The Land of Plenty.\\"  The lyrics, in typically Cohen fashion, are pretty good for songs, but not quite poetry, however the music is just slow, depressing and dark, like a clock winding down.
B00006IU73|5.0|This album is a hidden gem and deserves more praises and accolades.  This site cannot do justice to this disc.  You have to hear it and get a hold of the lyric sheet for a mind numbing experience.

B000025XKM|4.0|Nick Drake did not record a bad album during his all too brief life.  This is his darkest effort, the sound stripped down to mainly his own guitar, and quiet voice.  It is clearly a product of a great mental anguish, someone fighting their daemons, barely able to function.  The lyrics are less lush and hopeful than earlier efforts, the arrangements starker-- overall, a bleaker, surreal mood that matches the album cover.  The album showcases his guitar virtuosity drenched in melancholy and alienation.  It is impossible to listen to this album and not feel for this man.

0140186409|5.0|Although it is a little slow going at the start, once you have met all the chraracters, and the main story starts, it is actually painful to put down.  John Steinbecks vivid writnig keeps you engrossed in the story, and gives the reader a clear mental picture. Having also read Of Mice and Men, I expected to get that mental picture and to be severely moved by the story.  All my expectations were met.  He also has a writing style that lets one get close to the characters.  He has a way of making the reader really care about them. He makes the reader feel as if they are actually there, feeling what the characters feel.  Although The Grapes of Wrath left me feeling quite sad and angry, I was thankful for having read it.  It was very well written and an influential story.  It had a positive impact on me. I feel very thankful for what I have, for everything the characters knew and cared about was taken away, without question or concern.  I would really enjoy reading John Steinbeck's other works.
0307341542|4.0|Camille Preaker is a Chicago journalist who is sent to her rural Missouri hometown to cover a hot story about a supposed serial killer.  Throughout her investigation, we learn that Camille is a troubled woman, a cutter, who hasn't escaped her childhood wounds.  Camille's mother, Adora, is a woman who has her own high-society secrets, and her half-sister, Amma, is a sociopathic Lolita wanna-be.  Throw in a dead sister, a relationship with an \\"outsider\\" detective, and you've got one fast-paced novel.<br /><br />I liked the \\"film noir\\" feel of the prose.  Flynn is a talented storyteller, and while Camille is somewhat of a trainwreck, I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Flynn uncovers the darkness found in so many towns like Wind Gap.  Dark and creepy, this book will keep you reading late into the night.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|It's surprising, 25 years later, how little \\"Reds\\" has influenced movie making.  At the time of its release, Warren Beatty's use of real-life witnesses seemed to open up new doors for historical films.  Beatty proved that you could stop the action and bring in real people with knowledge of the events and strong points of view (often contradictory) and not just lend authenticity to the story, but also maintain the emotional connection between audience and character.  Within two years, Woody Allen satirized \\"Reds\\" by using Saul Bellow, Susan Sontag and others as \\"witnesses\\" of his fictional Leonard Zelig.  And then, the technique was just forgotten. <br /> <br />Perhaps the problem is that everyone remembers what didn't work in \\"Reds\\" more clearly than what did work.   Beatty gave one of his best performances, but his limitation as an actor is that he wants to be loved too much and will never allow his charcters to look unflattering.  \\"Reds\\" would have worked better without Beatty's shaggy dog portrayal.  Diane Keaton does everything she can to make her Louise Bryant work, but the casting still seems off to me.  Everyone else in the movie is perfectly cast, especially Nicholson in a very low key portrayal of Eugene O'Neill and Maureen Stapleton, a highly deserving Oscar winner for her portrayal of Emma Goldman.  Keaton is just a bit too flighty to play such an intellectual heroine. <br /> <br />Because of the casting, the love story is hit and miss, sometimes working (especially the early scenes), but growing more tedious as the film progresses.  Everything else about the movie succeeds brilliantly.  Yes, \\"Reds\\" is very long.  And it's also about communists ... not just American ones either, Russians too.  But within the complicated plot, you can see why the Soviet experiment failed ... how the American left felt betrayed by the shift from anarchism to communism (a theme of Thomas Pynchon's new novel \\"Against the Day\\", set in the same era.)  You can also see how Woodrow Wilson's crackdown on war dissent led to very un-American outcomes, such as the deportation of native born Americans.  <br /> <br />If only Beatty had cast someone else in the lead and fought his impulse to give his girlfriend a job, \\"Reds\\" could have been one of the greatest films in history.  Instead, it is very good and more deserving of attention.  Any screenwriter in a full on Charlie Kaufman panic over how to adapt a difficult book should take a look at \\"Reds\\" and consider whether Beatty's witnesses might be the answer.

B00005JPKC|5.0|Well.  Don't go into this movie expecting to be entertained, its more of an experience than anything else.  Of course Letters From Iwo Jima is about the battle of Iwo Jima told from the Japanese perspective with English Subtitles.  I didn't see Flags of Our Fathers so I can't compare the two.   <br /> <br />The acting is very good, Ken Watanabe is as good as ever and the guy that plays \\"Shago\\" was great.  The direction is good, I was hoping for more battle scenes on Iwo Jima but I heard Flags has more fighting.  This movie moves slowly at first but once we come(Americans) it all pretty much goes to hell for everyone.   <br /> <br />I loved the sepia toned, drained look to the movie and the ending is great in my opinion.  The only part where this movie drags is in the beginning, but thats a minor complaint.  It also has one of the most disheartening scenes I've ever scene.  I guess I gotta put up the big SPOILER! warning to talk about it, so SPOILERS! <br /> <br />Its the scene where the roomful of Japanese soldiers blow themselves up with there own gren@des.  Now that we are talking about v!olence lets talk about how bad it is in this movie.  Honestly, its not that bad.  Yes, there are some graphic scenes, but if your kid has seen GLADIATOR OR Kingdom of Heaven or another war movie he/she should see this. <br /> <br />Overall this is a heart wrenching, great look at how bad war is.  And that no matter what side you are on there are good and bad people.  Probably most importantly it says that in war there are no winners, only losers...

B000LC3ID8|2.0|I know it's just a movie, but I find it hard to believe most of the things in this movie could actually take place.  How could Amanda carry all her victims to their demise - How could she kidnap many of them in broad daylight - Who builds, maintains, and gets materials for all of the machines - how can Jigsaw install cameras in peoples' homes and also know everything about them? Amanda stated she built the shotgun bullet trap - yeah, sure.  Everything seems to work out perfectly and timed.  The husband must have a very low IQ as he is so slow to save any of the victims, by the time he does anything, they are dead, often standing there like an idiot for some time.  His wife is dying on the floor and he takes his sweet time to do anything.  Why couldn't she warn him that killing Jigsaw would result in her death? Many things happen in this movie that are scripted badly just so the story can come together in a neat little package.  P.S. I didn't know that getting your face smashed against a concrete wall 3 or more times is no big deal.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a series I discovered by accident; Someone told me about it and I had to DVR record it to watch later: (It was on Friday evenings on Fox) back in 2002 during footbal season.  I got to see five episodes before the series was canceled, so wound up buying the entire series, including the few that were never aired just to see the whole thing.  I was pleasantly surprised by the action, comedy, story line, plot, and unique style of the series. I also went to see Serenity (and bought the DVD), which is based on the series. I keep wondering how it would have faired if Fox had tried it in another time slot, say right before or after American Idol, or 24, or perhaps in it's Thursday night prime time slot.  Unfortunately, it was very poorly promoted, and I don't recall ever seeing teasers for it on Fox.  Too bad: They let a gem of a series go down the tubes; A series better than 90 percent of what they are currently showing.  <br /> <br />My two favorite episodes are \\"Out of Gas,\\" in which Mal reflects on how he met and hired his crew (Kaylee's first appearance is too funny), and \\"Jaynestown,\\" in which the rough, tough, and not so bright Jayne (Adam Baldwin) is mistakely given hero status as a \\"Robin Hood\\" type figure; all because of a mistake!  Truely histerical: I had to watch it a few times.  If you've never seen it, rent it or borrow it from a friend: You'll be hooked!
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|I was so excited to learn of a new production of my favorite book, and to add another DVD to my Jane Eyre film collection.  I'm truly sad to say this is just about the worst version of the nine, yes, nine adaptations.  The most faithful version remains the 1983 BBC production starring Timothy Dalton & Zelah Clark.    The Masterpiece Theatre Jane Eyre misses Bronte's all important social commentary on the abuse & neglect of children, the status of women, and the Victorian view of mental health care.  Bronte tackled human rights head on:  her heroine is a, if not 'the' proto-feminist, her progressive hero a  humanitarian.  Sadly, the foundation of the novel is seriously diminished in the mini series with the first twelve chapters covering Jane's childhood are given the barest attention.     (Circa 1850 women and children were regarded as property, women being thought to be biologically inferior.  Being a governess was to be a servant: after teaching was over for the day, a governess then took on menial labor, and at the end of long work day retired to a bed in the attic servants quarters.  Re. women & mental health issues, a male relative, notably a husband, could rid himself of the expense of a wife he didn't like by  having her diagnosed with 'hysteria'.  She would then be removed to an institution such as the infamous Bedlam where she would find herself housed with the so-called 'insane' and 'mentally deficient'.  Beyond the  chance of suffering physical assault by inmates, meager nutrition, unheated housing, the inmate's life was   shortened by poor sanitation leading to dysentary (24/7 diahrria), consumption (tuberculosis), etc..   Rochesters' placing Bertha under the care of a private nurse within his home is truly an extraordinary humanitarian act.  Final sidebar:  in 1850 England it was against the law to beat a horse but there was no law  against beating a woman).    The casting is strange.  Ruth Wilson is far too tall to play Jane, and she looks vigorous enough to build Thornfield in the morning and plow fields in the afternoon. Toby Stephens' goofy Rochester is downright comic:  there are moments when you half expect him to do a Monty Python \\"wink, wink, nod, nod\\".  Together  they lack the chemistry necessary to meet the demands of one of English literature's most passionate couples.  When Wilson & Stevens touch, she touches his shirt with her hand but does not clasp his arm.  And, with the notable exception of the excellent portrayal of Blanche, the supporting cast is dull especially when compared to the stunning supporting cast in A&E's Jane Eyre with its near perfect portrayal of 10 year old Jane.    Beyond a weak cast, the most serious flaw with the production is the complete mess of a screenplay which hacks up the novel into bits & pieces, and relies on awkward flashbacks and discordant dream sequences.      For those new to Jane Eyre, the Masterpiece Theatre production may seem wildly romantic but for those who go on to read Bronte's novel you will be richly rewarded with a far deeper & passionate love story.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I remember reading a review in American Cinematographer about a movie that was coming out in the late 70's called \\"Star Wars.\\"  As I read the review, I grew more and more excited about seeing the movie.  In contrast to the pristine space ships to date, Star Wars had things that went wrong or didn't work consistently, space junk, ships that were old and rusted, sword fights, arial dog fights, and some of the best elements from a variety of film generes. There was nothing else like it at the time, and it is now a classic that introduced technologies and techniques that changed the film industry.  It's rare that new Sci Fi movies have anything close to that winning combination: Serenity is one that does.   <br /> <br />In a day and age were most Sci Fi and action movies rely too heaviliy on special effects and CGI \\"eye candy,\\" Serenity has a great blend of comedy, action, and a very solid & well acted story line that make it a pleasure to watch repeatedly. Even if you didn't get to see the Firefly series for which the movie is based, it is a stand alone product that needs no prior familiarity.  Of course, because the principles were together for nearly two years, it lends to the solid performances in the movie: All of the characters are very well developed.   <br /> <br />All the same, for those of us who did see the series, the movie picks up where the series ends, and delivers upon the established characters and story, especially with the next level jump of River's character.  It's truly a shame that the series ended before the first season was even completed; It's better than half the stuff currently on TV.  If you see Serenity, you'll want to get hold of the Firefly series: It's great stuff.   <br /> <br />Serenity is one of those films that is an undiscovered jewel for many who find it.  Because of poor promotion, and a bad time slot, most people ne-ver saw the TV series. Subsequently, few saw the movie in the theatre.  Everytime I show it to friends or loan it tosomeone who has never seen it, they are blown away!  I've also purchased the television series of Firefly, as everyone I know who has seen the movie wants to also see the series.  If you collect DVD's this one is a definite keeper for your collection.

1878424319|5.0|My first experience with this book was actually the day I picked up a card from the Four Agreements deck, which told me \\"Don't take anything personally.\\"    Well. I took it personally (hahaha).  It irritated me so much I realized I needed to read the book.  (You mean it's NOT all about me?)    I love this one and Mastery of Love, which I have highlighted, underlined, dog-eared, and spilled tea on more than once.  I keep both books within reach, on the kitchen table or in the car, to grab and open to whatever page I stick my thumb into--and whatever page I land on is worthy of study and applies to my thought pattern that day, or something that \\"just happened\\" the day before.  Keeps me on track, and it's simple.    Don't take anything personally.  Everyone really IS in their own dream, and the reality is you don't know what others have been through, or where the journey has taken them up to this moment.  So in this moment, where your dreams intersect, it becomes necessary to meet with an open mind, and compassion, and non-attachment.  It becomes necessary to realize that their dream is NOT about YOU.  Let others dream, as you are dreaming.  Their dream really has nothing to do with how happy you decide to be.    Be impeccable with your word.  Watch your words, and what they create within your dream.  Observe them, and see how the feeling, energy and vibration of your words is affecting the dream you walk through.      Don't make assumptions.  How to eliminate drama from your life.  Find out what's really going on.    And do your best.  Funny how after we have those great \\"aha!\\" moments, where it all seems so simple, we find ourselves forgetting, when we're in a situation a half hour later.  Okay--what was that again?  Right--it's not personal!  Take a deep breath and get back on track.  Do your best.  It will come easier after awhile.   Maybe the next time while it's happening I will stop and say: \\"Okay, not personal, not personal,\\" right away, and it will save me a half hour of grinding my teeth.     When I looked up my own book on the Barnes & Noble website, I was surprised and honored that this book, and it's accompanying volumes, was listed on the \\"People Who Have Purchased Your Book, Also Purchased This Book\\" list.  (Ironically, a satanic bible is also on this \\"recommended\\" list, and I am still laughing about that--couldn't wait to point it out to friends, who already know I'm a \\"little devil\\").    The Four Agreements should be in everyone's library.  Or car.  Or on the kitchen table.  Just make sure it's within reach.

B000LC3ID8|4.0|I think many of us agree that the first one is still the best.  I must admit Saw III has many gross bloody moments with great torture devices but it was so rushed to get to the end that they forgot to let us get to know any of the characters.  These movies have made enough money to get some better known actors haven't they?  Perhaps familiar faces would help the audience connect to the characters more.  Or better writing too.  In Saw III we get what is expected.  More games, more sick twisted scenes, and we also get a surprise at the end of the movie that for me was worth giving the film four stars.  Overall I am satisfied with how this third installment tied all three movies together especially with the two lead charcters Jigsaw and Amanda.

B00005BAIQ|1.0|Don't let the famous actors, the beautiful women or the references to the Bond mythos fool you: this product of the late 60's is as boring as it is baffling. Jokes fall dead left and right. Anyone counting this film as one of Peter Sellers' best have likely never seen \\"The Party\\", \\"After the Fox\\" or choice installments of the \\"Pink Panther\\" series. And before you say \\"it's a comedy that was relative to the age in which it was made\\", let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of zany 60's films. It's just a mess. The emperor has no clothes.<br /><br />Lavish amounts of time, energy and (most foolish of all) money were poured into a project whose script seems to run out about 17 minutes in, leaving you a good 2 hours of meandering mush. The level of detail applied to that mush is astonishing: elaborate sets, exotic cars, high fashion and complex choreography. The line item for the writers must have been inadvertently dropped from the budget. Or maybe they just plain lost the script.... or edited it upside down.... or, or traded it in for whatever drugs were fashionable at the time. It's just a mess.<br /><br />Trust me, if you make the mistake of watching this film in the belief that you'll see the prototype for the Austin Powers film series you're going to be very, very disappointed. Mike Meyers and Jay Roach may play to early 21st century comedy tastes but they built a solid comedy that will stand the test of time. They took the same reference material and did it right. At one point in Casino Royale the background music rings with an echo of the themesong from the Benny Hill show and you just wince because it isn't funny like Benny Hill, in fact it isn't funny at all.<br /><br />I can't help but be angry at every big name star you see in the film for luring you into wasting your time. David Niven, Orson Welles, Ursula Andress, Peter Sellers, a very naked (but covered) Daliah Lavi, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Huston, George Raft and a very unfunny Woody Allen are wasted. Don't let them waste YOUR time, they did not capture the spirit of their age.<br /><br />Bottomline: any movie featuring a scantily clad Ursula Andress that makes me want to stop the DVD player, pull out the disc and bash it to pieces is fundamentally flawed.are wasted.

B00005JLR8|5.0|Name the film directors whose first film won Academy Awards for their co-stars. There's only one: Jim Sheridan, who directed \\"My Left Foot\\" in 1989. Brenda Fricker won an Oscar for Best Actress. Daniel Day-Lewis was named Best Actor. And Jim Sheridan established himself as a director who could plumb deep emotion without wallowing in it.<br /><br />Two more films, four more Oscar nominations --- clearly, Sheridan has a way with actors. And then, in 2003, he co-authored and directed \\"In America,\\" starring Paddy Considine, Samantha Morton, Djimon Honsou (who went on to co-star in \\"Blood Diamond\\") and two sisters, 12-year-old Sarah Bolger and 8-year-old Emma. Morton was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy. Honsou was a nominee for Best Supporting Actor. The Bolger sisters were robbed.<br /><br />But then, so was \\"In America,\\" which has embedded itself in my memory as one of the wisest, most affecting films I've ever seen. I just watched it again. On second viewing, it's just as powerful.<br /><br />I suspect this is, in part, because \\"In America\\" is the kind of story that the Irish do best. There's plenty of painful, gritty realism --- there's also a rich stream of magic. They merge at the start of the film. The strands never separate.<br /><br />It works like this: Johnny Sullivan, his wife Sarah and their daughters sit in their old station wagon at the Canadian border, waiting to be admitted to the United States as \\"tourists.\\" In fact, this Irish actor and his family plan to be illegal aliens in New York City. Johnny presents his documents....<br /><br />Immigration Officer: How many children do you have?<br /><br />Johnny: Three.<br /><br />Sarah: Two.<br /><br />Johnny: Two.<br /><br />Immigration Officer: Says three here.<br /><br />Johnny: We lost one.<br /><br />That lost child is Frankie, recently dead at 5. His legacy is grief --- grief like a lead blanket, grief so heavy there's no point talking about it because everyone feels it and no one knows what to do about it. Christy, the older daughter, has been \\"talking\\" to Frankie every night and believes that he has given her three wishes. Seeing that this moment could go either way, she uses one: Please let us into America....<br /><br />In New York, the Sullivans find an apartment in a druggie-infested slum. The girls like America. But Johnny is stymied in the land of opportunity --- his auditions are flat, he can't get a part, he becomes one of that army of actors who drives a cab. More stress: Sarah gets pregnant and learns that the baby could endanger her health. And the kids have befriended Mateo, a neighbor --- a fierce, hostile African artist who, unknown to them, is dying of AIDS.<br /><br />You watch all this, mouth open, as if you are watching a documentary. Credit the writing and, equally, the performances: Samantha Morton is all eyes and hope.  Paddy Considine is a tormented block of ice. And the girls --- well, here's Jim Sheridan recalling how he cast them:<br /><br />There was an open audition and Emma was the very first girl. I got Emma to read, and I thought she was a bit too good, so I went to get another girl, and Emma pulled my coat really hard, and I looked 'round and she just looked at me with pity, as if I'd crossed the line of etiquette, and she said, \\"Is she reading my part?\\" I waited and looked in her eyes, and she didn't back down, so I said, \\"No, Emma, nobody's reading your part. She said, \\"Good, my sister's in the car.\\" I said, \\"What age?\\" She said, \\"10,\\" but I thought that was too young. She said, \\"Well, see her anyway.\\" And I went down and cast her after three minutes. So that was the first two kids out of 300 --- I never saw any others.<br /><br />There are scenes in this movie that will haunt you all your days. At a street fair, John bets every dollar they have in order to win an ET doll for the kids....Sarah, wild-eyed, briefly loses her mind in the maternity ward....Christy sings \\"Desperado\\" at a school talent show....Johnny confessesto Mateo, \\"I asked God a favor --- take me instead of him. And he took the both of us.\\" And then there is a line that was, for me, the killer: Christy announcing, \\"Don't `little girl' me --- I've been carrying this family on my back for more than a year.\\"<br /><br />Oh, the wisdom of kids. These girls find the words than no one else can say. They form the friendships that lead the family back to life. You can see some kind of happy ending coming, but you absolutely can't see how --- and then Christy uses her third and final wish.<br /><br />When I saw \\"In America\\" in a theater, people all around us were blubbering at that wish; how simple it was, and how hard. Christy's words to her father cut deep, but they cut with such love. And then there are words --- three words, and you'll never guess them --- that Johnny has to say.<br /><br />The catharsis, when it comes, is glorious. There's a second one, a printed line at the start of the credits --- the dedication of the film \\"to the memory of my brother, Frankie.\\" A little research reveals that Jim Sheridan was 17 when his younger brother died. But the ages don't matter, only the emotions. And there is no director on this planet who handles emotional truth better than Jim Sheridan.<br /><br />As you will see in those moments when your tears don't blur the screen.to Mateo, \\"I asked God a favor --- take me instead of him.

B000JLTRJ0|1.0|Why this movie was made is beyond...trying even more so to cash in on this horrible event...
B00006RU5B|5.0|In my opinion, Audioslave's self-titled debut ranks among the all time great debut albums along with GNR's Appetite for Destruction and STP's Core.  While Out of Exile and Revelations are quite riveting and great fun, they cannot touch this.  There is not a weak track to be found.  Sure, some are better than others, but the best ones (Like A Stone, What You Are, Shadow on the Sun, I Am the Highway) are destined to be all-time classics.  Listening to this cd begs the question:  what the hell happened to good old rock?  what is with all this new girly rock? yeah, you know what i'm talkin about-  nickelback, hinder, etc.  there are good ones left like breaking benjamin, shinedown, godsmack, and disturbed, though.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you are into Led Zeppelin or not, just buy this.  It gives you TONS of vintage concert footage that show exactly how the band played and sounded back during their peak.  The best part about it is that it is not \\"over produced\\" like the music today.  Today's music is overly digitized studio recorded music that is a phony representation of the musicians.  Instead, this is authentic, sincere, and live.  This DVD shows what rock music is REALLY about.
B000002GQL|4.0|I like this album , it's the perfect ending to the Classic 7. As usual the Moodie 3 R's - Rock, Romance and Risk are all covered.
6304981635|5.0|This is classic.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  The kung fu movie that started it all.  It retains much dignity while still being an action movie from the 70's.  You may learn a little life philosophy while you're at it.
B000002GQJ|5.0|The best set of songs and most hardrocking set by the Moodies. Good album. <br />They tried to get away from overdubbing here so they could do it live.
B000L43AN4|4.0|This latest release for Tom Waits is a 3 disc set.  Disc 3 is the one that really makes the set shine.  It contains songs with similar sound to tracks from \\"Real Gone\\".  They are raw, juicy, and warped.  Disc 2 is mellow and works well when a mellow sound is called for.  Disc 1 is a little hit or miss.  Listen to the samples.
B000002GQH|5.0|The Moodies put together a melotron thick album. Have You Heard parts 1 & 2 are worth the price of admission. A preview for the next album which is......
B00000AFGM|5.0|This album is phenominal.  Every song encapsulates a futuristic style and vision.  The album tells a story about the future, and the future of humanity.  It makes a statement about where we are going, while maintaining a unique music style without being Sci-fi.  This is not about shock value, get over Manson's looks, pay attention to the music.
B000002GQK|4.0|This one is a good album and I like the concept but it hasn't stuck with me like the previous 2 no matter how many times I've listened to it, I think I may have been Moodied out after the first classic 5 albums.

B000LC3ID8|4.0|After seeing this latest installement in the Saw series, I was abit disappointed.  Yes it has the gore and the twist as the others....I just felt it was very rushed and predictable.  I cant even begin to explain the plot(so much going on and everything connected), the only thing I will say is that if you had any questions about the first two they are all answered here.  In the end, this is a definite see horror/thriller movie.   It may leave you wanting more Jigsaw.

B00005JPKC|5.0|This is a great movie, and a truly original one, although not for the reasons that have been previously offered up by movie critics and fans.<br /><br />First off, although this movie does portray the Japanese side of the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima, it does not glorify their role in this movie, nor does it ignore the lessons of history served up by this battle.  For the few critics of this movie who say that the Japanese soldiers got what they deserved, that the Japanese started WWII, and that this movie only brings in undeserved sympathy for those soldiers, I say, as an American and a reader of military history, perhaps, but look deeper into what this movie is REALLY saying.<br /><br />Although American film critics have almost universally hailed this movie as an anti-war movie, this movie is in reality only an anti-bushido movie.  The movie has been extremely popular in Japan, and I cannot but help think that its underlying messages serve only to work against the cause of the resurgent and revisionist right-wing nationalist elements in Japan today.  As the samurai coda of bushido itself is also in resurgence in Japan today, this movie comes none too soon as an antidote.<br /><br />The movie has two centers - one is on the fictional and very hapless ex-baker Saigo, who has been drafted into the Japanese Army as a common foot soldier; the other is the real-life portrayal of General Kuribayashi, the Japanese commander at Iwo Jima.<br /><br />The movie makes clear how the rigid military discipline and samurai coda of bushido worked against the Japanese throughout the fight for Iwo Jima.  For although this rigid discipline helped to prevent mass desertions and surrenders, thus enforcing the will of the military elite for these soldiers to fight to the death, it also resulted in stupidly ceremonial suicides when the soldiers were clearly defeated.<br /><br />The samurai coda of bushido also led to an unwillingness to adapt and learn from previous mistakes.  Kuribayashi, who had studied in America, and had studied previous Japanese island defeats against the Americans, actually had to fight his own fellow commanders to implement his defensive tactic of building caves and fortresses inland.  Brief mention is made in this movie of how he was urged to not give up the beach entirely -  and so the Japanese did put in some pillboxes overlooking the beach landing sites.  The only result was that three months of hard work building the beach defenses would all be blown away in the first few hours of the preliminary American naval bombardment.<br /><br />Above all else, the portrayal of Saigo, and of the failed Kempetai (Japanese secret police) soldier Shimizu show how brutal the Japanese military system was at the time to its own people.  Both suffer harshly from the military system - Saigo's bakery is regularly looted by the Kempetai and then finally ruined by the war, and his pregnant wife is left in tears when he is drafted into the war (\\"none of the men ever return\\", she cries).  Saigo's clumsy efforts at soldiering and general cynicism about the course of the war lead to beatings and near-death episodes at the hands of his officers.  In a flashback during the movie, Shimizu's failure to brutalize a Japanese family by killing their pet dog at his commander's order is met with a beating from his superior (Japanese commanders were authorized to physically beat their soldiers and underlings) and ejection from the Kempetai.<br /><br />Most moving of all, the mass suicide with grenades, after Mount Suribachi had been taken by the Americans, is portrayed as a direct disobeyal of an order from General Kuribayashi to retreat, regroup, and  fight again.  The group suicide is demanded by one of the most fanatically bushido-driven of the officers.  What a stupid man and stupid concept!  To kill yourself when you can still fight.<br /><br />The one false note in the whole movie was the scene where the character of Lieutenant Colonel Baron Takeichi Nishi talks to a captured American soldier.  That this ever happened is highly dubious (I mean, this American soldier was carrying a flamethrower when he was shot - such soldiers were universally targeted for instant death whenever possible).  It seems to only have been thrown in for two reasons - to balance out an earlier scene where a captured American soldier was beaten and bayoneted to death, and as an opportunity for the Nishi character to engage in some exposition about himself.  OK, Baron Nishi was a very colorful historical character, winner of the Gold Medal in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics in Equestrian show jumping and friend to many Hollywood stars.  But this whole scene just rang false, and people in the theater audience snickered when the Nishi character started speaking Engrish.<br /><br />All in all, this is a truly original work, exploring themes of the Japanese side of WWII that have never been explored before, either by Americans or the Japanese themselves.<br /><br />Japanese works regarding WWII have invariably portrayed the Japanese characters, whether civilian (\\"Grave of the Fireflies\\") or military (the recent movie \\"Otoko-tachi no Yamato\\" and the book \\"Requiem for Battleship Yamato\\", both about the last suicidal mission of the battleship) as tragic but heroic victims of overwhelming American might, and about the biggest Deep Thought that one ever gets out of these Japanese works has been some sort of a vague admission that  \\"all war is bad\\"; there is never any exploration of the possibility that something in Japanese society itself at that time might have been terribly, stupidly evil.<br /><br />Yes, it was the brutal military rulers of Japan who stupidly threw the Japanese people into a war that they could not hope to win, and then stupidly demanded mass suicide when their decisions failed.  Bushido was the underlying principle that led to all of that.  And \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is the first movie ever to bring out these concepts, while showing at the same time its greatest respect for the Japanese soldiers forced to endure under the harsh rule of that military elite.hat this ever happened is highly dubious (I mean, this American soldier was carrying a flamethrower when he was shot - such soldiers were universally targeted for instant death whenever possible).

B0000DJZ9T|4.0|As a bit of context to my review: this was given me as a gift before I really knew anything about Coldplay.  I couldn't name a single song of theirs, although during my first viewing of the DVD I did recognize three or four songs (which I liked, just didn't know who the artist was).<br /><br />I thought the concert was fanstastic.  I got more and more into it as it progressed, partly because I thought the concert itself got better and better, and partly because I come to know the band a little better as I watched, which adds to the concert experience.<br /><br />While I had a few favorite tracks of the concert, there were not any which I classified as one of my all-time favorite concert moments (I own quite a few concert DVDs).  At the same time, there were not any weak moments in the concert, and I was never tempted to skip any tracks.<br /><br />Regarding the extra documentary, I understand the complaints some had that it didn't really include anything new.  But for someone who knew nothing of the band, I enjoyed it and it added to the concert experience.<br /><br />All in all, a very enjoyable conert, definitely worth the purchase.  I finished watching it wanting to watch it again with an increased familarity of the band.
B00005JPCD|5.0|We took our five-year old twins to the cinema to see \\"Happy Feet\\" and they really enjoyed it.    Tells the story of Mumble, an Emperor Penguin. All the other penguins in his tribe are singers, and they use their songs to court mates. Mumble however, voiced by Elijah Wood, can't sing at all but has a gift for tap-dancing - which his tribe cannot understand or appreciate.    Fits in messages about the need to respect diversity and about the environment - yes, I know, it's very politically correct but this doesn't spoil the story.    Works on a number of different levels with a huge number of in-jokes to keep the adults amused. Two which I particuarly appreciated were the use of the song \\"I did it my way\\" to make a point, and a Skua with a tag who explains it in terms of alien abduction.    Also some clever and well-handled perspective shifts: to a human a seal is a cute furry creature but to a penguin a seal is a dangerous monster. The Leopard seals, Elephant seals, and Orcas were all very frightening, but not so much so as to ruin the film for the average small child - at least, my two coped OK and I didn't see any of the other children in the cinema having problems.     The music - most of it in various african-american styles - and animation are out of this world. The pace keeps moving brilliantly, and the big-name voice cast are all excellent.    I strongly recommend this and will be buying the DVD for my children when it becomes available.    Postscript, Easter 2007.    The DVD duly came out and I did buy it for my children as an Easter present; they watched it twice over the Easter weekend. In addition to the film itself there are some excellent extras on the disc, including two new story sequences, \\"Mumble meets a blue whale\\" and \\"A Happy Feet Moment.\\" Perhaps best of all the extras is a delightful dance lesson given by Savion Glover, in which film of Savion is combined with an animated baby Mumble.
B000001GH9|5.0|I've held off on reviewing this Deutsche Grammophon disc for a long time, since I didn't think I could add anything to the praise already lavished on it by the press and my fellow reviewers. Yet, it is the fate of reviewers to ultimately throw in their two cents in spite of all that has come before, so here follow my thoughts on these performances by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra led by James Levine, with Anne-Sophie Mutter on solo violin.<br /><br />Alban Berg's \\"Violin Concerto\\" (1935), with the dedication \\"to the memory of an angel\\", seems to have finally entered the standard repertoire. Written after the death of the young Manon Gropius, daughter of Alma Mahler-Werfel and Walter Gropius, it is a work of constant elegy sometimes tempered with praise of a beautiful young soul, but at other times giving in to the darkest feelings of mourning and catastrophe. Like in all his work, Berg uses the twelve-tone system inherited from his teacher Arnold Schoenberg, but with strong echoes of traditional harmony. Romanticism is abundant in this work too often considered undesirably \\"modernist\\"; it opens with the lushest sounds of clarinet and harp, moves towards the softest touches of strings, and ultimately roars thundering crescendos pregnant with meaning. While the violin is sometimes a sort of protagonist, representing the bloom of youth held down by Fate, often the work is intensely directing us to higher themes outside of the ensemble itself.<br /><br />Since Berg left the door open to traditional harmony, he brings in two objets trouvees that link the work to a long tradition before it. The most readily noticeable is Bach's chorale \\"Es ist genug\\", variations on which provide the basis of the second movement. Another is a Carinthian folk song Berg knew in his youth, when he had an illegitimate child with a family maid, giving the concerto a \\"secret programme\\". This being 2007, when film music has gone to much greater extremes of \\"dissonance\\" than Berg ever approached, the harmonies of the concerto will seem pleasing and elegant to all but the most conservative of classical listeners.<br /><br />There are, of course, many other performances of Berg's concerto out there. But several things set this apart. For one, the digital sound quality is superb, bringing a clarity to a piece too often heard in primitive recordings. And it was recorded after examination of the original sketches in the 1980s revealed that a key part of the work was muddled in the published score. Finally, there is Mutter's technique itself. While she has now grown rather stale and trite, at this time the violinist was at the height of her powers, and this performance is simple flawless.<br /><br />The second piece on the disc is Wolfgang Rihm's \\"Time Chant\\" (1991-92). Here the violin is meant to exhibit nearly vocal characteristics, and when the small orchestra contributes, it is only in the role of filling out a line that is, as Rihm, claims, \\"in essence monophonic\\". The writing for the violin hovers in the heights of its range, playing crystalline sounds in the longest durations. This is actually something unusual for Rihm, as his music is often concerned with movement and energy--see JAGDEN UND FORMEN in DG's \\"20/21\\" series for an excellent work in this vein. Here Rihm amost approaches Alexander Knaifel in the light purity of the writing. I enjoy it immensely, especially played on a top-of-the-line stereo where its fragile beauty shines through, but I'd certainly recommend that people look elsewhere for an introduction to Rihm.<br /><br />This disc is one of the greatest achievements on the CD. It commands so much respect and demand that 15 years after its release, it still has not been lowered to mid-price. It deserves a place in your collection, and the music will undoubtedly find itself a place in your heart as well.ched, the harmonies of the concerto will seem pleasing and elegant to all but the most conservative of classical listeners.  <br /> <br />There are, of course, many other performances of Berg's concerto out there.

Now if we can get a fitting Star Trek replacement....<br /><br />Anyways you get the complete season in widescreen mode that looks great using a progressive scan DVD player and a HD monitor.

076531178X|4.0|Sanderson is a remarkably original writer. I have been reading fantasy for over twenty years now, and it's rare that I run across an author who can still surprise me with sheer inventiveness. Mr. Sanderson has done so with this book, however, inventing a completely new magical system like nothing you're going to run across in any other author's work. The first action scene in this book that involves heavy use of this magical system--a fight scene between Kelsier and various opponents defending a noble's home--is pure joy to read.<br /><br />The characters in this book are vastly superior to those in Mr. Sanderson's first novel, _Elantris_. Vin is believable and sympathetic. Kelsier and his entire crew of socially-conscious thieves are fun to watch, their banter believable, their decisions equally so. You could do a lot worse than spend a couple days immersed in this compelling story.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give it 5 stars, which I badly wanted to do, has to do with the book's conclusion. I don't want to needlessly give away a major plot point, but I think I can safely say that the demise of one of the main characters was both unnecessary and inconsistent with that individual's personality. Not to mention horrendously disappointing. Then there was also the enticing prospect that Mr. Sanderson was writing this book as a clever political allegory, a hope that was also shattered by a startlingly conventional fantasy book ending. (Yes, Virginia, there really is a large, amorphous Bad Thing out there which wants to destroy the world....)<br /><br />That said, I still have to give this book a fairly strong recommendation. It's good, and worth your time.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I was very excited when I put the second disc of this set into my DVD player.  My excitement immediately turned to disappointment when I noticed that the original version of the film was not optimized for widescreen televisions, meaning that there were black bars on the sides and the top and bottom of the picture.  To span the width of the screen you have to use the zoom feature of your television resulting in a subpar image.  Why is the second disc not optimized for 16:9 televisions, when the first disc is?  I will still give it three stars because it is better than not having it at all I guess.
B000BQ7JRA|4.0|This film looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.
0765315246|5.0|This was just an unexpectedly awesome book. It does take about the first 50 pages or so, but once it does, high gear. The sequence when the main character is naming his brain-computer had me laughing out loud. I love the pragmatism of many of the situations the author's presented. Highly recommended for science-fiction lovers.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|My wife adores this movie so I had to give it a try. The movie was ok, but I just don't see what is supposed to be so romantic about it. The movie concerns four daughters who all get married and their mother who is obsessed with getting them to the altar. Two get married to jerks, two of them to nice guys. But the main story revolves around Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, and how they go from hating each other to falling in love. This would be romantic... if they had spent any time together! But they fall completely in hate and love after a few short sporatic conversations, with scarcely any time alone. Maybe that's how people fell in love in the early 19th century, but I just wasn't convinced. I felt like these characters still hardly even knew each other. Now I imagine to make this film a great deal was probably cut out of the book, so those who read the book may not feel like so much is missing.<br /><br />The scenery and costuming is very good, and the acting is top rate, although Donald Sutherland's accent sounds a little American. Definitely a woman's movie, but men can focus on Keira Knightly, who is incredibly beautiful here.
0792839730|4.0|The service from Amazon was excellent. We received the item within days. The movie is one of my favorite WWII movies so I think it is very good.
0446528056|3.0|Sparks has had so many winners it's hard to always hit one out of the park. I enjoyed Dear John, but found it didn't quite stand up to his last couple of novels. (I also HIGHLY recommend his book, Three Weeks with My Brother.)<br /><br />A pretty good barometer is how long it takes you to finish. I've read most of his books in a couple of sittings. This one stuck around on the nightstand for quite a while.<br /><br />Good book, but the bar for Sparks is high. Maybe he'll clear it with his next one.
B000001F75|4.0|In the fall of 1972, Thin Lizzy gambled on recording an Irish folk and recorded their first major hit, the classic \\"Whisky in the Jar\\". This driving version of the song was a curious selection for a single, but from its memorable intro to its \\"here I am in prison\\" conclusion, the song created a new market for the struggling band.  With renewed confidence they recorded their album `Vagabonds of the Western World' which was released in September 1973. The record marked a turning point in the band's career for a number of reasons. It was their last record for Decca, the final bow for Eric Bell as their lead guitarist and hence their last as a power trio. `Vagabonds' was supposed to make or break the band but instead it did neither. It did however force Lynott and Downey to regroup before expanding on their legend.  The lp is very much a hit or miss affair. While it is marked improvement from the previous album, it is still not one of the classics as a whole that the band would later turn out in abundance. Highlights for me would include \\"The Rocker\\", one of the key tracks of Lizzy's career and their future encore number. It is a barnstorming tale of Lynott bravado as only Philip can voice, and revealed one of his most successful characters, the barroom brawler/heartbreaker supreme.  \\"Vagabonds of the Western World\\" is another play on Celtic mythology that Lynott did so well with its magnificent \\"tura loora loora loroli\\" intro and powerhouse \\"blue eyes\\" chorus, an absolute stunner!! For me the most memorable highlight of album #3 is \\"Little Girl in Bloom\\", one of Philip Lynott' most emotional vocals and quite possibly the man's most beautiful poetic accomplishment, a gifted songwriter at the peak of his powers.  \\"Gonna Creep Up on You\\" is a great metal track, the music seems to stalk you as well.  The rest of `Vagabonds' is fair but not great although I love Eric Bell's solo on \\"Hero and the Madman\\" though the song is very odd.  Two lame blues tunes and a so so ballad wrap up this good but not great LP.  As an added bonus on CD, \\"Whiskey\\" is included along with \\"Randolph's Tango\\" which was the other non-lp single of 1973. Special note, \\"Whiskey's\\" B side, \\"Black Boys on the Corner\\", which is an absolutely brilliant hard rock song is here as well.  \\"What you doin' man?\\" \\"Teddy boy you got to roll\\"  \\"Let me tell you the story of a vagabond\\"!!
3822884979|5.0|I love this huge book. It gave me background on the artists that I wasn't expecting, and discovered new artists that I hadn't seen before. Covers a wide spectrum of styles too. It's my #1 coffee-table book.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|How this ever made it to the theatre or even DVD boggles the mind.  It opens with a man screaming, chained in a room.  From there, you will barely get the chance to meet the next characters before they are whisked away to the next torturous scenes to meet predictably grisly ends.<br /><br />You won't worry about them though, as you didn't get a chance to really know them.  Shouldn't you at least care about the people you're watching before the boogeyman gets them?<br /><br />The people who made this are the only ones deserving of a Saw demise.
B000HEWEJO|4.0|My wife loves this movie. It made a perfect stocking stuffer Christmas present that we'll watch for years to come.
B000001DTM|4.0|...but \\"Achtung Baby\\" is not my favorite U2 album. Tons of critics and a huge chunk of the rest of the world claim it is their masterpiece and some rhapsodize about it like it's the second coming of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" and \\"London Calling,\\" but I just can't agree with them. In the U2 canon, I have to place this below much of their earlier work, music that's often dismissed today by eggheads as \\"flag-waving anthem rock.\\"<br /><br />Well, pardon me if I like melodies.<br /><br />U2 is my favorite band. I've been a fan since the release of \\"War.\\" I own all their studio albums (save \\"Zooropa\\") and a few of their DVDs. I try to receive each project with an open mind and ears, and I've read plenty of material by the band on where this one was coming from and what they were shooting for. I appreciate (and own) techno and dance. Disco-funk (which is what \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is, folks) I can deconstruct. But beyond a handful of great songs, this album I just can't connect to musically or lyrically like most of the rest of their catalog. Compared to most bands' stuff, this is magnificent. But on the U2 scale it's only very good.
0618551050|4.0|Many others have rightly praised this book and I've enjoyed all the reviews, but want to emphasize one point suggested by others.  The best part of Smolin's book for those of us not conversant with the math is that he uses such interesting analogies.  They help me try to fit his ideas into my other reading. <br /> <br />One of the reviewers mentioned his uncertainty about some of the analogies and I would like to see other physicists and mathematicians critique them.  These would help me evaluate what I read. <br /> <br />I've been reading such 'popularizations' for over 20 years and my observation is that each author uses different analogies to try to describe the least intuitive aspects of his/her ideas.  Over the years, these analogies seem to have 'matured' (i.e. improved).  While I'm not in the field, I can't help thinking that some answers will come when someone uses the right analogy. <br />
0739334085|5.0|While I was reading this, I was also reading Dreams from My Father.  That, too, is a compelling, but much more autobiographical, book.  Audacity of Hope takes a thoughtful look at some of our most persistent problems. Knowing some of Obama's background helped put things in perspective. I liked the fact that he is well-qualified to talk about many of these issues since he has experienced much of it in his own life.  His caring for people and his desire to work with them to help them solve their problems came across clearly.  I read the audio condensed version read by the author and liked it so well, I now intend to read the print version.
0307277887|5.0|I bought the book because I just finished watching the Showtime series.  I was expecting the book to be really close to what took place in the series but it turns out the book has a different twist than the series did.  The different twist was still excellent and it was nice to have a completely different ending than what I was expecting.  Well read and an excellent read.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I found this adaptation of Jane Eyre to be quite good.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not find Toby Stephens to be that handsome - I think it's because I remember him as the villain in that awful James Bond movie.  He certainly has the dark looks and imparted the brooding character of Mr. Rochester.  The cynical view that his casting was influenced because of his parentage is unfair.  I did see him once in a production at Lincoln Center and once at BAM and I thought he had a dynamic stage presence, not to mention masses of talent.  I thought that the casting of Ruth Wilson was on point - she is plain (enough) and small.  She is a little on the thin side which gives the impression of never having eaten enough and especially when compared to Toby Stephens she's tiny.  And she portrays Jane with a quiet intelligence that is perfect.  I especially liked that she is a new actress for me.  And I loved little Georgie Henley... she actually looks like Ruth Wilson's younger self.<br /><br />Many of the reviewers have noted the lack of social commentary as compared to the book.  The way I see it, this is an \\"adaptation\\" and the writer and director focused on the story and Jane's own journey.  A five hundred page book is impossible to condense into a four hour version of anything - massive amounts of pruning must be made else it would be a twelve hour program.  I was disappointed that Jane's childhood passed in less than twenty minutes.  On the other hand, the opening sequence of her in the desert (which confused me at the beginning) and then her turning the page to hear the sounds of a jungle was inspired.  It really conveyed the sense that Jane escaped into books and stories.<br /><br />This production took many liberties with the story but it still worked - Bertha is not the \\"clothed hyena\\" with a purple face, Mr. Rochester did not play the part of the gypsy, we never meet Ms. Temple.  However, much of the dialogue from the script came directly from the book.  On the whole, I thought this production was well acted, beautifully filmed, and a sincere retelling of a well-loved book.ok.  On the whole, I thought this production was well acted, beautifully filmed, and a sincere retelling of a well-loved book.   <br />
0451527046|5.0|All four things mentioned above can be found at your fingertips with Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island.\\"  Before Johnny Depp stumbled off of the Black Pearl, before Errol Flynn took us on swashbuckling journeys, and even before \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey took to the water, Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins thrilled fans of high-seas adventure.  \\"Treasure Island\\" tells the story of one young Jim Hawkins.  It starts off in the simple setting of a family-owned inn where we are introduced to Billy Bones, an old seadog who has a secret.  After a couple of visits from some strange characters, a confrontation occurs and a treasure map lands into the hands of Hawkins.  From there, we set sail on the Hispaniola with Hawkins, the squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, the sea cook Silver, and a whole slew of pirates and scoundrels in general.  All are after the treasure of Captain Flint, who graciously marked his treasure map with an \\"X\\" to show the way to the riches.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tale of intrigue, double-crossing, greed, and swordplay.  Promoted as a children's book, I'm sure that any adult will find this story captivating as well.  Robert Louis Stevenson is a literary legend and deserves that honor based on this book alone.  However, if you read this book and are interested to read more of Stevenson's work, check out \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" \\"Kidnapped,\\" and \\"The Black Arrow.\\"  He also wrote a number of traveling books which are also fun to read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I don't know what all these negative people are talking about and so I just had to respond: I LOVE this CD!!!  It's creative, fun and really makes you feel like dancing.  In fact, the first track on this CD, \\"Wind It Up\\" is used in the hip hop dance class I'm taking and when this song comes on, we become absolutely energized! \\"Wind It Up\\" is one of those songs that borrows from a classic musical (in this case, The Sound of Music... remember that yodeling song about the goat herd: Yodel-ay-dee Yodel-ay-dee Yodel-oh).   <br /> <br />This CD has such a great mix of all of the many creative personalities of Gwen Stefani.  There are fast hip hop songs you can dance to, there are a few songs that sound like rap and there were two songs that my first thought was that I could imagine Madonna singing them.  I thought it was great and this is currently one of my favorite CDs.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Let me put it this way. Critics are people who have no talent, criticizing those who do, and I am not a critic.<br /><br />Buy this film, and I am sure you will enjoy it.

B0000041LL|3.0|Well, I really do not understand those who acclaim this recording with 5 stars. I sincerely urge you to go back to Busch or Budapest or the Lindsays or the Vegh or the Takacs. <br />Concerning the late string quartets which should be core of this recording, I will give this recording 2 stars. 1 more star is for their Op.18 quartets. <br />They can surely play this music, yes, but I highly doubt that they \\"know\\" and feel deeply at heart this music. <br />A safe and boring and idle interpretation of the music. I want more intensity, more depth, more spiritied approach to this kind of music, but the Quartetto Italiano fails in every aspect that I can appreciate. <br />Listen to the slow movement of the late quartets. Well, slow, but not touching. Especially that variation movent in Op.131. Very dull performance. And listen to the fast movements. Again, no concrete music making here. <br /> <br />These people shine in their Haydn or maybe Debussy or Ravel, certainly not in Beethoven. Overall, they are just average performances, for the late quartets, a huge dissapointment.
B000GY729M|1.0|I was a huge fan of the Killers' first disc, HOT FUSS. It has a good vibe to it, and a new brand of New Wave. However, I was MAJOR dissapointed with the new disc Sam's Town. Instead of original songwriting, this album sounds like they took the song \\"Smile like you mean it\\" and decided to make an entire album out of it. There are only two listenable songs on the disc, \\"Bones\\" and the last song. Otherwise, AVOID.
0812550706|5.0|This is probably the sixth or seventh time I have read Ender's Game, and it gets better each time.  Every time I read it there is something new I notice or some other nuance that I had not caught before.  This book about the raising of a military genius to save humanity, and all the hardships he must go through--all between the ages of six to twelve--is astounding. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.
068485743X|5.0|I bought this book hoping it was more than the others I bought. The others had a 10-20 idea stretched out to a whole book. This was the opposite. Each chapter, even each page is packed with concise to-the-point info. These reviewers who say it's only ok must be world class error free novelists. For the rest of us down here on earth, it's a must have. There was a review that said \\"doesn't teach much about writing\\",.....eh did you actually open the book? Most of it teaches about writing. I've learned more about writing (well) from this book than from books specifically about how to write well. <br /> <br />It points out all sorts of common problems and I find myself screaming \\"no no that's how I write, argh, now I have to rethink yet another thing\\", but he's got more insight (and books published) than I do so I read on. <br /> <br />The book is not entirely about just the first five pages. It's about common mistakes that show up throughout the manuscript and if an editor sees it within the F5P then the manuscript will surely be chock full of mistakes like that.
0312117337|5.0|It just doesn't get any better!!  This is an incredibly rich set of images that instruct gently, with beauty -- the way learning is SUPPOSED to be! Even difficult reflections of self are delivered with tenderness which, I believe, is a result of the artist's loving intention.  You WON'T be disappointed!
B000H5V8DG|3.0|Alias was such a great show and when I heard the idea of this Box Set, I immediately had to have it.  I previously had the first 2 seasons on DVD and liked the packaging.  Wasn't as keen on the packaging from season 3 on.  So once I received this my excitement went down the drain so to say.  I had numerous discs with scratches and figerprint smudges.  If you go to the discussion about scratched discs in Rambaldi set, you'll find some of the problems numerous people have had with this set.  Some people got lucky with this set, something I thought would happen for me but it wasn't meant to be.  An idea would have been for the discs to be in slim line dvd cases (like the ones in the Futurama box sets) and maybe cut down to HDDVD or BluRay size.  That will probably be how they do it if it does get released on to one of those formats.  So after the long diatribe - Great show, but be careful about buying the set as the set only comes with a bonus disc with an hour and 30 minutes of special features.  The exclusive book isn't worth it really in the end either. I believe a form on imdb tells you what was printed and learned from the book. The price dictates a great deal if you don't have all the sets.  If you do take into consideration, the problems discussed in the discussion below.
1572814136|5.0|FAR superior to the Universal Waite or the \\"regular\\" RWS deck.  Colors are BEAUTIFUL, VIBRANT and ENGAGING.  If you're going to buy a traditional deck, THIS IS IT, look no further!!

0446677450|5.0|Surely if you've been in a bookstore in the last few years you've heard of this book and the series of others that follow it. I read this book years ago and if I had to pick a book that most got me thinking about the world differently this would be it. Through a great mix of story telling from his childhood and practical if not conventional advice and logic Robert shares lessons which I've used and put into practice since reading these books and will continue to do so. Not all of the books in the series have quite the punch of this one - Cashflow Quadrant and Rich Dad's Prophecy are great, but you won't find them as easy going. And if you learn well through games like me you've got to try the Rich Dad game - Cashflow. I love it!

1881273156|5.0|Since reading it I've made almost all my friends buy it and I must admit, it's the first \\"non business\\" book I'd read in a long time. It talks about how people express love to their partner in different ways - I know my husband and I sure do! From there it goes to explain the different languages and how to find out what is the primary language of your partner. I was easily able to pick out mine, my husband's was a little more difficult - but I got it right. It then goes on to show you how to communicate in your partner's language to make sure they're feeling loved. Read it, but then put it into practice!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Once more the Brits have given us a quirky soul chanteuse who combines simple instrumentation and heartbreaking honest emotion. Think Sade crossed with India.Arie or a less bombastic Anita Baker. Already a multiple Grammy nominee including Best New Artist, her international hit Put Your Records On is just now breaking wide open stateside, pushing aside another stand-out Like A Star, Just a lovely, delicate, soulful debut tour de force. Don't miss it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|All right. This has been stewing within me for several years, and I'm finally going to put my two cents in about this episode of Star Wars. <br /> <br />I saw this movie for the first time at midnight near to the first night it came out, courtesy of my father's job. :) I enjoyed every moment, even Jar Jar who later came to annoy me. In fact, I saw it three or four more times in the theatres. <br /> <br />From what I have read and heard from critics is that this is the worst Star Wars film to date. They say that the acting is horrible, the special effects try to cover a botched-up story, that it can never compare with Episodes IV, V, and VI of yore, and that George Lucas has lost his touch. <br /> <br />Let me break this down by my standards: <br /> <br />The acting is horrible? Though some of the acting in Episodes II and III leave a bit to be desired (George Lucas needs to stop writing love scenes until he learns that \\"You're tormenting me\\" is a stupid line!), can you really say that the acting in the original trilogy was any better? No, you really can't. Now, I love the original trilogy, but seriously, some of that acting was pretty bad. (\\"But I wanted my power converters!\\") Everyone seems to really hate Jake Lloyd as Anakin the most. People, he was TEN YEARS OLD at the time! He did an awesome job for a ten-year-old. Honestly, stop judging him alongside huge Hollywood actors that are decades older than he was. I haven't seen any better acting from children anyway. On to the next. <br /> <br />A botched-up story? I won't deny that under the special effects there isn't a really STRONG story, but remember, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is supposed to be a set-up for the following films, not a stand-alone epic. Think about \\"A New Hope,\\" the first of the original. It was also a set-up for the following films, and it also did not have an exactly epic storyline. \\"The Phantom Menace\\" flowed much more in the epic vein than \\"A New Hope\\" ever did.  <br /> <br />It can't compare withthe original trilogy? That isn't true. The special effects have leaped ahead, and the story is every bit as good. But for those of you who were raised with the original trilogy, you couldn't disagree more, right? Take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You were raised with Luke, Leia and Han Solo (as was I), and growing up with those films gave you a natural bias against the newer Star Wars films. You expected to see more of the same at the theatre, and when you didn't it either saddened you or plain made you mad. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, you just need to realize that you have that bias whether you like it or not. If you didn't, I'm sure you would have liked \\"The Phantom Menace.\\"  <br /> <br />Besides this, you have to respect that this film as well as Episodes II and III have brought in a whole new generation of Star Wars fans. Now, some of you may be thinking \\"They don't know anything about the REAL Star Wars!\\" Not true, so stop thinking like you were the creator of Star Wars. <br /> <br />George Lucas lost his touch? That is a very wrong thing to say. Not only did Lucas give you the oh-so-wonderful original trilogy, this is HIS story. He knew what he wanted to happen in it. To say that he has lost his touch is to insult his story and so insult the original trilogy that you all love so much more. Without George Lucas, you wouldn't have Star Wars AT ALL. Now, you may disagree with some of his ideas, but it is ultimately HIS story, not yours. Besides, saying that gives you a very arrogant appearance. <br /> <br />Now, with that out of the way, this really is a gorgeous film. I can't recommend it more. Before you rebel against it, try to give it an unbiased chance. You may find yourself changing your mind.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|First, I'll admit I am not a fan of Marvel's Ultimate line of Comics, in fact, there are very few curent comics I want to read. They lack the sense of fun and adventure that comics are supposed to have. <br /> <br />But, this DVD does have the sense of adventure and is definately fun to watch. Yes it is \\"modern\\" re-telling of the origin of Iron Man, but not only does it keep the original \\"Grey Knight\\" suit, but also explains how he could manage to build it so fast (hint: he has had some practice in armor building, just has not played superhero yet). <br /> <br />The main villain is the Mandarin and his five elementals. Mandarin has also been re-imagined a little, he only has five rings, four with elemental powers and a surprising fifth ring. The elementals are vey well done and provide an excellent enemy to show off the abilities of Iron Man's classic Gold & Red suit and the Aquatic suit. <br /> <br />There is violence and some implied nudity (this is Tony Stark), but it is a very good DVD and I am looking forward to the next Dr Strange DVD, which I do hope is not the last Marvel DVD we see in this series.
0743455967|4.0|You don't have to like or write the sort of suspense/thriller fiction Stephen King is famous for in order for a budding writer to get something out of this book.  If you're going to do something, study the masters, of course!  Stephen King goes into great detail the process of becoming and being a writer, and part of the reason why I trusted him on this is because I was so impressed with how he treated the writing process in his novel \\"Misery\\".  He does go a bit much into his early childhood which is not all that interesting (except for the horrifying stories about getting his ears lanced, no *wonder* he grew up so twisted ;) but otherwise he's got some excellent advice for the unpublished.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Well I'm sorry some reviewers felt the leads were too attractive.  That didn't occur to me.  It was a very moving and dramatic interpetation of this compelling and offbeat story with perfect period details and high drama.  We enjoyed it thoroughly and look forward to the DVD.
B00005JPDU|3.0|\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a based-on-truth story about Chris Gardner, freelance salesman of portable bone density tracer. But carrying a heavy machine around in San Francisco is a hard work especially when he has to send his son to the daycare center, and not every doctor is interested in his `gismo.' Down on his luck, he accepts an unpaid job in the training program of a stockbroking house, but in spite of (or because of) his eagerness, his wife become more estranged, giving a cold shoulder to him. <br /> <br />Will Smith is perfect as Chris Gardner, who eventually has to sleep in a public restroom in the subway with his son, making him believe that this is a `cave.' Because of the warmth and humor in Will Smith's performance and the visible rapport with his son (played by his real-life son Jaden), the film is not depressing as you might believe. Still some people (not me) might feel so looking at Chris doing jobs as unpaid intern, hit by a car in the street, and still going back to work even though he is uncertain of his future (only one applicant will pass the test).  <br /> <br />Italian-born director Gabriele Muccino avoids sugary sentiments in this Horatio Alger-like tale, and at times Chris' zealous attitudes look pathetic (don't miss one scene where Chris is seen dragging his son to catch a bus). It is clear that Muccino is trying to present his own version of American dream. The film gets really credible and its satire becomes biting when the company's bosses casually ask him to do things like lending five dollars. The bosses are not bad people (no `villains' appear), but they just don't see the vast gaps (financial and otherwise) between them and Chris even though they are both wearing suits. <br /> <br />However, like many major studio films made by non-American directors brought in Hollywood, we can see director is trying to be different in contents, but we don't see in what way exactly. I read many reviews on this film, and though many used such words as inspirational and uplifting, some people said the film is depressing. The fact is `The Pursuit of Happyness' could be both, not content with being either of them. After all, what made Chris apply for the stockbroker's trainee course first? Was it a red Ferrari or his son's happiness? <br /> <br />We are not sure of that. We are sure of Will Smith's heart-warming turn, however, and that is probably the greatest thing in `The Pursuit of Happyness' which is a feel-good movie, but there is somewhere in the film an untold part you can vaguely sense.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|The previews you see for the Saw during commercial breaks on the television are misleading because Saw is *not* a typical \\"maniac with a saw comes out of the closet and attacks helpless horny teens\\" horror.  This is truly a disturbing film about a smart and dangerous killer who gives two people (who are chained to the floor of a bathroom) certain strategies that need to be completed in order to succeed at the killers twisted little game.  It's unreal. <br /> <br />Every time the two guys think they found a way to get out of the situation, they quickly find out that the killer already found a way to trick them.  The killer is always one step ahead of them.   <br /> <br />You will find out that the weapon of choice, the saw, is to be used in a deeply disturbing (and cleverly written) way.  Throughout the movie, the killer plays these sick little games with the two guys trapped in the bathroom, and it's truly something that will disturb anyone because it shows you exactly what the sickest kind of people on earth can be capable of.   <br /> <br />I was truly surprised that this movie was a more creative kind of horror than what the previews seem to show us.  Watch it.  It's an interesting and nicely created horror film.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|When taking a first glance at the Covenant, it's not hard to see how bad a film this truly is.  Directed by Renny Harlin, who once showed a promising career with Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea, and the Long Kiss Goodnight; but has faltered as of late with recent fiascos like Exorcist: The Beginning and Mindhunters; the Covenant revolves around a group of descended male witches who look as if they just walked out of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog.  Their posh lifestyle is threatened to come to an end when an adversary rears his head, or something like that.  The Covenant is one of those films that you just wonder how it got made.  Harlin's action set pieces are just plain sloppy and uninspired, making one wonder if this really is the same guy who brought us the aforementioned films.  As for the rest of the film, including the atrocious acting, lame CGI effects, and overuse of thunder and lightning effects; well, you get the idea.  Don't waste your time.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|.. and just great.  <br />'Not Too Late' sets the new standards in appreciation of Norah Jones and her unbelievable talent. And her unique style. And her great band. And everything her. <br /> <br />Therefore it deserves more that 5 stars. More like a night sky full of stars. And even that wouldn't be enough. <br />I've pre-ordered this album on iTunes because I had a feeling this one will be something to hear, something special. And, oh boy, it's unbelievable.  <br /> <br />Perfectly tuned jazz piano, occasional brass, strings, whispering guitar, percussion, dimmed lights, subtle tension in the air, sensuous voice and heaps, heaps of imagination ... this album carries your soul in and around beautiful places of Norah Jones' world. <br /> <br />How she does that? Where all that comes from? Don't ask me that, I have no idea .. or maybe, I finally have some clue about it.  <br />Remember her first album? Everyone said it was amazing and she a young lady of a great talent. Moody jazzy tunes, she sits before the piano, lots of emotions.  <br /> <br />Everyone was expecting the next step, and when it did come, many were confused. She dared to taste something new! Bluegrass?! Yes, new tunes, new mood, new lyrics, all new Norah. Norah was going home, and she has every right to do so. <br /> <br />And now, this third album .. has the story finally settled somewhere, and where this album fits in, you may ask? Where she actually belongs? <br /> <br />This album finally reveals -- Norah Jones lives in a parallel universe made of imagination, intriguing and smart lyrics, warm emotions, courageous thoughts and vivid colours. And her own style. 'Not Too Late' flies somewhere in between two first albums, but it rises up and beyond. My favourite song? Actually all of them. Every song is a surprise and this whole album is a necklace made of precious gems. <br /> <br />Enjoy it and try to relax -- you can't fit Norah Jones into any particular cliche -- she is better than that, she issmarter than that and deserves your utmost respect and appreciation.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|Pain of Salvation is a band that has a tendency to shock some people. From the incredible ability of the band's singer, Daniel Gildenlow, to go from guttural barking to saccharine-sweet operatic vocals--to the unusual influences showing where you would least expect them, especially in one of progressive metal's best known bands--PoS can always be counted on to mess with your expectations. <br /> <br />Scarsick is no exception to this rule, but what makes it stand out from the rest of this remarkable band's catalog is that it goes further than any would have imagined possible. From a band that embodies change, this is the hugest leap they've ever taken. It's disturbing, shocking, and as always, keenly insightful.  <br /> <br />On first listen, this album was the biggest disappointment of my life. I hated it like I've never hated an album before. I called all my friends and told them how much I hated it. And I realized, if I was that irritated with it, something had to be wrong. So I listened to it again. And again. And I came to the conclusion... that it's brilliant. <br /> <br />For those who are uninformed: this album IS The Perfect Element Part II. It is only one half of the second part, however, following the story of the male main character from the first TPE as he descends into insanity. The gist of it is that \\"he\\" (the only name given for the character) blames society at large for his problems. This certainly gives Gildenlow a chance to vent, which he does like he's never done before. At first glance the lyrical content may remind some of System of a Down or even the dreaded Green Day-- but there's much more to it. I'll leave the ultimate surprise up to listeners to figure out, but let me just say it's far more similar thematically to Operation: Mindcrime or 2112 than it is to American Idiot. Remember above all that Gildenlow is a vocal actor, and that he's telling  stories from the perspective of his characters.  <br /> <br />The music is where this album really shines. It took quite a few spins to get used to PoS's new style, and to be perfectly honest, my first reaction was anger. The band takes influences from places they've never drawn from before in order to continue to evolve their style, but they also go places never gone before by any band. Not a single note on this album is stale-- from the seemingly out-of-place disco beat woven seamlessly into \\"Disco Queen\\" to the haunting, atmospheric but still bone-crushing \\"Enter Rain\\".  <br /> <br />For the open-minded listener, Scarsick will challenge your expectations, it will break your heart, and ultimately it will take you on one of the best musical journeys of 2007. Don't miss it.

0618680004|3.0|From Richard Dawkins, one expects the surgeon's scalpel & not so much the soldier's sword. Needless to say, then, that the cut is less than clinical in this book which I thought would be full of interesting theories & explanations - which it is - & empty of rhetorical, at times, personal content - which it is not.<br /><br />Dawkins does a very good job of falsifying (again, like so many other books by scientists have done) the religious myth behind the origins of the earth & the subsequent speciation. Granted, he does not convincingly connect all the dots as he admits himself but does enough to justify why science is better at this game.<br /><br />The more interesting & funny chapters - or scathing, depending on which side you're on - are on how morality is NOT a religious prerogative. There are very interesting excerpts from research published in a book called Moral Minds, but the hilarious bits are really when Dawkins begins to tear apart the Bible as the source of Christian morality. There are, further, very illuminating illustrations on the evolutionary roots of altruism - which is kind of counter-intuitive at first look, but makes a lot of sense with Dawkins's explanations & examples.<br /><br />Having established that both the universe & our moral sense are better explained without religion, Dawkins then gets into murky waters in particularly two areas - linking war to religion when he talks about Adolph Hitler & his violence stemming from Anti-Jew sentiments which he admits might have been a populist thing to do. Yet, he says, 'probably' we'll find that there is a relation between the two. He goes on to say that there is no Historical precedent of an atheist making war. Perhaps, Mao Tse Tung would object to that. Even though Dawkins's judgment is  'probably' right, he builds a very weak case.<br /><br />Again, while he tries to do away with the consolation element of religion, what he ends up doing is expose the circular logic that this is built around. Again, he establishes that it is wrong, but fails to either explain the 'insecurity' that houses such belief or what to do about this human need, & if science or rationality can take its place. The existential outlook is definitely desirable but then so is a saintly life.<br /><br />The other conclusion which is preposterous - because Dawkins himself does not provide data to support it - is how religion cannot be practiced in moderation. This seems true only in a theoretical sense, but practically I think many people are happy to dawn the religious hats for festivities & the like, & be more than willing to go on with stem cell research.<br /><br />I'm definitely on Dawkins's side, but I think that this could have been a better, more-researched-&-less-argued book.<br /><br />S!round.

B00004CWO8|5.0|This is such an amazing new take on Swan Lake, a must see.  Matthew Bourne's choreography is exciting and thrilling.  A fresh modern remake of the classic Swan Lake with a male cast.  Adam Cooper is hypnotic, and beautiful.  Words can't explain how much I enjoyed this ballet.
B000002HK4|5.0|Change\\" is an ep from Dream Theater that is longer than many regular albums.  The centerpiece is the 24 minute magnum opus new studio track \\"A Change Of Seasons\\".  The rest of the album is rounded out by a bunch of live cover songs.  In lesser hands these covers would be nothing special, but Dream Theater takes the songs that influenced them and make them their own.  The title track is a tour de force conceptual piece that to me ranks right up there with the best stuff the band has done.  The track had actually been around the band for a while, but they never really had room to fit it on to any of their previous studio albums.  Everything about it is great instrumentally, vocally, and lyrically.  A picture of the band at their best.  Keys man Kevin Moore has left the band by this album being replaced by Derek Sherinian (Planet X, Alice Cooper, Billy Idol).   Sherinian's somewhat more aggressive keyboard style fits the band perfectly.  The live covers run the gamut of progressive oriented classic rock and are all performed brilliantly.  Elton John's \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" (on of Elton's finest tunes), Deep Purples' \\"Perfect Strangers\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"The Rover\\", `Achilles Last Stand\\", and \\"The Song Remains The Same\\".  The album closes with a medley of Pink Floyd's \\"In The Flesh\\", Kansas \\"Carry on My Wayward Son\\", Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", Journey's \\"Lovin Touchin Squeezin\\", Dixie Dregs \\"Cruise Control\\" and Genesis's \\"Turn It On Again\\".  The band sounds like they are having a blast playing these songs and they put their own unique stamp on all of them.  Since this is not a full studio album it may not be essential Dream Theater, but it is well worth owning.
B000000XB9|5.0|Fantastic collection.  <br /> <br />No one can do 'Heard it through the Grapevine' like Creedence. That wonderful understated anger and menace.  <br /> <br />
B000002HPT|5.0|The band took a 3 year break between full studio albums and the result was \\"Falling Into Infinity\\".  Derek Sharnian was fully entrenched in the keyboard role by this album and the rest of the lineup stayed the same.  I know fans of the band who call this the \\"sell out\\" album.  It does appear somewhat more commercial than previous efforts with a significant amount of shorter songs finding their way onto the album.  Still there is one track over 8 minutes and two that top the 12 minute mark, to appease fans of the band's epics.  Personally I think this album gets a bad rap and ranks right up there with the rest of their catalogue.  The record company was putting pressure on them to come up with a hit for this one.  Although the band did bow slightly on the material most of the album is still very strong.  One thing that is a bit unusual about this one is that it contains some of the best ballads the band has ever done.  \\"Hollow Years\\", \\"Take Away My Pain\\", \\"Anna Lee\\" are all beautiful and really show off James Labrie's vocal abilities.  Of the rockers the highlight of the album is the final track \\"Trail Of Tears\\" written by bass player John Myung.  This is a top notch track that clocks in at over 13 minutes closing the album with a bang.  Other highlights include \\"Peruvian Skies\\", \\"Lines In The Sand\\", and one of the heaviest songs the band has ever done \\"Burning My Soul\\".  There is also some rather average material here.  The instrumental \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" is no \\"Ytse Jam\\", and the ballad \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\" does not stand up to the others on the album either.  These are minor blemishes though on what is for the most part a solid DT album that is sometimes underrated by fans.
0307341542|5.0|\\"Sharp Objects\\" is like a snow ball going down hill as this novel gathers, forms and twirls into shape and shadows and then it hits a rock and veers and adds more silhouettes: PERFECT.  And I swear the reader must turn to the next page.  The story told has reality and scares the devil right out of the reader.  Now of course; this by no means causes the reader to put the book down.  You can feel, smell and taste the ambiance of the Victorian mansion.  The characters are visual in your mind.  I had put this book aside to save to read: mostly because of the description inside the front of the flap: what a shame (but also a magnificent surprise); I would have read it much sooner if I had only known that the flap description does not justice to this novel.  But, then again I'm not sure that is possible to review the book in three paragraphs. However, Stephen King's (which I read after reading the book) assessment on the back cover of the book most certainly does a fine job of it; thus, I'll borrow King's last sentence: \\"An admirably nasty piece of work, elevated by sharp writing and sharper insights\\".  And the narrative is sharp, the whodunit is sharp, the characters are sharp, the discourse sharp: don't miss reading this GEM!  And I'm not giving it way, it will be still be a great read in a year; and it will be still razor-sharp as the first read again.  Though I probably will not drink \\"sweet tea\\" for a month or two.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Being a long time lover of the works of Charlotte Bronte I have seem almost every version of Jane Eyre ever made and read the novel more than once. Up until this month I would have laughed out loud at the thought of finding a version of Jane Erye that could even hold a candle to the BBC Timothy Dalton Version of Jane Eyre (yes the stage and technical qualities are not up to modern standards but the acting, oh the acting). Well I stand corrected. The new Masterpiece theatre version was a delight! No it is not exactly like the BBC version, but that's what makes it so delightful. It is not a copy of anything. Yes I do feel this new version is more passionate and physically expressive but with these actors you can feel it as a natural progression of their story. It's love scenes, very tame by modern standards, are skillfully and delicately done.  Okay- let's face it Timothy Dalton was not ugly and neither is this Rodchester, but you will hear no complaints from me on that end. I would imagine it is no easy task finding an actor who is generally unattractive but who can produce such a romantic effect. I know, I know that was one of the main points of the novel but lets face it you don't have all eternity to cast a movie.
0307237699|3.0|A Floating space city  is certainly an entertaining idea...but that's just it.  The tone of te book borders on audaciuosness and a plug for the presidency. Some of the political ideas are interesting and certainly cause for debate, but they highlight Barack's inexperience and almost tease you wih a child-like approach to his platform.  Even though I disagree with the some of tennants and suggestions, it is still worth taking the time to read this book.

0596007124|5.0|The introduction says you need to know java (or at least C#) to get the most out of this book.  That may be, but I found the explanations perfectly understandable, even though I do not know any java or C#.    Before, I read the original design patterns book by the gang of four, but I got 10 times more out of \\"Head First Design Patterns\\".  Actually, the book introduction includes a hand-written note from the marketing department that the book is for ANYONE with a credit card -- the marketing department is more on the money.  I think this book is for anyone with a credit card who wants to put design patterns to work, whether they know java, C# or not.

B00011D1OA|5.0|I think of this musical as revolutionary, startling, glaring, and visually out of this world. One of its scenes brings me to the state that I can only describe as \\"esthetical orgasm\\" if I ever had one. It is gorgeous, intelligent, and one of the most beloved and brilliant romantic comedies. It's got music that makes you want to dance all night, and it's got an actress who possessed class, style and the kind of beauty and charm that would never be reincarnated after she was gone. \\"My Fair Lady\\" (1964) directed by George Cukor is a great musical but is perfect no matter what genre you are looking at - Comedy / Family / Musical / Romance / Drama - it's got something for everyone - for all ages, for all eras, for all countries, for all continents. I have a friend. We almost never agree upon any movie - anything I like he would usually stamp as \\"rubbish\\". There is not too much to reply to this argument but when we both watch the \\"Opening Alcott Race\\" scene in \\"My Fair Lady\\" with its harmony in white-black-gray (and who knew that color gray has so many shades and nuances), and then the harmony gets slightly distorted by Henry Higgins's brown suit and then as apotheosis, Eliza appears in an incredible black/white dress with a tiny red bow which completes this harmony, this feast of colors (and there are only five of them but you would think there are myriads) and that little bow is a last stroke, the stroke of a visual genius and that is magic...Every time during this scene I see the tears on my cynic-friend's eyes and I know that we both witnessed incredible moment created by the power of the human imagination.

Aint No Sunshine is out of this world! I cannot believe he was just 13yrs old when he sang it. <br />What amazes me about Michael Jackson, and what a lot of people fail to appreciate, is how each album of his is completely different. The sound, the image, the look...everything is different with each album. He's never stuck to a \\"tried & tested\\" method and has never been afraid to experiment. Sadly, this same characteristic has earned him a lot of criticism. Someday, people will understand.
B00009MGGP|5.0|Francis Urquart is Chief Wip when Maggie Thatcher ends her reign.  Francis has been happy with his position and the new Prime Minister has premised a posting. But when the promise proves empty, Francis begins to see his wife's point that he is the most qualified for the position.  Not only qualified, but devious enough to secure the position while appearing to be completely loyal. <br /> <br />We then follow Francis as he schemes his way through British politics, the press and his acquaintances.  Look for all of the transition scenes showing rats pawing around London.  But as cold and calculating as Francis is, he manages to get touched by a young journalist.  Will he manage to pull off his secret coup without being found out?  Ah, that is left for the viewer. <br /> <br />If Francis succeeds or not is minor.  This black comedy is about the doing and not the final goal.  It is a voyage and one that is as entertaining as any conceived.  The cast is superb and the acting impeccable.  While the Parliamentary proceeding has a basis in fact one can only hope that the behind-the-scenes reality not as it is portrayed here.  Lovers of black comedy with love this one as Francis Urquart is that wonderful achievement, a villain you love to hate and hate to love.  You want him to succeed and fail at the same time.

0740748475|5.0|Firstly, Calvin reminds me so much of my 4-year-old, as they both are highly intelligent yet have their own highly developed sense of naughtiness. I love the way Watterson integrates Calvin's imagination into the strip; the glimpses of an adult Calvin and Susie, or the creatures who live in Calvin's stomach, are priceless. I love the way Watterson uses Calvin to simultaneously critique the media-obsessed culture AND to celebrate the simple joys of the outdoors, or goofing off. It's like there are two Calvins, the TV junkie and the outdoorsman ... like some adults I know.  <br /> <br />The advantages of this huge box set are many. We get to enjoy full-size daily strips and huge Sunday strips in full color. By laying out every strip from beginning to end we can see the continuity of themes but also the progression in style; the characters are drawn differently in the beginning, enough that my daughter was taken aback by it. We also see how Watterson experimented with the space available to him; by Volume 3 he was conciously trying to utilize the space in more dynamic ways. <br /> <br />There isn't much downside to this collection. The volumes are kind of enormous, and it can be difficult to curl up in bed with one. (although it's a great meta-moment when you are curled up in bed with Volume 3, reading the strip in which Calvin and Hobbes are curled up in bed reading comics). And there are no tabs in the slipcase to help you remove the books. In these regards, I think the Complete Peanuts set is somewhat superior, in that the books are smaller and are easier to handle.

B000A2W1X2|4.0|Not much to add to previous reviews, except that this storyline really held my attention.  I wasn't entirely certain where it was going, at various points along the way.  That in itself made it absorbing to me.   <br /> <br />I will say this;  I first really became aware of Stephen Dillane in this film, and while it is definitely slanted to be the female character's tale, and Sophie Marceau is great in it, I was struck by the perfection of Mr. Dillane's expressions at certain moments.  On watching again, I rather wished that we had seen more of his reactions to her, rather than the many shots in which we clearly see her face, and his is either hidden or in profile.  I think that he is one of the most under-rated actors around; he has the ability to embody the characters that he plays to such a degree that his acting is totally true and natural.  Perhaps that is the reason that he hasn't achieved the fame his skills deserve, he is one of those who can make you forget he is acting -- he makes it seem easy and real.

B00005JPBD|4.0|\\"Volver\\" is a family drama set in Spain in which the protagonists wrestles with the continuing effect of dark secrets. The movie opens in a cemetery in which dozens of women, struggling against a fierce windstorm (metaphor! metaphor!), wipe dust and grime from the tombstones, presumably in preparation for a religious observance. We learn that the parents of Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) died in a tragic fire years before, an event that stands at the center of the drama. As the movie unwinds, the fire is at the heart of everything - Raimunda's aversion to news stories about fires, the ability of a blind and senile old aunt to take care of herself, the desire of a city-dwelling sister to interview her cousin on a confessional TV show. Meanwhile, there are rumors that the ghost of Raimunda's dead mother has been appearing to villagers.<br /><br />Saying much more would ruin the story. Suffice it to say that the cast is varied and wonderful - a true family. Wonderful characters interweave throughout the story. Paula is a shy teenager who is unwitting the object of Paco's interests. Augustin is Raimunda's middle-aged cousin and caregiver for the elderly aunt. Her mother too has died and she hopes the ghost of Raimunda's mother can give her information. Raimunda's sister Sole runs a beauty salon which has taken on an odd \\"Russian\\" woman. The resolution of these mysteries takes the entire length of the movie.<br /><br />\\"Volver\\" is gorgeously shot but sometimes maddeningly under-acted. Interestingly, though, themes that movies normally play for laughs -- like the need to dispose of a dead body -- are played straight. This presumably-deliberate melding of genres threw off the pacing a bit. But director Pedro Almod&oacute;var makes up for this with lush views of the Spanish countryside, with modern windmills continuing the wind/spirit metaphor throughout the film. Though it took a while to appreciate Volver's genre-busting moments, the film settled down and became more interesting to watch as it progressed. Speaking of busts, Penelope Cruz's should get co-star credits, and is actually featured in one gratuitous shot from above.<br /><br />\\"Volver\\" teeters on the edge between drama and comedy to deliver the story of a family attempting to cope with loss and return, and the healing of ancient wounds.essed.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|Unfortunately, I was not able to be graced by Madonna's presence with her \\"Confessions Tour\\" this year, however, this is a nice substitute. Over the years, Madonna's vocals have improved, and her shows have stayed just as amazing, this is not the exception. This uncensored, raw, and almost magical CD/DVD combo includes new renditions of past favorites, and many of her new hits to be a favorite in anyone's CD collection.

B00005MP58|4.0|I loved this series and have already watched it several times over. The quality of the DVD was really bad, however. The color is very washed out. I can't imagine that this is what it looked like when it was aired. I would buy the DVD again for the story, but I think if I wanted this as a collector's item I would pass.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|In this grand epic we are treated to an inside look at how a small man with great conviction and big ideas took on and defeated a superpower without ever lifting a gun.  Mao was wrong, power does not come from the barrel of a gun, it comes from the handful of individuals who can see injustice and find a way to use its own strength to defeat it.  Truth will win out if given it's way.  Injustice will hang itself when given the rope.  That is the legacy that Ghandi left us.  In this superb portrayal by Ben Kingsley, Ghandi and his spirit are shared anew with those too young to have felt his impact.<br /><br />The movie is historically very accurate though there are a few events out of chronological order or disputed with regard to Ghandi's views.  Still, overall, historical drama does not get much better than this.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|For many years i have changed my mind on what i thought was the best hiphop album of all time, but i think i have finally come to the conclusion that Biggie's Ready To Die takes the crown.  Thats not to say that he's the best emcee ever (though hes certainly top 5 all time) but of all the hundreds of hiphop albums in my collection this is the 1 i listen to more than any other, still 12 years later i listen to it at least twice a week.  There is simply not a skippable track on the entire album, every single track is great most being classics.  When i think of other albums that I have considered the best of all time, Me Against The World, The Chronic, Illmatic etc.. they all have songs im tempted to skip in order to get to better ones.  Thats not to say they have filler because i can listen to all of those albums right through however they have in my opinion noticeably weaker tracks.  Ready To Die has none.<br /><br />If you only own one hiphop album this should be it, it is far better than his other album Life After Death, which is quite simply bloated and one of the most over rated albums of all time and it has Puffy's influence all over it, thankfully this doesnt.  It is really pointless making a list of my favourite songs as they are all superb, however i will give a quick mention to Gimme The Loot which is undoubtedly my favourite song of all time, the way Biggie raps back and forth as 2 characters is amazing, but Biggie is lyrically superb throughout and the beats are perfect, though Biggie could flow over anything, his flow is untouchable and almost certainly the best ever.  This is a must buy for all fans of good music, if you dont own it buy it!!
B00080ZG10|4.0|The AVIATOR for me was a load of fun. As someone born in the 50s this movie shows how much fun it must have been to live in the first half of the 20th century and have money. DiCaprio does a fine job portraying Howard HUGHES, a true visionary who was afflicted with mental illnesses that, at the time, were never publicly discussed. The movie does not gloss over his eccentricities but fully addresses his unhealthy preoccupation with germs and other compulsive bahaviors. It even spends time at the beginning of the movie to show his childhood where his mother planted the seeds of his anxieties.    Cate Blanchett does a fine job in her portrayal of Katherine HEPBURN who had a love affair with HUGHES'S before she met Spencer TRACY.  Also we see hollywood in it's heyday with appearances by Louie B. MAYER, Ava GARDNER, Jean HARLOW and Errol FLYNN (played by Jude Law) among others. Alan ALDA capably plays a cowardly and corrupt senator standing in the way of HUGHES'S business interests. The movie is nothing to speak of as a great thought provoking experience. It is what it is- a very entertaining look at Mr. HUGHES life (with some very fine flying sequences thrown in).
0743243153|5.0|Only a very small percentage of books are worth reading multiple times, and \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" is undoubtedly one of them.  I have read some of the passages three, four times and am still finding fresh ideas.   I am deeply impressed by Peck's penetrating intelligence and tremendously benefited from his profound insights to life.   <br /> <br />There are two kinds of people - those who look smarter than they are and those who are smarter than they look.  Scott Peck is clearly the second kind.  The first time I read it, I could not continue beyond the first few pages - it just seemed too dry.  Peck was a first-class scientist.  There were no slogans or fancy presentation styles, but every word of the book was well thought - which I only realized after my second and third reading.  Readers if you feel the same way as what I felt the first time, remember my words and stick to it.  Some day you will feel so lucky for your whole life that you have been enlightened.   <br /> <br />Of course you don't have to agree to everything in the book to be enlightened.  Nobody is perfect.  Nobody has everything right.  Nor was Scott Peck.  However, always remember that just because you don't think he's right does not necessarily mean that he is not right.  Peck was a rigorous scientist and his observations are absolutely worth your consideration, while it is up to you whether you agree to them or not.  Throughout my life so far there have been countless times that I realized that what I once held steadfast was completely wrong.  And whenever those realizations struck me were my happiest moments.   <br /> <br />I would guess that this book is not for everybody.  The issues discussed in the book are so fundamental, and topics like religion, grace, miracle, and serendipity are always hotly controversial.  However, put down your ego, listen to this intelligent guy, be ready to change yourself, look for some gold nuggets, and perhaps even experience the strikes of a few happiest moments.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|It's not even May yet but the best Mother's Day present was just released today. And if you are a mother, I hate to spoil what you will be getting, but there is a good chance if you don't get the standard bouquet or chocolates in four months, you will be unwrapping Not Too Late, the latest album from Norah Jones, to complete your set of the singer's albums. The previous two of which sold an astounding thirty million copies and garnered her eight Grammy Awards solely on the strength of just one hit. Of course back in 2002 the slow jazz feel of Don't Know Why was a breath of fresh air back hip-pop and pseudo-punk ruled the radio. Well maybe not that much has changed in the five years since.  <br /> <br />Norah rarely deviates from her trademark, insomnia curing sound for most of the album. But there are some signs that she is breaking out of the mold and going back even deeper into Americana. My Dear Country does a much better job at making a speakeasy ditty than anything from the Outkast movie set in the same timeframe. Thanks to some cellos and bowed bass Sinkin' Soon also has an old-time feel to it while at the same time sounding like it wouldn't have been out of place on the latest Fiona Apple. Even though it still sounds more like her pervious work, The Sun Doesn't Like You drives along like a summer afternoon. Well maybe drives Miss Daisy along like a summer afternoon.  <br /> <br />The biggest change on the album though is that she has a writing credit on all thirteen tracks; for those keeping track that is six more than on her previous two albums combined. And from the lyrics it seems she's not that happy with titles like The Sun Doesn't like You, Not My Friend, and Broken. She's not too happy about our government either as seen in the biting My Dear Country with lines like, \\"'Cause we believed in our candidate, but even more it's the one we hate.\\" Is she talking about Bush? Kerry? Gore? Does it really matter because we always seem to lose either way? The songopens up with the irony that our elections are held not that far away from Halloween.  <br /> <br />The war also gets mentioned as Jones plays the role of a consoler for a wife who has lost her husband in the opening track Wish I Could. With some of the political leaning in other songs it easy to assume that Sinkin' Soon could be a metaphor about the botched post-Katrina cleanup effort. And again, choose your favorite scapegoat to play the captain in the line, \\"With a captain who's too proud to say that he dropped the oar.\\" Do we really need Norah Jones on a soapbox? Not really. But no one's really paying attention to the lyrics anyways, so just put the album on and relax. Well until you pass the album onto your mother in May.
B000J3FC0Q|4.0|I thought this was another blue-eyed soul (less) artist exploiting a classic genre. Amy Winehouse does a great job on this really fun and nostalgic cd. At times I am reminded of Erykah Badu, Billie and Sara Vaughn. At others I can feel Winehouse's own voice and personality.  My favorites are Tears Cry on Their Own which is passionate with a classic motown sound. Love is a Losing Game brings a slight Peggy Lee 50's sound.  <br /> <br />Winehouse's style is not original but this cd is a tribute to the soulful music that once was and still stains our emotions.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|When I first heard that they had hired Daniel Craig to play Bond in Casino Royale is was admittedly highly disappointed.  Yes, I was one of those naysayers.  I have been a fan of Mr. Craig's, thought he was great in Road to Perdition and Munich, but as Bond?  Well, I gladly ate my own words after seeing this movie!  He was phenomenal!  Yes, they finally had a great story to hang his tux on (ever notice that the best films follow the books pretty closely), but great story/writing or not he made the film and character his!  And like others who have posted here, I can't wait for the next one!
0375831002|5.0|Poignant, gripping, compelling, lyrical and tragic - The Book Thief is all this and more. Death narrates this tale of a young girl, a stealer of books named Liesel, who is growing up in a small town outside of Munich during Hitler's reign of terror. Markus Zukas - an award winning author of children's literature - pens an original novel which explores (among other things) the tragedy of war, love and hate, the power of words, and that tenuous space which separates life from death. The characters who people this amazing book come alive on the page: <br /> <br />Rudy Steiner - Liesel's best friend and a boy whose dreams include being an athlete as great as Jesse Owens. <br /> <br />\\"Papa\\" aka Hans Hubermann - Liesel's foster father, an accordion player who honors a long forgotten promise and whose kind spirit repeatedly brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br />'When he turned the light on in the small, callous washroom that night, Liesel observed the strangeness of her foster father's eyes. They were made of kindness, and silver. Like soft silver, melting. Liesel, upon seeing those eyes, understood that Hans Hubermann was worth a lot.'          - from The Book Thief (page 34)- <br /> <br />\\"Mama\\" aka Rosa Hubermann - Liesel's foster mother, a woman who loves as fiercely as she curses. <br /> <br />Max Vandenberg - The \\"Jew in the basement\\" who discovers the friendship of a girl and the healing power of words. <br /> <br />Ilsa Hermann - The mayor's wife who has lost and grieved and punished herself, and yet makes room in her heart for a young girl with a hunger for words. <br /> <br />And finally, Liesel herself - a girl whose courage and wonderful spirit of life shines through on every page. <br /> <br />At one point, Liesel writes: 'I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.' (from The Book Thief - page 523-) Markus Zusak makes the words right. His novel will resonate with book lovers. It is a story larger than life; one that touches the reader's heart and never lets go. Death's voice, at once both playful and profound, delivers the ending of this novel with a flourish that will break your heart.
B00005JPE7|5.0|This is the best film I've seen in the theatre for a while! The fight scene at the end is really one of the least important scenes as this picture is more about emotions than fighting. This film is all about excellent dialogue, acting, writing, and directing. It's perfectly emotional and inspirational. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I'd recommend at least watching Rocky I thru III first if you haven't seen them already, they are great films as well.
0060878770|5.0|For the last three years I've had The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath on my TBR (to be read) list. Recently when I saw an audio version on CDs, unabridged, I couldn't resist. Wow, this was a wonderful experience, albeit a sad one as well. The reader, Maggie Gyllenhaal, was wonderful. She had just the right voice, the perfect attitude, and even looks a little like Sylvia Plath, so far as I can see from the small photos on the back of the CD case. <br /> <br />I knew, going in, that this was to be a book about insanity, and semi-autobiographical. Typical for a first novel, to want to write about oneself. Of course after I listened to the book I had to do a lot more research because I was fascinated by Sylvia Plath and her brief but eventful life.  She was primarily a poet and short story writer who received a guest editorship position at Mademoiselle magazine in New York City by winning a short story contest in 1953. This is where her novel, The Bell Jar, starts, though she renamed the magazine, the main character, and the hotel at which she stayed. <br /> <br />In the book, the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, gradually falls apart mentally while interning at a magazine in New York City. She eventually has to leave to move back in with her mother, and from there things get worse. If you compare the novel with her actual life, there are many similarities. <br /> <br />In real life, she recovered from her breakdown and married Ted Hughes, another poet. They had two children and lived in England and later, in Massachusetts. Her first and only novel, The Bell Jar, was published on January 14, 1963 in England under a pseudonym, Victoria Lucas. Less than a month later, on February 11, 1963, Sylvia Plath took her own life using gas fumes from her oven. She must have been depressed due to a separation from her husband due to his infidelity, and the pressures of being a single parent, isolated, and unable to afford adequate winter heating or even a telephone. <br /> <br />I hope someday to read her unedited journals and some of her poetry, and perhaps some short stories. There also are several biographies about her available. She had an amazing talent for putting the reader in the midst of a situation, right into the thinking process of a deranged protagonist. I felt the narrative of her novel was phenomenally well done. She knew first hand about insanity, and let us in on the secret of how it could happen and what it is like to fall apart mentally, gradually, one step at a time. It is definitely a novel I'd put on my list of books every serious reader should experience at least once.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I had forgotten how great a major concert can be. Over the years I'd lost interest in Pink Floyd, too commercial, too slick, too boring etc, but this show (from a series of performances in London in 1994) is GREAT, the music, lighting, props, and film/projection at the show as well as production value of this DVD is top notch. I'd gladly spend big bucks to see a show like this now - live (as it was I surprised myself staying up way too late to watch the whole thing). I'm used to much smaller venues these days, but getting 30 to 40 thousand people together for a Vegas style sound and light experience is really something special and remarkable. The crowd looks suitably blown away, and it got me high too, (and brought tears to my eyes during the vocal solos of Great Gig in the Sky).<br /><br />I remember The Distant Sound Of Thunder CD having a distracting amount of audience noise (they never seemed to stop and listen!), and was pleased to have it be much more in the background for this concert's mix. The sound is really good (even as just audio). Having Dark Side of the Moon performed in entirety was great (alot of emphasis on the trippy projection and lights), and the encore of Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell was powerful with the grand finale' of lazers, lights and explosions being over the top but fun too. However, I liked the beginning of the concert (disc 1) more. The only other concert DVD I've seen close to this level of art and grandure is Peter Gabriel's '03 GROWING UP tour, but this is much more intense and cohesive. I missed Waters and wondered how much better or different it would have been with him, but overall, the show is complete as is.<br /><br />The DVD has alot of special features that I haven't yet explored, but I'm sure they will be fun.<br /><br />What impressed me most was the way the band appeared to have fun, playing consciously, relaxed and yet restrained, fully aware of their effect... It made me seriously think this is a good expression of the peak of our civilization (union of technology, art and consciousness, materiality and spirituality presented as entertainment, but delivering much more.)<br /><br />Even for the casual Pink Floyd fan this is a must see.the peak of our civilization (union of technology, art and consciousness, materiality and spirituality presented as entertainment, but delivering much more.)

B00005JLO2|2.0|Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|I have been waiting for years to hear POS on top form again after Remedy Lane in 2002. Their controversial album \\"BE\\" was really different but I was a little bit disappointed and wasn't able to dive in that album. So I forego that album from 2004 until 2007 and now Scarsick is finally released. What a new fresh of air to breathe in. I am so thrilled to say that indeed pain of salvation's music is always progressing with each new album. This one in particular is totally different from what they have done b4. There's a sort of a disco track or I might say disco feel to it and coming from a progressive metal band is just unheard of, never been attempted b4 but POS did it in style. If you look at the title track you would know which track I am talking about. Hurray!! The rest of the album is a feast for POS fans... Constantly Evolving and changing to fit the essence of time. This is my favourite Prog Metal album in 2007 thus far. Dive in and let POS take you for a wild ride!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The cinematography in this movie is the best I have ever seen. It is a turn of the century love story between Edward Norton (the illusionist) and Jessica Beil.<br /><br />They were childhood sweethearts, unwillingly seperated as youngsters, but cross paths years later, at one of Norton's shows.<br />She is already engaged to a crowned prince, but still loves Norton's character.<br />They decide they want to be together again, and this is where the movie takes off.<br /><br />The story itself is WONDERFUL, but even more than that, The reason I wrote this review was just to comment on the QUALITY of this picture. The sets are so wonderful, it will have you totally believing that you fell through a hole in time. The picture quality is so out of this world that the regular DVD looks like it is in high definition...Not only is the quality sharp, the entire movie has a beautiful golden hue, and I swear it looks like you are in an oil painting.<br /><br />I have seen good cinematography on movies like \\"Lord of the rings\\", or \\"The Village\\" but this is the best I've seen.<br />The casting too, couldn't have been done any better.<br />Take all that, add a great storyline, and you have a MASTERPIECE !!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is the best recent bond. Daniel Craig is a rugged sexy that reminds me of Indian Jones.  The movie is action packed.  They did a really good job with casting and making this movie.  Maybe the casting people knew what they were doing after all.  Great Great Worth Owning.
B0007WF1WI|5.0|Take it from someone who's really not a huge Britney fan. But this CD is actually REALLY good. She experiments with electronica, synth and dance, and it actually fits her like a glove. This is the first album from hers I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />STAND-OUT TRACKS:<br /><br />TOXIC - I have to admit this is one of the best pop songs ever recorded. The beat is so catchy and it sounded different than anything else on the radio. Like her or not, you have to admit that \\"Toxic\\" is fantastic.<br /><br />EVERYTIME - Yes, Britney actually has a nice sounding ballad. Her voice actually sounds good on here. The synth piano, strigs and subtle percussion create a haunting masterpiece. This song actually gives me goosebumps. One of the best ballads I've ever heard.<br /><br />BRAVE NEW GIRL - This song sounds very similar to Imani Capolla's \\"Legend of a Cowgirl\\". It also has elements of Madonna's \\"Material Girl\\", and Talk Talk/No Doubt's \\"It's My Life\\". Nevertheless, her voice sounds kind of cool because the engineer made it sound electronic (a la Cher) at some parts. Overall, a great an fun dance song.<br /><br />SHADOW - Another great ballad. I was produced by the Matrix, so it does sound a little Avril-ish. But there are a lot of synth sound effects which give it a futuristic feel. Definitely a good listen.<br /><br />SHOWDOWN - This is kind of a mid-tempo pop song that sounds very unique. It's very catchy, and it has a lot of dance/analog elements in it. The guitars make the song what it is in my opinion.<br /><br />Other good songs include \\"Me Against the Music\\" [Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix] featuring Madonna (Better than the original IMO), \\"(I Got that) Boom Boom\\" featuring the Ying Yang Twins, and \\"Breath On Me\\".<br />e<br />Britney caught me off guard because this album is actually great. She is definitely \\"in her zone\\", because this type of music suits her and her voice. I really recommend you check this CD out, even if you don't like Britney. This was a step inthe right direction for her.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|Well, I've read some other reviews of this movie and a lot of people have given some harsh criticism to the directors cut and they say to just buy the original cut. First off BOTH the original theatrical and directors cut are on this DVD and I think both are fantastic. The directors cut does add some poorly done 3D animation of space (with one or two shots that look distinctly familiar to 2001: A Space Odyssey... Echoes+Jupiter and the infinite beyond synchronization anyone?) as well as some 3D reconstructions of Pompeii, I'll admit it they are totally unneeded. However, the directors cut also adds about 20 minuets of interviews and recordings of their Dark Side of The Moon Sessions, which is really awesome to see. So basically, buy this and if you can get it for under $15 its an even better deal!
B000HOJDBQ|5.0|Having a chance to here two track from this new album due out next year, Gears of War\\" and \\"Washington is Next\\", Dave Mustaine and this version of megadeth continue the classic sound that the Rattleheads worship at the alter of the metal gods.

B000GCFO0I|3.0|I'm not going to give the plot away so here is a brief description of the film. Rose takes her adopted daughter Sharon to a deserted town called Silent Hill (due to the fact that Sharon has been sleepwalking and screaming \\"Silent Hill\\" into the night). She is followed by a cop (Cybil) who is suspiscious of her. Rose is in a car accident and wakes up to find Sharon missing. Rose sets off into Silent Hill to find Sharon. <br /> <br />As a fan of the videogame series, i was impressed that Christophe Gans kept the movie true to the videogame. Some of the scenes in the film are pretty much the same as in the game except with real actors. Silent Hill stars Radha Mitchell (Man on Fire) and Sean Bean(Goldeneye, LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Hitcher) who do a great job at acting in this film. The one complaint i have about the film is the script. The dialogue could of been written a little better. <br /> <br />The thing i really liked about this movie was it stayed true to the videogame series (unlike Resident Evil), a confusing plot that makes you want to see the movie again just so you can tie up some loose ends, and it's got a really good ending that leaves you thinking \\"what the crap just happened?\\" Do i recomend this movie? Yes i do!

080701429X|5.0|Dr. Frankl trys to answer the question: &#34;How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?&#34;<br />The Capos were prisoners, who acted as trustees and were given special privileges; the Capos were never hungry; the SS provide liquor in large quantities to the Capos; the Capos were often harder on the prisoners than the guards; the Capos were chosen based on their character attributes, psychological basis of character attributes capable of merciless beating the prisoners and forcing compliance; only the most brutal of the prisoners were selected for the job; if the Capo did not immediately comply with the guard they were demoted; the Capo would eventually die, but they were capable of great cruelty until that time. The study is not so much concerned with the sufferings, which did happen, but stories focus on the sacrifices of the prisoners.<br /><br />Prisoners hated their number; these numbers were often tattooed on their skin; and any guard that wanted to make a charge against the prisoner just had to glance at his number. A prisoner goes through three phases at camp: the period following his admission, the period he is entrenched in camp routine, and the period following his release. The first reaction by the prisoners was shock; a sudden cry from the passengers, &#34;there is a sign, Auschwitz!&#34; Everyone's heart missed a beat at that moment. Auschwitz- the very name stood for all that was horrible: gas chambers, crematoriums, and massacres. Camp life was brutal: nine men shared on blanket, one shirt had to last a half a year, prisoners were unable to wash for days, shoes were to small and modifications punished, and sleeping quarters impossible.<br /><br />Control: Every man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family waiting for him at home, and to save his friends. Prisoners began self-selection interactions; they often lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves.<br /><br />Shoes: It was forbidden to take shoes to the bunks. Some people use their shoes as pillows. &#34;Otherwise one's head had to rest on the crook of an almost dislocated arm. An yet sleep cam and brought oblivion and relief from pain for a few hours.&#34;<br /><br />Suicide: A popular method of suicide was touching the electrically charged barb wired fence. &#34;The prisoner in the first phase of shock did not fear death. Even the gas chambers lost their horrors for him after the first few days - after all, they spared him the act of committing suicide.&#34;<br /><br />Looking fit: &#34;If you want to stay alive, there is only one way, look fit for work&#34;.<br /><br />Injustice: &#34;I did not know what was going on in the line behind me, nor in the mind of the SS guard, but suddenly I received two sharp blows on my head. Only then did I spot the guard that was using the stick. At such a moment it is not the physical pain which hurts the most; it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all.&#34;<br /><br />Spiritual life: &#34;In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it was possible for spiritual life to deepen.&#34;<br /><br />Wives: &#34;Hardly a word was spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his mouth behind his upturned collar, the man marching next to me whispered suddenly: `If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are better off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us.'&#34; &#34;Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds.

B000KQGP2G|4.0|While not as stellar as \\"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\\" or \\"The Perfect Element Pt. I\\" (what is?) this is still a solid release and a must have for POS fans. The lyrics (when understandable) get right to the point that Daniel is pissed off and he wants to complain about it. He's anti-American but pays tribute to American music, anti-materialistic but recorded this in his personal studio and some guitar manufacturer sponsors him (a bit hypocritical, aye?), he's sick of everything and there is a lot of unnecessary foul language. Maybe I don't understand the concept, and if you think you do, clue me in and post a comment. Anyway, the vocals have amazing range and tone, and I pay more attention to the melody than the words.    Most POS discs are loaded with variety and why should this be any different?  Heavy riffs (\\"Scarsick\\", \\"Spitfall\\"), quirky tunes (\\"America\\", \\"Disco Queen\\"), ballads (\\"Kingdom of Loss\\") and epics (\\"Enter Rain\\"). While some of the tunes see the band charting new territory, others sound familiar and this balance is a good thing. I liked this the first spin and it gets better with each listen.

B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I was given this cd by one of my supervisors and he told me that he thought that I would like it. What an Understatement!!! I love it!!! She has a hint of some of the worlds best known recording artist such as Sade, Eryka Badu, Norah Jones, Jill Scott, Rikki Lee Jones and the late great, Billie Holiday, but when you hear her voice, you will know that she is an artist embarking on her own musical journey. Even thou she has been compared to these other talented artist, she has her own style of bringing the music. The album is smooth and is full of jazz, blues, soul and R&B. Her lyrics are so realistic. For this to be her very first cd, she did one heck of a job. My favorites are, \\"Till It Happens To You\\" which tells about one being in love and how it made you feel like heaven and then you get your heart broken and how you could never understand it till it happens to you, and lets not forget the Hit Single \\"Put Your Records On.\\" Another favorite is the funky \\"I'd Like To.\\" The whole cd is great. So go out, buy it, play it, and you be the judge. I guarentee you, you won't be disappointed. Come February 2007, all the other artist that are up for \\"Best New Artist, better watch out. She came out the box with a number 1 cd at the top of the charts and that alone speaks for itself. Now this is Quality and Refreshing Music from someone with a beautiful voice.
B00004VVN9|5.0|The movie Brainstorm is not only thought provoking it is entertaining.  Though filmed in the early 1980s, the plot could be taken from the pages of today's cutting edge science journals.  The idea behind the story is that scientists have developed the means of recording or transmiting the world we see, touch, and smell, with all sensory reactions in place.  In reality, this is now being seriously considered by scientists.  The technical aspects of the film are as believable as any other film of its era, so the viewer will not be bored with the visual quality of the film.  The acting is superb with academy-award-winning actor Christopher Walken playing the lead.  Strong support is provided by Natalie Wood, who plays the estranged but reconciling spouse of Walken's character.  The fact that the plot involves the two main characters trying to gain access to the recorded experience of a scientist as she dies makes this film especially interesting; the producers had to scramble to finish it, for Natalie Wood tragecially drowned before the filming was finished.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|There are few soundtracks I race to purchase, and even fewer that I truly enjoy from start to finish, regardless of mood, moment, or time of day. And not another inspires as much as this; Dario Marianelli's compositions for the film are enchanting and unforgettable, and I'd like to think that if Jane Austen were alive today, she would gladly give an approving nod.  <br /> <br />This soundtrack is shorter than most, at little more than forty minutes. Thank goodness for repeat buttons - it's nearly painful to have it end. From the very first, quiet notes of Dawn, to the glorious Georgiana, and all the way to the lively Can't Slow Down, there's not a single unpleasant or unworthy note on this record.  <br /> <br />Among my favorites are the haunting The Living Sculptures of Pemberley and The Secret Life of Daydreams, which would have captured me by title alone - it is a track I write to, one that consistently brings inspiration, and one I wish I could program in my head so it could accompany me anywhere, anytime, without needing such a thing as an iPod. And while Liz On Top of the World and Darcy's Letter (how amazing that it begins with such a rush, echoing the feeling one gets when she realizes she has wronged someone; and then how it slows, as the realization of love floods in) are head to head for the #2 position, it is Your Hands Are Cold that has no competition; it is romantic, powerful, passionate, chilling, and unbelievably beautiful. Ah, but then there's Mrs. Darcy, which is breathtaking as well...   <br /> <br />Between composer Dario Marianelli and world famous French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, as well as The English Chamber Orchestra, this soundtrack is one hell of a masterpiece.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|This is an intriguing and sophisticated look at the war between the South Boston Police force and its most dangerous crime ring.    Billy Costigan (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is allowed into the force under the condition that he will infiltrate the crime ring's inner circle as an undercover officer (the ring is led by a man named Francis Costello, played by Jack Nicholson).    While he is working to gain Costello's trust, it becomes evident that there is a rat for Costello working on the police force (played by Matt Damon). The movie winds its way toward a bloody and penultimate conclusion.    The movie is loaded with bad language, violence and bad values, so there's no way I would take a kid to see it. But for a grownup, it is a scary look at a world that we don't always get to see in our neck of the woods, as it were.    My favorite character is undoubtedly the police chief (played by Martin Sheen), a devout Catholic who emerges later in the film as a Christ figure of sorts (you'll see why as the plot becomes evident).    This is undeniably a well made movie, but it is not for the faint of heart. 4 stars.    The movie is called \\"The Departed\\" because it surveys men and women on both sides of the law who have departed from God and have lost their souls, with the exception of Martin Sheen's character, who dies for one of the Departed.

B000JFXTHC|5.0|Inside a red velvet flip-top slipcase is a beautiful illustrated, 148-page hardbound book by Roma Ryan, Enya's lyricist. The text is a travellers tale about the fictive country of the Loxians. It was previously released as a hardcover novel, that is still available in the U.K. In a pocket on the back-sleeve of the book is the regular Amarantine CD, (no additional tracks), but the music is wonderful to listen to while reading the book. Three Enya-photo's accompany the CD in the sleeve. They remind me of the photo's inside \\"Only Time: The Collection\\", very stylish! I find this Box-set a great addition to my Enya-collection
B000002JKA|5.0|After the hugely successful Images & Words, DT tried something completely new. They mixed their sound with more heavy elements, resulting in Awake. However, as heavy as it is, this is also possibly Dream Theater's most emotional album to date. Just listen to The Silent Man, Scarred, and Space-Dye Vest. Don't get me wrong, DT has always put emotion in their music, but this one seems to take it to a new level.<br /><br />As all of us DT fans heard on I&W, James Labrie has a very high-pitched wail that sounds like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate (without ripping off either of the aforementioned singers). On Awake, his vocals are more raspy and snarly, especially on 6:00 and Lie. However, he still sings in the Iron Maiden/Queensryche-esque vocal style that he's so well known for on the majority of the songs, such as Innocence Faded, The Silent Man, and Space-Dye Vest. John Petrucci's guitar playing is no less complex than his work on the previous album.... or the album after that and so on. He's seriously my new favorite guitarist, and his solos on Awake are amazing and have almost a voice to them. John Myung's bass is very heavy and rumbling, and while at times he's hard to hear, he's very impressive when you hear him. Kevin More plays more piano and organs on this album than on DT's other albums, but it suits the album perfectly. I won't lie, though: I personally prefer Jordan Rudess' keyboard playing over Kevin's, which seems to be in constrast to most DT fan's opinions. Still, he's very good, and he's better suited for this album than Jordan Ruddess' style. Mike Portony's drumming seems a little toned down compared to other albums, but it's still very fast and complex, just a little slower. And while this album is considerably darker than I&W, it's still very catchy and infectious.<br /><br />6:00 seems to deal with tales of religion, death, and how people always take what they have for granted (\\"nobody knows what they want, 'til they finally let it all go\\"), and is a great way to start off the album. Caught In A Web is a lot catchier, and one of my favorites off the album. It's about feelings of isolation and insanity culminating from that loneliness. It's also a very good example of how Dream Theater can make a song consisting of bleak lyrics a hit by giving it catchy hooks. Innocence Faded is in the same vein as the previous song, but more melodic. James Labrie whispers the first several lines of the songs, right up until the chorus. The instrumental Erotomania (which has an almost industrial sound to it) kicks off the trilogy of songs that makes up the suite called A Mind Beside Itself. This suite includes the next 2 sings, Voices and The Silent Man. Voices is 10 minutes long and is the second longest song off the album (the first being Scarred, 11 minutes long). It's about a schizophrenic who believes angels and demons are talking to him, and he starts to wonder if he should give up his sex life or his religious devotion. The Silent Man is the exact opposite of Voices - that is, it's much lighter and softer. It's basically James singing over John's acoustic guitar playing. I think it's about how the schizophrenic could have avoided his disorders if he never lost faith in God. Mirror has themes of betrayal and temptation in it. It sounds like it's about these sorts of things happening to someone. Every time a voice in the background mutters something (like \\"temptation\\" or \\"hypocrite\\"), the lyrics are something you would say as a reaction to the word. The next song, Lie, could have a connection to the previous song; it also has similar themes. It's about trusting someone to help you with your problems but then they do the opposite and do something to hurt you more. Lifting Shadows off A Dream has a much more relaxing flow through it. It's about your dreams being shattered, but carrying on because it's not the end of the world. The lyrics are condsiderably more uplifting than the others before it. Scarred is about someone whois hurt or \\"scarred\\" by his/her lover, but not in a cheesy sort of way. It's the longest song off the album (11 minutes), and probably my favorite as well. The lyrics are very deep and personal, and the musicianship is the best off Awake. Space-Dye Vest is a very relaxing piano song, written by Kevin Moore. It's the one song that Dream Theater doesn't play live. This is because they feel it's \\"Kevin's song,\\" as Mike says, and they feel they shouldn't play it without him. The song is musically simple, but lyrically deep. Space-Dye Vest's lyrics are very depressing, and you can feel what Kevin was getting at.<br /><br />While Awake isn't the best way to sart of a DT collection (the best choice is I&w, even though SFAM is my favorite by them), it's still a very crucial part to their catalogue, and undoubtedly one of their best albums. So buy it, along with the rest of the DT catalogue, and forget all the pursits who can't accept the fact that DT isn't afraid to do something new, and not in the same vein as I&W.<br /><br />Long live Dream Theater!rred\\" by his/her lover, but not in a cheesy sort of way.

B00003CXAY|4.0|Koyaanisqatsi WAS a great, unique piece of cinema, but does look visually and socially a little dated these days. The Phillip Glass soundtrack works beautifully with the time lapse scenes but after a while begins to grate...  <br />Powaqatsi is based much more on the ryhthms of life and work in the developing world, but as opposed to Koyaanisqatsi's hectic time-lapse, it's so slow-mo and meditative that some viewers may find it the perfect thing to fall asleep too. Godfrey Reggio's original vision seems to have been a fluke - Cinematographer Ron Fricke made Koyaanisqatsi as good as it was, but upon seeing how depressing it was, he then made Baraka to improve on it. The third instalment in the series, Naqyqatsi, is best avoided or borrowed from the video library and watched on fast forward.

A man who would like nothing better than to present the original version in the worst possible way gives us a non-anamorphic version with 2.0 sound.  Thanks!    That's right, it's letterboxed.  I would suggest everyone who owns a widescreen TV to steer clear of this.  The quality of the original version on this DVD (completely untouched from the looks of it) is about as good as the VHS version.  In fact, it looks like they used the VHS version to create this DVD.  Oh, the irony.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|What makes it so great is how it never tries to be clever or cool and totally avoids all of the pitfalls of other \\"sample-based\\" albums. It's not douchey and trip-hoppy like DJ Shadow and it isn't creating totally \\"new\\" songs out of samples like RJD2, who ends up being kind of a bore. `Workinonit' is really the only track on that album that isn't perfect because it sort of falls into the RJD2 style, it is song length (2:52), so you get a vivid feeling for its structure, and it just feels off-balance precisely because it is so ordered. When the twangy guitars come in you kind of get the feeling \\"it was time for those twangy guitars\\" which is quite different from when Jadakiss's laugh randomly pops up or a track bleeds into the other and you've totally lost track of where you are in the album. Basically, its the only song on the album that actually sounds like someone should be rapping over it. There are so many things going on and so many subtle production details (that never try hard to be subtle or smart!) that are too amazing to try to describe. The way, for 30 seconds \\"Wake up world! Give peace a chance\\" slowly bubbles in the background of 'Glazed' before it becomes clear a minute into the track. Does that announcer at the beginning of 'The Twister (Huh, What)' say \\"Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing\\"? And then, it sounds like he says \\"The Temptations\\" but Dilla has chopped his words up to not actually say a word, so it sounds like \\"Tempting\\" and then we hear a live version of 'For Once in My Life' by Stevie Wonder' and I feel like I could have totally misheard all of what I just described...and don't forget that \\"I give to you\\" vocal sample on 'Last Donut of the Night'...and it is called `Donuts' which could mean a million different things and which is probably better place to begin any attempt at unpacking 'Donuts'. <br /> <br />Dilla made it as he was dying and calling it `Donuts' fits Dilla's unpretentious and modest style. There's obviously some circle-of-life stuff going on with that image of a donut; calling it `Donuts' is a way of bringing the circle-of-life stuff down-to-earth. The title addresses issues of death and (possibly) asserts comfort with death as a part of this cycle without being all My Chemical Romance about it...(or all Pink Floyd/Lou Reed 'Magic & Loss'/'American Recordings' Johnny Cash about it...)

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this version of Jane Eyre.  Yes, it is far more sensual than any film adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's novel that I have ever seen (and I've probably seen them all!), but I thought it served the plot very well, provided some new insights into the characters, and actually helped to tell the story.  This is the first time I truly understood, on a physical level, why Jane leaves Mr. Rochester, and what a torturous decision it is.  There was, to me, something incredibly poignant about Mr. Rochester feverishly insisting to Jane that they could have a platonic relationship when everything that was happening between them physically made it clear that it would be impossible.  The chemistry between the two leads was palpable, and you really cared about them.  And the acting was great, from everybody.  Great cinematography, costumes and locations, too.  I'm going to preorder this DVD right now!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|It's a dangerous thing to write an honest review where the wide wave of popularity and critical acclaim seem to all but shout \\"masterpiece,\\" BUT THIS ISNT, and you should be forewarned, despite the boos and hisses I'll get, that this is, when it all comes down to it, a clever little slice of Americanna, nothing more, nothing less-complete with the requisite dysfunctional family, masquerading itself as a comedy but in reality more of a clever statement about modern families.  True, it DOES have it's funny moments (the stuck horn scene, for one), but it also has an uneasy, off-kilter rhythm to it that keeps it from being, well, phenomenal.  Pluses include outstanding performances all around, especially by Kinnear (the motivational father) and adorable Abigail Breslin (as Olive); great set and design; and surprises thrown in at unexpected moments (don't worry--I won't ruin it for you).  Negatives include underplaying the characterization and motivation for gay uncle Frank (Steve Carell), losing Alan Arkin far too soon, and silly cop-outs (like the porn with the dead body and the pull over).  Overall verdict: enjoyable and worth repeated viewings, but certainly not the best film of the year.

B00003CXWV|4.0|In BLOW, Johnny Depp gives us one of his earlier but no less brilliant performances as George Jung, the premier American cocaine importer of the 1980s.<br /><br />A film heavily influenced by Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and CASINO, BLOW is as frenetic as its namesake drug. We watch Jung grow up in a stressful household with a shrewish mother (Rachel Griffiths) and an easygoing father (Ray Liotta); Ms. Griffiths' characterization as Ermine Jung is so reminiscent of Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill in GOODFELLAS that I initially confused the two actresses. Liotta of course, played Henry Hill.<br /><br />George flees his childhood home for the endless sunshine of Southern California circa 1967, where, dedicated to the proposition that he will never be poor, he begins to deal drugs. A minor pot bust leads to an association with Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, and George soon builds his small-scale operation into the major North American llello pipeline.<br /><br />His vast wealth (literally hundreds of millions of dollars over the years) leads to the predictable vast excesses (think Tony Montana in SCARFACE) and George's hedonistic lifestyle comes crashing down in a white cloud of confusion, betrayal and self-destruction. Depp captures it all perfectly, without caricaturing any of it, an impressive accomplishment when one considers how easily the Cocaine Universe lent itself to cartoonishness in the mid-Eighties. George Jung ultimately was convicted of smuggling and was sentenced to a horrifying sixty years.<br /><br />Despite George's Colombian connections, he remained a small-town American boy at heart, and Depp deftly and subtlely demonstrates to us George's increasing sense of isolation and disorientation in the midst of the drug culture. In the end, George Jung is left nothing but his sense of aching emptiness as he pines for his daughter Kristina, who, the film tells us as it ends, has never visited her father.<br /><br />George Jung is seen in the Special Features as a broken, sad and lonely man, condemned to spending most of the rest of his life behind bars. The hardest blow fell on George Jung. Was it worth it?atures as a broken, sad and lonely man, condemned to spending most of the rest of his life behind bars. The hardest blow fell on George Jung.

B000J3OTTQ|2.0|Step up is a very okay movie at best. I'm a sucker for dance movies and thought this would be a very good movie to purchase. Over hyped music soundtracks and reviews of the movie clouded my judgment.  <br /> <br /> What you got is a very mediocre story of talented goof meets hot dance girl. The story line is what it is aspected to be but what I brought this for was for the dancing, which was very limited, very unskillful, and very average quality at best. Channing Tatum does a good job as a dancer, but for someone who is suppose to be an elite at hip hop - pop lock dancing as it is protrayed, he still came off as an average dancer to me.. <br /> <br /> If you want an average fill good movie (such even the brother getting shot plot, ended up being very weak in impact) this is a rental.. <br /> <br /> If you want a dance movie with great dancing with a slightly better plot, wait for Stomp the Yard to be out on dvd. That will be a better to own movie by far.  <br />

B000001FT0|5.0|Steve Winwood's 1982 solo album, \\"Talking Back To The Night,\\" is a breezy, cheerful delight. Winwood plays all of the instruments himself, and the very-catchy songs on this album are among Steve's best, including the classic \\"Valerie,\\" and other winners like \\"Big Girls Walk Away,\\" \\"Still In The Game,\\" \\"Help Me Angel,\\" and the excellent, made-for-cruising title track. Yes, this is unquestionably Steve's most synthesiser-heavy album, (after all, it was made in 1982), but I think his synth sound here is simply wonderful and uplifting (as is his singing, songwriting, performing & production chops). I love the charming \\"do-it-yourself\\" vibe that Steve gives the music on this disc! So go ahead and pick up \\"Talking Back To The Night,\\" one of my personal favorites from the multi-talented Steve Winwood.

0141439661|3.0|This is the first Jane Austen novel I've read. I have to say that I had a very difficult time getting through that book. I find it extremely slow reading on inane subjects. But I am obviously in the minority with that opinion. I expected wonderful stories like Louisa May Alcott's books, but then maybe I am listening with the wrong \\"ear\\". Maybe I was suppose to listen to the sound of the words like a James Joyce novel. I've read a lot of period novels written in that time and place, so it's not a lack of familiarity with the era or the language.<br /><br />I will say that it shows a very real contrast between the use of emotion controlled by intellect vs. total emotional immersion in the subject of romance.
B00062ZE58|5.0|I am really having fun with my new CD!  Withing Temptation wouldn't have been my first choice, but I was introduced to a particular song and I just had to have it.  With me getting the CD one day eariler than expected, I was able to listen to it two days after I purchased it.  That's pretty good, if you ask me... <br /> <br />The songs are so emotional and they inspire me when I write my stories(just short stories on fanfiction).  I'd have to say my favorite one is Memories.  And I love Jillian(I'd Give My Heart). <br /> <br />It's one of the best CDs I own!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I've been listening to metal longer than it was called metal. I've recently been on a binge for female fronted groups and this album rates up there with Evanesence. If you can imagine Metallica going to the opera you have a pretty good idea of what this sounds like. I haven't listened to any of the other albums by this group but I can strongly recommend this to anyone with a refined taste for music that should be played LOUD!

B000M4RG42|2.0|It seems ironic to me that while this film was heavily touted, its sister-film, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" has been nominated for an Oscar, yet we've heard relatively little of it being promoted, except for the \\"now playing\\" blip on television. As a former Marine, I honor the sacrifice of my fellow Brothers, but I have to ask myself, why isn't the other side being told? Why aren't theaters just as anxious to show that all sides in war know honor and death equally?<br /><br />Makes me wonder if the same thing is going on in Iraq. We have many brave boys dying, but what about the other side? They should be honored as well. Maybe we'll have to wait 60 years before we hear of their side of the story from an America that's blinded by its \\"patriotism\\" and paying for it with its dearest blood.
B000F7OPCC|4.0|One can compare this movie in the Indiana Jones trilogy with \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" in the first Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV-VI).  Both return to themes that were in the first movie and overlooked in the second.  Unlike \\"Return Of The Jedi\\", this was a step backwards in quality as opposed to a forward step.  But then, being a formula sequel like this makes it harder to improve.<br /><br />Another comparison with the Raiders trilogy and Star Wars (which, considering George Lucas is involved with both, shouldn't be a surprise) is that both series started with a movie that appealed to the Judeo-Christian heritage this country has.  The second movie in each series moved more into Hinduism.  Unlike \\"Return Of The Jedi\\", this movie returns to its Judeo-Christian roots.<br /><br />One twist in this movie, the rare one that actually worked, was Sean Connery portraying Indiana Jones' father.  The late Gene Siskel gave this movie a thumbs down, because he didn't feel that relationship was developed well enough.  Roger Ebert pointed out that people don't go to see an Indiana Jones movie because of its development of a father-son relationship.<br /><br />One final comment.  This is the only movie of the series with a PG-13 rating, basically because this was the only one released after the PG-13 rating was created.  \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom\\" was one reason that rating was created.  The LA Times family viewing section of the movies felt the first two were definitely not for children.  Yet this one was rated as \\"family\\".  This is no more a family picture than the others were.  The difference is that some want to redefine \\"family picture\\".  And I feel this is actually less of a family movie than the other two.

B000002KHH|5.0|I'm kind of baffled at how almost every review posted of Master Of Reality describe that album as Sabbath's \\"best work\\", yet most reviews of Paranoid cite it as \\"one of their best\\" or say \\"completists should own this\\". Don't get me wrong, Master Of Reality is a great album, and easily ranks with the band's best material. But to disregard Paranoid and not recognize it for what it is-the single best Metal album in history-is a major head-scratcher for me. Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But Master Of Reality simply didn't match either the historical impact, quality of songs, or overall sound of Paranoid.  <br /> <br />Of course, one wouldn't want to overlook Sabbath's self-titled first album, especially if speaking in terms of historical impact. While not the first heavy rock album to blow out speakers with distorted guitars and cacophonous drumming, all you need to do is hear the first unbelievably colossal chord struck in the song \\"Black Sabbath\\" to (by the time you're done changing into a clean pair of pants) recognize this as the arrival of the form of music known as Heavy Metal. That song was recorded almost 40 years ago, and it still has the power to terrify unsuspecting listeners to this day. And, while I feel that the song \\"Black Sabbath\\" is still heavier than anything put out since (even downtuned sludge-mongers like Eyehategod, Electric Wizard, Melvins and SunnO))) can't match the song's power), the album still had some weak points; weak points that would be completely eradicated in time for their 2nd album, Paranoid.  <br /> <br />What still always gets me about Paranoid every time I pop it in and the first notes of \\"War Pigs\\" come through my speakers, is the utterly desolate and raw production. When that song's meandering intro abruptly gives way to monolithic power chords chopped up by long pauses, when the thudding bass drum kicks off \\"Iron Man\\", when Ozzy's voice cuts through the oppressively doomy progression of \\"Electric Funeral\\"...there is no warmth or gloss to these moments. The whole album sounds as though it is being transmitted to you from a shack at the fallout site of a nuclear explosion, somewhere completely isolated in the desert, in the darkest and most deathly still hours of the night. But at the same time, the unchecked power of Tony Iommi's mammoth guitar riffs evokes images of erupting volcanoes and 8.8 earthquakes. And let us not forget the perfectly loose interplay of Bill Ward's pounding drums and Geezer Butler's plodding yeat fluid bass. Nothing against the uber-precise technical riffing of death metal and grindcore, but it was at one point called HEAVY Metal, and with good reason. While speedy, thrashy riffing has the ability to assault the listener much as an arsenal of machine guns, the lumbering rhythms laid down by Sabbath completely destroy, like an elephant crushing you under one foot until you can't breathe and every bone is broken in your body. THAT is heavy. <br /> <br />Even \\"Planet Caravan\\" (which I admittedly didn't like upon first listen when I first bought the album way back when I was 12), in its calm, almost jazzy quietness, still sounds unearthly and frightening. It is perfectly in place as the final (and only) relief from the sheer volume before \\"Iron Man\\" comes in and commences the rest of the album's terrifying descent into madness.  <br /> <br />Through the wah-drenched evil riff of \\"Electric Funeral\\", the harrowing post-war drug addiction tale of \\"Hand of Doom\\", right down to the galloping storm of the album-closing \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" (with its darkly melodic guitars and oddly twisted hallucionagenic lyrics, one of Sabbath's all-time classics), this is all absolutely essential Heavy Metal.  <br /> <br />And of course, I can't go without mentioning the title track. With its instantly recognizable opening guitar riff (which is never repeated once the song abandons it in its driving mid-paced rhythm) and desperate lyrics about depression and the protagonist's recognition of his own state of mental decay (no one can ever forget the opening line \\"Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind.\\"), the song \\"Paranoid\\" summarizes all of the anguish, frustration, and insecurity of passing from youth into adulthood in just 2 and a half minutes. <br /> <br />Since Black Sabbath first exploded into existence with their eponymous first album and song, Metal has evolved into countless styles, froms, and variations. I love most all of it, from sinister Black Metal like Darkthrone, Bathory as well as Emperor, to Speed Metal/Thrash like Slayer, Sodom and early Metallica, to ridiculously epic power metal such as Blind Guardian, Manowar and Hammerfall, to skull-crushing Doom/Drone/Sludge like the aforementioned Electric Wizard, SunnO))), and Eyehategod. But one thing all of these artists have in common (not to mention unapologetic Sabbath copycats like Sleep, Pentagram, and Saint Vitus), is their debt to Black Sabbath. Without their first four albums, and especially the albums Black Sabbath and Paranoid, there would be no Metal, regardless of what style you play. And, in my opinion, Paranoid is the one album that displays this music at its most powerful, dangerous, and absolute best. If you don't already own it, what the hell are you waiting for?

0802130208|5.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces,\\" John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece, takes its title from a quote of Jonathon Swift's: \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" And so we are introduced to the irrepressible Ignatius J. Reilly, a corpulent behemoth of a man-child living in New Orleans with his long-suffering mother. Ignatius is an oddity of a character: a morbidly obese slob, a lazy intellectual with delusions of grandeur, a hypochondriac constantly worried about the state of his 'valve', an argumentative buffoon in many ways and a damaged genius in others. It's not easy to take to Ignatius for all of these reasons -- which is fair, and I suppose that it is his oddities that make so many reviewers not take him seriously, but I would implore them to look past the facade. There is so much more to Ignatius if you look at the core of his being and try to understand why he is the way he is. Clearly, he is suffering from depression, and his arrogance and laziness are his method of pushing the world away. He wants to be a writer and esteemed intellectual, to bring back the \\"theology and geometry\\" that he thinks the world is sorely lacking, but instead of trying to get published he sends a dirty writing tablet filled with his writings to Tulane University with the expectation that they will file it in their library -- as if goading them into rejecting him as a lunatic. Whenever his mother presses him to get a job and make something of his life he is overcome by panic, and inevitably starts complaining that his precious valve is acting up. He clearly resents his living situation and wants to get out of New Orleans (a city he describes as \\"famous for its gamblers, prostitutes, exhibitionists, anti-Christs, alcoholics, sodomites ...\\" and, well, you get the point), but he blames fate -- specifically the Goddess Fortuna -- for keeping him chained there, as if he had no say in the matter. Ignatius J. Reilly is a man trapped in a vacuum of his own making, and the tragedy of it all is that it's unclear whether or not he will ever escape himself. The fact that the author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide before the book was even published makes this even more poignant. Blessed with an equally eccentric cast of supporting characters including Santa Battaglia, Myrna Minkoff (a woman Ignatius ostensiby despises but can't seem to let go of), and Angelo Mancuso, a police officer reduced to wearing ridiculous disguises when he is told to watch for 'suspicious characters' by his sergeant in order to make a big arrest, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is a novel that seems cartoonish at first glance, but is stunningly brilliant if you just look closer.y is a man trapped in a vacuum of his own making, and the tragedy of it all is that it's unclear whether or not he will ever escape himself.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|To start I am going to go out on a limb and say that this was the best album I bought last year. I find it fairly interesting that people are saying that this is weaker than Room For Squares and Heavier Things. I don't think they are even comparable! Ok, I'll admit that if you got into JM for his Dave Matthews influenced acoustic rock then I'll admit that Continuum aint the album for you. But if you have followed his growth into the blues rock musician that he has now become then you know that this album represents all of that growth and the promise of even more greatness from the man. It's true that he nothing short of swiped Eric Clapton's guitar tones and licks for a number of solos on this album, (I'm Gonna Find Another You would fit completely comfortably on EC's Reptile album!) but I personally couldn't think of a better guy to steal from! Outside from saying that Slow Dancing in a Burning Room is my pick of all the tracks on the album I am done disecting the album for you. BUY-LISTEN-REJOICE!
B00005JPBD|3.0|Penelope Cruz delivers the performance of her career in Pedro Almodovar's \\"Volver.\\" In her native Spanish language -where she doesn't stumble over every third line of dialogue - she morphs into Julia Roberts or Kate Winslet, actresses of wit, guile, aura and raffish charm. Cruz is smart, resourceful and smoldering. <br /> <br />That she's sexy and stuffed into tight blouses and short skirts is not the point. What she does in \\"Volver\\" is make her performance look effortless. She cuts a path for her character using many old school tricks of melodrama - facial expression, body language and comic timing - to pay a warm tribute to working women. <br /> <br />Cruz is in the moment, and it's fun to watch an actress own the screen like this. After years of tough and somewhat justified criticism of herworking America, Cruz finally steps up to the hype of being a modern Sophia Loren. And she should be proud of it. <br /> <br />Almodovar should be glad for it because \\"Volver\\" is not one his better films. It is a minor work compared to \\"All About My Mother\\" or \\"Talk to Her.\\" It's still a mix of comedy and pathos, and the movie's look is that typical warm palette of colors Almodovar specializes in. But the story is thin and exploitative, and the director takes liberties and shortcuts, relying on one of those long, unsatisfactory speeches you usually find in action flicks. <br /> <br />Because it is a personal homage to the films of Almodovar's youth - European neo-realism that juxtaposed beauty with society's underbelly -the movie showcases Cruz in all sorts of random situations. Here's her character, Raimunda, as a cook. Here she is flirting with a man. Singing a song. Talking to friends. Mopping. Moving several fridges. <br /> <br />Raimunda holds a lot of odd jobs because she's married to a lazy sort named Paco (Antonio de la Torre), who's been looking a little too lovingly at their daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo). Raimunda also has a sweet spinster sister named Soledad (Lola Duenas). <br /> <br />Both sisters live in Madrid, and they lost their parents in a village fire. The village seems to believe their mother, Irene (Carmen Maura), has returned as a ghost to take care of her dying sister. Then Soledad finds Irene in back of her station wagon. Soon, Irene is working for Soledad's home-based salon, and trying to avoid Raimunda.  <br /> <br />There's a rift between Raimunda and her mother, and the dark source of it ties the whole movie together. \\"Volver\\" waits too long to reveal this secret and refuses to deal with the emotional consequences of it. <br /> <br />Let's be honest. An American director would be closely examined for mixing such loose, jaunty material with serious subject matter. It would be nice if life merrily continued in the face of such deep, intimate betrayal. It does not, and it probably should not. <br /> <br />Sure, \\"Volver\\" is a fantasy. Almodovar is extending his characters an inner peace the world would not. That's gracious of him, and it is his right as an artist, but the approach demands harder questions than most critics are willing to pose. Just because a director intends to be playful, is it OK to advocate vengeance? Is death a just punishment for adultery? Should we be comfortable with Irene, or mortified? If Raimunda, the \\"lost\\" child, forgives her mother, isn't that meant as a signal for the viewer to pardon Irene as well? <br /> <br />Almodovar hides his revelatory ace so long to deflect those questions and focus on appreciating the daily life of a Spanish working diva. Again, that's kind of him, but it's snide, too. Paula, Raimunda's daughter, is wrapped up in a whole mess of lies. Do we embrace Raimunda's treatment of her? Does rage forgive behavior? <br /> <br />Those questions are possibly too didactic and literal. Then again, Almodovar's work is character-driven, and if we're not supposed to think about them, what other entryway is there into the narrative? Plus, Almodovar's masterwork, \\"Talk To Her,\\"is no less shocking but it's far more measured, relevant and thoughtful. <br /> <br />Maybe the decisions seem more acceptable, and the tone more allowable because Almodovar couches his story in a sunny paean to feminism. We accept, somewhat blindly, the random, unearned triumph of the female spirit. Consider when Soledad runs away from the voice of her ghostly mother only to face a courtyard of men. Almodovar shows their hard, unsmiling faces in close-up, and Soledad is frozen to her spot. She turns back toward her fear of the ghost. Better that, than any of those men. <br /> <br />It has nothing and everything to do with Cruz's performance. She is weakest in the scenes that should require the most emotional honesty, and she is best in the random scenes. She is the star here, and stars get a lot of mileage out of otherwise ordinary moments. \\"Volver\\" works when Cruz works it. <br /> <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Following the success of Norah Jones's first two albums, 2001's \\"Come Away With Me\\" and 2004's \\"Feels Like Home\\", (which sold around 17 million and 10 million copies respectively), I'm sure I'm not the only fan who's been wondering whether that level of success can be sustained and what she would do next, i.e. would she stick to her established formula and risk being savaged by the critics for \\"playing safe\\", being \\"dull and boring\\" and inducing slumber (\\"sleepytime pop\\" is how one newspaper critic recently described her music) or would she branch out and try something new, and risk alienating settled and comfortable (not to mention lazy) fans like me?<br /><br />The answer to the first question remains to be seen of course - after a couple of listens, I'm unsure as to whether this is a better album than the previous two - but happily, in regard to the second one, I think it's safe to say Jones has done both. She still sounds like the Norah we all love but she has made slight changes to her style in what, to this listener, sounds like a clever attempt to expand artistically without ruffling the feathers of her core audience. There's a new producer at the helm in Lee Alexander (Arif Mardin sadly passed away late last year) but while there's no overt new sound to speak of, there is a definite sense of a change in mood. The jaunty \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" has a darker edge and a sense of foreboding about it that's new, for instance, even though it is essentially a love song. It's a lot more percussive too. Things get slightly more electronic, even funky for a couple of minutes, on \\"Thinking About You\\", her most close-to-formula song on here and similarly, on \\"Be My Somebody\\". She nibbles at getting political on songs like \\"Wish I Could\\" and \\"My Dear Country\\" but she refrains from actually biting. On the former she sings: \\"Love in the time of war isn't fair/ He was my man but they didn't care\\". She sails a bit closer to the wind on the latter: \\"Nothing is as scary as election day,\\" she sings, and later, \\"Who knows, maybe the plans will change/ Who knows, maybe he's not deranged.\\" Further than many might have expected but I'm sure they'll be those who'll say she could've gone the distance.<br /><br />And I do question the wisdom of the whistling on \\"Little Room\\".<br /><br />But mostly there are no surprises here. Overall, the sound is a little drier maybe, with more acoustic guitar and cello than I recall hearing on her previous works but it's Norah Jones, still essentially the same but just a little different. Is she pop, is she jazz, is she country or is she folk? Maybe I'm getting too old to care but I just find attempts to categorise her boring now. Whatever she does, she does damn well and what's more, she makes it all seem so effortless. Her creamy voice never seems to rise above a whisper, a sonic caress, the kind of things lullabies are made of. (Maybe the sleepytime pop critic had a point after all). I put on my Norah Jones and I am immediately and very easily able to forget the madness going on all around me. The world feels like an easy, gentle place where everything is all right. Well worth paying $9.99 for, in my view.<br /><br />Norah Jones and her music seem to be very polarising, if the reviews on this site are anything to go by. It seems people either love her or hate her. I love her of course and in my book, any female singer/songwriter who can achieve the level of commercial success that she has without her videos on heavy rotation on MTV, her airbrushed face (and body in skimpy dresses) plastered all over glossy magazines or a canny PR machine frenetically making sure she remains at the forefront of our collective consciousness, surely has to be doing something right.ings, and later, \\"Who knows, maybe the plans will change/ Who knows, maybe he's not deranged.\\" Further than many might have expected but I'm sure they'll be those who'll say she could've gone the distance.

I love her of course and in my book, any female singer/songwriter who can achieve the level of commercial success that she has without her videos on heavy rotation on MTV, her airbrushed face (and body in skimpy dresses) plastered all over glossy magazines or a canny PR machine frenetically making sure she remains at the forefront of our collective consciousness, surely has to be doing something right.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Back when Blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike, there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed Blondie as \\"bubblegum pop,\\" and one group that would never have staying power. But I think it's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh. Parallel Lines helped establish Blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success. This album is also the first where Debbie Harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet, vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next. The album made punk, pop, and disco shake hands, which was a method unheard of in 1978. Songs like \\"Hanging on the Telephone,\\" \\"Picture This,\\" \\"Pretty Baby,\\" and \\"Sunday Girl,\\" have become irresitable pop gems, while \\"I Know But I Don't Know,\\" and \\"Fade Away & Radiate,\\" featuring a terrific guitar lick by Robert Fripp, are punk-driven classics. Last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in \\"One Way or Another,\\" and \\"Heart of Glass.\\" And how has Debbie Harry played out as lead singer after all these years? As Rolling Stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, \\"Madonna was surely watching.\\"
B000BT97AO|3.0|Ok, maybe not, but it does follow that story path.<br /><br />This movie rates as an 7 on the bad movie scale, and a 4 on the good movie scale. It gets points on the good movie scale for its storytelling from a teenage girl dream perspective. You don't need to be inebriated, an insomniac, or on crack to enjoy this film. The art is of the Neil Gaiman style: detailed, darkly colored, and seemingly disjointed from its story. Tumultuous is how I'd describe the story in terms of the girl's journey about understanding her emotional health. This rating is similar to what I'd give The Craft, which may still be added to my dvd collection. It is, after all, a very good bad movie.<br /><br />My interpretation of the film is that the darkness the girl experiences in her dream realm is the fear and self-loathing she feels about her mother's illness, possibly brain cancer as alluded to in the story, and how she behaved towards her mother just prior to hospitalization. The other good movie point is for the film actually ending with story resolution. Good films don't always have to have a finite ending, but resolution to the current story is always good. With no cliffhanger, it is likely that there will be no sequel. I would like to believe that I watch movies to gain something from them in exchange for the time I've spent watching it. Most of the time, I am after a well-told story.<br /><br />I did find Helena's answer to her own riddle (\\"What's green, hangs on a wall and whistles?\\") to the sphinx to be quite amusing.<br /><br />Helena: Riddle?

0451196716|5.0|Stephen King's horror books usually involve gore and violence, which make them more gross than horrific. This book is a shining exception, and probably his greatest work. The book's central theme is an odd fascination with death, and how King exploits this through the participants and spectators alike: the desire to join the race even if only 1% survive, fascination in watching the event, disgust at watching the event but then watching it anyway, a girl kissing one of the boys because it's like kissing death, etc etc. It is an absolutely brilliant book which shows just how far King has sunk in the past few years (From A Buick 8 is such a sad pathetic departure from King's original brilliance shown in this book). Never mind the ending, it's the process and the unfolding of this book that matters most. Ignore the \\"hate the ending\\" posts!
0767821629|5.0|This movie had a unique slant on an unusual type of time travel (more like 'mind travel'), though it really goes far deeper than just a 'man with a glorious machine' concept. It's hard to get your gray matter around this one, but the submersion into the intense Science Fiction element prompted me to watch it several times. A great techno-thriller with a twilight zone twist. If you liked the mind manipulation of 'Matrix', I believe you'll be intrigued from start to finish with this one.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

0618680004|5.0|After reading 'The God Delusion', I went through all the readers' reviews on this site to learn where everybody stands on this controversial book. Here is my review (some words and thoughts are taken from other reviewers on this site):    Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins (The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, A Devil's Chaplain, The Ancestor's Tale), in his book `The God Delusion', criticizes religion for its intolerance. His book is full of scorn for religion and those who believe. Dawkins argues that religion oppress women, creates intolerance, oppression, bigotry, homophobia, abortion-clinic bombings, war, suicide bombers, abuse children psychologically with the notion of eternal damnation, and closes people's minds to scientific truth.     Dawkins is hostile to religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise. It teaches us not to change our minds, and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known. In other words, the greatest crime of religion is to have us believe without asking scientific questions.    Dawkins believes that the world would be better and more peaceful without religion. According to him, the biblical God is \\"psychotic,\\" full of jealousy and revengeful. He portrays the God of the Old Testament as \\"arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticide, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully\\".     What all powerful God is it who creates life only to have his creation cannibalize itself to sustain itself?    He shows that the Founding Fathers considered religion to be a threat to democracy. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, claimed \\"Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man\\". Benjamin Franklin said, \\"Lighthouses are more useful than churches\\".     He draws on evolution todisprove the ideas behind intelligent design, and thus the existence of God. He argues that evolution is the only rational and sensible explanation for the existence of life. As the theory of evolution states, life is caught in a brutal competition and struggle for survival, and that is exactly what we find on Earth. No one can deny this fact, according to Dawkins.     Dawkins further argues that we can be impressed by the complexity and beauty of the world around us without believing in God; that it is not necessary for man to have religion in order to be good and moral (all our behavior, including our moral behavior, is genetically predetermined); that smart people (Einstein and Carl Sagan) don't believe in God; that religious people are a threat to smart people and scientific inquiry; that reading spiritual books such as the Bible will lead us to behave in monstrous ways, such as killing those we perceive as being opposed to our religion; having more people not believe in God will create room for better living and thinking; and that children should be protected from being taught religious beliefs by their parents. Dawkins writes that we should stop associating to children their parents' religion, because, he points out, it is the same as associating to them any other ideology (such as being democratic, republican, communist etc.).     In Dawkins' eyes, religion is the source of all evil, and based on fallacious myths, while atheism is the path of enlightenment and liberation.     He comes to the conclusion that all religions are \\"nonsense,\\" and that God does not exist. According to Dawkins, believing in God is \\"intellectual high treason\\".     The above is a brief summary of what the book is about. Now that we are on the same page, let's analyze the book.    God does not exist! Religion is nonsense and is therefore not needed! Not only is religion nonsense, it drives us to kill each other. Dawkins says that atheists do not kill people in the name of atheism.Let us pause for a minute and consider the above statements for a minute.    Who holds the worst body count of people murdered for ideological reasons? Is it Islam or Christianity maybe? Or maybe Judaism or Buddhism? There is no denying that millions of people died in the name of religion. How about \\"atheistic\\" Marxism? The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Khmer Rouge, and the Nazis, to name a few, carried out the most extensive atrocities and genocides that the world has ever seen. What they have in common is an atheist ideology and a hatred of religions, religious beliefs, and the ethnicities associated with religions (the holocaust, as an example). What about the imprisonment and torture of innocent people? Aren't those committed by people with no fear of being 'judged' by a Supreme Being?     Man tries hard to dismiss God, because once dismissed, man can do whatever he wants; he can be his own god! This belief in being your own god is what drove Hitler in his attempt to create the 'master race'.     Dawkins argues that science has eradicated God and that, in a way, it should be seen as a new religion. How about the horrible things science has done? The nuclear bomb, biological warfare, poison gases, to name just a few, have killed millions of people and threaten to destroy our very existence.    Who can question that creation in all its violence, beauty, discipline and awesomeness does not have the signatures of intelligence, wisdom, order, and perhaps even purpose? Common sense tells me that scientists in particular should be the ones promoting the existence of a Supreme Being regardless of how we name Him.     There is no scientific proof for or against the existence of God. Just because we cannot prove God in the lab, does not mean God doesn't exist. Fill a glass with water. Now put some salt in it. You can clearly see the salt in the glass. But how about the next day, would you still be able to see the salt? The salt would have dissolved inthe water, and thus become invisible to the eye. Yet it is still in the water!    Imagine yourself in the middle of the desert. You come upon a watch. Could this watch have come together by chance? There is obviously a designer who put the pieces together to form the watch or at the very least gave the instructions to those who did build the watch. When we look at the world around us, everything is too complex to have come into existence without an intelligent designer. This intelligent designer we call God (one reviewer used this analogy and I thought it was a good one).    Let's look at another example. Imagine a junk yard. Now imagine a hurricane blows through the junk yard, and behold, you suddenly have a 747 aircraft! That is exactly what evolutionist's claim; that the big bang created our universe! How many things do you know of that come about by accident? Where did the energy from the big bang come from? (Dawkins actually used this analogy in his book but he explains it in a different way)    It takes a lot more faith to believe the Universe came about by random chance than it does to believe a Creative Being or Force designed things this way.    Only a Supreme Being has the capacity to create the greatest miracle known to Man, that of Creation itself. Nothing comes from nothing!    If God exists, then who created God? This is a thought process trapped in the confines of our own time frame. God is outside of creation and thus, not subject to time (when), space (where), or matter (what). How can the one who created time be subject to it? How can the one who created space be confined to it? And how could we, with our very limited mind, try to imagine how and who God is? (This paragraph is a direct quote from one of the reviewers on this site)    Let's take the example of a fly to illustrate the above point. Can a fly understand mathematics? Can a fly imagine a great palace as a dwelling place and set out to design one for itself? The answers to those questionsare obvious. What makes us think that our brain is any different than a fly's when it comes to understanding our universe?     Our earthly minds are deliberately 'veiled' from the whole Truth in order for our soul to experience challenges of a deeper kind. If we were aware of the whole Truth, then not only would the challenges cease to be, but we'd also be jumping off bridges in an attempt to get back Home (in other words, to Heaven. I took this paragraph from one of the reviews on this site).    I truly believe in God, but our religions have been written and interpreted over and over again that they have become confusing and self-contradictory.    Many religious people feel embarrassed by the failure of some aspects of their religious tradition to co-exist with common sense. Many Muslims, for example, are embarrassed by the events of September 11, 2001 and by jihadists blowing themselves up and countless other innocent people.     We live in a world where priests carry out sexual exploits in secret while condemning others who live life openly and free. We live in a world were leaders misuse religion for power. No wonder many of us question our religion.    Can we separate religion from God? It is possible to be both spiritual and anti-religious?    Many of you will find it strange that I gave this book a 5 stars rating even though I truly believe in God. The more controversial a book is, the more it challenges the mind, and that is exactly what I like about Dawkins' 'The God Delusion'. I found the book to be thought provoking, very educational, and very entertaining.     People who really should read this book won't as they don't like to have their faith challenged. Who said I'd have to give up my faith after reading this book? If you want to know if God is real, just ask Him!
0743267478|5.0|There are a billion people in India, and one wins a billion rupees on \\"Who Will Win a Billion?\\", truly a one-in-a-billion shot.  The one who wins is asked the only questions he could probably answer in the world, by a coincidence equivalent to his odds.  From this timely and gripping premise, Vikas Swarup has crafted a wonderful novel, taking Ram Mohammed Thomas through his entire life in the way he explains how he, a poor 18-year old waiter, was able to answer each of the questions that led to his billion, and also to a stint in a Mumbai jail.      The book unfolds in the order of the questions Ram was asked on the quiz show, with his explanation of how he learned each answer forming the story.  The most poignant part covers his period of time in Agra, where he works as a tourist guide at the Taj Mahal, befriends a boy who speaks nonsense, falls in love with a girl forced into prostitution and suddenly realizes that he must get on this quiz show to effect his life's destiny.   I cried as that chapter ended.    Swarup is not a polished writer (he's a lawyer turned novelist) and he didn't experience many of the places or events of this book (he is well-educated and lives in England).  But the book was clearly written with passion and compassion and a great deal of understanding and love for India and for his characters.  His use of coincidence sometimes comes off as heavy-handed, until you realize that the entire story is about that one in a billion chance.  Somewhere in heaven, Douglas Adams, inventor of the infinite improbability drive, is smiling reading this book.
B00000JCB3|2.0|Although I primary listen to hip hop most of my life, I ocassionally listen to other genres of music. But to be straight up: This album sucks. It sucked back in 1999 and it sucks today.<br /><br />Lets bust a few myths before I continue:<br /><br />*Fred Durst is not rap, let alone hip hop. He basically just says words in a fast pace. He barely stays on beat on some of these songs.<br /><br />*Anyone who says Fred Durst is an excellent lyricist needs to have their hearing checked. Just listen to \\"Nookie\\" for a good example.<br /><br />*I don't listen to heavy metal that much anymore, but just because you hear some heavy drums and loud electric guitars, doesn't make you heavy metal.<br /><br />Now as for this album, I only find two good tracks on here which are \\"9 Teen 90 Nine\\" and \\"N2Gether Now\\", only because of Method Man, and DJ Premier. In fact that song was the only reason why I wanted this album back in '99. Everything else sucks. Most of the vocals here are horrible to listen to (even \\"Rearranged\\" looses it's momentum after a while). And I agree with one reviewer who says that the drummer John Otto sounds like hes just beating the drums insanely. And I still believe DJ Lethal should have stayed with \\"House Of Pain\\" because this band has been dragging his career down.<br /><br />Overall I can't recommend this album to anyone, unless you are into pop and alternative music (I can barely call this rock). I won't lie, I was about 13 or 14 when this dropped and thought it was awesome. 7 years later, you couldn't pay me to listen to this anymore. Whats even worse is that I bought their next album, which is WORSE than this. My advice, download \\"N2Gether Now\\" because I believe that is the best track. Avoid this album all together though.<br /><br />Lyrics: D<br /><br />Production: D+<br /><br />Guest Appearances: B<br /><br />Musical Vibes: F<br /><br />Overall: D<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: 9 Teen 90 Nine, N2Gether Now<br /><br />Peace Everyone!!!

What I like about his lyrics is that they are humorous and funny to listen to, and I think that is what made him accepted by everyone.<br /><br />As I mentioned, there are a lot of bangers on here. \\"Pick It Up\\" was the first that stood out to me. Redman's rhymes have much substance for most part. \\"Smoke Buddah\\" is a funny track that is fun to listen to (even the edits sound funny). \\"Rollin'\\" and the series \\"Supaman Lover 3\\" really shows off Funk Doc's best skills.<br /><br />Guest apperances are excellent as well. Partner in rhyme Method Man would appear on the song \\"Do What You Feel\\". Old schooler K-Solo hops on the track \\"It's Like That (My Big Brother)\\". Then there is the Def Squad crew on the closing track \\"The Ill Out\\".<br /><br />As for anything bad, there are a few. Some of the skits are not appealing, but some are. And I find \\"Case Closed\\" with Crossbreed pretty skippable. Other than that, this album is one album that should be added to your collection. Redman, doesn't make bad albums, and this proves that he is a real consistant emcee. If you are new to Redman, you should also listen to \\"What?

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist (horrible title!) is a wonderful movie to watch, which makes sense, because it's all about visual illusion, and nobody does visual illusion quite like Hollywood.  From the theatre to the palace, the costumes to the cobblestone streets, carriages, and buildings, the sense of place is compelling - excellent cinematography.  (Norton seems unsure about what sort of accent he is trying to pull off, but for the most part, even the diction and affect of the actors contribute.)<br /><br />The basic story, to say nothing of the dialogue! - is pretty boilerplate, a boy meets girl set-up with a royal court intrigue backdrop.  That's okay because the protagonists are likeable and the villain is really nasty - Giamatti is excellent as the guy in the middle.  Where the film gets into trouble is with its depiction of magic.  Norton - a terrific actor who struggles with unremarkable looks - has been made up well, he's almost dashing.  At times, when he is conjuring, Norton almost seems to have that Svengali dark power of magic, which can be turned to evil purposes at will.<br /><br />I was reminded of a much better movie, The Magician, by Ingmar Bergman.  It was clear in that film that magic, and magicians, emanated from a dark place and were not to be trifled with.  Our Ed, by contrast, has wandered the globe living for years in the Orient and still retains his affable, kid next-door persona - summoning spirits for stunned audiences as casually as you or I would use the phone to summon pizza delivered to our door.  This is one of many ways this picture cheats you.  Is he merely an entertainer, or is there sinister purpose to his shows?  Maybe he just likes being on stage.<br /><br />Bergman's The Magician ends with a chirpy twist which seems to belie everything that came before it, the deus ex machina for which magicians are famous.  It's a deliberate sleight of hand.  The ending of The Illusionist also comes with a twist, but it fails.  Instead of running in contrast to what's come before, it is designed to explain and justify \\"the show.\\"  In this regard it is incredibly cheap and flabby - like watching playing cards fall from a magician's sleeve as bunnies hop around the stage.  Jessica Biel is exquisite, Rufus Sewell is an excellent baddy, and the antler hallway alone is worth the price of admission.  But don't be tricked into thinking it's anything more than what it is - a nice show.e, it is designed to explain and justify \\"the show.\\"  In this regard it is incredibly cheap and flabby - like watching playing cards fall from a magician's sleeve as bunnies hop around the stage.

B000J10EQU|3.0|Superman Returns was a bit of a disappointment, considering the hype, though by no means is it a bad movie. <br />After taking an unexpected and abrupt leave of absence, Superman returns to find out that things are not as he had left them...  <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is the familiar Superman setting, the special effects are very good, while the dialogues and the plot are just average. <br />The major setbacks are in relation to: <br />1) The mediocre plot and the average dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.  Specifically, turning the film into a soap opera was such a letdown!   <br />2) Kate Bosworth was not that great as Lois.  Just as uninteresting were the actors playing the minor roles. <br />3) Why did the little boy have to look like a little girl???  <br />4) Apart from being given terrible lines, Kevin Spacey was surprisingly not that good. <br />Though the potential for an amazing movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers. <br />The very good special effects in conjunction with the fact that it's (lovable) superman after all and that Brandon Routh does have potential are just about the only things worth while. <br />Let's hope the next one is better. <br />

B000KCHZK6|4.0|Not Too Late continues Norah Jones' impressive recording streak.  Her third effort represents some significant changes from her first two albums.  It is her first album where she has either wrote or co-wrote all the songs and it is the first album produced by someone other than the late Arif Mardin.  The first thing one notices about the album is the sparse arrangements.  While there are songs with a full band, this is more of an acoustic affair. It really showcases Ms. Jones' sultry voice.  While it is nice that she is branching out and trying different sounds, the best tracks are the ones with the full band arrangements including the magnificent soul driven \\"Thinking About You\\" and the jazzy \\"Until The End\\".  \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" dabbles in a Tom Waits sound and is an interesting track while \\"Be My Somebody\\" sounds like it is from her work with her country side project The Little Willies.  Overall, Not Too Late is a better than average record by an artist who is expanding her music horizons and showing she is more than a one trick pony.

6305546789|5.0|Halloween is the movie that started the avalanche of \\"slasher\\" horror movies.<br /><br />But the original is the BEST!<br /><br />John Carpenter is a master at terror, and his Halloween is the sterling example.<br /><br />You don't need blood to scare.  Carpenter uses a strong storyline about the psycho Michael Myers to awaken every childhood horror of the BOOGEYMAN!  Carpenter uses shadows, out of focus mask shots and startling loud noises to inflict the terror intended when the 'Boogeyman' makes true believers of those skeptical to Doctor Loomis' warnings!<br /><br />There was no need for any \\"Chss-Chss-Pah-Pah\\" in this one!  Just Myer's labored breathing behind that awful white Cap't Kirk mask is enough to give you the neccesary nightmares after viewing this one!<br /><br />So, order  Halloween.  Turn down the lights. Turn up your home theater system.  Get ready for horror in the Hitchcock fashion.<br /><br />Yes, Virginia!  There IS a BOOGIEMAN!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|OK, the movie is great, awesome, spectacular, very well acted, thrilling, but if the movie is all this. Why Sony didn't do the same job in to make this collector's edition well worth it? There are only 90 minutes of extras if you didn't know. No trailers. No Death in Venice featured. I'm completely disappointed Sony Pictures.
0784011680|5.0|This is a wonderfull and interesting movie on the life of Charlie Chaplin, with one of the best performances i have seen from Robert Downey jr,and includes good performances by many other stars, including Charlies own daughter.It gives real insight to the world of silent movies, it is at times sad and tragic but mostly funny and entertaining, a must to see wether you are a fan of Chaplin or not and definetly if you are a fan of Downey as his potrayal is superb.
B000JVSUS4|3.0|This movie was definitely one to show off the Blu-Ray format, but some corporate genius decided not to pay MS royalties for the use of VC-1, and they went with MPEG2 again on PH.  Unless you have the sharpness dialed down on your set, or a 720p display blocking can be seen on this title pretty easily.  If you're not sensitive to it then you're lucky.  It comes through looking almost like a second layer of grain, but not the very fine grain of good film we're used to.  I know some films are intentionally grainy, but rather than error diffusion (like real grain) this movie exhibits patterned grain.  It is an artifact of MPEG2 block in motion. <br /> <br />Titles released on Blu-Ray in VC1 encoding have proven how much better they can look.  Why won't they maximize the potential of the format already?
B000002N25|3.0|Maybe it was because I was listening to Golden Heart on a short road trip when I also had White Stripes and The Go-Betweens in the player, but this CD comes off a bit boring and too comfortable to me.  I have no quarrel of course wtih Mark Knopfler as an outstanding musician and Dire Straits as a great genre-bending band, but, OK, what have you done for me lately (or at least lately as in 1996)?  Not much -- three songs utilizing Celtic pipes is two songs too many, and then there's the couple of cuts that sample riffs from Money for Nothing, and making fun of Imelda Marcos was already a decade old at the time this was recorded, and who needs a sympathetic take on a lonely autograph hound?  But all that occupies space on this CD.  Far from a different direction, Golden Heart sounds more like re-warmed Dire Straits than anything else to me.  Not a bad thing, but nowhere near a great thing, either.  For the record, favorite cuts are Golden Heart, Cannibals, and the sweet love song, Are We in Trouble Now?
B000002ADT|5.0|In the first week I had this CD, I listened to it everyday for the whole week. It changed the way I play music especially when improvising or playing in a band--although I am not a pro musician, I can tell it. Each note played by each instrument at anytime seems to be just right--you feel that not a single note is missing or one too many. The connections between songs are just perfect, especially between the first song and the second. Seamless. <br />
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Both Madonna herself and her highly acclaimed 2006 Confessions Tour can be easily identified by three central characteristics - Energy, Originality, and Expertise. <br /> <br />ENERGY - <br />Despite claims to the contrary, Madonna is not aging gracefully; how can this be when she is, in fact, not aging at all?  She is one of few, if any, celebrities who has defied time by wholly stopping and paradoxically enough, reversing the aging process.  Despite accumulating almost fifty years of age under her diamond-studded belt, Madonna's body is as rock-solid as ever and her face wrinkleless (although some cite Botox as the `youthenizer' for the latter).  Injections or not, she retains a raw, undiluted sex appeal that has both captivated and excited generation after generation.  She flaunts her tireless sensually once again on this tour through the implementation of a seemingly interminable string of hip-thrusts and grinds during the pumping jam, \\"Like It or Not.\\"  In addition, many other numbers feature her now-signature eroticized dance routines including \\"Get Together,\\" \\"Like a Virgin,\\" \\"Sorry,\\" \\"Music,\\" \\"Hung Up,\\" and unsurprisingly, \\"Erotica.\\"  To some parents' dismay but her fans' delight, this feminist message of owning and embracing one's sexually is pervasive throughout her exhaustive set. <br /> <br />ORIGINALITY - <br />Madonna has never been one to settle for mediocrity or lackluster performance; this trend is maintained throughout the entirety of the Confessions Tour.  Although many of her time-tested songs and selections are familiar, her executions are as novel as can be.  Take, for example, the 80s anthem \\"Like a Virgin.\\"  While she could have donned a wedding dress and enacted yet another infamous episode of stage-grinding, M opted to remix the track and restage her performance by replacing marriage ceremonies with tumbling mares.  Being only three tracks into the concert extravaganza, \\"Like a Virgin\\" embodies the opening number's equestrian theme.  Outfitted in spandex riding apparel, Madonna gallops across the stage, her golden locks swaying to and fro with each footfall.  Large-scale video installations project clips of horseracing accidents interspersed with shots of M's x-rays taken after her bone-breaking riding injury of '05.  As she segues into the chorus, the Queen of Pop takes a turn for the controversial by mounting an S&M style carousel horse.  There she bucks and rears like a savage beast, all the while performing supernatural feats of flexibility including soaring leg extensions and reverse splits.  The symbolism here is anything but subtle as Madonna showcases the correlation between horse riding and human sexuality.  The equestrian theme continues for one more song (\\"Jump\\") before being replaced by a Middle Eastern suite (\\"Live to Tell,\\" \\"Forbidden Love,\\" \\"Isaac,\\" \\"Sorry\\") which is then followed by a show-stopping disco medley (\\"Music,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" \\"La Isla Bonita,\\" \\"Lucky Star,\\" \\"Hung-Up\\").   <br /> <br />EXPERTISE - <br />Without a doubt, Madonna is the quintessence of a seasoned performer.  She has sang, danced, and gyrated herself to the top and in doing so, has rightfully solidified her reputation as the world's \\"best performer of all time.\\"  By now, she has the art of performance down to a science and no tour better substantiates this than her most recent.  There is literally not a single misstep, not a single slurred lyric, and not a single movement out of sync during the entirety of the recorded event.  This type of `no-holds-back' singing and dancing is true second nature to M but she realizes that even when she gives her all, she must still give even more.  She must provide her audience with an EXPERIENCE, something that will leave a lasting impression long after her final words, \\"I'm tired of waiting on you,\\" have faded from memory.  Therefore, the pre-produced elements of the concert are almost as rewarding as the performances themselves.   <br /> <br />Her video productions don't serve merely as backdrops to better impact her audience - no, they are, in and of themselves, feature presentations.  Don't believe me?  Watch the cinematic CGI sequences screened during \\"Forbidden Love.\\"  Computer-generated blood cells appear on screen and a time-lapse progression occurs as cell division begins.  This continues over and over again until countless cells have been amassed.  They then begin lumping together, forming various religious symbols (a Cross, a Wheel of Dharma, the Star of David, the `Om' Symbol, etc).  These masses float about in an emerald fluid before suddenly, one by one, they collide and burst.  These images only further emphasize the spirit of the track - the fragmentation of humanity along religious lines and the dangers that exist therein. <br /> <br />What makes this concert experience so compelling is its re-watch value.  You can view the DVD literally dozens of times and still uncover something new and rewarding in this alternate state of reality which Lady M has crafted so marvelously for our enjoyment.  So, only one question remains: are you ready to jump?
B00008EY65|5.0|I really liked this movie. I thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it. It was well told and the characters were well developed. The special effects were great too!! I am not one for comic book heros, but this one confinced me otherwise. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character.
B00005JP9V|5.0|The film Children of Men, while fictional, still has it's finger on the pulse of what is headed our way as a species. A period of unrest will happen eventually. The United States will get it the worst because right now we have it the best. The film does a good job of showing just how it will go down. The idea of humans not being able to conceive is a brilliant concept for this film and the novel.<br /><br />The idea of a lone pregnant woman wandering a childless world wrought with unrest and carnage is great and for once illuminates a distopia film with a ray of hope. If only a single child could do that today. The film also does a marvelous job of illustrating how even today we have lost sight of the hope, beauty and promise humanity has to offer. It also shows how sometimes things need to get worse before they get better.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have it in my top 3 favorite films of 2006. It will be remembered for a long while and is one of the more reflective films of our times. this is not the 60s boys and girls this is the new millennium, we have larger problems and a few marches on the mall will not fix them this time.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|Amazing memories of the most amazing Madonna's show to date. I got the chance to see this concert on July 23 in Miami, it was just an great experience. This DVD is totally worth it. And if your not a Madonna fan, you might become one after seeing this show. Play it really loud on your home theater, and you'll feel like you're right in there back in the concert!!!

B000E1MTY0|5.0|This is a very well-made movie. The cast, acting, direction, cinematography, and writing are all excellent as are the visual effects.  <br />The HD-DVD version packs in a number of extras (deleted scenes, commentary, etc.) which is expected.  <br />The best feature of this film is the fact that running in 1080i resolution there are no blue-screen artifacts or visual blemishes. HD-DVDs are worth the extra expense for movies such as this one which offer stunning visuals and excellent story telling.

B00005RHGL|5.0|As I put Tombstone in my list of top 5 favorite movies, it wound up at the top of the list. I'm typically not one for viewing movies of this length as usually they will linger and loose my interest. Tombstone moves along at a great pace and every scene offers attention grabbing excitement. I'm also not one for watching a movie more than once unless of course I really, really enjoy it, then it may not be more than twice. I own Tombstone on DVD and have watched it over 100 times since it's 1993 release! The cast is superb...the entire cast! The intensity of the direction in unmatched by any western prior to or since!

B000K7VHQE|5.0|At the beginning of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", everyone seems to be floating in a kind of Proustian soup--a fact marked by the screenwriters when they make one of the ensemble cast, Frank,who has just lost his lover and attempted suicide \\"the world's #1 Proust scholar\\".  The three adult male members--Frank, the uncle (Steve Carell), father Richard (Greg Kinnear), and Richard's father (Alan Arkin, \\"Grandpa\\"), come at us with eyes full of a sense of a life somehow gone off the track, much as little Olive, the title character, bounces cheerily in with eyes full of hope and dreams.  Paul Dano, as teenage Dwayne, in a vow of silence that allows his character to play the tortured adolescent brilliantly by showing no affect whatsoever and through scribbled notes like \\"Welcome to Hell\\" and \\"Please don't kill yourself tonight\\", still hangs on to two dreams--getting away from his family, and being a test pilot for the Air Force. Mom Sheryl (Toni Colette), quirky in her own way, (\\"Olive, you can be fat or thin, whichever you want,\\") is the glue that seems to hold this bunch together.<br /><br />When Olive gets a chance to participate in the finals of a beauty contest in another state, the  family  pack up in the yellow VW van.  On the way, dad keeps in touch with the guru who's supposed to get his first book off the ground, of which he told mom \\"This is it,\\" an apparent promise to get his office out of her kitchen.  He excitedly shares his \\"9 Step\\" self help program to everyone.  Grandpa, who has been helping Olive with the \\"talent\\" part of her performance, sneaks into the bathroom to snort some of the cocaine that got him kicked out of the retirement home and into the Hoovers' household.  Frank seems to be growing comfortable with this quirky family of his sister's, particularly Dwayne.<br /><br />But before they reach the Redondo Beach hotel where the pageant takes place, losses or the poignant memories knock the wind out of each of the yellow, sunshiny bus's passengers. Painful (and expensive) as these problems threaten to be, no one suggests turning back.<br /><br />Once in Redondo Beach, afraid the pageant is not for Olive, they are tempted to \\"protect\\" her from her own dream.  After all, they've all just been a little bruised, they don't want her to feel such pain. But instead, they find a way to temper the consequences of living those dreams out, a little.  In doing so, they craft a last scene  full of all the comedic command of Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, an up and coming little Abigail Breslin,  other members of this stupendous cast, and a certain funky number by the late Rick James.<br /><br />*********<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS<br /><br />This DVD is worthwhile in that the directors' and writers' comments are helpful in understanding the film.  I'm surprised to hear, for example, that the directors thought the scene with Frank (Steve Carell) in the convenience store (no spoilers, sorry) would be funny.  It will break your heart--as will the one scene where Dwayne does become emotional.<br /><br /> The camera technique used by having a camera in the back and front of the bus (and several different busses) gave more of a sense of what the crew and cast were going through on this low-budget film: clearly a labor of love.<br /><br />Don't get too excited over the 4 alternate endings.  1 of them is Abigail Breslin's (Olive)  ending, \\"with Abigail Breslin directing\\" and you can pretty much guess the 2 minute ending she would have liked.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Edward Norton, as always, was fantastic.  I really enjoyed this film.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|I really didn't think anything could top Universal's excellent \\"Legacy Collection\\" of the classic monster films.  True, the initial collection was released to help promote Stephen Sommer's forgettable VAN HELSING film, but they were also a very impressive and affordable way to collect many of the studio's great monster movies.<br /><br />Now, for the 75th annivesary of Dracula, here comes yet another DVD release. . .the third release, in fact (Dracula was released on DVD in a single-disc edition in 2000).  For fans who already own one or both of the previous releases, the question is obvious: Do you need another version of Dracula?<br /><br />Well, the answer is YES, you do!  And here's why: As good as the Legacy Collection prints of Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. looked, Universal has actually improved upon the picture and sound quality for this release.  But that's only part of the reason to upgrade.  Several new bonus features enhance your viewing experience.  In addition to the excellent audio commentary from film scholar David Skal (heldover from the earlier discs), there is an all-new commentary track from Steve Haberman.  Haberman, the director of Mel Brooks' parody DRACULA, DEAD AND LOVING IT, might seem an odd choice at first.  But he offers plenty of insight into the film's production, and spends an inordinate amount of time picking apart the Spanish production of Dracula, which many fans feel is superior to Tod Browning's film.<br /><br />Another bonus is \\"Monster Tracks,\\" a running text commentary, in which trivia about the film's production appears on-screen throughout the feature.  Much of the information is repeated from Haberman's commentary, and the track's writers take off on tangents that sometimes have nothing to do with what's happening on-screen (such as lengthy biographical information on director Browning).  Still, even a die-hard fan like myself learned a few new tidbits about Dracula.<br /><br />\\"Lugosi: The Dark Prince\\" is a fine documentary that was also included on Image's \\"Heroes of Horror\\" from a few years back.  And I'm pretty sure it also aired on A & E sometime in the mid-90's.  Lugosi fans looking for a more definitive overview of the actor should pick up \\"Lugosi: Hollywood's Dracula.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, there's a great feature-length documentary on ALL the Universal Horror films.  Well...maybe not quite ALL of them, but it's a fairly comprehensive program.<br /><br />I won't use up any more space discussing the merits of Dracula itself.  If you're read this far, you know it's one of the defining moments of cinematic horror.  And with this deluxe 2-disc set, virtually no stone is left unturned in celebrating its lasting impact.  This is truly an essential purchase for classic horror fans, and probably for anyone else interested in the early history of sound movies.mentary that was also included on Image's \\"Heroes of Horror\\" from a few years back.

0553260111|5.0|A man is found on a small island called Ile de Port Noir in the Mediterranean, south of Marseilles. He is more corpse than man. A doctor, an Englishman named Washburn who came to Ile de Port Noir 8 years before because of his dismissal from Macleans Hospital in London, saves his life. But the man suffers a memory loss. He knows several languages. He is deadly in hand-to-hand combats. He can use several kinds of weapons. But he doesn't know who he is, where he comes from, whom he works for. He doesn't know his own identity. He is an amnesiac. Implanted beneath the skin on his hip is a frame of microfilm, which contains a bank account number. This account number leads to a bank in Zurich, the name Jason Bourne, supposed to be his, and four million dollars. Is Jason Bourne his real name? Or Cain? Or Delta? Or anything else? He becomes a wanted man of every side. The police want him. His description is on every immigration desk and border check in Europe. His old friends and colleagues want him dead. Carlos, who is the most dangerous assassin in the world, hunts him. He is struggling to kill his enemies, to protect the woman he loves, to find out his past and his identity, and to survive. <br /> <br />I watched the movie starring Matt Damon about a year ago. The movie is excellent. Matt Damon is also an excellent actor. But I am sorry to say that the book is much better. This is the first Robert Ludlum book I've read. And I am sure that this isn't the last one. Mr. Ludlum has done an excellent job in piling plot twist upon plot twist. The pace is fast. The book is full of actions and surprises. I would highly recommend this one to anyone who wants a 5-star action thriller book.
B000002J09|5.0|Starting with thedown and dirty rocker Black dog 4 coninues where 3 left off. Rock n roll is what the title says. Battle of evermore is an elegant beautiful fairy tale like song with Sandy Denhy on backing vocal. Stairway to Heaven is still an ojective choice for greatest song ever. Misty mountain hop is a fun listen. Foursticks is a very overlooked song everything about it is good. Going to California is a great folk song. When the levee breaks is a great blues song wtth Bonhams drums leading the way and a solem vocal from Plant IV Is not overated a true classic.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|Two children in Morocco test the range of a new rifle that their father just purchased.  Americans Susan (Blanchett) and Richard (Pitt) are on vacation when Susan is shot and badly injured, setting off an international incident.  Richard and Susan's children in America are being watched by their nanny, an illegal immigrant named Amelia (Barraza).  She brings the children across the border into Mexico to attend her son's wedding, and problems arise when they attempt to re-enter America.  In Japan, deaf-mute Chieko (Kikuchi) is trying to connect with someone, anyone.  All the stories are related, and all come together smoothly in this tale of small mistakes and lapses in judgment, and the consequences that they cause.<br /><br />Like \\"21 Grams\\" before it, in \\"Babel\\" director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu masterfully entwines multiple stories into a compelling film.  Packed with solid performances all around.  Bernal and Kikuchi in particular are standouts, and their Academy Award nominations are fully warranted.  This is not a fun movie, but it is thought provoking and solid.  It says a lot about the world we live in and the amount of misunderstanding in it.  I highly recommend this film.
0393327655|2.0|The research behind this book is outstanding and the author's writing style is direct but not very warm.  Even though the author would call me a \\"believer in the myth of God\\" I still found the book very interesting and insightful around the problems that organized religions present to this world.  He does a fair job deconstructing some religious systems, most harshly with Islam but the other major belief systems are not far behind.<br /><br />To anyone inclined toward faith in a God and to anyone who believes it is stupid to suggest that if you can't measure it or examine it then it does not exist... this book will leave you pretty empty.  While he suggests meditation is a good thing (toward what end I am not sure), it is human potential, without the crutch of a \\"myth\\", which should be honored, measured, and pursued.  So, he would argue simply that humanism should replace God.  My summary of the book is essentially this:  Religions kill and destroy, humanism is our only hope.  If you buy that, you should buy the book.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|My love of the novel and the 1983 BBC film adaptation starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, ruined all chances of me enjoying this latest Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Eyre. It started off well with the gloomy mystery I was expecting, and then it became an overly melodramatic succession of one sappy scene after another. Ruth Wilson pulled off the character of Jane fairly well, but Toby Stephens I felt was miscast - too much smiling and smirking - he played Rochester like a caricature and ended up seeming comical instead of smolderingly sexy. The multitude of kissing scenes didn't help to turn up the heat at all. This version is definitely for the younger perkier crowd of romantics. For me, it lacks depth and I don't feel the weight of the story - I'm not left wanting more.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Ever since the bloated Be Here Now, I have not had any interest in buying an Oasis album.  However, after hearing \\"Let There Be Love\\" I decided to give this one a shot, and I have not been disappointed.  I bought it about three months ago and I have listened to it pretty much non-stop since.  The songs on Don't Believe the Truth are stripped down compared to the guitar-heavy, interminable tracks on Be Here Now, and the result is fantastic.  The songs still sound melodic and huge, but not overdone.  It also helps that none of them is 60 minutes long like every track on Be Here Now.  I also have to admit that, after not listening to an Oasis album for probably 6 years, it was great to hear Liam Gallagher's vocals again. <br /> <br />There are really no throw-away tracks on the album, but some of the best include \\"Turn Up the Sun,\\" \\"Mucky Fingers,\\" and \\"Lyla\\" (all of which deserve to be played loud and often), \\"Keep the Dream Alive,\\" \\"Let there Be Love,\\" and \\"A Bell Will Ring.\\" <br /> <br />I have always been partial to British rock, and it really doesn't get much better than this.  I think Oasis have suffered for about a decade from trying to clear the impossibly high bar they set with What's the Story (Morning Glory), and for that reason, they still have alot of skeptics--I was one of them.  But I consider this album a step in a new (and the right) direction.  Definitely give this one a listen.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|Despite all the haters out there this was one of the best Madonna tours ever. Madonna described the tour as \\"turning the world into a giant dance floor\\". The show is divided into four separate acts with different themes: Equestrian, Urban Bedouin, Glam Punk and Disco Fever. Madonna's Confessions Tour was a concert tour organized to support the album Confessions on a Dance Floor and set the record for the top-grossing tour ever by a female artist. The tour grossed more than $194.8 million with a total of 60 shows and 1.2 million people in paid attendance through North America, Europe, and Japan. Despite the U.S. lack of good taste in music and by refusing to give her radio play for her Confessions CD, she still managed to gross more than $80 million for the U.S. shows alone throughout the summer. In The U.S. her confessions tour instantly became the highest grossing summer tour of the year 2006. The tour has generated international controversy due to its use of Christian religious symbols. While singing \\"Live to Tell\\", Madonna hangs from a mirrored cross wearing a crown of thorns around her head. Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups in North America and Europe came together to criticize what they saw as Madonna's exploitation of \\"sacred\\" Christian symbols and labeled the show as blasphemous even though they never saw the show. Madonna brought more than just the Devil out in some of these Christians and other religious groups. A 63-year-old Dutch priest was even arrested when he decided to make a confession of his own when he confessed to making a hoax bomb threat in an attempt to stop her concert. In response to the criticism, Madonna personally and publicly invited Pope Benedict XVI to see the show while she was in Rome - insisting that she was doing the controversial act to raise awareness and money for orphans abandoned in Africa (particularly Malawi) due to HIV/AIDS and that \\"Jesus wouldn't mind.\\" (While she sings \\"Live To Tell,\\" in the background run haunting images of the devastation in Africa right now. On the top of the screen, a count begins from 0 until it reaches 12 million - the number of orphans created by HIV/AIDS in Africa alone. The tour features songs mainly from her Confessions on a Dance Floor CD which is considered Madonna's comeback album from her previous lowest selling effort American Life. Confessions on a Dance Floor's sales are near 10 million worldwide. It also holds the record for topping the most charts in the world. The single \\"Hung Up\\" also holds the record for topping the most charts in the world. With Confessions on a Dance Floor Madonna refused to follow any U.S. chart trends. She decided to release a collection of dance/electronic songs, which did not receive significant airplay in the U.S. but received massive airplay on all other parts of the world, including Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, despite lack of U.S. radio support (boycott because she spoke out against the war and that idiot president bush) all of the singles had a great performance on iTunes and on MTV's TRL Video Music Countdown. Madonna kept her goals of doing what she wanted and establishing trends instead of following them. Even lack of support in her home country didn't stop the album from selling over 1,600,000 units in the U.S. alone. This is one amazing show and one of her best tours. Madonna is still The Most Successful Female Recording Artist in the history of the world and this DVD proves she is far from singing her last song.<br /><br />Below is the Set List<br /><br />Equestrian Act<br /><br />1. \\"Future Lovers/I Feel Love\\"<br /><br />2. \\"Get Together\\"<br /><br />3. \\"Like A Virgin\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Jump\\"<br /><br />Urban Bedouin Act<br /><br />5. \\"Interlude: Dancers' Confessions\\"<br /><br />6. \\"Live to Tell\\"<br /><br />7. \\"Forbidden Love\\"<br /><br />8. \\"Isaac\\"<br /><br />9. \\"Sorry\\"<br /><br />10. \\"Like It Or Not\\"<br /><br />Glam Punk Act<br /><br />11. \\"Interlude: Sorry (Remix)\\"<br /><br />12. \\"I Love New York\\"<br /><br/>13. \\"Ray of Light\\"<br /><br />14. \\"Let It Will Be\\"<br /><br />15. \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" (performed only in Moscow)<br /><br />16. \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\"<br /><br />17. \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\"<br /><br />Disco Fever Act<br /><br />18. \\"Interlude: Roller Dance: Disco Inferno\\"<br /><br />19. \\"Music\\" (With Where's The Party mid-section)<br /><br />20. \\"Erotica\\"<br /><br />21. \\"La Isla Bonita\\"<br /><br />22. \\"Lucky Star\\"<br /><br />23. \\"Hung Up\\"<br /><br />Madonna will also be releasing a live cd to go along with this Confessions Tour DVD.

0893860220|5.0|This is the one you want on a desert island. Nothing else is needed - seeking ends here. I have been fortunate enough to sit with Ramesh Balsekar, Nisargatta Maharaj's enlightened follower in Mumbai. He is getting up there in years, so if you would like an up-close and personal encounter with Truth, call your travel agent now. Ramesh talks every morning in his home to<br /><br />anyone who shows up. Check online for details. My sage wife says \\"I Am This\\" would be a more appropriate title for this jewel - but really, honey, what's in a name?
B000002UAO|3.0|Of course it's great, it's the Beatles after all. However, why is \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" missing, (from side 1, song 1)? Definitely one of the best tunes on the album. Why fool around with the original classic? Very disappointing.
1400044162|5.0|\\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is everything one could want in a novel. First and foremost it is a riveting story with interesting and well-drawn characters, but it was also a fascinating history lesson about the short-lived country of Biafra (1967-1970) and the utter starvation that occurred there. I was just a clueless pre-teen, but I remember my mother telling me to eat my dinner because there were children starving in Biafra (they gave to the Red Cross, and it was interesting to learn what happened to those contributions). This wonderful novel prompted me to do more research on my own (another mark of a great book). I recommend it wholeheartedly; I appreciate books that are interesting and also make me more aware of the world I live in.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|In fact Colin Firth's \\"Darcy\\" is an 8 (Pride and Prejudice); Richard Armitage's \\"John Thornton\\" is a 9 (North and South) to Toby Stephens' 10 as \\"Edward Rochester.\\"  Each of these actors are beautiful men, but I am writing of the performances here.  Previous reviews of Jane Eyre and undoubtedly others yet to be written have focused on the appearance of the actors and how they relate to the descriptions in the book.  Whatever your preconceived notions are of Rochester's appearance, let me encourage you to set that aside.  After all no two people will see the character in the book exactly the same in their imaginations.  This DVD is worth purchasing and watching for his performance alone.  Though there are many, many other highlights as well.  <br /> <br />The one thing I think could have been improved upon in this series was the Helen Burns' character.  Charlotte Bronte modeled this character after her older sister who had wisdom beyond her years and died an early death.  In the book Helen, her life and her death, undoubtedly helps shape Jane into the person she would become.  I have never seen an adaptation of Jane Eyre that has done justice to this character.  I wish more time and development could have been given to her.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I experienced Madonna in concert on June 5th, 2006, and it was amazing. I was hoping that the CD would include \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Like it Or Not,\\" but having the \\"Like a Virgin\\" version from this tour settled all my issues. This show took my breath away.
B0000029DD|4.0|Try listening to one of the contestants on American Idyll/Rockstar SuperNova or whatever the show of the month is try to sing a Buckley song like Eternal Life.  Without the contrast, it is hard to appreciate just what kind of talent this guy had.  He made it seem effortless: the voice and the guitar.  Personally, I find Grace to be an eclectic, uneven CD with flashes of brilliance and mediocrity.  I think Buckley deliberately tried to develop a mixture of musical sounds that ranged from the avant-guard to pop-rock to classical.  Without a doubt, he made \\"Hallelujah\\" his own.  I love the slower songs on the CD that give his voice a chance to soar.  I'm less sold on the hard rock songs.    If you don't already have it, this CD is worth a buy and a listen.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|With all of Marvel's superhero, the Ironman has always been very special because it's different, i.e., instead of super power, its power lies in technologies. That's why I was eager to give this a go.    After watching it, I felt it was a let down.     This movie has the feel of everyday, run of the mill, cartoon network type program, I mean why couldn't they use better animators, and have better designers for characters. The whole movie feels like it can't wait to finish, too much of a big rush to end it all.    For one the Jade's Dragon army looks like ancient Japanese then Chinese, one reason is the masks they are wearing.    And the Elementals as well, for example, the Earth Elemental is from Japanese mythology and not Chinese.  Watching the interviews of the people that worked on this movie, I wonder how much passion they \\"really\\" put in making this movie.    All in all, very disappointing, nowadays, its all about using cheap tricks to make money, there is no passion in it at all. What a shame!
1582701709|5.0|I received this book as a gift--and there's been something empowering for me about just having the book on my desk, or holding it in my hand and turning to a page to re-read. Every page is filled with wonderful reminders of the core principles of The Law of Attraction--basically, how we attract nearly everything we experience through the thoughts, feelings and images we hold in our minds. While this law has been observed throughout the ages, in everything from quantum physics to the practical philosophy of positive thinking, I really like having it all in one place--quotes by scientists, philosophers, psychologists, writers, artists, what have you. One of my favorite quotes is by the physicist, Fred Alan Wolf: \\"Quantum physics says that you can't have a Universe without mind entering into it, and that mind is actually shaping the very thing that is being perceived.\\" Another, by Prentice Mulford, who lived in the 1800s, is: \\"Every thought of yours is a real thing--a force.\\" Those two quotes put it all together for me. I love holding this book in my hand. It's a small hardcover book, beautifully designed. The person who gave me the book also gave me the CD of the author reading it, which is great to listen to in the car. A very enjoyable and edifying reference with enough practical suggestions to bring the principles into our lives. Nice gift, too!
B00004YRQA|1.0|I am having a hard time writting a review on this product because I have not received it yet.  I ordered it on Dec 26, 2006 and it is now Jan 30, 2007.  When I contact the vendor they tell me to wait another couple of weeks?
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|'the illusionist' was one of the few pleasant cinematic surprises of 2006. Somehow this elegant period piece was much more enchanting than the thrillers and horror flicks that came streaming in from all directions. Edward Norton's fine performance and a fine supporting cast are greatly enhanced by the period sets and costumes all lit and styled with great taste.. We live in a world of illusion and this movie does a fine job of tickling and teasing us with this notion.. One can only hope that this will help to open the doors for similar projects in 2007..
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Although the film is recut it still has a running time of 126 minutes.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|He is now doing for the irish mob what he did with the italian mob in good fellas... When Scorsese is in his element you have cinema at its finest.. Excellent cast - who knew Mark Whalberg could act? The choice of music, locations, and photographic technique are top notch.. Leonardo Decaprio continues to amaze me - he isn't just that annoying kid from titanic anymore - this guy has become one of the best leading men of our time.. The plot twists are just classic Scorsese  - he combines elements of the modern action/thrillers with the classic noir films that obviously have had an influence on his career. What a treat it is when you can go to a theatre and actually be totally enchanted by something - it must be art...
0060594888|5.0|I am a bit bias regarding anything Jack Canfield writes because he is so good.  This time he has outdone himself.  This is not a book to be read, it is a book to be hi-lited, dog eared, inscripted with notes and then more importantly, a book where the exercised contained there are should be done, not just read.  It is clearly a book to help you to first identify where it is you want to go and then Canfield lays out a plan for you to follow to get you there.  I thought the book was so good that I bought a copy for each of my four children and asked them to study it as I am.  It may be the best book I have ever read.
B00007LTIG|5.0|1967, San Fran... from what I hear, this album never scored very much attention when it came out, nor really ever, from what it seems. For many, this disc is much different than what they are used to from The Dead, but this establishes the bands first excursion to the studio, which is a place that, yes, they were never very comfortable with... (in fact they have admitted that they were ALL hyped up on various psychedelic drugs during these sessions, and had sort of a rough time recording it..)<br /><br />However, it is sort of a guilty pleasure album for me. I love The Dead, but am way more of a fan of the stuff after they seperated from the psychedelic sixties thing... this ain't my favorite, but sometimes I can really dig the vibe...<br /><br />There are the singles GOLDEN ROAD, and the more enjoyable MINGLEWOOD (one of my signature picks from way back).. there are equally as catchy tunes like BEAT IT ON DOWN THE LINE and theres the gutter blues via Pigpen GOOD MORNING LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL (though not as developed as some more classic live versions).. plus lots of early Jerry Garcia trips like CREAMPUFF WAR and MORNING DEW.<br /><br />A certain mood has to strike me to really get down and listen to The Grateful Dead. Theres a different mood that strikes for this album in particular... a sixties garage album all the way, and excellent in that vain (which is what I've been all about lately)....Rhinos DEAD remasters rule all over the place... they all have a sound far superior to the original releases and mucho extras.. so, pop a flower in your hair and get ready to dance in that weird, tripped out flower child kind of groove, baby. Deads first.
0743298020|5.0|the begining started too slowly. I prefer to be gripped and pulled down the rabbit hole. But I kept at it for some reason, as I am known to stop reading midway if it bores me. I ended up loving this book.<br /><br />Though the ending was pretty out there, never saw it coming, and I felt at loose ends with the mother in the asylum, I wanted to hear more from her instead of killing her off when I so enjoyed her character... anyhow, over all well worth the read.
B0000024LN|5.0|Classic album from the originator of bring the ruckus hip-hop!!
B00065MDSG|5.0|After four amazing albums. In The Court-Islands. King Crimson or Robert Fripp said so long to Peter Sinfield, and invited some new members to join the lovely King Crimson.  John Wetton-Bass vocals  David Cross-Violin viola keys mellotron  Jamie Muir-Percussions various instruments  Bill Bruford-Drums  and they caught lightning in a bottle just like they did in 1969. And created Larks Tongues in Aspic an amazing album that would define there mid 70s sound and be the seed to future Prog Metal. Every song is great amazing improvs some brutal jams and some beautiful ballads.    SONG BY SONG  \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\\"- This is amazing the first 3 mins are sorda pointless but once Cross comes in your in for a roller coaster ride from prog metal hell. Fripp is very brutal on this track and Bruford and Muir are out of this planet, after the amazing drumming you hear some more great work from Cross, then the ending which is very haunting and if you arent prepared you may jump. 10/10    \\"Book of Saturday\\"- Nice ballad short it's hard to believe this is after L.T.I.A. part one. Still it's a nice song. And Wetton and Cross rule this song. 9/10    \\"Exiles\\"- One of my favorates, this song is amazing some weird little noises at the beginning. Then gets good and Wetton sings his soul out very good and haunting. The violen work is top shape but it's David Cross his violen is always top shape. The song is better live but this version is still outstanding. 10/10    \\"Easy Money\\"- Progressive, fast and rocking what more could you want this song is great whisper vocals but that changes. The Percussion can give you a good laugh but it's very good and adds a very unique touch to the song. The last couple minutes of the song are the best, then you hear some nice laughing kinda like Indoor Games on Lizard but well more sinister business man like. 10/10    \\"The Talking Drum\\"-After you hear nice laughing you get to The TAlking Drum which is also very amazing. Starts out quiet and get's louder and louder and louder. The violen gives me chills. The drumming, bass and guitar are just as good. Then at the end well make sure to turn it up really loud.=) 10/10    \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\\"-after the talking drum it gets to this heavy prog metal closer to a amazing album. This is a song by Fripp and it is amazing one of the heavier if not heaviest songs I've heard from that time in music. Has some great well everything this is the perfect King Crimson song. And is a amazing closer that leaves and impact. 10/10    OVERALL 10/10  Buy this if your a fan or are looking for a amazing place to start in the great world of King Crimson.
B0000019PA|5.0|My first listen to this cd, I put it in the player listening casualy doing a puzzle book.  Somehow I find myself paying no attention to the puzzles but deeply engaged in the lyrics of Oh Comely, wondering how I got there, wondering how a song could completely engulf my thoughts and mind.  What a great song, what a great CD.          <br /> <br />       Is it as good as all the reviewers make it out to be??  Yes. If you like deep, dark, intropective lyrics then you will love this cd.  If you are into top forty catchy easy listening music then go check out Blink 182 or Jessica Simpson.    <br /> <br />       With all the great music that is out there, so many are caught up in the few same sounds that have been around for 20 years.  I just don't get it. Thus, I feel sorry for people who will never even hear of this band or the many other great under ground bands that are out there.  >>>---Zen---> <br />
B000002JPA|3.0|This is the first Dream Theater CD I've bought, which I did with anticipation since there are so many raving reviews in the prog community web sites, and Mike Portnoy's side projects - especially Transatlantic. It's supposed to be, along with Scenes From a Memory, their \\"masterpiece\\". It also might be the last Dream Theater CD I ever buy. Not only the recording quality is mediocre, with very compressed, flat sound, but the music doesn't really do anything for me. Sure, these guys can play very well, very fast, and very hard, but as  much as there is amazing musicianship, the songwriting is not very good. Once you get pass their technical abilities it gets boring fast. Also, LaBrie's singing is annoying to me, Portnoy is really busy using every fill he knows on every song... I could go on and on about why I don't think this is worth my money... If you are thinking about getting into DT, try listening full samples first, it might not be your ticket as I found out it is not mine. I'm happy I tried it, got it over with, and moved on.
B000LC3ID8|2.0|I have appreciate the first one, it was in a way very original. <br />The second chapter has succeed in creating a surprise, but the last chapter is the weakest of the three.  I just hope that this one the last one, don't make a serie like Friday the 13th....please !
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Werewolves and vampires, two staples of the horror genre, are mixed together in this action - drama set in some European country where it is always night and raining.  The protagonist is Selene, a gorgeous and very athletic female vampire who is a Death Dealer; someone who kills Lycans.  Lycans are werewolves, and the two races are immortal enemies.  The story centers around her relationship with a man who happens to be an original descendant of the man who gave rise to both vampires and werewolves.  Along the way, he, and then she, discover the truth about this immortal war, and who has really done what to each other.   <br /> <br />The movie is quite dark in setting, and most of the characters are palish white in contrast.  The action scenes are a mix of hand-to-hand combat and shooting galleries in the style of the Matrix.  The violence is bloody and sometimes gruesome.  There is no nudity, or swearing even; just violence.  This DVD came with some extra features, but not much.  This is no matter though as the movie is quite entertaining and moves along at a quick pace.   All in all, highly watchable.
6305922756|4.0|I first saw Spinal Tap when it came out years ago...then not again until a week ago. It was as funny as the first time. I have since seen about every Christopher Guest film or mockumentary and loved them.  <br />I think this film has a following and I think it would be fun to have a  <br />\\"where are the now?

B00005QXDD|5.0|There isn't much point to writing a long-winded, analytical review of Tenacious D's debut album. This would almost certainly involve a good deal of overthinking. What everyone should know is that even though the D are something of a joke band, their claim as \\"the greatest band on Earth\\" is not very far from the mark. Let's face it: aside from the 70's classic rock veterans who still release albums and show up in concert from time to time, music these days basically stinks. Tenacious D are a breath of fresh air and a legitimately great band. Their songwriting is top notch and very musically creative, while still remaining extremely funny. Jack Black has a great voice, and Kyle Gass is really a very skilled guitarist. Sure the lyrics are incredibly obscene, but so what? Tenacious D are the bawllz. Enough said.

Could his book be condensed into 50 pages?  YES!!!!   <br /> <br />While the content is worthwhile - it was nearly impossible for me to read this book.  Many of the chapters could have been condensed into a sentence or two and thus would have been more appealing to the general public. <br /> <br />Shame on the publisher who gave him a page count.  :)
0060254920|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a child, and even now. The artwork is spectacular and the story is simplistic for your beginning readers, but still fun as they get older.  <br /> <br />For a special keepsake for your children to hang onto this is definitely one of the greats!!!
B00007K02F|3.0|Jane Eyre has been redone so many times; all versions are interesting. But in this version, though so much is right, William Hurt is simply not the person for the part of Rochester. <br /> <br />If you love Jane Eyre, check out Toby Stephens and his lovely Jane in the brand new production done quite recently for Masterpiece Theater (ran Jan 2007). <br /> <br />
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I have spent the last three days at work listening to the new Norah Jones album.<br /><br />I am perplexed. I am unable to remember any of the tunes and I still haven't been able to detect any emotional content in this album. The voice of Ms Jones seems to be almost entirely without expression. The musicians around her play in a way that is so emotionally \\"cool\\" it is hard not to come to the conclusion that they were simply \\"going through the motions\\" when they recorded this album. As I said, the songs themselves aren't memorable and after three days of fairly solid listening, I still can't remember any of the songs, or, rather, none of the songs have made any significant impression on me.<br /><br />This singer has a Grammy and is regarded as one of the most popular singers in the Western world today. So what is wrong with me? I don't mind \\"Lounge Music\\" and singers who perform this style of music. I found myself strangely moved by the new Patricia Kaas album, \\"Piano Bar\\", several songs on this CD are beautiful, poignant and poised. Ms Kaas can bring tears to my eyes with her interpretations of sad songs. Patricia Kaas sings with beauty and simplicity on this album, yet she also sings with great feeling and conviction - she makes each song tell its story in the most beguiling way.<br /><br />I do like a wide range of other music, too.<br /><br />So why am I so unmoved and impervious to Norah Jones?<br /><br />Is it just me or is it that her new album is musically, emotionally and spiritually empty?<br /><br />I wonder!?
B000BZISPS|5.0|This is a very impressive cinematic rework of Batman's origins. The cast is first rate. The score is moody yet very dynamic. The plot is also very solid. This Batman film succeeds on every level.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|i usually dont bash bad movies (as I try to avoid viewing them) but I made the mistake of watching this and want everyone to know that it should be avoided. the director, Michael Mann, likes to pride himself on being a bit of a outlaw. He succeeded by getting away with highway robbery and making this abomination.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is a very impressive and well-structured cinematic rework of Batman's origins. The cast is first rate. Christian Bale's performance is impressive adding a dimension of emotion to the stoic side of the character. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score for BATMAN BEGINS is mesmerizing and quite moving. There is a lot of pent up emotion, energy and haunting beauty just waiting to explode. This is not your typical BATMAN score established by Danny Elfman but it maintains an undercurrent of continuous movement and vibrancy and is just overwhelmingly enthralling. It examines a meaningful nature of the character and his motivations augmenting Christian Bale's dedicated performance perfectly. The plot is also very solid. When I think of how the origin of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) was interwoven into the film, I was impressed. This Batman film succeeds on every level.
B000FVGMC4|2.0|While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|If you are a classic Science Fiction fan and don't already have Forbidden Planet, I highly recommend this one!  Not only do you get the Full movie with outtakes, you also get DVD's with Robbie the robbot in other roles!  Plus you get the nice collectors tin as well as the Small Toy Robbie!   enjoyed seeing the movie again and in the new format with all the extras.  I found this to be a good buy for the price considering all the extras! <br />Collect SciFi?  Then you should own this!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I've been a Maiden fan since 1983 when I first heard \\"Piece Of Mind\\" and I have followed the band since that time. I've followed them through the ups, the downs, Bruce Dickonson's absence to pursue a solo career, etc. In my opinion, the Band started to go down hill after Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. I'm not sure what it was but something seemed to be missing from the formula. There were a few songs on Brave New World, and Dance of Death, that reminded me of the \\"good old days\\" but the rest of the songs, on those albums, had me pushing the next song button on my CD player.  <br /> <br />Being a die-hard Maiden fan, I've been aware of every New Release until Dance of Death. Somehow this fell under my radar and I was unaware of it until Jan 2007. Now that I've discovered it, it is all I've been listening to for the past 3 weeks. It has to be one of the best Maiden releases in quite some time and there isn't a bad song in the mix. I highly suggest picking this one up! <br /> <br />Up the Irons!!!
B000001E18|4.0|All great bands expand the boundaries of their genre of music, and U2 do just that with Zooropa.  This record is well ahead of its time as U2 establish themselves as one of the few groups who can merge rock with electronica and make it sound compelling from both vantage points.  Though this record follows the experimentation with electronica on Achtung Baby, the deep bass and big guitars are replaced with more subtle touches, allowing the electronica and sound effects of The Edge to take more of a central stage.  The key to any great record is great songwriting plus a great sound, and that is evident on this record.  The songs themselves are about profound isolation and confusion in an era where the virtual world of the Internet, mobile communications and satellite technology are fundamentally redefining our lives.  The songs are not about impassioned anthems or uplifting messages of hope, but about confusion, dissonance, introspection, insecurity and trying to find oneself in an odd world.<br /><br />The Songs:<br /><br />Zooropa - the ambitious 6 minute opener, recalls David Bowie but with the solid backing of Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen's solid rhythm section. The Edge is able to roam free with distorted and flanged echo guitar riffs that coalesce around a more sophisticated chord progression that would sound great even if played on an acoustic guitar or piano. A track with depth that gets better with every listen.<br /><br />Babyface - U2's most pop-like song since Sweetest Thing, but in electronica format.  This song is pop psychadelia meets electronica, driven by a xylophone/bell like keyboard sequenced melody and has a Beatle/Bowiesque melody that is very hummable. Edge continues to provide great touches with sounds that don't seem like they should be made from a guitar, but are.  That is Edge's genius, and this song is a gem as a result.<br /><br />Numb - The most well-known song from the record, fits in nicely into the pattern of detachment, cynicism, andconfusion that defines the themes of the record.  Edge sings lead, and mutates a standard I-IV-V rock song into a compelling electronic mumble with a punctuation that says 'I'm supposed to feel something here, but I'm not sure.'<br /><br />Lemon - My favorite U2 song ever.  A great bass line by Adam Clayton and impassioned, thoughtful lyrics by Bono about the displacing effects of societal change provide the backing for one of Edge's greatest sonic achievements.  His combination of echo/flange/and fuzx guitar sounds that make up the main chord progression sound at once like an organ, a keyboard, a guitar and something distinct and new altogether.  Brian Eno also played some keyboards on this song.  A great achievement.<br /><br />Stay - A song that is more or less like a standard U2 rock ballad put through the cynical, detached meat grinder that is the sound of Zooropa.  This is a solid track that is very popular among fans, especially since it has been played live many times.<br /><br />Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car - One of my favorites.  U2 sing about the Laguna Beach scene before the show even existed.  The music is based on an industrial drum sample followed by electronic touches.  This is the most electronica song on the CD.  Bono's vocals are reminiscent of the songs on Achtung Baby.<br /><br />Some Days Are Better Than Others - A song driven by Adam Clayton's groove, Bono's melody, and some truly amazing sounds created by Edge in the chorus.  This song could've been played as a commercial friendly rock song, but it is far more compelling in this rock-electronica format.<br /><br />The First Time - The worst track on the record.  It simply a rewrite of All I Want Is You, but a less hopeful version.  Should not have been on the record.  I would have rather they waited to release Zooropa until Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me was ready (as that song was released during the same time period).  Now the addition of that song would've made this a 5 star record.<br /><br />Dirty Day - The version on the record is not compelling.  There are some very good parts of this song, but Bono's voice is too nasal sounding, and the true essence of the song was buried in the mix.  The remixed version of this track on the best of 1990-2000 collection, however, rocks.  Use that version when making your own mix of Zooropa.<br /><br />The Wanderer - U2 meet Johnny Cash and record an electronica song?? But somehow it works.  This is not a novelty track, but a very well written song in the great tradition of Cash.  If Cash had used musicians from the world of alternative rock, he could've had more hits in the 80's and 90's.
B000M4RG42|1.0|It is sad when you watch a movie like this and you cannot wait till the movie is over. It seems like movies now want to be negative and for sure not patriotic at all. These men were brave and hero's just like all fighting men are that are fighting for freedom and security of this country. But you walk away from this movie not feeling that way at all. And also if you noticed no reference to god and we know especially in 1942,soldier's were praying and reading the bible for sure on a average. Again it is a shame that so many movies now have great potential to be great but are lacking so much and fall short of being what those old movies had. Where is people like John Wayne, James Stewart, Clark Gable, etc.....
B00005JLWN|3.0|I enjoyed this watching this film. It is a futuristic/sci-fi action packed thriller in which everyone is mandated to take emotion suppressing drugs to prevent them from feeling any emotion whatsoever.  <br /> <br />It is thought by the new government that any type of emotion is evil and will bring on war and violence. So the new government would rather keep everyone like mindless drones and prevent anyone from reading books, owning and viewing art and listening to music. All of which are crimes punishable by death. <br /> <br />An elite force known as the \\"Cleric\\" enforce the rules that have been set forth by the current government. They also arrest those which are involved with the underground resistance movement trying to over throw the government. Christian Bale's character plays the head/lead of all clerics and is the best of the best. He loses both his partner and his wife to \\"sense crime\\"---crimes done by those who've stopped taking there medication to prevent emotions from surfacing.  <br /> <br />Eventually Bale's character stops his medication as well. He continues working as a cleric but guards his emotions in attempts to over throw the government from the inside.
B000KGGLCU|1.0|Please don't buy this until the Reinvention tour comes out on DVD. Why is this coming out first. what is wrong the the people at WBR. So we got a movie, with no real point, and no RIT dvd. What was the point of i'm going to tell you a secret? That religion is not even allowed to be discussed!!! But who cares about tradition. So we have to listen to her go on about how rich she is and watch some boys hold hands, to quote bette davis, \\"what a dump\\" Grow up madonna and think of your fans for once. furthermore the cd should have been the studio versions. or demos. it is sad that for anything rare we have to download it.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Oh My Gawd! This movie is fabulous.... I can't rave enough about how great this movie is! It is hilarious...... the storyline & acting are phenomenal, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. This movie is a suspense- mystery with plenty of wit and humor thrown in to keep you guessing as to what will happen next. A must see film.
0307276902|4.0|I am tired of people's outrage! As a crack addict in recovery for<br /><br />several years, James Frey did a splendid job of describing what my<br /><br />life was like and how I felt, physically, mentally, and spiritually,<br /><br />on a daily basis, in active addiction. As I read this book, I knew it had<br /><br />been \\"fluffed up\\" to some extent, however, I also knew some of the<br /><br />insanity he described could just as well have been mine.<br /><br />I liked this book for several reasons, but so far, Mr. Frey has been<br /><br />able to describe the pain and anguish this addict has lived the best.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Inscribed in what we might say a smart variation about the noir genre, Martin Scorsesse has constructed, depicted and achieved possibly his finest works in decades, with a breathtaking script in which you must not miss just a single line; when two young agents, both smart, clever and astute work in the police, one of them is a very poor boy who since his childhood was literally engaged by Costello; and in the other hand we have an outlaw boy who comes from a rich family and by that well known rebelliousness, typical of the first three decades of the human being, decides to be hired by the police to work as a covered agent without identity in order to make Costello goes to prison.<br /><br />Absorbing drama with profound psychological inflections, spiced with black humor, a formidable cast, a sleepless camera that simply does not blink for a second, with admirable mobility and mesmerizing angle shots, and a very clever script make of that movie not only the best entry of this veteran director, protagonist of so many battles and an erudite connoisseur of the cinema which may be compared at the level of let's say Peter Bodganovich.<br /><br />Another high peak to realize: the hidden homage to The Thrid man in the last sequence when she ignores Damon after having buried to Di Caprio in the cemetery, Then go to the last sequence of the Thrid man when Alida Vali makes the same with Joseph Cotten.
B000002KCC|5.0|Anyone who follows up a No.1 album of country rock with a drunken rock  tribute (concept) to the 2 recent deaths of Danny Whitten and Bill Berry victim to drugs is a genius. Neil does the unexpected and he is a true artist and the stellar opposite of the \\"Top 40 Formula/American Idol\\" music business. Way to go Neil.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins makes a very clear and compelling case for atheism, using arguments from science, philosophy and logic to show why it is not rational to believe in God's existence, and examples from history to demonstrate the evils religion has caused humankind. If that were all, I'd give it a 5-star rating. Unfortunately the book also contains large doses of anecdotal material, much of it of a personal nature, which contributes nothing to his arguments. This is not a book on relativity for the layman, where anecdotes can lighten up an otherwise very obtruse subject, but a defense of atheism which can be understood by any educated person, so the anecdotes are superfluous. Of course, if they were taken out the book would be at least a third thinner.
B000002KCI|5.0|This is Neil's best album and the most underrated album in Rock! <br />Highlights are... <br />Danger Bird- epic guitar song, dark!    <br />Barstool Blues- great song that no one has heard      <br />Stupid Girl-About Joni Mitchell?   <br />Drive Back- Punk attitude song    <br />Cortez The Killer- The Best Neil song, period.      <br />Through My Sails- druggy CSNY outake from the disaster 1974 Hawaii sessions, great.    <br />
0618680004|5.0|This book should be read by all human beings, religious or not. It gives a clear picture that it's about as likely that there is a god as it is likely there is an Easter bunny, tall and furry and carrying a basket of giant candy eggs!
B0000033TE|5.0|The perfect progressive rock masterpiece just got better, with a better sound and an interview about the making of the album and meeting Swiss artist Giger. Karn Evil 9 is the best prog song of all time and is worth the price of admission here. All 30 minutes of Karn Evil 9 must be played  <br />LOUD!
B000KQGP2G|5.0|During the first spin of this disk, I sat in my living room, head-in-hands, trying as hard as I could to figure out exactly what I was hearing. I was angry. I was upset. I hated Scarsick. Spitfall was annoying, and Cribcaged was an absolute disaster.<br /><br />Before you condemn me as a traitor, hold on. By the end of Enter Rain...I must admit, I had \\"gotten it.\\" This doesn't _sound_ like TPE1, eventhough it is the sequel to that much beloved album (look on the CD inlay for those of you that say this isn't TPE2). This is a completely new Pain of Salvation. And frankly, _Scarsick_ is amazing.<br /><br />It's _not_ what you expect. You WILL be shocked when you hear it. You may even hate it, as I did, until you give it time to sink in. Disco Queen will make quite a few of the less rabid PoS fans run screaming for the door. Idiocracy will bring back fond memories of TPE1, and Enter Rain will absolutely floor the astute listener.<br /><br />Bottom line? This is an amazing album, and the next step for Pain of Salvation. This band embodies \\"progressive\\" in every sense of the word. _Scarsick_ is angry, it is cold, it is beautiful, but above all, it pushes the boundaries of what progressive music is, and it does it unlike anything I have heard since Images and Words.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended.
B0000033OZ|5.0|Keith cranks up the Marshall's and spits out his Hammond C3 on The Barbarian and Knife Edge for some heavy organ rock. Also recommended is the Clavinet driven Tank and the Church Organ workout Three Fates. Lake's Take A Pebble is a masterpice. Lucky man is a first for the big Moog to take the spotlight in rock.
B0000029DD|4.0|one or two great songs that I can identify with, others not sure on yet.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album was and is McCartney's inspiration for the rest of his musical life and that is saying something. Brian pulls out all the stops to make the Teenage angst Masterpiece and the song I just wasn't made for these times is the anthem for those of us that can't seem to fit in with the cliques. Highly Recommended for music fans, especially musicians. Casual BB fans should not start here, get the greatest hits.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|The sound is retro, definitely in the vein of 70's hard rock groups(I won't name them, I think they have been named enough).  The music is catchy and guitar riffs are aplenty.  Though one thing is concerning me, many reviewers make it sound like there is finally one band going back to basics but that isn't true!  Of course everyone has heard of \\"Jet\\" but if you like Wolfmother and want more Old school garage band sounds, check out \\"The Datsuns\\", \\"Kings of Leon\\", \\"Silvertide\\", \\"The Black Keys\\"(Really bluesy),and \\"Buckcherry\\".  Now back to Wolfmother, my favorite song is definitely White Unicorn, but all the songs are good.  If you are looking for solid rock and roll with guitar solos and heavy guitar riffs and drum beats then get this album!!!
B000002U9Y|4.0|Syd leaves us 2 songs Jugband Blues and he plays slide on Remember a Day (recorded for the first album) he will be missed although the band w/ Gilmour do a good job carrying on.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Norah Jones isn't a belter, never will be. But what she brings to her music is a quiet assurance of \\"been there - done that\\" kinda living and vocal styling. It can get lost, as with her uneven second countrified CD and it can be boring and un-adventureous like with this CD. But when she does the CD is just amazing to listen to. \\"Wish I Could\\" tells the story of a fallen solider that Jones may have had an affair with, the quiet simmer of her vocals underlies the painful lyrics. \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" seems to talk about the aftermath of Katrina and along with the depth of \\"Broken\\" with its cello and bass, Jones seems to be reaching for something bigger.  <br /> <br />This new disc, doesn't offer that lounge type feel of her first disc, its leaps and bounds below that in terms of quality. But what makes the difference here is that Jones is going after songwriting. The hardest thing for an artist to master. She's no Lucinda Williams or Patry Griffin, though. And the music suffers for it. She seems to have something to say, but is afraid of alienating her fanbase. And that in itself is boring. <br /> <br />
B0000033P2|5.0|The breakthrough and contains ELP's best song The Endless Enigma. Overall this is a very good record, but the Bolero thing is kind of anticlimatic after the bombastic \\"Living Sin\\"
0792163710|5.0|I could not get over how modern this movie seems.  If it weren't for the flat widescreen and the Alan Ladd's pompdour, the movie seems like one that could be released today.  A loner comes to town and tries to leave his past life behind in his gun belt only to be dragged into the fight to help the very people he wants to join.  Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider is very close to this one. Whether or not he dies at the end is unimportant to me.  What is over is the only way of life Shane knows.  Ryker tells him this in the movie.   <br />To a generation that knows jack Palance's work from City Slickers, this shows how frightening he could be.  What a great snear he had.
B0000033PB|4.0|Half Moon, half a good ELP album better than no ELP <br />5 classics are here! <br />Paper Blood   <br />Romeo And Juliet   <br />Farewell To Arms   <br />Changing States   <br />Close To Home     <br />
B000KJU1MS|5.0|Most KISS-o-holics, like me, probably know most of the content featured on this DVD set. But here is the reason why you should consider to buy this: <br />1. The quality (Video & Audio) is far better than on any of the bootlegs of these concerts that have been circulating for quite some years. <br />2. It is way cheaper! Look at it this way: You get 4 complete concerts and 4 rare TV appearences (of the early years). You can not get the same amount of material for that price if you buy bootlegs. <br />One must consider though, that the recording technology that has been used at that time can not be measured by today's standards.But that's okay, because for us KISS fans it's about collecting a document of the early years and to see the development of the KISS show, isn't it?
B000002KDG|5.0|The acoustic side contains his best folk song Thrasher, which is about CSN. The electric side has one of his best underrated rockers Welfare Mothers.
B0002G2B2W|1.0|I thought this was the worst Jim Carey movie I've ever seen. In fact one of the worst movies I've seen. I really like Jim Carey movies, and usually enjoy his serious roles, but not this one. Looking at other reviews, I was very surprised. I thought it was very boring and senseless. I could barely sit through the entire movie. The only good thing was I only paid $2 to see this movie. Anything else would have been a complete waste of money.
B000002KOG|4.0|This is a good album, The Loner, I've been Waiting for You and What did you do to my life still have Neil's buzzy fuzzy Gretch guitar that make those three songs sound like the Buffalo Springfield. The last trip to tulsa is bizzare with a Dylan like story and a surprise ending.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This was my first live experience with a Madonna Tour and I have to say it was better than my greatest expectations. I'm so happy that the DVD+CD has been released! I get to experience all of the wonderful memories of her concert again! <br /> <br />I'm also ecstatic to know that the Erotica version that she did on the tour is on the CD. I forgive her for not having Get Together on there...I was blown away by the Erotica re-mix she did for the tour. <br /> <br />If you have been waiting for a Madonna Tour on DVD, this would be it!
B000002KD9|4.0|This is a good transitional album by Neil. He smartly used some of Crazy Horse and CSN to complete it before going on tour with CSNY.
0618680004|2.0|In his latest book -- \\"The God Delusion\\" -- Richard Dawkins serves up a fast-paced course in \\"how to refute God at your next cocktail party.\\" Enormous intellectual issues are boiled down into a few pages of clever repartee -- just enough to check this or that faith question off your list.<br /><br />Creationism? Check. Miracles? Check. Scripture? Check. Pascal's wager? Check. Human suffering? Check. By the end of the book, you could be completely convinced that A) God doesn't exist. B) Religion is inherently foolish and often destructive. C) Anyone who believes otherwise must be some sort of idiot. No matter that thousands of scholars have spent their entire lifetimes debating this issue. All you need is this little book to find your way back to the promised land of \\"pure reason.\\"<br /><br />The logical fallacy Dawkins uses is called a \\"Straw Dog\\" (sometimes called a Straw Man). This involves creating a position that is easy to refute, then attributing that position to the opponent. For example, Christians \\"must\\" believe in creationism, and creationism is scientifically false, therefore Christians are fools.<br /><br />The other technique he uses is to imply that the most fanatical members of a particular religion are the true representatives of the entire faith. It's like claiming that St. Francis is no different from some abortion clinic bomber or that every Muslim is somehow a murdering terrorist at heart. Uh huh. Sure.<br /><br />When you take the time to actually research some of these issues, you'll find that many practicing Christians do indeed believe in evolution, have nothing against Charles Darwin and feel perfectly OK living with vast amounts of uncertainty. But these facts aren't convenient for Dawkins' shallow argument.<br /><br />What disturbs me most about some atheists isn't their belief system (rooted in scientific empiricism). Rather, it's their evangelical zeal to convince others that religion is a fraud and a waste of time. In many ways, they are the exact mirror image of a Bible-thumping hell-and-damnation preacher. Ironic, isn't it?<br /><br />In the introduction to this book, Dawkins explicitly says that he hopes any believer who reads through to the end will end up agreeing with him that \\"God almost certainly doesn't exist.\\" I think he's just preaching to the choir...of anti-religionists.e the exact mirror image of a Bible-thumping hell-and-damnation preacher.

B000002KCV|4.0|Good album. Plays like Harvest Part 2, but more polished. Contains a few leftover Crazy Horse tracks that sound out of place here.
0446608955|4.0|What can i say about this book? it's incredibly beautiful. Not only is the story amazing, but Spark's style of writing is profound, poignant, timeless. I cried during this book. Sparks writes with such clarity that it's soo easy to see the scenery. I gave this book to my little sister and she loved it. It's for any age. I saw the movie after i read the book and was SOOO mad! The movie is beyond stupid. Please, get this book.
0618680004|5.0|When asked at a symposium for a broad range of Irish intellectuals what he thought about the sexual abuse of children by catholic priest, Dawkins replied: \\"[....] but arguably it does less harm than bringing the child up as a catholic in the first place\\". You have to realize that he was not exagerating. An American woman who had been sexually molested  by a priest when she was seven, wrote to Dawkins that the experience was just unpleasant, nothing to be compared with the trauma she received from being told that one of best friend would burn in hell because she was a protestant. <br /> <br />The above is just one of many chocking examples of how religion motivates the most horrible crimes. Read this book and realize how urgent it is to free society from religion. It's not as impossible as it might seem: most intellectuals, and many ordinary people, are atheists waiting for comming out of the closset. And the lies and hyppocracy of religion should be easy to unmask. Did you know that the myth that Einstein was religious is notoriously false? As well as the myth that Jesus was born in Betlehem? (Not that the latter matters, of course, it just unmasks the bible as a product of manipulation). <br /> <br />Helene H. Thygesen, Ph.D.
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep is Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief of Runway, obviously Vogue. She is imperious, demanding, arrogant and, as it turns out, extremely skilled in corporate ju-jitsu. Andi Sacks (Ann Hathaway) is a young thing in New York, trying for the first rung on the writing ladder. Andi, plain, Midwestern is immediately out of place among the fasion obsessed. Aha, but the Devil does wear Prada and soon Andi is on the road to being obsessed with glitter, glamor and fashion.<br /><br />  Streep simply steals the show. She is marvelous as Miranda always reaching out to  be the woman you absolutely, positively want to hate, but never quite crossing the line. For Streep's Miranda character, the job is destiny, the job is everything, leading women across the world to a more beautiful (if anorexic) tomorrow.<br /><br />  Andi is torn between the seductiveness of Prada and the simple things, like her boyfriend and other friends. Yes, they are simple souls, all young, all trying to climb the ladder of success in the Big Apple.<br /><br />  I was actually disappointed in the end, which I won't reveal.<br /><br />  But even with my disappointment, it's still a good movie. Stanley Tucci is absolutely marvelous as Miranda's long suffering art director (I think) and Emily Blount does well as Miranda's first assistant.<br /><br />  Fun film.<br /><br />Jerry
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|People tell me I missed the point in this one, that it's as much about reconciliation, closure, and understanding as it is about the fantastic tall tales told throughout his life by a now old and moribund man, played by Irish actor Albert Finney, but all I know is this is the only Tim Burton film I have ever disliked. I found Big Fish uninteresting, slow moving to the point of boring, and it didn't seem to have a point. It sounded good from what I heard told about it when it was in theaters, with its giant and enchanted town, its evil old crone who forecasts death, its \\"big fish\\" and its love story, but when I watched it on DVD I was put off, and I can't quite define why. Big Fish has a good cast and some nice sets and once or twice it almost seemed to find its pace, but it never grabbed me, and that's unique among everything Burton has done. I can't say I'd tell anyone not to see it, but I also haven't been enthusiastic in recommending it, either.
B00004U8H4|5.0|With a chiseled chin and an iron physique, Patrick Bateman's looks make him the ideal yuppie -- and the ideal serial killer. That's the joke behind American Psycho, which follows a killer at large during the 1980s junk-bond boom. Bateman (Christian Bale) takes pathological pride in everything from his business card to his Huey Lewis CD collection, all the while plotting his next victim's vivisection.Parts of this film should not be controversial: sleek photography, a good score, great acting by the supporting cast, and deft directing. Two areas that ARE controversial: Bale's acting and the story itself. Black satire, including American Psycho, is a legitimate theme as are serial killers. Character studies can explore questions like Who am I? What is inside me? etc., as does this movie.  <br /> <br />Disturbing? Yes. Boring? With an ATM that instructs customers to \\"Insert cat now\\" and a severed head chilling in the fridge, there is nothing boring about the film. If you are bothered that the movie is violent and its star is one sick puppy, then you won't like Bales, but if it grips you despite its unpleasantness, you'll realize that Bales was superb.  <br />That the film is unrated may mislead you. The nudity and sex are not explicit, and its violence is less graphic than, say, that in many films. To me, the violence could have been more intense, as in the original Psycho.
B00005221M|5.0|Sometimes a film version of a novel falls greatly short of the original material (as in Demi Moore's execrable 1995 re-invention of The Scarlet Letter) and at other times a motion picture rises far beyond the story upon which it is based: happily, this version of The Last of the Mohicans is probably the foremost example of the latter possibility. This is simply among my favorite movies of all time, and how anyone can fail to be swept up by this one mystifies me. Telling a superior version of James Fenimore Cooper's hopelessly plodding 1826 classic, with the verdant Appalachians of North Carolina standing in for the 1750's New York of the book, there is everything one could want here, from violent war, to tender love scenes, a stirring score, to panoramic captures of natural beauty so perfect it's little short of a sin to show this movie in anything but widescreen format. Daniel Day Lewis, always captivating in his performances, delivers as the central character, the heroic white man raised as a Mohican, Hawkeye (here re-named Nathaniel Breen) who first leads a band of newly-arrived Scots through danger to a British outpost in the wilds, and then later after surviving a brutal massacre, tracks the woman he loves across the frontier and to a hostile Huron village, where he undertakes a courageous rescue. That's of course a razor-thin description of the multi-faceted plot, but trust me, there's more going on here than I could easily describe in a review three times this size. This director's cut took me a moment to appreciate, since I'd seen the theatrical release so often on VHS, but having watched both versions now, I think there is a scope to this release on DVD that enhances the film for even a mega-fan like me.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Martin Scorsese's Oscar-nominated epic focuses on the rise of Irish and Italian gangs in New York in the mid-1800s. When the leader of the Dead Rabbits is assassinated, his son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) seeks out the perpetrator, Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Poole (a magnificent Daniel Day-Lewis). Yes, it was violent, but a well done movie. Watching the history of that time (on the menu) helped me understand what was going on. Very intense, interesting, I had no clue what would happen next. The acting was superbGangs of New York is a brutal and equally memorable epic that perfectly captures 19th Centurey New York. Sprawing, ambitious, and bold, Martin Scorsese \\"Gangs\\" is a vilm of vision and grace.  <br /> <br /> <br />It's a unique film with its deciption of the era, and its striking visual imagery is astonishing. As many people are dismissive of this masterpiece, the unusual period is at least arresting as the story itself. It may be flawed with the love-interest between Diaz, and DiCaprio, but Daniel Day Lewis characterization of Bill the Butcher is riveting. This is a great movie that shows where modern America has come from. I never understood Why Scorsese still didnt win the Academy Award for best director yet I love his work Casino,GoodFellasm,Taxi Driver,Mean Streets,and Raging Bull and Gangs Of New York is right up there with all of them. This movie has such a uniqe look into Gang life in the 19 century this film he clearly should of won best director for this was an Epic among all dramas this movie is realy great and if you like Scorsese's work you should like this and its a film that will grow with importance in time to come.

B000784WMW|5.0|Of the nine plus adaptations of Bronte's novel, this version holds closest to the book in both plot and dialogue. Fortunately, this 'Jane Eyre' was digitized and made available on DVD last year, a huge improvement for those of us who had to tolerate the old VHS version.    Timothy Dalton is a surprise.  His portrayal of Rochester catches the character's pain and sense of humor, anger and care, frustration and playfulness.  Zelah Clark's interpretation of Jane is weaker, perhaps because she is the one character required to mature more than any other.  (While Dalton is my choice for 'best Rochester', Samantha Morton (A&E) remains my favorite 'Jane').      With a good supporting cast (including the Newfoundland playing 'Pilot') with particular kudos for the three Rivers characters, this is an adaptation I get more out of each time I see it.  Well worth owning.
B00009Z576|5.0|I just got this on CD and I Love It! I remember the days of having the 8 Track, where they spliced the songs in wierd places. I have always been fond of \\"Drama\\". But now that I am listening to the CD there is one element of the songs that I haven't heard many ackowledgements for- the tunes are really catchy! After I listen to it certain songs really linger in my mind- \\"Into The Lens\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" for example. This album came out at a time when Prog Rock was selling out (Gentle Giant \\"Civilian\\" <br />Genesis \\"Duke, Starcastle \\"Real to Reel\\" are some that come to mind.)That's what I appreciate about this album, even though the Buggles joined, they still manage to keep the \\"Yes Sound\\" and blend it into the vibe of the day (New Wave). I recommend this highly to anyone interested ingiving this one a chance. You won't be dissappointed. Make sure you get through \\"Machine Messiah\\" - it's probably the least \\"hummable\\" tune. But with each listen you'll find all the songs really grow on you..
0743487583|1.0|This \\"enriched classics\\"  is a bowdlerized version of Mary Shelley's original text.  It eliminates passages, changes the diction, abridges the chapters, and changes the entire structure of the novel.  Our school bought this edition thinking that the additional notes would be helpful to students studying the text, but there was no indication at all on Amazon's website that this version had been substantially altered by the editors.  The book is so bowdlerized that our school bought an entire new set of texts for the students at a considerable finanacial loss for the school.  WHATEVER YOU DO, BUY SOME OTHER VERSION OF FRANKENSTEIN.  THIS ONE IS A MONSTER CREATED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS NO RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR.  BANTAM, PUFFIN, OXFORD -- THEY ARE ALL FINE.

B000FS9FC6|5.0|Yes, If your a huge fan of the Matrix Trilogy, then you will love this movie! Marvelous, Political, poetic, romantic, has a \\"phantom of the opera\\" twist in my opinion with a Matrix twist. For those into complete full action and hate jibber jabber talking, then this is not the game for you. This movie has importance to what V says throughout the entire movie with a deep poetic summary of how he feels is wrong and must persist with relinquishing the Government/Parliament by using Orchestrated Drama, fire crackers and Demolition. Natalie Portman has never been sexier, and her acting is awesome in this movie, so buy it and keep right next to your Matris collection because its definately a keeper!
B000IAZPKM|4.0|Disc one contains the actual concert and this is the disc I will return to, and soon, to enjoy an excellent show.  There are multiple camera angles that showcase the entire band, chorus included, and the sound quality is exemplary for a concert DVD.  However, there are two moments during the set that I think are unnecessary: a keyboard solo, and a drum solo.  Okay, so their new keyboardist gets to show off a bit, but who really cares?  As far as the drum solo goes, maybe I was ruined by attending four RUSH concerts in my youth; no drum solo will ever compare to Neil Peart behind the drum kit.  Besides that, Kamelot frequently reminded me of Queensryche with their overall theatricality and tight band interplay on stage. <br /> <br />Then comes Disc two which has some horrible sound during the interviews.  At one point during Simone Simons interview her voice is almost drowned out by a group of people speaking nearby.  The videos reminded me of why I hate watching videos anymore as the actual songs are sliced and edited to a compact size and played over some otherwise decent imagery.  Also, only two of the videos are formatted as mini-movie videos ready for MTV, another is a bloodier version of \\"March of Mephisto\\"(uncensored).  The remaining two videos are taken directly from the show on Disc one.  Okay?  What was the point in doing that?  There is a short \\"Making of 'The Haunting'\\" which was slightly interesting the first time through, but watching that again would induce intense boredom.  The rest of the information provided on Disc two can be garnered from their website.  Disc two is a wash.  Just put in Disc one and enjoy the show.  Thank you.
B000FVGMC4|5.0|I saw Paolo Nutini perform his song \\"New Shoes\\" <br />from his album \\"These Street\\" on the TODAY show on NBC on  <br />January 30th 2007.I taped the performance and I watched  <br />him at least 50 times since yesterday. <br /> Right away I googled him to find out more <br />about this wonderfull artist with a fantastic, smoky, sexy voice. <br />I ordered it on amazon and I can not wait to get the CD. <br />I hope he has a good manager and I hope to hear much more in the future.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I was lucky to see this concert in San Jose, and I must it was an awesome show!  I was dissapointed with the NBC version because of all the editing, but I am very pleased this DVD has been released because it was truly a memorable concert!  I am also pleased the CD sound quality is excellent and great for turning up the volume in the car...This is truly a great package and one that won't be regretted!!!
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I should this film for the first time several years ago during the week before Christmas. This film which is better than the remake geniunely creeped me out. It's consistently dreary and from the beginning of the film you seem to know that the 5 co-eds and everyone connected to them will generally come to an awful end. As one reviewer put it, there's a definite sense of dread in the film and it bleeds out from the screen. This is what horror truly is!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I totally agree with many of my fellow reviewers, the NBC special was terrible! How could anyone appreciate and enjoy this concert with all those commercials and that awful editing! I was lucky to see this concert, as I have seen most of Madonna's live shows, they are all unique.  Every concert has a theme and she manages to create a show built around her and the audience.  She is mesmerizing! Can't wait to hit the gym with my new \\"Confessions CD\\"! If you want to see how a concert should be done, grab this!  She is worth every penny!
0792844882|5.0|I know this movie gets a lot of crap but you know what? I love it and all its smutty terribleness.  I've seen it about a hundred times on tv with all the bad stuff cut out so I finally decided to go ahead and buy the damn thing so I could get the goods!  and boy was it worth it.  I laughed soooo hard.  If people were that spastic at sex everyone would be walking around with bruised groins.  Despite the bad acting and script, I can't help but love it.
B000006TRV|5.0|In the Flesh is the best song here, it always get to me, the hairs on the back of my neck just stand up when that intro comes in loud. But It's pointless to name the strengths here, it must be played in it's entirety and LOUD!
1878424319|1.0|Interesting, Ruiz claims to be a Toltec descendant and throws in at least three \\"Toltec\\" words to substantiate his claim.  The book is a very fast read, I completed it in about 90 minutes.  The four agreements (CAUTION - SPOILER) 1) Be impeccable with your word, 2) Don't take things personally, 3) Never assume, 4) Always Do your best, could have been taken from any kindergarten classroom poster.  His writing is strangely simple, honestly it reads like a six grade text.  Although one can hardly disagree with the four agreements, some of his imagery and related references border on the bizarre.  His statement that even \\"if someone shoots you in the head\\" one shouldn't take it personally.  I am troubled by the constant messages in many new age works which promote the abandonment of responsibility.  Read the book if you must, if only to reaccquaint yourself with some good, simple tenets.  But by all means, get it from the library!
B0000025ZK|5.0|The follow up to Final Cut is a breath of fresh air for Gilmour, who couldn't contribute much to Roger's last 2 masterpieces. David has a lot of pent up anger here and it helped the creation of a few tracks here \\"you know I'm right\\" which is David's version of Lennon's \\"how do you sleep\\"  <br />Speaking of Lennon, \\"Murder\\" is a tribute to that sad day 12/80. <br />About Face and the first solo record David Gilmour are David's own stellar creations and he proves he can pull it off.  <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah clearly develops her music organically, not to show off.  She shares her feelings honestly, openly and forthrightly.  In my estimation this is the best album of lyrical music to come out since Phoebe Snow's self-titled debut in 1974.  It sketches the outlines of a worldview, stands back and allows the listener to enter in as far or as little as one may need to. <br /> <br />That being said, I want to jump up and down and turn off the Daly show because it's not funny enough anymore when I hear \\"my dear country\\"!  It's so hilarious, that almost no buddy in a body will get the nightmarish-tinged ironic sense of some of the verses.  But that's just fine, in fact, it's perfect.  Perfect for the times.  \\"Who knows, maybe he's not deranged?\\"  George w. aside, we can feel this question posing itself in the minds of the volken in the early days before Hitler's ascendancy.  Can't we hear this question whispering in the hearts of the people of Iraq during the reign of their recently executed leader?  And in the considered estimation of the British adjutant to Idi Amin in Nigeria... <br /> <br />Tomorrow on February 1st, we are invited to e-mail our 2 senators, with the message:  escalation of this conflict/unsuccesful occupation in Iraq is madness.  Or whatever else you may feel on the issue.  If you want to retain a voice in how your dear country is acting in the wider world, please do e-mail two human individuals who happen to be the senators from your state (assuming you live in America).  But wait a minute here.  If you happen to live in some other country, why not e-mail the united nations in NYC at the same time?  February 1st, babies.  it's happenin <br />And if you don't happen to read this until February 2nd or February 3rd, so much the better.  Keep those cards & letters comin!  The senate vote is mere days away.  Have a little democracy-sized say in it.  That's what America is supposed to be about - always has been.  <br /> <br />\\"my dear country\\" is not merely a song on a Norah Jones album, it is a call to action for all those who care about the wider world in which they live. <br /> <br />Russel
B000002A3T|2.0|It's not bad, but it's not Pink Floyd and that bothers many. I'd much rather hear Gilmour's solo albums than this bombastic self parody. I believe they did this and the tour to pay for Nick Masons Jaguar collection and Dave's barge studio expenses. So The big deal here was Rick was now a full time member, whoopie! He should have been he only co-founded the original group
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I found Prarie Wind to be one of those albums that you play over and over again until the song order is etched in your memory so much that you start humming the next song just as the previous one is finishing.  Kind of a <br />teenage/college habit that has reappeared as I reach retirement and pre-senility.  The theme of the album is <br />also along those lines too.  It's a collection of Neil's songs about an age, a generation.  The line, \\"too much time took away his head\\" is an example along with the empty-nest message of \\"Here For You\\".  As a parent <br />whose kids have left home to begin their adventure it sure hits home.  Neil's tremendous range of abilities is <br />so evident in this country collection but the signature is still his.  If you really want to enjoy this take a look at his <br />DVD \\"Heart of Gold\\" and you'll see this CD visually.  Worth the cost anyway you look at it or listen to it.
B000002U9W|5.0|I fall under the category of a PF fan that absolutely thinks this record is one of their best. All of Atom Heart Mother is magnificent and it works as the trademark side long concept and other side of songs.  <br />Fat Old Sun appeared at Gilmours shows in the last few years so he couldn't of hated it that much.
B00004UFYU|5.0|I was introduced to ERA via a track on You Tube. I heard something from THE MASS. When I came to Amazon to buy it I found they had two other discs so I bought them as well. This music is haunting ... great for setting a scene ... compelling without being overbearing. I love it.
B000002UA2|5.0|The best Pink Floyd may be this pre-Dark Side soundtrack from 1972. Childhoods End, Freefour, Wots, uh the deal? may be the 3 best PF songs ever and not many people except the fans have ever heard them.
B00008NEQM|5.0|I originally heard a track from this disc on You Tube and came here to find it. The music is haunting and powerful, so much so I also ordered two other discs by ERA. I'm very pleased with this decision.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is the lost PF masterpiece written by Roger and touches more of his life story and how his fathers death in WW2 affected him. His performance is extraordinary. Gilmour plays some of his best solos here, especially on Gunnars dream and the title song.
B000007ODM|5.0|This was one of two additional discs by ERA I ordered. My decision was based on hearing a track of their THE MASS disc and finding two other discs by them as well. The music is somewhat similar to Gregorian chants but I found an underlying drive to it. Great for setting a mood for an intense scene.
B0000025DD|5.0|What a beautiful album. Most of these songs were written during the Animals era but Roger already had the Animals trilogy written unfortunately for David. He must have been relieved to get his songs out here and he creates an album that is better than Animals in my opinion
B000002HJR|5.0|Simply put, if you are a Pantera AND Corrosion Of Conformity fan, you might really want to pick this album up. I am a huge fan of both, and I was FAR from dissapointed.
B00000260F|3.0|This is unlistenable. Thank god this is Jeff's only time in his career he went for the dollars instead of the substeance. This sounds like a poor mans Chic and thats not good.
B00005JOCU|4.0|I saw the original on Broadway (with Jennifer Holiday) and was prepared to not like the movie because I thought no one else could believably play Effie. Boy was I wrong. While Jennifer Holiday still rules supreme because she shaped the role, Jennifer Hudson lite up the screen. I felt as though I was watching and hearing the beginning of a future legend. The only complaint I had is that she emulated Jennifer Holiday's original delivery a little too close. For instance, at the end of And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going, she did the breath gasp that was spontaneous in the original Broadway production. But I don't want to sell her short, she was absolutley amazing.  <br /> <br />The rest of the cast did a good job. I found Eddie Murphy to be very believable and he had a surprisingly good voice. I was less enthralled with Beyonce and Jamie Foxx. Beyonce's voice was good on Listen but came off a little thin compared to Hudson. The actress who played Lorell did a good job in the role. The rest of the supporting cast delivered. <br /> <br />I had heard that the movie dragged but this wasn't my impression. I thought it was just right.  <br /> <br />I saw the movie at a historic theatre in New York City and the crowd enjoyed the film so much that they stayed in their seats and applauded when Hudson and Murphy were shown during the credits.
B000002C1W|3.0|Not many signs of life here. A few tracks hold up...Dogs of War, On the Turning Away and One Slip are great songs, the rest is a mediocre David Gilmour solo album with 9 million studio musicians to pad out the sound, not the way I want to hear Pink Floyd.
B000063UR2|3.0|For lover's of fantasy and magic movies with fairies and elves and unicorns, this isn't half bad, even considering it stars an early in his career Tom Cruise, which seems an odd casting choice.  The movie is entertaining if you're in the right frame of mind or mood...the kind of movie that when it comes on at 1:00 am and there's nothing on TV you just CAN'T stop watching.  TIM CURRY has an AMAZING performance as the Devil character, he adds a hypnotically seductive and powerful element of Satan as sinfully decadent evil dude, but with the strangely attractive longing of a human.  His performance makes the film a cult classic.
B000024D4R|3.0|I'm a huge Floyd Fan, I even like The Final Cut!, BUT I never understood the hype over this album. OK Dogs is amazing and parts of Pigs, but by the time Sheep comes on I'm always ready to take the needle off and go to sleep.
B00003CXAA|5.0|They are fabulous!  The quality is first rate and they also came in a beautiful display case.
B000002U8G|5.0|This may be the bands peak as far as a working 4 man equal unit that is Pink Floyd. Echoes is the masterwork and Side 1 has some gems like Pillow of Winds, Fearless and the tongue-in-cheek San Tropez.

B000A6T262|4.0|I would have given this product 5 stars had it not been for the second movie of the set, The Wrath of Khan.  Half way through the movie is started to skip and freeze. I checked it for scratches and there were none. <br />It had to be a bad disk used in the duplication process. The rest of the disks are fine.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|I find this the best eminem album after The Eminem Show because not only it has new good artists but in here eminem showed us his old rap style and not that funny rap of his like in ENCORE like rain main, just loose it etc...Well Done EM!!!!I REALLY LIKE THE INTRO AND THE OUTRO!!!!
B000LC55F2|4.0|Have you not seen the Prestige? I believe you are missing out my friend!  Considering many called it \\"the Other Magic movie\\" after the Illusionist's release, a huge group missed this special event in cinema. The Prestige is a film with rich sets, high profile actors (Jackman, Bale, Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie), and other makings of a popcorn movie. However, the film uses suspense, a little suspension of disbelief, and a dramatic twist to make it a mature mystery about the repurcussions of obsessive competition. <br /> <br />  The Prestige centers around two turn-of-the-century magicians,Robert Angier(Jackman;an honest man who enjoys entertaining and being the best) and Alfred Borden (Bale;a man who lives with guilt and has an un-shown trick that will beat all others), who worked together until the accidental death of Angier's wife. Angier holds a grudge against Borden for her death, but decides to move ahead to become the most prestigious magician. Borden then reappears with a NEW trick, one that challenges peoples' common sense and eyes. This trick is the Transported Man, in which Borden 1.throws a ball 2. enters a closet on one side of the stage 3.Comes out of a closet on the other side and 4. Catches the ball, all in a matter of seconds. Angier imitates this trick, but doesn't feel it is real enough if he uses a \\"stunt double\\"of sorts to catch the ball at the other end. He then travels to find a new variation that may very well beat Borden's. The two men then enter into a deadly rivalry to become the most popular entertainer, stopping at nothing to discover the secrets behind each other's trick. <br /> <br />  This is an amazing film from all aspects. The cinematography(Feels similar to Nolan's other film Batman Begins) fits perfectly, there are mysterious sets, good acting, an interesting plot, and a building score. The prestige works well because of the consistent build up of rivalry and desperation. The men begin as naive partners, who break off to find their own place in the magician trade. They then become fierce BUSINESS rivals as they both market the same trick. Angier and Borden then slowly descend into a state of hatred for one another, where they would be willing to KILL for the chance to be the \\"talk of the town\\". The two rivals begin to want to not only one-up the other in tricks, but also in their personal lives. I highly recommend picking this up. Not a masterpiece, but a great popcorn film to watch on a rainy day.  <br /> <br />   <br />
B00005JKG5|4.0|The 80's produced some of the corniest movies of all time but I must admit, this one was not bad. I think this movie was more of a trendy film and a cultural statement than a masterpiece. It's about a young woman named Alex who is a steel worker by day and an exotic (non nude) dancer by night. She dreams of becoming a professional dancer one day but has no formal training. A very cool scene is when she goes to the snooty dance school to apply and is wearing dirty work boots among all the elegant dancers and she runs out of the building because she is so intimidated. Alex ends up dating a rich guy, which makes for some clever lines and funny scenes. I think Jennifer Beals is gorgeous in this movie and in great shape! Overall, this is a movie that was great in it's day not because of a huge budget or great acting (though the acting is pretty good) but because it made a huge statement and influenced fashions of the 80's. The message here is: You can do anything you put your mind to and should not be afraid to strive for the things you dream of! I also liked the fact that this was made in a time when strong female characters were just becoming popular. Don't watch this movie if you want something deep and meaningful. This is more of a nostalgic and 'fun' movie for when you want something not-so-serious. The movie has a refreshing innocence about it. I found it to be very inspirational and I thought it had a positive message for women. Honestly, it made me want to cut the collar out of my sweatshirt so it hangs over one shoulder, throw on a pair of spandex and leg-warmers and hit the gym and accomplish some of MY goals! I thought this was a cute movie (even though it's really outdated) and I would watch it again!
B000J103PC|3.0|It's a good movie, kinda wants you needing to know more? Maybe you should get the book, it's a lot better than the movie.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I am not really into family-focused movies but this one is great. A highly heterogeneous disfunctional family - everyone looking to fulfill their dreams. At the end they realize what's important - to have fun and don't try to please everybody around you. Great characters, great directing. A must see movie
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I loved Norah first album. Hated hated hated her second and now I hate the third. Norah please stop writing such boring material.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Sure, Rochester is a touch too handsome, but this production is the closest thing I have ever seen to the passion represented in the novel.  I mean, the day I see an actor portray Rochester as unhinged by circumstance as I believe him to be in the book is the day I'm a happy camper.  Still, this is pretty darn good, and Jane's fiesty spirit shines through.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is by far the best show Madonna has put on since The Blonde Ambition tour back 1990. I would recomend this cd+dvd to any Madonna fan out there. Buy it you wont regret it!!!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Okay, even if I wanted to hate this album, I could not. There is no doubt in my mind that the Leto Brothers and company have talent. I would be playing the hater if I said Jared could not sing or if I said Jared only made it because he is an actor. No, without a doubt this album has more potential than I thought. The more I listen to it, the more hyped I get. For one thing, obviously the lyrics are intelligent, emotional and thought provoking. Somehow I can't see this band trashing a hotel room, they seem to have much more going on upstairs than outside appearances may warrant. There are shades of the Cure and U2 on this album and that was cool with me. There are so many things to like about this album, Jared Leto being beautiful was the last thought on my mind. Okay, I was blown away when I read the thank you notes inside and what could I do but swoon even more when a man can say he would like to thank Jesus the Christ, Buddha, C.S. Lewis, Deepak Chopra, the Seraphim and the Nephilim to name a few...deep Jared very deep. Deep and gorgeous...a girl just can't ask for more. And to cover a Bjork song and not botch it up...BRAVO! <br />30 Seconds to Mars is a trip worth taking, these guys can rock!

B000KGGLCU|5.0|OMG! This show was amazing live. The DVD almost comes closes to the real thing. PLEASE make sure you have a Home Theater Surround System with DTS 5.1 Decoder. The soundtrack will rock your home. iTunes provides two unreleased tracks when you purchase from itunes. Again I still dont know what the controversy over \\"Live To Tell\\" was all about. Her message was well sent without any insults. The whole show is here. The last 30 minutes is just a powerhouse of music and entertainment. No one can put a show on like Madonna. Thanks and I hope my review helps. <br />

0446677450|4.0|This book teaches one thing really and it works but if you can't figure it out on your own well you probably aren't going very far to begin with.  In 200 some odd pages he says save your money and reinvest it.  This is great advice and will more than likely make you rich especially if you start young, but he really didn't go much into how to be rich.  All he talked about is how saving got him his porsche and rolex.   <br /> <br />I mean that's good and all but this is more of an inspirational piece of advice than anything else.  I'm about to start another book in the Rich Dad series and see how it is but I really hope its more instruction and detail than this one.  The lesson it teaches are great but it only teaches one word SAVE.

B000002KMV|5.0|More times than not it is the disc before the big hit disc that is responsible for an artist hitting it big.  Controversy is that disc. The first two Prince discs were unremarkable except for showing us the talent of what was to come. Dirty Mind was great and set the tone for future releases but very few took notice.  Controversy was the snowball that became the 1999 avalanche.  When Controversy came out a few more took notice, but in this case it just kept going.  This was a classic case of word of mouth not letting a disc out of sight.  This album would not go away and that by the time 1999 came out Prince had a huge following because of Controversy.  While 1999 is undeniably great Controversy may be his best.  If you picked up Prince with 1999 then do yourself a favor and pick up Controversy, the disc that REALLY started it all for Prince.

It covers a lot of territory...some of which was not applicable to my interests (I can pretty much guarantee I will never photograph a wedding, nor am I likely to shoot portraits of people, but the portrait tips might be applicable to pet portraits, some of which I am very likely to do). I was interested in learning about some of the equipment that pros use, most of which doesn't apply to me as long as I am playing with my Canon S2 IS, but I do want one of those portable hard drives for offloading my memory cards!<br /><br />The tips offered are \\"what to do\\" with little to no \\"why you do it\\" ... I'm a \\"why\\" person, however, so I suspect more books are in my future. Some of the tips seemed rather basic, and there seemed to be a small amount of repetition, but overall, I got quite enough out of the book to make it worth the purchase. Probably not a keeper, though...one read was sufficient, so I will likely pass it along to another newbie when the opportunity arises.<br /><br />The author's light-hearted, good-natured humor is sprinkled throughout. I found myself chuckling often, and occasionally rolling my eyes. How-to books can be a bit stiff and impersonal--I enjoy Scott's more personal style.
B000K7VHSM|5.0|<br />Amazing film about true human feelings. Not sick, depraved nor disgusting. The only disgusting thing here are the homophobes like the one above. Anyway, as I was saying, a true and honest film that will stay in your heart forever if given the chance. A film that has and will open many hearts and minds.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Very cute movie. I think \\"Finding Nemo\\" was WAY better, but Cars is cute in it's own way. I like the way Pixer chooses such different concepts for each movie. Very creative.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|This collection of lethargic crud is her worst yet...which isn't saying much. I'm listening to it as I scribble this \\"review\\" and I'm already nodding off this listless, limp, tasteless and unmusical album. <br /> <br />I can't believe pop tastes have gotten so bad as to make this CD Amazon's second (or is it first?) most pre-ordered. Gawd, we're all doomed!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|It has been 30 years since a decent Bond film (The Spy Who Loves Me). It has been nearly 40 years since the last great one (On Her Majesty's Secret Service). But I kept going to each new release, with less and less enthusiasm. Until now. Craig has brought back the rough and tumble style of Connery and Lazenby. No more ratatattat machine guns with no recoil! No invisible cars! No \\"witticisms\\" that could have been recyled from Austin Powers! Nope. Just hardcore action, great acting and a fantastic story and dialogue. Wow!!! Bond is really back. As for the lack of special features that several have mentioned, I predict that a special edition for hardcore fans will be on the way by the end of '07.
B00005JA2B|5.0|This is a great album from 1976 that shows Kansas bridging the gap between their excellent prog rock epics and the shorter hard rock tracks.  The result is a collection of extremely tight and intricately arranged pieces (Magnum Opus is incredible in this regard) that feature the nimble ensemble work that characterized their proggiest material, yet are presented in a more cohesive format.  Gone too are the shorter \\"boogie rock\\" pieces, resulting in a very balanced and proggy sounding album.  In short, Leftoverture is an exceptionally fine example of progressive hard rock and shows Kansas starting to mature their sound.<br /><br />All of the band members were in top form on this album and Kerry Livgren (guitars, piano, clavinet, and synthesizers) was positively on fire - in fact he contributed most of the material, including one of my favorite Kansas compositions (Cheyenne Anthem).  I especially like the instrumentation on Leftoverture (and all Kansas albums for that matter), which includes nice Hammond organ and tasteful use of synthesizers (ARP, Moog, and Oberheim synths), along with the electrifying sound of heavily distorted electric guitars courtesy of Rich Williams and Kerry (the acoustic guitar work by Rich is also very nice too).  There is also the fantastic rhythm section of Phil Ehart (drums/percussion) and thunderous bassist Dave Hope - Dave provides some nice counterpoint and together they give the tracks a proggy punch.  Last but not least, I also appreciate the vocals - Steve Walsh (lead/backing vocals; Hammond organ; piano; synthesizers; vibes) can really belt out and Robby Steinhardt (lead and backing vocals; violin/violas) is no slouch either.<br /><br />The remastering on this CD is very good and features extensive liner notes, crystal clear sound reproduction (this was a well-produced record to start with), along with photos of the band and a few bonus tracks including live versions of the smash hit Carry on Wayward Son and my favorite, Cheyenne Anthem.<br /><br />This is a great album of progressive hard rock by Kansas that features some of their most focused songwriting and arranging.  Combined with the superb musicianship that the band was (and is) known for, Leftoverture makes for a very enjoyable listening experience.  Very highly recommended along with Kansas (1974); Song for America (1975); and Point of Know Return (1977).  For those folks that are discovering this style of music for the first time, the albums Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978) by the Canadian band Rush might also prove to be of interest.is a great album of progressive hard rock by Kansas that features some of their most focused songwriting and arranging.

B000KCHZK6|1.0|Her first recording was her best. It had more of a Jazz feel to it. This one is just another dud. I'll give it a few more listens to see if it grows on me but I doubt it.
1881273156|4.0|I got two copies of the book right before I got engaged to my fiance.  At that time, I just thought that our relationship was something that I wanted to develop, improve and really make something out it, and I was hoping that the book would give us pointers.  Now that I'm engaged and looking forward to the marriage, I'm so glad that I got them for all the points and illustrations it offers with the mindset of marriage.  My fiance and I share similiar beliefs and values, but we express them in different ways.  The illustrations used in the book help us to see the each other's perspectives, so that we are not focusing on our differences but our similarities.  Only things I might complain are that most of the examples seem to resolve so easily withouth much struggle though I'm pretty sure they weren't.  I wish there was examples how marriages actually failed because of certain mistakes people made so I can avoid them, these illustrations though unfortunate can speak volumes.  Also, some of the activity ideas are ridiculous, such as having a picnic at a local cemetary to celebrate life, he listed some very strange ideas.  Other than that, it was a great read!!

B000H305U0|4.0|I must admit that I am impressed with Justins' growing talent and efforts at leading and not following the pack. \\"Them other brothers dont know how to act\\" says it all. I am thoroughly enjoying this album and am looking forward to the slower tracks becoming just as popular as the slammin title track and my Love. It is fun and creative production wise and quite frankly I am eager to see how he transitions as an artist as he further matures into a more experienced business man/actor/singer/performer. Good Job Justin, I am keeping back one Star for your next album...so far you are two for two with me.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My son received this as a present for his 2nd birthday and loves it. The pieces stick to the wall when wet,they also float, and the \\"road\\" pieces fit together like a puzzle...so he has a blast playing with them all sorts of ways. We make it part of the routine that at the end of the bath he sticks them all to the wall to dry and later I put them back in the mesh bag that suction-cups to the wall.  And the suction cups actully work! Great product - would make a great gift.

B000ICLHIE|4.0|Tom Waits has bestowed unto his fans a great gift with ORPHANS, his new 3 CD opus of lost and found treasures from his vaults.  To a long time fan like myself, it's a staggering amount of material to ingest and digest, and after several weeks, I think I can finally share some thoughts on it.<br /><br />I was originally wary of the fact that the material was broken up into three distinct parts.  One of the pleasures of a Waits set is how the feral blues tracks play off the sentimental ballad, which plays off the twisted spoken yarn.  After listening, I can say that I'm not too put off at all by the Brawlers (the more up-tempo material) and the Bawlers (the twisted Tin Pan Alley types), but find the Bastards a little less enjoyable as a whole.  Not that the BASTARDS are devoid of good material, but the unrelenting strangeness does not pull this listener back for repeated listens.<br /><br />That being said this is a mother lode of classics from the Barking Bard.  Having this much A grade material in the vault just highlights the fact that Waits is one of the top artists of these times.  Personal favorites include DOWN THERE BY THE TRAIN, LOWDOWN, THE ROAD TO PEACE, WORLD KEEPS TURNING and his two great Ramone's covers DANNY SAYS AND THE RETURN OF JACKIE AND JUDY.  The song ROAD TO PEACE is a political song concerning the Israeli-Palestinian situation, quite out of character from it's author, but also one of the best political songs I've encountered.  And catchy too!<br /><br />While far from perfect, this set remains a treasure trove for most of Waits fans, especially those who have embraced the later half of his career, where I believe most of these tracks have come.  I wish the booklet would have had more information on the origins and recording dates of the songs, but that's a minor complaint.  I'll take the two solid disks of great music and one of interesting, if flawed experiments anytime
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This DVD edition is a must for fans of both Kurosawa and the \\"Jidaigeki\\" genre in general. This masterpiece from the 50's is indeed revolutionary with it's storyline, character development, and editing. Toshiro Mifune is simply radiant in this film! I'm no expert when it comes to production quality, but I am very impressed with this DVD edition. The bonus disc highlights some of Kurosawa's inspiration behind the film and gives the viewer some background on the subgenres within Japanese Cinema. Most of my DVD collection is shelved in a closet. Seven Samurai, however, is proudly displayed on my living-room bookcase.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|In 2005 she wanted to tell us a secret, but lately Madonna has been all about \\"Confessions\\" and this tour de force from last summer completely delivers!  Fans will not be disappointed by this CD/DVD offering and non-fans will be delighted by how amazing this video presentation is - it is top-notch and beautifully shot!  The CD is also a great mix but it's noticeably missing some of the shows biggest numbers.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I love this album, found it by accident and I've listened to it several times thru already. One of my favorites so far this year!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I can't get enough of this cd and dvd.  It's like the best night of clubbing wrapped up in media.  Plus it's great that you can get the cd and the dvd for such a reasonable price.  I love every song.  I dont know how she does it.   If you even kind of like the confessions cd you will love this concert.
B000IY041S|4.0|The content of this DVD is great, the concert video is outstanding, great shows.  And the CD is outstanding.  It is certainly worth owning and the package price for for the DVD and CD together is a very good deal compared to buying the CD and single DVD version individually. <br /> <br />But be warned, this is a Region 2 DVD and will not play on DVD players sold in the US that are not all-region/zone players.  It will play on most computer dvd drives though, which is how I have to watch it pending getting an all-zone dvd player.
B0000DKKY4|4.0|Cat Stevens is not a very popular man in the west right now - especially after his conversion to Islam and his lamentable involvement in the Rushdie affair. But he was a superb composer of delicate pop songs in the 60s and 70s. This compillation includes some of the best of them - Wild World, The First Cut is the Deepest (later a memorable cover by Rod Stewart), the wonderful Rubylove, Moonshadow, Father and Son, Hard Headed Woman, Peace Train. Highly Recommended.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|Even if you're not a Streisand Fan, you'll love this concert--personal,intimate and all the Streisand hits! <br />She's natural, at ease and so happy to be entertaining her dear friends.
B00005RFVL|4.0|After \\"Sing when you're winning\\" (something of a breakthrough album for him), Robbie decided to take on his riskiest project: a cover of standards from the 40s, 50s and 60s. To everyone surprise, he succeeded. The album is wonderful to listen. The hit single of the album was Somethin' Stupid (a cover of Frank and Nancy Sinatra's hit by Robbie and Nicole Kidman - yes, she can sing), but the album has a lot of other great songs - Mack the Knife, Well did you Evah (a duet with Jon Lovitz!), Mr. Bojangles, the wonderful Things (a duet with Jane Horrocks), Ain't that a Kick in the Head, They can't Take that Away from Me (a duet with Rupert Everett!), and finally, to me the best song in the album, Beyond the Sea (originally a french song, but made famous by Bobby Darin in the 1960s).
B000INAXGU|5.0|Because Jamiroquai such an album oriented band I didn't think 'High Times' would make much sense.So often CD's such as this are released as a contractual obligation gimmick,forcing a fan to duplicate many songs to purchase a couple new tunes.'Hight Times' is not the case.Even though this is a greatest hits of sorts,it isn't-or a best of.Jamiroqui are barely 15 years old so this isn't inteneded as any kind of ending,no more then Janet Jackson's similar 'Design Of A Decade' project was a decade ago.All of these songs are single edits,shorter and differing musically from the versions on the regular CD's.As a result the featured versions of \\"Emergency On Planet Earth\\" and \\"Space Cowboy\\" are drastically different (and actually far funkier) then the album versions.This only features one song from 'The Return Of The Space Cowboy',the band's sophmore release and considered their finest.'High Times' will also save casual fans from having to purchase the bands last CD to date 'Dynamite',an inconsistant recording best known for it's hit singles represented here.As for the two new songs,both are terrific.\\"Runaway\\" (the 'hit' song) actually brings a little of the 80's production style of ABC and early Spandau Ballet,rather then J Kay's constant reliance on the 70's.And it's got that great hook that only this band can offer.\\"Radio\\" is one of the great radio-themed songs out there and is,as far as I am concerned Jamiroquai's most successful experiment in rock,certainly a better fusion then the silly \\"Black Devil Car\\" from 'Dynamite'.So rather then being a CD Jamiroquai fans should avoid,this is actually something worth picking up if you already have their other seven releases.
B000L212HW|1.0|This was a bad movie made worse by the fact that I was actually excited about it before it came out.  I'm a big fan of dragons and the ones shown in the \\"behind the scenes\\" show that preceeded the movies release really had me looking forward to seeing it.  Seeing this in the theater was like a kick in the teeth with a steel toed boot - although the dragons DID look good, the story was terrible (both in its concept and presentation) and the acting was, by far, the worst I've seen out of professional actors in a movie that was not made for TV.  I watched the whole movie with a glimmer of hope, which was definitely extinguished when the credits started rolling by.  This is now how I refer to any movie that I think is terrible (i.e. - \\"That's almost as bad as 'Reign of Fire'!).  If you're expecting crap and only want some mindless action to play in the background, it might be passable, but if you have any expectations beyone total [explative], then avoid this atrocity like the plague.  As for seeing it in 1080i - a piece of trash in any resolution is still trash!
B000001AFY|5.0|I used to play this album back in 1976 all the time, and thankfully, still have it on vinyl, and, without a lot of scratches.  I do wish I had it in C.D. form, but, for what people here are asking for it, no thanks, I'll just use my turn table!!!  This is one of Diana's very best albums of the 70's,  Get this is you can, you will so enjoy hearing Diana's classic 70's voice again.
0307237699|5.0|halfway thru this book, I realized who I would be voting for in 2008. Mr. Obama's book inspires smart debate while remaining civil He presents his politcal observations and I agreed with many of them and disagreed with others but he presents his ideas with the door open to disagree with him without a sense of punishment by his camp for doing so. he wonders about himself as well 'Can i remain objective and focused without becoming bitter and spiteful int he hard game of politics?'  I hope so. he seems ot be a good leader and this book is writtern very well.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|'The Snowman' is a video for all ages, a wonderful fantasy that captures the viewer's heart.  Our 2 and 1/2 year old granddaughter loved it, as did everyone else in the family.  The only thing that might trouble some viewers is that the snowman melts at the end of the story.
0141439475|5.0|I was quite surprised at how much depth was really in this book. I had ideas of Frankenstein's monster from the movies and society, but those pathetic interpretations do not capture the true, sorrowful nature of the \\"daemon.\\" I was genuinely moved by this tale: It is a story of light and dark; it is a story of gain and loss; it is a story of love and hate. When the creator becomes the hated, the created becomes the vengeful.<br /><br />I never expected this book to have such unique depth. Whatever you think you know about Frankenstein is just a poor transcription of this wonderful work by Mary Shelley.

B000AP04OM|5.0|This is definitely a great movie for you and the family. You'll find yourself singing the songs at work, in the bathroom or wherever. I would recommend this movie for everyone. Julie Andrews played this character so perfectly.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|First of all let me say how in love i am with this movie. throughout all the adaptions of this movie that i have seen, this version comes closest to portraying the book to the fullest. i always felt that both jane and Rochester should be played with more passion and physical connection, not just of the mind and spirit. they are two impassioned and soulful people who belong together in every sense of the word. this comes across wonderfully because of the easy chemistry between both toby stevens and Ruth wilson. you look at these two and you can feel every emotion, love, passion, laughter, desperation, betrayal, forgivness and in the end happiness and redemption. they say toby stevens too good looking to play rochester (and yes he is gorgeous) but his acting is so real he makes you believe he is rochester. as for Ruth wilson i think she was perfect for the role of jane. depending on the emotion or angle of her features can she become quite plain and intriquing and the next moment exotic and mysterious. she also had a fiestiness about her that i had never seen in others versions. i have watched this movie 3 or 4 times now and still find a reason to come back and watch it again. new movies worth watching are so few and far between these days i grab them when i see them. seems these days the only good films worth anything are of british origin. its nice to see a movie without blatent sex and violence, a movie that keeps you captivated by the acting and the rich scenes. jane eyre was a wonderfully written book that captured the senses and for me was finally brought to life by two incredible actors that were so believable you can see there attachment come alive and awaken into a passionate and eventually soul deep love.   the only fault i have with this version is the lack of spiritual imput the book origianlly intended. Her relationship with Helen was completely ommitted from the movie, which i feel left you hanging without insight into how Jane became the woman she became. How she went from rebellious and spiratually ignorant to finding strength in the Lord and a peace that allowed her an understanding of forgivness and respect for herself no matter the hardships in life. This leads to the reason why she has to leave and why it tears her apart. by doing the right thing and putting her trust in the Lord by leaving does she come to realize the true connection between herself and Rochester. By having faith in the Lord and following him did she eventually complete her life, and because of this was Rochester given his redemption. as said in the book \\"God tempers judgement with mercy\\". all of this was missing in this movie i am sad to say, it would have made this movie complete in every way. overall, despite this the film was well made and i loved the scenes between Toby stevens and Ruth wilson, they were magnificent together. all told its a keeper.
B0007OY2MG|4.0|Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory are small town girls growing up fast. Conflicts this season arise from Rory dating Jess, the nephew of Luke, and ditching her old boyfriend Dean. Also conflicts arise between Rory and her rival Paris.<br /><br />While I liked the season, I felt a few things were overdone. I was a bit bored by Kirk. Yeah we get it. He's clumsy, anti-social and a loser. But the slapstick comedy got a little old.<br /><br />Also, the elder Lorelai and her selfish antagonism and refusal to 'bury the hatchet' with her parents got a bit boring. I like Lorelai's parents...They've been exceedingly generous with both their daughter and grandchild and at times Lorelai's attitude towards them bugs me.<br /><br />Overall, this was a solid season. I'm looking forward to season 4.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I am a long time advocate of taking care of our earth, and this DVD made me get into gear to try and do more to be part of the solution, and not the problem.  Global warming can be corrected, but we all need to do as much as we can to make it work.  Even if all some of us can do right now is take \\"baby steps\\", we must take them, and \\"grow up\\", and grow aware!  <br /> <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album was almost universally acclaimed as the release of the year in 2005. Listening to an album with high expectations can sometimes bring disappointment. If you're expecting a masterpiece anything less than perfection may seem a let down. Yet this wasn't the case this time. Listening to Illinoise for the first time I was surprised and delighted again and again. The man has a range and versatility that few people working in music now could match. He can be gorgeously folky one moment and then spring a full pop symphony on you a moment later. And for all the elaborateness of the arrangements the music is very emotionally direct. \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\" is a disturbing ballad about the life of a serial killer. The emotion Stevens brings to this song is disarming. And yet on other times the music is really joyful and celebratory. At times you hear folk influences- a bit of Paul Simon here, a bit of Mercury Rev there and a touch of Nick Drake in the guitar-based songs. But Stevens is a man who does something new with his influences. This is really outstanding music which deserves all the plaudits.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I recommend this film for everyone who plans to live on Earth in the future. You will need to get past the political and some personal aspects of Al Gore (don't let that make you skeptical of the message), but those parts do provide some background and explanation.  Too bad he didn't make this film earlier before he wasted energy on the presidential campaign.  The message of the film is clear and effective.  Gore shows himself to be a true leader in this global effort.  If we had seen this before the election, I believe that the world would be a better place today.
B000056BOR|5.0|I just recently saw this movie for the 1st time and LOVED every minute of it; there were even several laugh out loud moments.  Cary's comedic talent is at it's best with fabulous lines and Doris is, of course, gloriously Doris.  I intend to buy this little gem of a movie and highly recommend that others do too!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who said everyone interprets the book in a different way.  I've always been slightly irritated with the other versions that render one of the most passionate books so tame and mannerly.  Jane Eyre is not a Jane Austen novel.  It is over the top and gothic and melodramatic. Jane and Rochester are two passionate creatures in the book--they are always storming and raging and lightning is symobolically burning trees next to them--but in the movies they are so chaste.  I was thankfully surprised that in this one they are touchy-feely.  In the book, when he is trying to persuade her to stay with him, there is a lot of crushing her to him going on.  I'm glad they showed that in this version.  I really believed these two were in love, mentally, emotionally, and physically. <br />I think it's funny that a couple people said they were too good looking but nobody mentions that the actress in the Timothy Dalton version looks about 38.  I never could believe it when she says she's 18.  And she has none of the impetuousness and rage that young Jane Eyre has.  I loved this one.  I thought she captured all the power and passion surging in Jane's soul.  And I like that she is cute to us but would have been considered ugly by Victorians.  That is how I always pictured Jane--as somebody who didn't live up to her age's standard of beauty, whereas Blanche is supposed to be the epitome of that ideal.   <br />I thought this version was more in the spirit of the book than any of the others (a spirit of passion and vehemence and rage).  I would recommend it.

B000IHY9UW|5.0|'The Doors' were one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the sixties and the quintessential California group of the decade. They so embodied the West Coast counterculture experience that viewing this biographical film about Jim Morrison and The Doors also provides a fascinating view of the cultural and spiritual forces that drove Jim and that entire generation to challenge the status quo of the American mainstream.<br /><br />What exactly is the true story of the life and death of Jim Morrison? Is it the story of one of the many rebellious young adults of the time who in looking for an alternative way of living got lost along the way in the drugs, alcohol and sexual freedom that so dominated that culture? Or is Jims' story a deeply mystical tale announcing the rebirth of ancient shamanism into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century? The story of someone chosen by the spirits to bring the 'old ways' to a new generation looking for something to fill the spiritual void brought about by the loss of belief in the Christian God?<br /><br />Director Oliver Stone has played the mythmaker to perfection in this amazing film providing us with the unique experience of entering into the American Dreamtime. Layering mundane worldly events intermitently with glimpses of the psychic, shamanic forces motivating those events we are given the opportunity to chose for ourselves what level of reality we are willing, or ready to accept. A truly remarkable accomplishment.<br /><br />As for the performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, it couldn't have been better. His ability to capture both the physcial appearance and dark persona of the legendary rock star so completely is beyond extraordinary. Without question Val was born to play this role.<br /><br />Did Jim really believe he was the \\"Electric Shaman\\" called by the spirits to open the \\"Doors of Perception\\" to a sleeping world? Was he Dionysus reborn, here to use his suggestive music and lyrics to arouse his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring' with \\"Golden copulations in the streets of L.A.\\" More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster' leading us once again in the wrong direction. Maybe it's just like his Mother said long ago while the old Indian lay dying along the roadside in the California desert. \\"It's just a dream Jimmy, that's all it is.\\"<br /><br />So relax, show no fear, \\"Kiss the Snake\\" and enjoy the ride!his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring' with \\"Golden copulations in the streets of L.A.\\" More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster' leading us once again in the wrong direction.

0307237699|5.0|I don't read books normally.  Everything is online for me, but this caught my eye, and I read it from beginning to end.  It really explained his background and what his beliefs are and why he believes about certain things.  I think he has a much better grip on reality than many of his coworkers, including the president.  He knows that he must remain true to the common person, even if he rises to the top.  He also knows that he must accept campaign contributions to afford to run, but he also is ashamed to do it sometimes, which I think is important.  He says the current political election system is backwards, and gives good detailed examples of how it got to be this way.... it wasn't always like this, you know.  After reading this book, you'll have a lot more knowledge about Barack Obama than you could gather watching the silly media.  I think America someday will require all it's presidents-to-be to write a book and provide it (free of charge) to all registered voters.  Americans need to spend MORE TIME RESEARCHING CANDIDATES, otherwise this Government is going to get too big and detached from the average voter that we will have some sort of civil war someday.  Read this book if you want to be an educated voter in 2008. ;)
1582701709|2.0|I was really excited to read this book! However...once I started reading I was really really disapointed to see quotes from two 'hype n type' authors. I then found it hard to take this book seriuosly because of this. Joe Vitale is a author who punches out pretty much useless ebooks and over priced ones at that, and Dr Martini (I'm not joking - formally married to Australia's answer to miss cleo Athena starwoman - yah lots of credibitlty there!) However I do like the other points made by other contributors to this book however I do think that this is just a revamped smaller version of the book 'Ask and it is given' ...this book is just repackaged idea's and beliefs made public by other authors. <br />
B000FQ4M58|5.0|As a longtime meatloaf fan, I have to admit this album does sound different from its first and second Bat Out of Hell albums. Meatloaf's vocal is still very powerful though. The first time listening to this album, I thought it is good but not that impressive. However, the more I listen to it, the more I like it. My favorite tracks are \\"Blink as a Bat\\", \\"What about Love\\" , and \\"If God could Talk.\\" The sample of \\"the Monster is Loose\\" does not do its justice. The 7+ minutes version is 5 times better than the sample. I do enjoy Meatloaf's new sound. This album is definitely not a disappointment as other reviewers pointed out. Can't wait to see the concert at Madison Square Garden this year.

B000002UA5|5.0|It was pretty hard for me to choose a Floyd album to review as I consider most of their records close, personal friends. But after mulling it over, I settled on Ummagumma. It isn't my favorite Floyd album. Heck, it's not even in my top five, but I chose to focus on this album for a number of reasons.<br /><br />When this record first came out, Pink Floyd's future was anything but certain. They had just lost their lead singer and chief composer, Syd Barrett, and the rest of the band (including newly joined Dave Gilmour) was struggling to take up the reins. Saucerful of Secrets, their second studio album, was the band's first outing without Syd, and while it wasn't necessarilly a bad album, it had failed to live up to their groundbreaking debut. What they really needed at this point was to solidify their fan base while exerting their own skills as songwriters. Ummagumma was their attempt to do just that.<br /><br />This double disc is divided into live tracks and studio compositions. The first disc is a glorious, if brief, return to roots with early songs performed alongside newer compositions, such as Water's beautiful deep space psychedelic 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun.' This live material is entirely satisfying due to the quality of the performances, but also on account of the fact that little of Floyd's early live work is documented. Other than bootlegs, Live at Pompeii is perhaps the only other live recording that addresses this critical phase in Floyd's development.<br /><br />The second disc, however, is where the fun starts. Each member set out to write his own compositions... and what results we are treated to. Waters' song, 'Several small species of animals... ,' is perhaps the weirdest track you will encounter, but it's just the tip of the psychedelic iceberg. 'Grandshester Meadows' is a delicate piece that anticipates such future ballads as 'If' and 'Is there anybody out there?' 'The Grand Viziers Garden Party' is a long psychedlic piece that builds to a climax with Waters laying down a wailing vocal. The songs are as varied as imaginable... and it quickly becomes evident that from this primordial and multi-colored ooze the Dark Side of the Moon would someday emerge.Waters laying down a wailing vocal.

0451167716|5.0|If you are a fan of the Godfather movies you will undoubtedly love this, because the film adaptation did not stray very far from the book upon which it was based. It's all here: the saga of the Corleone family passing the baton from one generation to the next, and of 'good son' Michael's unexpected ascent to leader of his family business. I shouldn't have to tell you that said family business extends far beyond the reaches of the olive oil company the Corleones use as a front for their mob activities, the film being one of pop culture's cornerstones since its release in 1971. But we're here to discuss the book, which is surprisingly well written for what essentially amounts to a potboiler filled with sex and violence. I expected it to be exciting, and it is, but the quality of Puzo's craftmanship was a welcome surprise. He has a deft touch for shading the characters into complex beings, and he is certainly smart to allow the violence to serve the story instead of vice versa (all too often novels like this think that an excess of blood and gore will lend an air of drama or credibility to it, and the genius of the Godfather is that we get that from the characters instead). The Godfather is, after all, about the complexity of a family whose livelihood is steeped in murder, but whose loyalties are deep and whose love for each other is palpable. Puzo does a great job laying bare the inherent contradictions in this set-up, and just like in the movie you may find yourself respecting them despite your better reasoning.<br /><br />There are some differences to be found, most notably that you get Vito Corleone's back story here whereas the movie held off on that until the sequel (probably for time reasons). There is also a lengthy subplot in the book concerning Johnny Fontane's exploits in Las Vegas after Vito gets him his part in the war movie he was after -- a wholly unnecessary subplot that gets weirder and more annoying as the book goes on and Lucy Mancini, the bridesmaid that Sonny Corleone got familiar with at his sister's wedding, is sent out there to keep her away from him. Her storyline takes away from the suspense that the rest of the novel builds and has little to do with anything else, although the curious surgical procedure that she undergoes is such a left-field oddity that it does have some merit as camp. But camp doesn't suit the rest of the novel's grim sensibility, so it really should have been excised. Puzo spends a lot more time hammering in the allusions to Frank Sinatra that Johnny Fontane is meant to embody (he even snags an Oscar for his war movie a la Ole Blue Eyes' 1953 win for 'From Here to Eternity'), which is fine except that the way the movie hints at it is a lot more effective in its subtlety. But I'm being nit-picky here, those are Puzo's only missteps in an otherwise spectacular novel. While the novel may have been overshadowed by the film(s) that it led to, it has rightly earned a spot as a classic, and I would recommend it to mystery/thriller buffs as well as fans of the movies.id that Sonny Corleone got familiar with at his sister's wedding, is sent out there to keep her away from him.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|Norah Jones' latest album may not win any new fans, but it won't scare away her present ones, either.  It's the usual low-key, mellow, effortless affair we've come to expect from this winsome chanteuse.  The difference is that this time out, all the songs are originals (most co-written with bassist-boyfriend Lee Alexander, but some penned solo).  And she does a capable job, even if some of the lyrics are rather simplistic (\\"You seem really glad that I am sad\\").  Oh well, we can't all be Joni Mitchell.  There are some standout songs, though, like \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", a New Orleans-flavored tune with whimsical food imagery and a political message.  Norah's dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs also comes through in \\"My Dear Country\\", and the love song \\"Wish I Could\\".  In fact, there is a political undercurrent in much of her work here, though it's presented subtly in the music.  Of course there's romance too, in songs like \\"Be My Somebody\\".  Melodically, these songs are strong across the board, though none of them will make you want to get up and dance (well, maybe slow-dance).  But my advice to Norah is not to abandon the standards and others' contemporary tunes.  I think she's at her best when she mixes original and interpreted material, like Bonnie Raitt does.  Bottom line?  Get it if you're a Norah fan (grab the specially-priced CD/DVD edition if you can).   But it's also a safe bet for any fan of mellow, piano-driven, \\"torchy\\" music.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Just order it !  If you love the book, you will appreciate this movie. <br />It's beautiful, the actors have intense chemistry.   <br />I cannot wait to get this DVD ! <br /> <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|When Norah first came out I wrote her off as a pop artist with only one or two good CD's in her. But the more she writes the better she becomes. I picked this CD up just before my shift ended tonight and have already listened to it twice.  I'm 22 but I love and listen to every variety of music there is, but no matter how much I listen to music I like the newer music, but I love the older ones. They're bands that are outstanding in today's music, but I think over half of them don't have the staying power. <br /> <br />However I think Norah does have the ability to stay around for awhile. \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" reminds me a lot of Tom Waits \\"Rain Dogs\\" CD, and that's not an insult. \\"Thinking about You\\" is just outstanding and it stands on it's own. The atmosphere of \\"The Sun Doesn't LIke You\\" reminds me of \\"The Doors - Riders of the Storm\\" with lyrics that could be written by Lou Reed. Take the first two lines of the song \\"the sun doesn't like you, you always get burned/stay in the shade and watch the world turn,\\" the lyrics are just outstanding. One of my favorites is \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" it's just inspiring. It's beautiful and inspiring. <br /> <br />So the songs don't run at 150 beats a minute. The music is outstanding it travels through the whole spectrum blues/rock/classical/country/jazz, it's all there. As for the lyrics they are beautifully written. This CD is showing a hell of a lot of talent that I think is going to explode in the next 1 or 2 CD's. Yes I would recommend this CD.

B side of Speak & Spell written by Vice & Martin with AWESOME RUMBLING GUITARS OF BOTH!! <br />Please DM release this track soon!!
B0000085N4|5.0|Damn, this is good rock & roll. In my mind there are four classic balls-out guitar-rock (is there any other kind?) albums: Van Halen's first, Back in Black, Appetite for Destruction, and Sonic Temple. And of them all, Sonic Temple probably rocks the hardest. It's a solid wall of buzz-saw, multi-tracked guitars. And it's not just a jam-fest: the songwriting is top-notch (except for the weak \\"New York City\\"). I used to put this CD on to get stoked before I went into the gym. Almost twenty years later, it hasn't aged one bit.
B000M4RG42|5.0|I do not go to see a movie with any expectations.  I have seen movies that have been poorly rated by film critics, but absolutely loved the movie and recommended it to friends who also love the movie.  Thus, I do not allow a critic's words about a film to influence me......a book on Flags Of Our Fathers will be quite different than the movie, as it is with any other book followed by the movie.  The books' author, the screenplay writer and the director don't always agree and their insights will be different -- then there is the chief editor who might edit not consistent with the author or the screenplay writer.  Of course, then we have the \\"Hollywood mindset\\" and they don't care what we want to see -- just how they see it -- and their opinions and ideas are skewed,
B000KRNCYY|4.0|I am a big fan of Celtic Woman. I was introduced to the women thanks to my local PBS station that aired their first televised special just over a year ago. \\"A New Journey\\" is music from their latest dvd of the same name. I caught a televised airing on it last month on my PBS station so I knew what to expect on their cd. Hayley Westenra joins Celtic Woman and she is a nice addition to the group. Her voice is somewhere between Chloe's and Lisa. I have to admit that the music took me awhile to grow on. The songs didn't leave me breathless like their self-titled album did but after a few hundred listens, I was ready for some new music. There are a couple of songs on the album that the women sing without the orchestra, \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"Beyond the Sea\\" (well for the most part). I wasn't really big on hearing the women sing acapella but it wasn't bad. Just different. One of my favorite songs on the cd is \\"The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun\\" (all five women sings on the song), it is kinda bombastic but it is a perfect opener for the cd. My other favorite song is the beautiful \\"Caledonia\\" which is sung by Lisa Kelly. That song stood out for me on this cd as did \\"Someday\\" did on their self-titled album. I also enjoyed \\"Vivaldi's Rain\\". I thought it was odd hearing lyrics to the song but still lovely song. The production is slick. Melodies are lush. Nothing new or innovative but I still enjoyed listening to \\"A New Journey\\".  Overall \\"A New Journey\\" is definitely worth having for Celtic Woman fans.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Ta-Dah speaks to my inner 70s child and part of my 80s. I could waste valuable time (which you should spend buying this) writing endlessly about how great this CD is, but I'll sum it as quickly as possible. Here goes:<br /><br />THE OVERALL SOUND REMINDS ME OF:<br /><br />the best of Elton John, Pet Shop Boys, George Michael, Abba, Times Two, a tinge of Go West, \\"Xanadu\\" (as Amazon.com so rightly puts it in their review) and even the harmony of the Beach Boys and Carpenters...<br /><br />WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT SO MUCH:<br /><br />Because you can dance AND listen! While the incredibly energetic, fun sound of disco is here and welcome, the often horrible lyrics that genre generated is most definitely (and with much relief!) missing.<br /><br />TA-DAH IS THAT MOST RARE AND TREASURED OF ALBUMS:<br /><br />the one where every track's either a winner or at least \\"not bad\\"!<br /><br />AND THESE ARE JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />Track #1) \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\"--Do you remember the awful movie XANADU with the terrific soundtrack? This song reminds me of ELO and ONJ's collaboration on one of the most underappreciated soundtracks of the early 80s!!<br /><br />Track #2) \\"She's My Man\\"--At the risk of implying Scissor Sisters borrows a lot from their favorite 70s idols, I've got to say this wonderful, quirky song reminds me so much of \\"Still Standing\\" by Elton John. (This is a good thing, though!)<br /><br />Track #3) \\"I Can't Decide\\"--A great tongue-in-cheek song that reminds me of the Beatles if they were writing in the 21st century...any other song about killing someone would be totally out of line, but somehow it works here because...well...it's tongue-in-cheek of course!<br /><br />Track #4) \\"Lights\\"--I can't help but hear echoes of \\"Grease is the Word\\" when this song is on, but again, they're echoes, NOT imitation. The power of this album is that it merges great lyrics with undeniably great beats!!!<br /><br />Tracks 5 and 6 (\\"Land of a Thousand Words\\" and \\"Intermission\\") are pleasant enough but I can't automatically bring them to my mind and ear right now the way I can all the others...\\"Intermission\\" is a fitting title, though, since once it's over TA-DAH returns to its wonderful spirit!<br /><br />Track#7) \\"Kiss You Off\\"--With its Pat Benetar bursts of energy, \\"KYO\\" forces you to sing along and you WILL do so, especially if that special someone's got you all hot and bothered.<br /><br />Tracks 8 and 9 (\\"Ooh\\" and \\"Paul McCartney\\") are, hands down, the best of the best here. I hit repeat on \\"Ooh\\" at least five times before I continued on to \\"Paul\\" (a witty and sometimes funny pop powerhouse!)<br /><br />SO TO SUM IT ALL UP:<br /><br />Do you remember how you felt when you were a kid and you were worried the second time you listened to a spectacular album you'd find all its flaws??  Well your worries can be put to rest here.

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|This DVD is based on the best-selling book \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\".  It is full of fine actors, many of which you will probably recognize, even if you don't know their names. The story is a fictitious adventure, taking place mainly in Peru.  Our hero, John, runs into an old friend, who tells him about information that sets him off on an interesting adventure to find 9 ancient scrolls from 500 or 600 BC, called \\"Insights\\".  The Insights redefine they way people can choose to look at life and interact with each other.  The problem is, church officials in Peru don't want the information in the Insights to become available to people.  The church and the military are intent on destroying the scrolls, and are willing to jail, or even kill, anyone who tries to interfere.  As John goes to Peru, he meets many people who each teach him something about the Insights, in their proper order. It displays the concept \\"when the student is ready, the teacher will appear\\".  (Many people believe there are no coincidences, but instead there is a divine order, which often occurs to achieve something.)  The video is done well and the journey is full of adventure, although the book is even better. There's some great scenery, too.<br /><br />If you know anything about energy in the spiritual sense, the Insights teach about energy fields surrounding people, places, and things.  They show the auras (energy fields) surrounding people, show you the concept of seeing colors in the aura (each color has meaning, as does the intensity of the color), and the concept of people \\"stealing\\" energy from other people (like when someone leaves you and you feel physically drained), and people exchanging energies from their heart charka (energy point area near the heart).  They show you energy life in plants.  They show you about seeing beyond what your physical eyes see.  Another concept is that there is plenty of energy to share.  No one needs to control others and steal energy.  As a spiritual student of Reiki, I am pleased with the spiritual energy concepts portrayed in this DVD.  I think it could have been a little longer, with more info, but it is certainly worth watching, especially if you have knowledge of the spiritual energy that I'm speaking of.  If not, can you open your mind to the possibility?  Remember, we all have these big brains that we only use a very small percentage of.  Wonder what the rest is for??? H-m-m-m-m.<br /><br />Personally, I would advise you to read the book \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" first, and then watch the movie.  The book is really hard to put down.  (Later on, you might want to read the other books that follow.)  The DVD is great, but the book gives more info.  My 33 year old son watched this DVD and LOVED it.  He knows only what I've told him about spiritual energy.  He does not believe anything until he sees it, so he doesn't believe any of this energy stuff, but still loved the movie.

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars.  I was pleasantly surprised although I personally can't give it 5 stars for a number of reasons. I think those who have only seen the 2 hours versions and not the Dalton version and/or read the book will like it a lot. For most (not all) of those who've seen or read the latter they'll not be as overwhelmed.     Because the Dalton/Clarke adaptation is closer to the book in atmosphere and dialogue, it truly epitomizes the Gothic romance and atmosphere of the book with the sexy, smouldering broodiness of Mr. Rochester, the soft-spoken introverted fairylike creature of the strong-minded Jane and the combination of the dark cloud of mystery hanging over Thornfield Hall and it's master.  For Masterpiece Theatre to cut out some of THEE most important parts of Mr. Rochester's introspective dialogue with Jane as she fell in love with the glimpse of the redemptive man she saw in the tortured soul, was a crime to say the least. It was so important to the story and there were so many hours in which to work with.    You kind of know where things stand early on in this version.  If you like things to be a little more obvious as opposed to subtle, then this one is definitely for you!     I felt Toby Stephens did a great job and he actually portrayed SOME type of emotion unlike Orson Welles, William Hurt and others who clung too strongly in my opinion to the angry/brooding side of Mr. Rochester.   Mr. Rochester was a combination of moody, happy (with Jane), tumultuous and quietly introspective. Toby Stephens is never quite the \\"peculiar\\" Mr. Rochester that Mrs. Fairfax initally describes to Jane, nor is he the moody person Jane describes in the book as being one day kind to her, then unkind during some of their earlier meetings. This Mr. Rochester appears more lonely and sad, not necessarily brooding.    For a friend, that I asked (more like begged) to watch because she had never read or watched Jane Eyre, this version (outside of the surprise of Bertha) left little surprise for her by way of their feelings because of the added scenes of his impatient treatment of Blanche Ingram and also the numerous scenes of he and Jane walking and talking alone out in the open as opposed to meeting in secret due to unforseen circumstances.  The proposal under the tree was very anti-climatic to her because of this. In the book/Dalton versions you are feeling Jane's anguish right up until the time he makes her finally open up and express her feelings for him.  Up until then you aren't sure if he is getting married or not.  When Jane struggles with him under the tree in this version, it's almost pointless as they already have pretty much let the other know their feelings due to their established companionship.      I had to LAUGH OUT LOUD at this portrayal of Bertha.  The book had her practically running around on all fours like a beast with her hair a tangled mess (as did the Dalton version), but this version had a very lovely Bertha who had a temper tantrum at the end. No where near the look and lunacy portrayed in the book in order that you could truly sympathize with the plight of Mr. Rochester trying to find happiness in a plain governess who had a gentle spirit and light about her.    I thought Ruth Wilson's acting was very good as she worked with the script she was given.  Her Jane called for Jane's outward expressions and actions to be far more assertive and impertinent than that of the time period and the book's Jane Eyre. For the most part, the book's Jane's inner thoughts were very passionate and not said aloud until the proposal scene, hence his painstaking attempts to draw her out.  With that said, she worked the adaptation she was given quite well.     Also in this version, the gypsy scene appeared more as a simple joke played on all of the guests as opposed to what it truly was in the book and Dalton version - a plot by Mr. Rochester to draw out Jane's feelings for him in order to help her realize that outside of her stubborness and self-preservation, happiness was within her reach.  The dialogue in the book and Dalton scene spoke volumes as to how he truly recognized Jane's deeply conditioned thinking of being unworthy of happiness and reciprocated love.  It truly is an unforgettable scene due to the depth of the conversation and the humorous depths he sank to get into her head and have her express herself. The gypsy scene also was a way to expose Blanche Ingram for the \\"mercenary\\"  she actually was. The book and Dalton's Mr. Rochester is much more of a scoundrel with a heart. This one already appears to be \\"saved\\" and not really seen as a scoundrel. He's more of a man whose had a few bad breaks and easily redeemable.     Although as someone else alluded to, the physcial scenes are very harmless when generally speaking of Hollywood standards today, they are still SORELY misplaced in the Jane Eyre scheme of things.  The movie studios for some reason do not \\"get\\" there can be passion without laying on top of one another which would have never happened with the book's Jane character for the sake of righteousness and not flaming her own raging feelings. In that regard, I feel the studios do not have faith in their viewing audience to clearly see the underlying passions building up with looks and words exchanged between the two.  Can you imagine if the studios took such liberties with Pride and Prejudice and showed Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy doing that? Elizabeth was far more bold and assertive than Jane, yet they have Jane doing just that in this version while in a closed room, then outside on the lawn before marriage.  Jane Eyre? It would never happen... although the reader/viewer would know she'd wish it. Oh well.    I guess the most positive thing I can say is the acting is top-notch and it's better than the other versions outside of the Dalton/Clarke adaptation - which still remains my favorite at this time.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|The 1st Underworld was a brilliantly done film.  It had a unique story and I loved how it ended leaving me wanting more.  However, Underworld Evolution left much to be desired in the story department.  Many horror fans claimed that the 1st Underworld didn't have enough action and had too much dialogue.  Underworld Evolution didn't have much of a story and  had far too much gore.  It wasn't as good as the 1st film, still I think that Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and she makes the film watchable.

Stop whatever you are reading and read this book rigth now. Clearly written, on personal and very interesting tone, when I finished reading this I realized that what was there - all about IBM - was pretty applicable to any kind of bussiness. From Spaceshuttles to ethylene plants and hotdog sellers. <br />OK, maybe not for hotdog sellers.

B000092ZYX|4.0|This is a very good album. The thing I appreciate about it, is that it's a bit more accessible than Kid A and Amnesiac. Those albums are good, no question, especially Kid A. But it's very hard to get into and I have to be in a certain mood to listen to them. With \\"Hail To The Thief\\" Radiohead continues with their experimentation. Overall, this is a more upbeat album than either Kid A/Amnesiac. Overall though, it's not drastically different from what they have done before. So it could feel like just another Radiohead album. But dismissing it as that would be a mistake, there are some very strong tracks on here, and I personally feel that this is their best album since OK Computer.<br /><br />If your new to Radiohead, I probably wouldn't start here, not that you couldn't. My personal opinion is that you should start with early Radiohead and work your way forward as they progress with their sound. But if you want to start here, there is nothing wrong with it and you'll find a very strong and enjoyable album within. It's certainly one of my personal favorite Radiohead albums.
B000J103YI|4.0|This is a great soundtrack and I recommend purchase.  The movie was also great and I applaud the singing efforts.  I must say that Jennifer Hudson is surely a natural.  WOW!  Golden Globe winner and Academy Award nomination.  Jennifer is surely on her way on becoming a big star...let's hope she has the right management and support to steer her in that direction.  Her rendition of \\"And I am Telling You I'm not going\\" was really great...of course she couldn't duplicate the original version, but she made the song her own and did a great job.  I think almost everyone did a great job in this movie...Jamie Foxx, Anika Noni Rose, Eddie Murphie, Keith Robinson and Sharon Leal.  In my opinion, Beyonce's acting performance was just okay compared to her other roles because I really think she cannot act.  Beyonce dazzles on stage and is a great singer, but she's surely not an actress.  However, I do commend her on her singing performances.  Overall, the soundtrack and the movie is great.  The cast SHINES. <br />
074356619X|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to \\"The Secret\\" on cd. I own the DVD but have found the CD book much more helpful since I can listen to it anywhere, any time. I also really like listening to Rhonda Byrne. She is not featured too much on the DVD. I highly recommend this product in addition to the DVD. The more you listen, the easier it is to incorporate the principles into your life.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This CD is absolutely enjoyable. Has many old favorites and the sound is wonderful. You should definately buy it.
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|Este es uno de esos CD's que lo he comprado por pura curiosidad, y vaya que resulto una agradable sorpresa!  La creatividad compositiva de Arjen es impresionante, este disco cuenta con el equilibrio justo y necesario de la presencia de los instrumentos, y la tem&aacute;tica lirica del disco unido a los sonidos realmente te transporta a una dimensi&oacute;n musical diferente.<br /><br />Tecnicamente la guitarra de Arjen suena impecable!! y la producci&oacute;n del disco orilla la perfecci&oacute;n. Si eres de esos que disfrutan de la musica experimental con inclinaci&oacute;n al metal, no debe faltar este material en tu colecci&oacute;n, os aseguro que no se arrepentir&aacute;n!!
0440539811|5.0|I was loaned the three installments of this trilogy way back in 1990. At that time i had never heard of Robert Anton Wilson and didnt know about 90% of the content of these books, but... Since reading the trilogy my third eye was squeegied clean and the intellectual journey that it has taken me on has been a wonderful experience that is still on going. Of course once i had read the book i had to own it and have since purchased many of his other works, which i read and re-read. In short this book is better than the bible, by far my favourite novel of all time and well worth the read, as long as you have an open mind to magik, sex, anarchy, religion and mythology. If you don't then i wouldn't bother because it will probably freak you out. By the way the great man died recently, i for one am greatly sadened because he was one of the greats. R.A.W.

B00008GKEG|5.0|waited almost 3 weeks to get this shipped to me...the wait killed me, but it was totally worth it. could get a little repetitive for a normal person...but for a true Beatlemanic, it's a must-have. LOVE IT!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I am so excited and so thrilled, they are finally here. I remember when I was in high school when 90210 came on Tv and every week me and my Mom sad down to watch. Now I get under a warm blanket and watch it all over again. Can't wait to collect them all. <br />Just wish the Seasons would come out sooner, rather than wait 2-3 months for another season to come. <br /> <br />Thank you for those that make it happen and the fans can get them on DVD.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I was dissappointed with Not Too Late. Too blend, boring at times. I do really believe that Norah is great at live performances. But not at home, or in the car listening to her CDs..definitely not this new CD.
B0000025DT|5.0|If It Was Me On A Desert Island. This And Brad Pitt Would Be Heaven. I wore out my record stylus playing it in the 70's while in high school. Everything said about 70's music does not apply to ELO. I was there and this was a revelation.  <br /> <br />Perfect Perfect Perfect
1594200823|5.0|What a fascinating book!  Anyone reading this book will have a new conceptual understanding of the food system in America and will certainly know more about corn than they thought possible. <br /> <br />The description of how corn reproduces is amazing as is how it became linked with man. \\"Looked at another way, corn was the first plant to involve humans so intimately in its sex life.  For a species whose survival depends on how well it can gratify the ever shifting desires of its only sponsor, this has proved to be an excellent evolutionary strategy.\\" <br /> <br />I loved the quote by Joel Salatin, the farmer who owns Polyface Farm. <br />\\"'You know what the best kind of organic certification would be?  Make an unannounced visit to a farm and take a good long look at the farmer's bookshelf.  Because what you're feeding your emotions and thoughts is what this is really all about. The way I produce a chicken is an extension of my world view.  You can learn more about that by seeing what's sitting on my bookshelf than having me fill out a whole bunch of forms.'\\" <br /> <br />\\"I asked him what was on his bookshelf.  J.I. Rodale, Sir Albert Howard, Aldo Leopold, Wes Jackson, Wendell Berry, Louis Bromfield.  The classic texts of organic agriculture and American agrarianism.\\" <br /> <br />Joel's description of his knowledge of the cycle of nature on his farm and how to use it to the best advantage was also fascinating and inspiring. <br />\\"Joel pulled a single blade of orchard grass, showing me exactly where a cow had sheared it the week before, and pointing out the finger of fresh green growth that had emerged from the cut in the days since.  The blade was a kind of time line, sharply demarcated between the dark growth predating the bite,and the bright green blade coming after it. 'That's the blaze of growth, right there.  I'd says this paddock will be ready for the cows to come back in three or four more days.'\\" <br /> <br />I highly recommend this easily readable fascinating important book. <br /> <br />
B000N3T0DW|5.0|The Rise of Cruz<br /><br />This film @ 121 minutes passes much too quickly. Director Pedro Alamodovar, riding high on his last three hits; BAD EDUCATION (2004), TALK TO HER (2002), and ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (1999), delivers again. Alamodovar has been called,\\"the most internationally acclaimed Spanish director since Luis Buneul\\", and with this film he has soared to new heights, getting award-winning performance from the entire, mostly female cast. At Cannes , the actresses were all given the \\"Best Female Ensemble Cast\\" award. Alamodovar won an award for \\"Best Screenplay\\". Penelope Cruz has been nominated for an Oscar in the Best Actress category. She won a Golden Globe a few weeks ago as \\"Best Actress\\", and the film won as \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\".<br /><br />The director has given us a fantastic tale well told, a story of a \\"dead\\" mother, a dying aunt, childhood friends, sibling rivalry, two very different sisters, a granddaughter, several abusive philandering womanizing husbands and fathers -modern Madrid with its vibrant pace blurring poverty and struggle -a small village in La Mancha where the family grew up, where the widows all gather one day a month and scour and clean the tombstones together, singing and scrubbing amongst their flowers, a constant wind that blows both ill will and power to people and to the thrashing windmills that dot the barren landscape; a place where superstitious people believe in ghosts and curses and the frailty of human nature. Yes there are many dark secrets to be told through tears, and there are sordid touches of homicide, molestation, adultery, incest, and abandonment, fraught with unspoken unrevealed familial pain that has been harbored much too long -all told with the unblinking and colorful eye and lens of Alamodovar, somehow bringing us wondrous closure and logic to a minefield of absurdity.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz as Raimunda has never been lovelier or more effective as an actress -sporting a Sophia Loren more ample bosom and padded bottom. Like Loren in De Sica's LA CIOCIADA (TWO WOMEN) (1960), Cruz sails through the full spectrum of emotions, dealing with incredibly stressful and tragic circumstances with the aplomb of an earth mother; sexy, charming, beguiling, and yet still so very vulnerable. For those of you who have only seen Cruz in American films, this performance is not the pale Cruz-lite, the Mrs. Cruise of films of yore -no, this is a much more powerful Penelope, who will shock you as you fall in love with her, and tease you as she holds your heart in her hands.<br /><br />Carmen Maura as Irene, the mother, was likewise wonderful. She is one of those Spanish grand dames that have been making films there since she was younger than Cruz, 110 films since 1969. She is only 63 years old, and does this incredible job of appearing much older. I don't think there was one bad performance in the film. Lela Duerra as Sole, the younger sister was delicious in all her idiosyncrasies. Yohana Cobo as the daughter of Raimunda, and the granddaughter was perfectly petulant, moving through the miasma of plot changes with appropriate teen angst, warmth, and wonder. Blanca Portillo found just the right notes of loyalty, kindness, terror, and pathos for her Augustina..

B000KGGLCU|5.0|<br />The NBC version was a travesty. It was chopped up to accomodate a billion commercials, with up to 5 minutes or more between songs.  Then we all had to be deprived of \\"Live To Tell\\" because of some sanctimonious station managers who refused to air it (though, I should note, those same managers have no problem airing violent programming). No wonder the broadcast bombed! <br /> <br />I saw Confessions live and didnt think it was as good as her last one, but even so this DVD is fantastic.  The concert is beautifully filmed, and sounds great blasting through a good set of speakers.  And \\"Live To Tell\\" is fully intact, and features some gorgeous close-ups of Madonna as she's singing.   <br /> <br />There is also a good (if short) behind-the-scenes doc, filmed at the rehearsals, that conveys just how much grind and sweat goes into pulling off a production like this.   <br /> <br />Only quibble:  the selection on the CD is puzzling.  They should have included the lovely \\"Paradise\\" (heck, it's better than the original album version!). <br /> <br />
0142406112|5.0|Fourteen-year-old Alex Rider knows something bad has happened when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night. He soon learns that his caretaker uncle, Ian Rider, was killed in an automobile accident on his way home. A banker who works for Royal & General, Alex's uncle was a fine man who wasn't home much--but he's still devastated by his death. Except the appearance of some strange people who claim to be his uncle's co-workers, a gun-toting man at his uncle's funeral, and the findings of his uncle's bullet-ridden car make Alex think that there's more than meets the eye to the \\"automobile accident\\" story.<br /><br />Alex soon finds out that his Uncle Ian's life, at least where he himself was concerned, was based on a lie. Ian Rider was a spy, employed by the Special Operations Division of MI6. And the last case he was working on, concerning multi-millionaire Herod Sayle, was a case that got Ian Rider killed. Now Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Jones, head of SOD, want Alex to pick up where his uncle, their operative, left off--infiltrate the compound where Herod Sayle is building his new Stormbreaker computers, and find out what Ian Rider had to die for.<br /><br />What follows is an action-packed story of danger, bullets, viruses, and out-and-out excitement. At fourteen, Alex is savvy, trained in martial arts, can speak multiple languages, and is, in fact, a truly bliddy good spy!<br /><br />Anthony Horowitz has devised a real winner with Alex Rider and his new career (although he was actually forced into working for MI6), and I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see what mission Alex will be sent on next!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jennifer Wardrip, aka \\"The Genius\\"
B000AP04OM|4.0|When I was a kid, this was one of the few videotapes we owned.  And because we didn't have cable either, we watched this about 2.5 million times over.  I could probably write out the script of this movie while wearing a blindfold locked in a closet.... underwater.  Didn't this movie win some kinda award?  Well all I know is the music drives me insane.  2.5 million times is a lot to hear/see anything.  It IS a good movie and if you've never seen it before you really should, as it has some roots in true events.  Just be wary - your head may explode with all that high-pitched singing...
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is a brilliant man and this book shows why. He has nothing but contempt for religious doctrine, believing it corrupts our rational mind. He dissects the arguments for the existence of a supernatural being and demonstrates that they have no substance. Dawkins compiles a list of pernicious acts that religion is responsible for (e.g. 9-11, 7-7, Northern Ireland, etc..). Dawkins makes a powerful case for reason and secularism.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that Dawkins does not consider the good religion does in this world (e.g. Christian charities, missionaries in the Third World, etc..) This omission makes the book incomplete, at least for me. It's unfair to only consider the evil religion is responsible for while ignoring the positives.<br /><br />The last paragraph notwithstanding, I still highly recommend The God Delusion
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|All I can say is wow! I felt all of the emotions when watching this masterpiece. Ruth Wilson was feisty & courageous in her role as Jane, & Toby Stephans was perfect in his role as Rochester though maybe a bit too handsome for the role (oh the torture).  Both actors had amazing chemistry & the scenery was breath-taking, I cried when she had her heart broken & was disallusioned/devastated after finding out Rochestor withheld information about his insane wife & past.  Anyone who has lived has felt or lived some of these same feelings, from betrayal, disallusionment, to injustice, devastation despair & heartache (like Jane felt on those moors) to recovery, forgiveness, joy & deep love. A deeply moving story, well acted & very well done. I loved that Rochester realized the precious pearl he had in Jane even after all the pain they shared, they were able to overcome it & renew their love & devotion to one another. Don't we all wish we could make others see how simple forgiveness & uncondtional love is. I am going to buy this for myself as a belated birthday gift, it makes me cry alot, but it also makes me cheer for true love, endurance & feistyness, & it makes me feel almost every emotion deeply which is the sign of a excellent film or book.I could go on and on about how wonderful this version of Jane Eyre is just see it & enjoy it for yourself.
B00008WT5M|4.0|Ac/Dc had recently released 'Blow Up Your Video' which had garnered a bit of a buzz especially from 2 great videos but the sales were still not up to what they were in the early 80s so they did what on paper seemed to be a very smart idea,they hired THE best rock producer in the business,Bruce Fairbairn who had rescued Bon Jovi,Aerosmith,and others with smash hits...heck,I would have done the exact same thing in their shoes,and did it work? Well,yes and no.The razor's edge did sell quite a bit more then the past few releases,especially powered by the lead off single 'Thunderstruck'<br /><br />and the songwriting did improve tremendously on this release while still not selling out the blues based rock style that got them to the party in the first place..songs like 'Moneytalks''Are You Ready', 'Let's Make It' 'Got You By The Balls' and my personal fave 'Mistress For Christmas' show that they have all the power and fire that they did way back for their ultimate release 'Back In Black' yes,those songs are that good,the lyrics are still as sexually charged as ever,Angus can still play lead right up there with the best of the best and nobody alive can scream like Brian Johnson...but..something just doesn't feel right with this release...if you listen to the songs by themselves one at a time,they are just about perfect,but when you listen to the CD from start to finish it feels so bare bones,so for a lack of better word 'empty' I'm sure this was intentionally done,the band did not want people to say they had gotten too polished,but it makes the CD kind of hard to listen to from start to finish,there isn't a lot of warmth...maybe that's just me...but especially towards the end of the CD I always find myself looking at the CD case to see how much longer I have to go 'till it's over..it's just too similar,to o dry sounding the whole way through....I think basically aside from the production being dry the last two songs really bring it down (a problem that Ac/Dc had on almost every release)<br /><br />The CD opens with 'Thunderstruck' a modern day classic,couldn't ask for a better way to open the album...from there 'Fire Your Guns' almost shouting to the world that they are back as strong as ever...'Moneytalks' brilliant lyrics,and extremely catchy music make this one very strong..the title cut 'The Razors Edge' full of dark atmosphere,reminds me in a lot of ways of the feel of 'Nightstalker' from Highway To Hell..but it seems to be lacking the same warmth ..from there 'Mistress For Christmas' almost every guy in the world would love the lyrics to this one..it's one of my favorite holiday tunes and is my personal favorite from this one...'Rock Your Heart Out' is another great catchy song...'Are You Ready' is just one word..power..awesome tune,one of their best ever,would be perfect to open up concerts with..from there 'Got You By The Balls' again the lyrics are perfect...I think they took more time with lyrics on this release then any album they ever did,and it shows,catchy music too...'Shot Of Love' catchy but not one of my favorites...'Let's Make It' perfect song for girls to dance to,so that gets thumbs up from me...'Goodbye & Good Riddance To Bad Luck' and 'If You Dare' I think they just threw those two songs to fill out the CD,but if they left 'em off (or maybe threw 'em onto a box set as unreleased tunes) it would have been better,it really drags the whole CD down at the end...all this being said,I originally was going to give this a 3 star rating but I've changed my mind and give it a 4 star rating...there are many many great songs,some of the best in their career,I just don't care for the overall tone,I wish they would re-release this one with a warmer feel...it feels very sterile..but overall a great CD and truly a comeback!<br /><br />The Upside - perhaps the best lyric work they've ever done...the style of great blues tinged rock continues,but with a lot more attention to songwriting.They have done a great job of putting together some classic tunes.<br /><br />The Downside - the last two songs,aside from that it's perfect aside from feeling a little bare.<br /><br />The Bottom Line - This should definitely be in your collection. You are not likely to find a collection of songs this good on almost any band's CD.Some great hits are here,some incredibly catchy songs with great lyrics and my favorite holiday song are all here...if you are new to the band I'd start with Highway To Hell,Back In Black,and Dirty Deeds,but then you should definitely check this out..and all hard core fans of Ac/Dc should definitely have this...this is some of the best work...go out and buy this the donutman says so!!!er some classic tunes. <br /> <br />The Downside - the last two songs,aside from that it's perfect aside from feeling a little bare. <br /> <br />The Bottom Line - This should definitely be in your collection.

B00000JZI9|5.0|This was a great Western.  Very creative and adventerous,  and a wonderful cast.  Where else would you see a Monty Python alum as a sheriff in a Western?<br /><br />This movie featured three of my favorite actors:  Scott Glenn, Brian Dennehy, and Jeff Goldblum.  It also featured one of my favorite actresses, Rosanna Arquette, though she had such a small role even the worst actress couldn't mess that role up.  Kevin Costner had a youthful exhuberance that I hadn't seen since from him.  And I'm just mentioning my favorites.<br /><br />I'll stop before I spoil any surprises.  If you want a classic western, this is one.
0736063684|5.0|I owned the first edition of this book at one time, and I kicked myself for selling it when I finally joined a gym and started working out on a regular basis.  This edition is an indispensable reference for planning your workouts.  It is conveniently divided into seven parts, so it's possible to exercise almost every one of your muscles in a week.  The drawings show you which exercises and angles work which muscles, variations of common lifts, and all muscles in each exercise are individually labeled. <br /> <br />The difference between the first and second editions is noticeable, but the update is not significant enough for me to recommend that owners of the first edition buy this second edition.  The new features include some information on the differences between men's and women's bodies as well as differences among all people.  For example, your friend might be able to lift a weight in a certain way, but the structures of your elbows force you to lift the weight in a modified form.  Along with this acknowledgement of different body types and shapes comes more information on safety with regard to muscle and tendon tears. <br /> <br />If you need help with your weightlifting form, need tips for lifting weights safely, or you are simply interested in how the human body bears weight, this is a great book for you, indeed.
0786867973|5.0|I bought this book about six months ago, and I find myself turning to it more often than any other cookbook in my vast collection!  My favorite recipe in the entire book has to be the Cheese Onion Potato Pie recipe; by modifying it ever so slightly (baking it as a single standard-size pie rather than as individual pies) it becomes even easier, and by adding a baked ham and a fruit salad, you simply could not ask for a better brunch dish.  The Steamed Syrup Sponge sounded like the culinary equivalent of a kamikaze mission, but I was so intrigued by it I simply had to attempt it.  I was very happy I did; like many recipes in the book (ie, the divine Chocolate-Cherry Cupcakes), it sounds intimidating yet turned out to be incredibly easy to make.   <br /> <br />I think my favorite aspect of the book is how it's filled with recipes that one need not be a professional chef to attempt.  The recipes are at once comfortingly familiar so as not to be intimidating and intriguingly exotic which makes one feel inordinately competent when they turn out well, with many of them falling under the 'why-didn't-I-think-of-that?' category (ie, the dangerously wonderful Vanilla Fudge).  Give this book a whirl; you won't be disappointed!
B000K7UBTI|4.0|I thought this was a great movie.  I actually thought that this was the better of all the recent animated features from marvel that I know own.   The art was great and so was the storyline.  I think the negative reviews that I have read from this movie are just that some people are never satisfied.  Yes they did change some things about his origin but so what.  It shows that Tony/Iron Man is just a very intelligent man in a suit.  He is a knight for all this movies shows.  I think marvel has a great thing goin with these animated series.  I myself have found some of the movies a bit disappointing and with these features you get a better chance at nailing the animated series.     Hey marvel I hope you guys work on some Xmen ones soon.  You guys need to make up for Xmen 3. lol.

0780622553|4.0|One of the most pervasive cinematic formulas is film noir.  There's something intriguing about a dark urban landscape, about characters who pose and speak profoundly, about plots that always involve murder and mystery, and of course, about beautiful women.  Dark City is a noir machine, literally.  It exposes the world as manufactured, genre and artistic formulae as constructed from bits and pieces of the real world. <br /> <br />Many American dreams and nightmares seem to merge in noir.  I think Dark City also shows that science fiction captures the imagination much like noir.  Science fiction allows us to explore unknown horrors as well as unknown hopes.  It's rare for a film to be working on so many levels. <br /> <br />If you aren't interested in the genres Dark City is working with, you might be missing a good chunk of the film, but you could still enjoy the variation on the \\"last man alive\\" plot.  The movie does an excellent job of placing the viewer in the position of the protagonist. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Kiefer Sutherland's performance as the mad scientist is a bit over the top.  He takes you out of the film and you feel like you are watching Sutherland be weird and not an actual character. <br /> <br />The DVD version has commentary by Roger Ebert.  The only other film Ebert has done commentary for is Citizen Kane, so he thinks rather highly of Dark City.  I do, too.
0060555661|5.0|A must read for all investors.<br />This is a new addition of a book written over 30 years ago and it is as valid and important today as it was then.  This particular revised edition contains commentary by Jason Zweig, and I would recommend that you read this version above any of the previous ones.  Mr. Zweig brings the material up to date and shows why the book is as valid today as it was when it was written.  He also shows that people do not seem to learn by previous mistakes, making the same ones over and over again.<br /><br />Graham is the chief proponent of value investing, which is investing based on the value of the security.

Also, there are different variations of this equation (see The Motley Fool, [...]<br /><br />This book describes investment vs. speculation, effects of inflation, portfolio management, security analysis, investments in bonds and convertible issues, and much, much more.  This book has been cited as the bible of value investing by the likes of Warren Buffett (who wrote a preface and an appendix of the revised edition).  You can't go wrong if you read this book, but be forewarned it is about 600 pages long and therefore requires some commitment, a commitment that should be amply rewarded.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|It's hard to not be a little nostalgic when reviewing an artists  <br />last album before their death but then again it's hard not to be  <br />nostalgic when reviewing anything by joe strummer. Five years  <br />since his passing I still believe this is his best solo effort.  <br />The fact that it wasn't finished makes me wonder what more it  <br />could have been. Strummer was one of those few voices that  <br />seemed to speak to the whole world,a rare voice we need now  <br />more than ever. Keeps you a little more sane doesn't it?
B000244FDW|5.0|For me, this is the version that is truest to the novel, with wonderful casting and dialogue straight out of the book. I love this video!
B000J6I0PM|4.0|One of the best acoustic sessions ever performed by a rock band.  Hands down, the Foo Fighters are an accomplished band and they demonstrate it during this show.  Many of the classics like \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Everlong\\" were just meant to be played acoustically.  A few other of my favorites include \\"February Stars\\", \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\", and \\"Big Me\\", which were given a complete different dimension in comparison to their \\"plugged\\" versions.   <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed it, the Foo Fighters are real musicians, and their audience are people who love music.  To complain about a dirty word or two, does not reflect in the quality of this product.  Guaranteed!
B00005MP58|5.0|This version is very enjoyable, but does not follow the novel exactly. The casting is good, and the production is more lavish than others.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This could be such a cute movie for all ages if the grampa would clean up his mouth, his nose, and his library. Don't missunderstand, because I thought the movie was hilarious. National Lampoon meets RV, and crashes into Cinderella, then rolls over the 40 Year Old Virgin.
B000784WMW|5.0|To me, this is the quintessential version of the novel, with dialogue taken directly from the book. In my opinion, Timothy Dalton is the best Mr. Rochester ever! My only complaint is that the section dealing with Jane's life after she leaves Rochester omits some important parts of the book. Great video!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have only ever seen one other concert dvd/vhs that actually gave me the true feeling I was really there and that was the Pulse VHS/DVD of Pink Floyd in concert. This Madonna DVD of the Confessions Tour is INCREDIBLE! The sound and the picture quality, and most important of all, the performance is EXCELLENT!! Much better than the NBC broadcast...The stage performance, the dancers, the clothes, the lights, THE MAGIC!Plus you get to see the  scene (in full) for the controversal performance of Live To Tell, and you'll see that the crucifixion scene was not the bad thing the media made it out to be....its her way of showing us that Jesus suffers when suffering children suffer. All you have to do is read the screen during the performance.  No different than wearing a cross necklace. Plus you'll see much more of the show itself on the DVD than NBC showed.The CD sounds GREAT for a live cd!! Buy it! You'll love it! Good price for BOTH a cd & two hour concert DVD !
0618680004|3.0|Richard Dawkins is getting old. As may great writers, at the end of his life (hope not soon anyway), he is tells us moral lessons and shows us his \\"utopia\\". This book does not do any good to the cause of atheism. <br /> <br />I'm still a hard-line atheist after reading Dawkins book, but I never thought he could have on me the very reverse efect of what he intends. <br /> <br />Chapters one to five are more than fine. As usual with Dawkins books. Then he enters the moral lessons and he misses the point. First, he keeps insisting in attacking extreme or fundamentalist religious people, showing many examples of radical and nonsense attitudes from here and there. But we don't need to debunk those. That is easy. Most religious eople would agree with Dawkins, except for the tone. Then, he blames moderate religion for the existence and growing influence of radicalism. I don't think this is fair (I can't believe I'm defending religious people now!). There have been murders of doctors by anti-abortion groups, but blaming moderate religious people for that crime is also extremism on his side. He should then blame also the ecology movement for any acts of eco-terrorism, shoudln't he? <br /> <br />The moral lessons about abortion are disgusting. The fact that I'm an atheist does not prevent me to feel that killing a just born (I said born, 9 months after conception) is horrifiyng and morally reprobable. Following Dawkins reasoning, this would be like killing a cow, for the baby does not have past experiences, or plans, and the suffering-meter would signal even a lower value. Dawkins insists on this point, and now I understand the religious people fear that atheism would lead to a complete loss of moral values.  <br /> <br />There is a chapter devoted to the evils of indoctrination. Certainly indoctrination causes harm, but the anectotal and exagerated references presented cause a loss of credibility. I was born in Spain, all my friends and me have gone through catholic indoctrination, and none of them needs phychiatric attention. Dawkins devotes this chapter to make us understand how bad have to feel the people that really believe in hell, and the next one to explain that in reality, nobody believes in \\"after life\\". That is the point: in reality nobody believes in hell also!. <br /> <br />In western countries we have tamed religion and for all practical purposes an atheist and a Catholic are indistinguisable, except during sunday morning. The real problem is not Catholicism (condoms use in 3rd world countries aside) or religion in general, but Islam. It is Islam, the 11th Sept events and the Middle East situation that have sparkled this rage agaist religion, but why to put them all in the same box? We should be honest and point to Islam, not to religion. <br /> <br />For a brilliant and ponderated view on this topic, get \\"The Blank Slate\\", by Steven Pinker.
6305784116|5.0|If, after watching this movie, you don't want to be a cat, then there's something wrong with you.  I have loved this movie since I was a little girl and it's one of those movies that you will always remember the songs and the characters.  Bambi and Dumbo made me cry, but The Aristocats made me laugh and sing.  Great movie for all ages!
B000002AGE|5.0|Quite possibly one of the best recordings by Weather Report because of the addition of Jaco Pastorious who added new dimensions to \\"Heavy Weather\\". Jaco played the bass like many jazz musicians play the sax, following the lines but delving into improvisational bliss. His style defied defintion but suffice to say he was a master at his trade and a trail blazer; too bad his time ended much to soon to fully explore his depth of soul. The opening track, \\"Birdland,\\" is very different from other versions you may have heard because of the fine arrangements by Joe Zawinul. Zawinul lulls his audience in with his expertise as he floats from acoustic to electric piano then over to sythnisizer while you sit in amazement at the textures of overlaping sounds. Many of the songs are mellow with Wayne Shorter contributing  just enough to highlight his sax in contrast to Jaco's bass underlying the rhythm that can break into a solo at any moment. The term world music can apply to this synthesis of sounds on \\"Heavy Weather\\" that has jazz-rock elements. For example,the song \\"Rumba Mama\\" is a pefect early lesson in the merging of cultural sounds with heavy percussion and eclectic diverse sounds integrating into one cohesive piece of music. The voluminous textures are a thing of beauty. This is indeed spacial Heavy Weather and should not be missed this time around.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is by far the best album they have put out yet.  This should be a grammy winner.  It would even be liked by those who are not close Peppers fans. <br />
B00000DAFP|5.0|Strange that it may sound, I kept my copy of \\"Deuce\\" unopened and slotted with my other Rory Gallagher CDs for a year before I could listen. I had last heard \\"Deuce\\" on vinyl quite some years ago, and the opening chords of I'm Not Awake ushered me back to my college days and debates with my friends about the merits of Mr. Gallagher's guitar mastery. The energy that flows from this music crackles, whether Mr. Gallagher is playing acoustic blues, coaxing magic from his slide, or wringing out just the right amount of feedback.<br /><br />The dark, edginess of his first solo release have receded (though I love that CD for other reasons), and \\"Deuce\\" pretty much set the stage for how Mr. Gallagher's later catalog of recordings would be structured, intermixing blistering power riffs from tracks such as Crest of a Wave and In Your Town with plaintive blues songs such as Don't Know Where I'm Going and Should've learned my Lesson.<br /><br />His stalwart sidekicks from the early days, Gerry McAvoy on bass and Wilgnar Campbell on drums, generate the rhythm that sets the course, keeping things down to earth and lively. (Mr. McAvoy played bass with Rory till the end.)<br /><br />This remastered CD sounds clear and free from the technical problems that have marred some of the others. That clean sound, a fine bonus track called Persuasion, and expanded liner notes are enough to justify replacing older copies of this CD<br /><br />It seems that many folks tend to disregard Rory Gallagher but anyone who takes the time to listen will appreciate how fine a talent we lost in June 1995.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Superb Show, Ive heard the CD, and about to watch the DVD. Its great to have an entire Live CD from Madonna. Question, No one has mentioned in the song \\"I Love New York\\" her change of lines when she tells the Audience what they can do when they go to Texas. I will not repeat them on this posting, for the under 18 crowd!!! And to think, The Dixie Chicks careers were almost ruined for comments that were G rated compared to Madonnas X Rated!!! What did everyone think of these new lines??  They were bleeped by NBC, But the CD is Loud and Clear!! Will she suffer any backlash from Critics???????
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book! I listened to it on CD read by Elizabeth Gilbert, and am now buying the hardcopy for me to keep and a paperback to lend out. Maybe it came at the right time in my life but it was COMPLETELY mind changing. This book was very spiritual for me. I cannot say enough good things about it!
B0006Z2LH4|2.0|If you found your way to this movie you probably watched the original Cube. What a great movie that was. People getting chopped up in interesting ways, the isolation, desperation, group dynamics, sci-fi big brother element, and the whole metaphor for modern life elements. Wow.<br /><br />However, riding on that success was Cube 2: hypercube, which in my mind was only good in so much as it explained things about this history of the Cube.<br /><br />So now there is Cube Zero. If you made it through the first Cube (pun intended), and through Hypercube, watch this. However, in my mind this is the most silly, almost \\"Brazil\\" like in it's dumb characters and lines, and technology used. I don't want to give anything away, but trust me, keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy it if you saw the others. However, if you've never watched the original, OR if you did and didn't like it, stay well clear of this movie...go watch something else. Maybe Fight Club, or if you want some sci-fi, Equlibrium (that movie should have gotten more attention in my opinion). Good luck and hope you wake up where you went to sleep.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Though there are some very good performances here, I must say I was very disappointed with this movie. And when I assumed it was more family oriented, that all flew out the window when the \\"R\\" rating appeared. Dysfunctional is hardly the word. A psychotic mess better suits this family. The jumpstarting VW bus was about the most humorous part of the film. Hardly deserving of an Academy Award Best Picture nomination in my opinion though.
0553131001|5.0|This piece is ultimate Steinbeck.  The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones.  The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly.  The reader feels so very sorry for George.  George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged.  This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it.  The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about \\" a stranger killing my old dog\\" are so very sad!  One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does.  This is a beautiful book!
B00005JPD0|5.0|On my way into the theatre, the guy in front of me hollared to his friend that he has seen it before and you have to wait until the end to have it make sense.  He was right. <br /> <br />If you like movies whose ending pulls together all subplots and even minor details, you'll get the pay-off with this one.  I prefer movies which offer varied subplots, if the director and script writer make it work.  This one delivers, and will twist your mind on the journey. <br /> <br />Mid-movie, we find out that we're watching a time-travel movie.  Yes, the thought came to mind that the story writer had recently watched Timecop (man goes back in time to try to ... well, I won't spoil it any more than that). <br /> <br />What I didn't like was that I also felt like the director had recently watched The Forgotten.  Deja Vu has that same kind of out-of-the-blue mid-movie genre twist into scifi.  I think that's cheap. <br /> <br />The other thing I did not like was the overuse of shaky-camera stuff.  Thankfully, that annoyingly vogue style of filming is utilized less in the second half of the movie.  I think it is a cheezy way of making the viewer think that frantic action is occuring.  I'd rather see clever scene delivery and truly captivating action.  It's better to create real tension rather than merely make the viewer feel that if you don't fixate on the screen, you'll miss something important. <br /> <br />Overall, a top-drawer film... one of Denzel's best!
B000K4X5XA|4.0|This is a tough one to review.  For a film made in 1978, I don't think it could look any better.  I'm willing to bet this Blu-ray disc is as good if not better than the premiere screening of Superman back in 78.  Great care must have been taken to clean up and restore this picture.  It is practically free of scratches and dirt.  It is detailed, far above standard definition.  Colors are balanced and eye catching.  Contrast is natural and evenly spread.  Inserted scenes are consistent with the rest of the film.  Never looked better.  Still, 1978.  There are a few scenes with plenty of grain and most of the film gives the impression of being a little out of focus, a little blurred.  Five star transfer, four star visual impact.  I doubt if a 1080p display is getting much more out of this picture than a 720p display.   <br /> <br />(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\") <br />
1881273156|5.0|As a counselor who works with a lot of couples who struggle in their relationship, I can readily climb on the bandwagon praising this book. Every so often a book comes along with a simple, useful premise that can make you think \\"hey, that's right!\\" and truly change your approach to a complicated subject. The concept of the five love languages has helped me assist many couples to unscramble some seemingly insolvable problems in their relationship.  While it's not a cure-all (what is?) it can bring a lot of practical benefit in a relatively short period of time.  If you happen to be in couples counseling it would be a good idea to gently ask if your counselor has read this approach and suggest they pick up a copy if they haven't yet done so. They'll probably thank you for it.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera has been the premier demo disk for High Definition TVs and Projectors for some time now.  When trying to show off, at various trade shows, not only the detail but the contrast of a new product the HD-DVD of The Phantom of the Opera would always find its way on screen.  Now we have it on Blu-ray, the same encoding in fact.  It isn't just the transfer, near perfect, which makes this disc such a treat but the lavishness of the film itself.  Rich colors, ornate details, vibrant bright scenes next to detailed dark ones; a sense of depth is throughout this musical.  What little film grain there is is in keeping with a perfectly maintained film source.  This is a top shelf Blu-ray release that will bring out the full range of color and contrast that your TV can display.    (PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\")
B000HT386M|5.0|A very pleasant surprise, Click, is a movie that brings to the screen the story of a married man and father of two who is given the opportunity to skip all the unpleasant situations in his life, only to come to the realization that the phrase \\"Careful what you wish for\\" is meant to mean something...    <br />The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both. <br />There are the slightest hints of The Family Man starring Nicolas Cage. <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Click is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars <br />
