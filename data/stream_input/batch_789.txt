0143038419|3.0|Though this book was entertaining at times and makes me want to visit Italy, I found her very selfish and emotionally immature woman.  It is just disheartening that in her bathroom she had God talking to her and not a woo woo guru.  But did she turn to God, and ask for guidance, no!  She went for the feel-good religion of the liberals and the misguided.   Let's take a look at things from a realistic perspective.  She didn't get onto anti-depressants until after destroying her marriage.  What if she got counseling and anti-depressants before her divorce?  I don't think I will finish the story, but from the other reviews it looks like after running around the world she is still lost.  \\"I am the way and the truth and the life.\\" John 14:6  Maybe if she turn to God instead of worldly endeavors she may have discovered something.  Unfortunately, Christ isn't cool and sheik and Eastern religions get a free ride.
B000001F5A|2.0|After giving this CD about 7 listens over the course of a couple weeks, I put it away probably for good. The melody he relies on through the first movement and several times thereafter isn't bad but it isn't much either. I also don't like his use of the big clapping sound that was almost comically overdone as a backbeat in the 80's. Vangelis at times uses some really cool drums which makes that cheap backbeat almost like a physical shock to hear - so out of place. In fairness, that might not have been the case when this soundtrack was first written, and it might not bother somone who doesn't find it to be an 80's new age cliche sound. I just expected more meat and potatoes from the guy who wrote the virtually unsurpassed soundtrack for Blade Runner! Besides that clapping backbeat, the repetetive simple melody and some fluffy nice chord washes - I didn't find much there there...
B000GPIPSS|5.0|-This review pertains to the Dracula: 75th Anniversary Edition DVD-    There have been many attempts to adapt [[ASIN:0393970124 Bram Stoker's 1897 novel]] into a film. In most cases the adaptations are unsuccessful for the primary reason that the novel is so convoluted in its narrative structure. Although most Dracula films are repetitive and formulaic, there are a handful that have stood the test of time. The film that most people remember is Tod Browning's 1931 masterpiece starring Hungarian expatriate [[ASIN:B0009X770E Béla Lugosi]]. Browning had been one of the premier American filmmakers in the `20s. His most famous films, other than Dracula, are those that he made with [[ASIN:B0000B1O9L Lon Chaney, Sr]]. Browning had a fascination with gothic imagery, macabre subject matter and suspenseful minimalist storytelling, which made him the perfect director for a filmed version of Dracula. The film, though in sound, feels like earlier silent expressionist movies most of which were made in Europe.  As for Béla Lugosi, he has become the most iconic performer to ever play the undead Count. He'll forever be associated with this role, in part because unlike the repulsive old man in Stoker's novel Béla was attractive and he played the part of Dracula as though he were a sex symbol. He brought to the character an air of sophistication and an implied perversion, which later were adopted as characteristics in most portrayals of Dracula. Another reason for Béla's longevity is his accent (ironically, the very thing that limited his success as an actor). His heavy Eastern European accent (in Stoker's novel Dracula speaks fluent English and has no trace of an accent) helped to make his performance feel more authentic and even made the fact that Dracula was a vampire more plausible. Other notable cast members include Dwight Frye who is perhaps the best Renfield the screen has ever known and Edward van Sloan who plays Professor Van Helsing to near perfection.  The screenplay waswritten by Garrett Fort and rather than basing it solely upon Stoker's book, he chose to use the stage play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston for his inspiration. This is why some fans of the novel consider the film to be a travesty. However, the fact that the film Dracula isn't faithful to its literary source material is somewhat irrelevant. The film remains a true classic.    The story begins when real estate agent Renfield travels to Transylvania where he is to meet the reclusive Count Dracula. Upon his arrival, the locals repeatedly warn him that Castle Dracula is a home to vampires, but Renfield disregards these warnings as superstitious ramblings. A dark and mysterious coachman takes him to the castle and then vanishes, leaving him in the courtyard. When Renfield meets the Count for the first time, he is visibly unnerved by his pale and malevolent appearance. Renfield and Dracula sort out the necessary paperwork, for Dracula intends to buy a house in London, but then Dracula reveals himself. Using his vampiric powers he makes Renfield his slave. Together they journey to London on a ship, all the while Dracula feeds on the ship's crew. Then they arrive in London. Before long Dracula has infiltrated the London social scene, where he feeds off of beautiful, aristocratic, young women. But when a Professor Van Helsing uncovers the truth about Dracula he becomes London's only defense from this parasitic intruder. Van Helsing carries out a counterattack against the vampire Count while the lives of all Londoners hang in the balance.    This horrifically good DVD includes an audio commentary with film historian David J. Skal, an audio commentary with Steve Haberman screenwriter of [[ASIN:B0001ZX0O2 Dracula: Dead and Loving It]], an optional score composed by Philip Glass, Lugosi: The Dark Prince documentary, The Road to Dracula documentary, Monster Tracks trivia, The Spanish Version of Dracula with an introduction by Lupita Tovar Kohner, Universal Horror feature-length documentary, poster montage with music, and a theatrical trailer.    For those interested in learning more about the fictional Count Dracula, the historical Vlad the Impaler or the making of this film, I recommend the following books:  [[ASIN:0743498038 The Essential Dracula]] by Bram Stoker, edited by Leonard Wolf  [[ASIN:0395657830 In Search of Dracula: The History of Dracula and Vampires]]  [[ASIN:0316286567 Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times]]  [[ASIN:0879102667 The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Bram Stoker's Dracula]]  [[ASIN:0571211585 Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen]]  [[ASIN:B0001CNRLG Dracula: The Legacy Collection]]

B00007FOMP|5.0|Along with 'Kind of Blue' and 'Songs In The Key of Life', this cd, album, whatever...is the absolute embodiment of what music is about.  Marvin was touched by the all-encompassing spirit that moves through and around all of us.  'What's Going On' speaks to a place in us that can only be described as seminal, pure, suigeneris...priceless.

B000J103PC|5.0|The first time I saw this movie in the theater, I felt a little sick, because I have worked for women like Mirada.  I went with a friend and she agreed, but since seeing it again on HBO and leaving the Mirandas, I think it is hysterical!!! Emily Blunt is really the star of the show.  She is SO funny in this.  But they are all good. When you have a bad day at work, just pop in this DVD and you will feel better.

It's like the worst flippin hunk o' cheesy-arse junk possible. I'm kinda being forced to watch it.

0061537934|5.0|Early one Sunday morning, I was listening to the radio and the host was interviewing Garth Stein about his new book, The Art of Racing in the Rain.  I was immediately taken with the concept of the narrator being a dog -- so much so that I went on [...] that very morning and ordered the book.    It is a fantastic read and my only problem with it is that it was not long enough.  I didn't want it to end.    Bravo Garth Stein.
0143038419|1.0|I could not finish this book. The section on \\"eating\\" in Italy was interesting as far as hearing about the food and language. The \\"praying seciton\\" started to bog down. Not a page-turner book at all. Several friends just could not finish it either. I made it almost through the \\"praying\\" section, but other folks I talked with could not even get that far. She needed to write a book to make some money after her divorce. Her publishing friends supported her in her time of need and pushed all the buttons to get this book hyped. But that is all it was--hyype--no substance. Don't waste your money. If you want to try reading it, go to the library or borrow it from a friend and don't spend the money buying it yourself.
0385340567|5.0|I think what is most upsetting to people about this book is the concept of a liberal who could kick their a**.    If you are a fan of Jack Reacher Novels, and you're not a conservative wingnut, then you should enjoy this. Especially since it holds the current administration's feet to the fire about the \\"war\\" in Iraq (and soon to be Iran)
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Do not let the mixed reviews about this film deceive you. I would say however, it's wider appeal will be for blues fans and those who are interestd in Robert Johnson in particular. Some parts of the movie are based on either facts or legends of Robert Johnson, mostly on the legend of Johnson selling his soul to the spirit Legba at the crossroads in return for the ability of being the best blues player alive. The same happened to one of his associates, Blind Dog. Blind dog later tricks the young Ralph Macchio to help him escape a nursing home in order to go back to the delta in an attempt to nullify his own bargain with Legba. Short of money, they must play the blues in roadhouses and juke-joints along the way to survive, allowing for many adventures. A surprise ending with a \\"blues head-cutting contest\\", giving a great array of guitar licks. If macchio wins, then Blind Dogs gets his deal with Legba nullified, but if Legba's man wins, then Macchio then loses his own soul. This is a must for any blues enthusiast! Find out he outcome!    John Cole
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I have to admit that this year I have been listening to so much great music that Sigur Ros, which has been my favorite band for almost seven years now, has not received the amount of listening time I usually give them. That isn't to say I stopped loving and appreciating their music, but when one is filling himself with the beautiful sounds of Mono (Japan), Beach House, The National, The Hylozoists, Mum, and others, it becomes a wonder that so much time could have been devoted to one band. That, at least, would have been my thinking before listening to this album. It is everything I have come to admire about Sigur Ros, and somehow still surpasses my expectations. I refused to listen to the album before it was released, despite the numerous opportunities to do so. I downloaded \\"Gobbledigook\\" onto my Zune, I'll admit, and listened to it endlessly, but that is where I stopped myself. This album is perfect. Every song offers a bit of magic. Every good thing that has been said about it is absolutely true. If I ever have children, this will be one of the first gifts I give to them.
B0017I0KVI|2.0|After reading Mr Darcy's Diary and Captain Wentworth's Diary, I was a little disappointed. This book starts out slow and is a little boring until at least halfway or two thirds through. Then it gets pretty good but the ending seems to drag a little.
0385340567|1.0|This Reacher is a dud. After reading all novels, this just doesn't feel right. The Hard Way was a great Reacher book. Bad Luck and Trouble was weak. It's too slow and the action is lacking, and it drags on. The villian is weak also. It took me over a week to read Nothing To Lose, and if you are a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher, you know that says a lot.
0425223523|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The first half is all about how they first fell in love and then became seperated. The last half is eight years later when they are again re-united and fall in love all over again. Hearing the story from Wentworth's point of view was a lot of fun!
B00066R4S4|4.0|This is a fun story, and it is engaging right from page one. The love story is sweet and romantic...and this is pretty funny as well. It is different from the Shopaholic series but just as good if not better. Read it.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|When I saw the movie on PBS Masterpiece Theater, I really enjoyed this version. However, I did not know that PBS cut out a few scenes which are on the DVD and are REALLY good! I am SO glad I bought this DVD!
B0018TLRTU|2.0|Billy Idol is really cool and I am a big fan his music.  But this is a rehash of his Greatest Hits album with two new songs...gimme a break Billy...this smells like trying to cash in one last time.
B0012Q732O|1.0|We have seen movies with this kind of story many many times.  Bad guys captured the girl from a little village, and the hero went thru a tough time to get her back.  Absolutely boring, too much talking, unremarkable special effects.
B0013FNC38|4.0|There are a lot of reviewer that are \\"MrazHeads\\" and are disappointed that the album was overproduced.  I'm a fan but not exactly that devoted.  I thought initially that it was overproduced as well but I take that back now.  \\"Details in the fabric\\", \\"Coyotes\\", \\"Only Human\\", \\"Dynamo of Volition\\" is probably one most entertaining 4 song stretches in any current album that I've heard lately.  The problem is not with the production but with Jason.  He is very talented but writes really beautiful songs but also very cheeky and cheesy pop songs and the production just over emphasizes it.  I could of done with out the corny \\"Love for a child\\" and pseudosensual salsa lite \\"Butterfly\\" but from what I've heard of his other albums he always has a good song followed by a cheesy one.  Given his tendency to try give his albums depth and upbeatness I actually found this album better than the last.  \\"Coyotes\\" and \\"Only Human\\" I think may actually be some of his best studio produced songs.  I think his hardcore following have to realize that studio versions are totally different than live versions.
0385340567|5.0|Having just discovered novels by Lee Child, I have read only \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" and \\"Nothing to Lose\\". I thoroughly enjoy his writing. His writing is similar to David Baldacci and Dan Brown in that the plot is so smooth and rich. Child can get his point across without undue vulgarity. I will be searching for some of his previous novels and cannot wait for his next book.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Well guys Alanis has done it again!  Everyone is still singing Jagged Little Pill over 10 years later.  This cd will in time be the same way!  It is a little different but in the same respect a great cd.  I recommend this to anyone whether you are an Alanis fan or not.

1594489505|3.0|First I absolutely LOVED the Kite Runner.  This book-not so much. ***spoilers*** I don't have a problem with the simplistic prose; my main issue with this novel is that the characters aren't as fleshed out like in the previous novel.  I don't think the author write women protagonist as well as he does men.  Mariam and Laila felt one dimensional.    The timeline felt awkward and disjointed.  Plus, I felt like I was being manipulated for the circumstance to fit where the author wanted me to go.  Two women can't get rid of one man?  C'mon, they cooked for him.  Give him a little rat poison and claim he died in his sleep.  Give me a break.  Women are crafty when circumstances command it.  With such lawlessness in Kabul, I don't understand why the wives couldn't just play dumb to the crime.  The ending felt too pat as well.  It's an easy read, but this sophomore effort fell short for this reader.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|Controversial and hated by critics and feminists, it's easy to see what people found offensive here. A very prolonged and cruel rape scene that is hardly a pleasure to watch. A series of acts of revenge that are justified but methodical and lacking in emotion.ISOYG is not a badly made film- the problem is the realism of the sexual assault that provokes the less than realistic acts of revenge by Camille Keaton on her antagonists. Watching a 20+ minute scene of a pretty young woman being brutalized and tormented by four rural thugs is no picnic, and maybe credit should be given for portraying such a horrible act in a way that is unglamorous and very unsettling as it should be.    After suffering with our victim, it's not hard to lust as she does for the blood of her attackers. You may find the revenge less than satisfying and cliched and you may find ISOYG a little overhyped and overlong..
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|This movie is something far worse than historically inaccurate.  It's just plain BORING.  I'm a Tudor junkie from way back, and I nearly fell asleep watching this.  A horrible script.  At least Showtime's THE TUDORS is riotously good ridiculous fun.
0061142026|5.0|The movie was wonderful, so naturally... the next logical thing to do was read the book.  While I felt the movie had some parts that were better... the book told more of the story, and felt like a more grand adventure, than just a crazy weekend.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I'm not sure how anyone can write a positive review of this movie. OK, I take that back. The only good thing going for this movie are some of the visually stunning sequences. I'll save you from an over-elaborate plot description other than a mourning professor builds a time machine and tries to save the woman he loves, instead finding himself 800,000 years in the future where the human species has split into two after the disintegration of the moon - the hunters and the hunted. The movie is poorly and woodenly acted and I'm truly astonished a studio paid money to make this film...
0525950079|1.0|This book is mis-titled.  It should be \\"Book Without End\\".  This book is utterly tedious.  The characters are predictable, dull and unremarkable, from the utterly unredeemably wicked and cruel knight, to the patiently and remarkably perceptive builder.  Who really cares about the ultimate longing and un-requited love story of the nun and builder?  They are, oh, so saintly.  There is very little real historical value, just page after page of one trite, little episode after another.    I awaited this book with anticipation...such a mistake.  And such an unworthy follow-up to \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\".  My recommendation is that unless you like to bruise your nose as this unweildy tome falls on your face when you fall asleep trying to get through it, skip it.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Will Ferrell shines in this quirky and touching movie about a man who hears the voice of a writer who is narrating the story of his life. Ferrell stars as a numbers obsessed IRS employee whose life revolves around a strict schedule that includes waking up at the same time each day, brushing his teeth a set number of times, knowing the number of steps he takes to and from his house, etc. Things suddenly change for him after he starts hearing a voice that narrates his life. What ensues is the slow transformation of a person who had no life to one who starts to live it to the fullest. What makes the movie shine is the interplay between fiction and real life and watching the way Emma Thompson, who plays the hermit-like writer who kills off all of her characters, struggle with what to do with this novel is quite moving. All of the actors do a remarkable job at bringing this fresh script to life and I will be sure to watch this many times in the future.
B0012Q732O|3.0|Wow, some of the reviews label this a real stinker.  Give it a break.  It's not prehistoric history; it's not a geography lesson; it's an adventure, pure and simple.  It reminds me of an E.R. Burrough's tale: good vs. evil, a noble quest to save one's princess, lots of fighting and surreal surroundings, monstrous animals, and a little romance.    The main actors deliver for the genre: Steven Strait- muscular, ruggedly handsome, angst; Camilla Belle- beautiful, wistful, longing, angst.  The evil guys evil.      The downers: the story's a bit hokey and, of course, it's predictable. And the romance could be richer. But there's no foul language, no sex, and the violence, stylized; moreover, the scenery's incredible, and there's plenty of computerized images to stir the imagination, most of it's well done.  So, it's not 'Lord of the Rings', but I'd love to make friends with a mammoth or sabertooth anytime.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|A fantastic CD that grabs you from the start and works nearly all the time. Only a couple of songs didn't work for me, but otherwise, everything else did. A great CD.
1400023343|5.0|Chapter Two on Learning a First Language is the best thing I have read on First Language Acquisition and I plan to tell the professors where I work that this is the text they should use for their courses on First and Second Language Acquisition (which I have taught for four years). The  information is presented in a concise and easy to understand manner so that scholars and parents alike will find it useful and interesting. I think any parent or scholar would find this a useful resource whether they are looking to understand their child's development or trying to find research to back their claims on the benefits of bilingualism. This book is a gold mine of information backed in research. There is nothing that I have read so far on the market that explains all this in such detail and in such a easy way to understand. This is a must as a textbook for a class on language acquisition or as a manual for parents to use as a reference.     A SIGH OF RELIEF FOR ATTEMPTING TO BE BILINGUAL AT HOME  After reading the introduction and the first chapter on The benefits of Childhood Bilingualism, I breathed a sigh of relief. I did not know until reading this book that there were so many other parents like myself who did not grow up speaking another language, yet they are teaching a second language to their children. The book discusses the phenomenon of so many Americans in this generation having the opportunity to travel and experience other languages and cultures. This has created a niche of people in the U.S. who are raising their children with the values and languages they acquired abroad. I live in an English-Only state with everyone questioning my reasons for bringing up my daughter in the two languages of Spanish and English. It is nice to find a home for my feelings and know there is a larger community of people out there who are following in the same footsteps towards bilingualism. Thank you for giving me hope and appreciation for what I am attempting to do by publishingthis book.
B0018OAPAW|2.0|I grew up in Southern California. The Offspring were my favorite band for well over a decade. I grew into metal, loved Metallica, Pantera, Megadeth, and all of the other great Thrash bands, but The Offspring always had a a special place in my musical tastes; I had bought Ignition on cassette from a friend when I was only in grade school, and loved every album that they've made because every single one had at least 4-5 solid songs that I wouldn't be ashamed of blasting on my car stereo. Smash was the first CD that I ever owned. I can't count the number of times I've played their songs on my car stereo, on my guitar, at home, when I streamcast. . . they were one of those bands that I thought I would never tire from.<br /><br />Or so I thought. This album completely lacks the aggression, speed, hard riffs, and punk background that made their greatest songs great. I'm not talking about Pretty Fly or their other trendy songs, I'm talking about Bad Habit, Cool to hate, Kill the President, Americana, Mota, Pay the Man, The Noose is Falling, Come Out Swinging, and my personal favorite, Staring at the Sun. . . you long time fans know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. That sound and beat that made you band your head, get pumped up, and got your blood pumping. The songs that said \\"F--- YOU,\\" and really embodied the basic tenants of punk. There is almost none of that on this album; they're not trying to dodge any bullets as they try to find their way through this mess of tracks. They manage to destroy the momentum of most song with terrible attempts at melodic choruses and horrible backup vocals. The only possible exceptions go to Hammerhead, You're Gonna Go Far Kid, and maybe Trust in You. The lyrics are so incredibly generic and terrible it amazes me. The thing that kills me about this album is that the three best songs on this album aren't nearly comparable to the best songs (or even the catchiest songs) on previous albums.<br /><br />I don't know if it's Bob Rock, who I learned to hate from what he did to Metallica, I don't know if it's the loss of Ron Welty . . . I don't know what it is. All I know is that they're heading down a road of garbage, trendy music that's made for high schoolers with no damn taste. I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer, this sounds like a ton of over-produced garbage. All I know is that it just really sucks to see another one of the bands that I absolutely loved when I was younger go down a horrible path of mediocre \\"more mature\\" music, rather than stay true to their roots. At least Pennywise among a very small number of other bands has managed to hang on as one of the original punk acts that stayed original rather than devolving into a bunch of generic garbage. I seriously believe, despite their many successes with Sony/Columbia, that Offspring would be better off if they too had stuck with Epitaph.what he did to Metallica, I don't know if it's the loss of Ron Welty . . .

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|This film has an incomprehensible plot, full of large gaping holes, where people do things that make no sense and run from bad guys who are attacking and killing them for no good reason. There is only one character that has any kind of development (Griffin, who doesn't exist in the Gould book at all and appears for far too short a time) and he is the only reason to watch this film.  The two leads, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson, give pitiful performances as one-dimensional characters caught in a matrix of whiz-bang special effects-- which aren't even all that good or even very interesting.  Might be entertaining if you grew up watching MTV music videos, because it is fairly short and it's completely pointless to expend gray matter activity trying to figure out what's happening.  It's edited a lot like a music video too, although the largely unnecessary dialoge kind of gets in the way of fully appreciating the pretty locations and the gee-whiz light-show effects.  Hayden and Rachel are pretty too. If you're very drunk you might enjoy it, otherwise don't bother.
B000094HMU|3.0|The CD recently bought it's of poor quality. It skips more than once several times during play.
B0010358D0|5.0|Ex Machina fulfills its potential in almost every way.  It is amazing to look at.  The characters are beautiful and human.  The music is awesome, though it often takes a back seat to the spectacle of the choreography.<br /><br />While some reviewers have mentioned that the main villain is revealed late in the film, I disagree (though, yes, it is in many ways a borg ripoff).  The villain of Halcon is present throughout the movie, both literally and symbolically.  The man vs machine, individual vs collective, is what the movie is about from start to finish.  This obviously isn't the first story to tackle the subject, but it does so very ably.  It is about identity, and the struggle to retain our necessary humanity while accepting the benefits of a technological lifestyle.  It is a love story at least as much as an action flick, and that love was the hero in the identity-centered story is entirely appropriate.<br /><br />I believe this movie has set a new standard for full-cg films, both visually and emotionally.  Well done, I look forward to watching it again.
B0009IOR6Q|1.0|I love Johnny Depp and think he is a terific actor who takes on difficult roles and does them wonderfully BUT THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE, I hated it, in fact I did not get through the whole movie.<br />It reminded me of a very badly overacted Grease.  As good looking as Johnny is, that cant carry this movie.  Sorry I bought it as I could have watched it for free on Comcast On Demand:(
B0002STNQ2|5.0|Crichton does a fabulous job of portraying how our human ignorance can lead us down a path of no turning back. How much do we really know about how computer technology works? What explains the strange anomolies that appear in computer code? \\"Prey\\" shows us just one hypothetical example of what could happen. It also makes you wonder how long before science fiction turns into science.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I enjoy Mrs. Gaskell's books, so I was surprised to find myself agreeing with the many liberties the screenwriter took here.  In the book, much of Margaret's dislike of Thornton hinges on his being in trade rather than a gentleman, which just made her seem like a snob to me. The dramatic fight scene created a real tension and reason for her antipathy. I was glad to have one less death, and the way other information was doled out made much more dramatic sense, too.  The technical aspects of the production are amazing and the actors are just incredible, particularly Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack.     My one complaint is the proposal scene, which was cut to shreds, apparently, to the point that it doesn't always make sense from moment to moment. Also, in the book Margaret's vigorous refusal is motivated in part by what she has overheard Fanny Thornton saying about her behavior during the riot, but in the movie it's not clear whether she overhears Fanny at all.     The train scene is anachronistic, but so well done, who cares?  It's wonderful to imagine Mrs. Thornton's reaction when the two of them get back to Milton.
B000007RYQ|5.0|I've owned this album for years and I still come back to this piece as one of the best interpretations of the Resurrection symphony out there. It captures perfectly the dissonance that Mahler was trying to convey in this symphony in a striking, innovative way and I think he would have approved.
0452289963|5.0|I can not explain to you in words what the message of this book has done for my everyday life. I wish I could but I can't. Read it with an open heart and I can't imagine how you could remain unaffected. In a life full of turmoil I finally have peace.
0061537934|5.0|I purchased this book some time ago because it caught my attention yet, it sat collecting dust until I had some time to read it. I picked it up two days ago and finished it this afternoon. This book was excellent! I could not put it down. It is very emotional and I found myself fighting with the pages with what Denny was going through. Being an animal lover the fact that the narrator was the family dog, Enzo, was wonderful. I loved the view of life from his eyes. The book gives many references to Formula One racing, though I am not a fan I loved the connections the author gives and the messages of doing your best, dealing with what life(or a race) hands you, and never giving up on those that you love, what you love doing, or loving yourself whether you are a human or a dog. It was amazing. By the last few chapters I could no longer hold back my tears. Great book.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine starring Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette is the cutest and zaniest film of 2006. This film was nominated for best picture and Alan Arkin won best supporting actor, I was worried this film would be a disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this quirky flick from beginning to end. Abigail Breslin (also nominated) is ray of sunshine as a beauty pageant hopeful Olive Hoover, she is plain, chubby, and less than graceful but she has tremendous heart. Breslin's performance is pretty amazing for someone so young, and jeez she's been in like a thousand films after this one made her famous. Paul Dano and Steve Carell also star and probably have the best character layout in this film. I highly recommend this much-beloved gem! Enjoy!
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Ya know, I have to say.  I honestly didn't even expect to see another Sigur Ros album this soon after I received Hvarf/Heim in the mail last year when I preordered it.  I hopped online earlier this month and saw that a new album was coming forth.  I, naturally, became very excited because they are my favorite band.  I didn't want to spoil it and stream the album and listen to them all before they were released on disc. I wanted it to be a surprise.  I've read a few reviews from people who have streamed some of the tracks and given them a listen.  I became worried.<br /><br />Are the boys becoming a pop band and selling out and shedding their ethereal, lush, soundscape voice and moving towards the annoying pop-driven world we have to endure?<br /><br />No.  I don't believe so.  The best description I can give you, assuming you are a long time fan, if not at least starting to listen to their previous albums, is that this album is sort of a light at the end of the tunnel.  Their previous albums sound like you are walking through that tunnel, wandering in the darkness.  This album is happier and more joyous but has not lost that voice that we love so much.  I am certainly not disappointed with the new album and am happy to say that I can recommend it to people new to Sigur Ros and the avid listeners who have fallen in love with their sound over the years.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0000009RT|4.0|Debut albums are often tentative, exploratory works. They find artists refining their sound, honing their chops, getting a feel for the studio, delicately introducing themselves to their audiences, and otherwise learning to navigate the ins and outs of this whole \\"recorded music\\" thing. In the 60s, this usually made for unexciting quickies that buried two great songs under ten bits of worthless filler. Covers ruled the day, and the originals were largely dull and derivative.     For his debut album, Frank Zappa ripped rock music in half and rebuilt it in his own image.    Here's how he did it: He took all of the clichés, conventions, and conceits that had come to rule the pop world and he turned them inside out. He wrote doo-wop ditties with upside down harmonies and surreal narratives. He wrote catchy melodies and pureed them into white noise. He made time signatures go to war with each other. He juxtaposed cheesy pop and musique concrete. Greaseball R&B sat side-by-side with acid fried social commentary. Accessibility went one-for-one with alienation. It's hilarious, catchy, eye opening, friendly, and uncompromising, and it all goes on for over an hour.     And what an hour it is! This album is just about stuffed with classic moments. I mean, who could ask for a better opening salvo than \\"Hungry Freaks, Daddy?\\" It's a stinging rocker, a furiously intelligent weirdo anthem, and a good-natured descent into the experimental. And it's catchy! Elsewhere, the album flaunts socially enraged garage rock (\\"Trouble Every Day\\"), hilarious post-modern teen pop (\\"Wowie Zowie,\\" \\"Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder\\"), Oedipally conflicted sex-rock (\\"Motherly Love\\"), sneering anti-love anthems (\\"I Ain't Got No Heart\\"), and whatever the hell \\"Who Are The Brain Police?\\" is. I love \\"Who Are The Brain Police?\\"     But it's the album's second half that really flies the ol' freak flag. Starting with \\"Help, I'm A Rock,\\" the proceedings begin a descent into a menacing world of mean-spirited sound collages, spooked acid-psych, and leering avant-garage. The structures become less linear and more freewheeling, less accessible and more violent, less friendly and more...freaky.     Believe it or not, it works. The music (experimental and otherwise) has dated surprisingly well, thanks in no small part to the fact that, as subversive as he was, Frank Zappa was a great writer of pop songs, and the Mothers of Invention were a great band. The wilder elements of the record are balanced by a great sense of humor and adventure. In the end, it's actually the more conventional songs that wind up dragging Freak Out! down a peg: \\"I'm Not Satisfied\\" and \\"How Could I Be Such A Fool\\" are pretty dull, with stiff melodies and drab lyrics. \\"You Didn't Try To Call Me\\" has little more going for it than a cool-sounding intro, and \\"You're Probably Wondering Why I'm Here\\" repeats the outcast-anthem message of the album without really contributing anything new.     Still... classic album!
B000UJ48VI|1.0|What is wrong with this movie? Almost everything. It turns Nabokov's text about the memoirs of a pedophile into a melancholy comedy about a sad middle aged man, Mason, who gets trapped by a very young seducer and fights for her with a silly Sellers character.<br />The movie contributed to the stereotype of the prematurely sexy girl, who entraps older men.<br />That is not what Nabokov's book was about. I think the book can not be turned into a movie without being either illegal or messing up the contents badly and mortally. Humbert Humbert, the main character and narrator of the book, is attracted to female children, not to the type of 'Lolita' that has become idiomatic after the film, i.e. a sexy precocious seducer. The book is a complex construction based on the untrustworthy story teller concept. We know that HH is a lier.<br />Nabokov wrote not only the novel, but also the original script for the film, and when the film did get Oscars, he got one for the script, though Kubrick had in fact largely ignored the script. There is a Library of America edition which includes the novel and the script. The end product is just something else, and it is something not very appealing.
0618918248|5.0|If you have doubts about religion versus science then read this book.  It is clear and cites good evidence to support it's claims.  A book to read several times.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Well it seems that everytime I fall head over heels over a band, they wind up getting produced by Brian Eno at some point. And I have been a huge Brian Eno fan long before the Talking Heads, U2 and the B-52's were blessed by his production magic.  I was so excited to hear that he was taking this on, and really not too surprised. The outcome is exceptional.  The band stays true to each members artistic expression on this album, with Eno's atmospheric and sometimes ambient layers floating in the background.  What a great combination this makes. The track \\"42\\" is my favorite, done in several different \\"segments\\", each complimenting the one before it.  Unlike most bands that you hear and love their music but then grow tired of it....Coldplay has always done the opposite for me. The more you hear them, the more you like 'em. Great job to all involved on this release, and it is highly recommended.  Turn the lights down low, kick the volume way up and be ready for a great ride.
0307265730|2.0|Lahiri needs to branch out of her comfort zone and write a story that goes beyond the account of Bengali-Americans trying to adjust to new frontiers. Enough already. The writing is narrative at best. For truly evocative writing on a similar theme, read Monica Ali's Brick Lane.
0446402389|5.0|This is not the type of book I would normally pick up (Russia? historical murder mystery?), but I am so very glad that I did. The character development and plot are excellent, with the setting serving as another character in itself. I read many, many books, many of them mysteries, and most can best be described as average. This book was riveting. Kudos.
B0012Q732O|1.0|I got the dvd yesterday with great anticipation.  Emmerich's movies are always fun...until this one.  Boring and shallow plot, bad acting, and the references to aliens and Atlantis are flat out dumb.
B000002I4W|5.0|Two of the albums most influential to my understanding of jazz both came in 1959. Bill Evans masteripiece Portrait in Jazz and Ornette Coleman's The Shape of Jazz to Come.  Bill defined the piano as the well-spring of jazz, Ornette thought the piano was the whole problem.  Ornette's frentic solos were a stark contrast Bill's cyborg-like restraint.  For all their differences, one thing on which the could agree was that traditional chord voicing had to go.  These are both great ablums in their own right, but its all the more exciting to listen to them in context with full knowelge of all that they would inspire in other artists. To be sure, there are a great number of other highly influential albums of that time, but for me, these two stand apart from the pack.
014241011X|5.0|This is an excellent book for 3rd grade readers.  It is very exciting and keeps my child interested.  I recommend this book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Unlike some of the reviewers on the site, I have seen all the episodes of the John Adams miniseries. It is true that not every episode is 5 stars, but even the less impressive episodes in this miniseries are far better than the majority of anything you will see on TV this, or any other year. Where John Adams excels is in the remarkable acting, not just of Giamatti, who is amazing, but particularly of Laura Linney. Linney's natural, understated, performance gives a level of depth and intensity that very few actresses could have conveyed in this role. The supporting performances are almost uniformly excellent, with standout achievement's from David Morse as George Washington, Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, and the reliable genius of Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin. The directing is competent but not inspired. I was rebuffed by the soundtrack's grandiose nature at first, however, the series lived up to insistent tone and delivery by the end. I have not read the book that the series is based on, however, my uncle has. His opinion is that the series is a very faithful portrait, but has far less detail. This is understandable. For any fan of history, this is a must see series. For any fan of drama, this is a must see series. You will certainly not be disappointed. If only history class was this engaging in school, then maybe our children would actually learn about our country.
B00006I53S|5.0|Being new to the digital camera experience I had much too learn. I purchased my Canon EOS XT with the standard kit lens. I also had other lenses from my Canon 35mm. What I didnt know was how important shutter speed and ISO settings were. I was able to go online and learn how to take pictures all over again. For those of you just starting out on digital let me hopefully make it easier for you. First, get this lens! No matter what you read if you are like me, you purchased this camera because you want more control in certain situations that a point and shoot digital just wont do. Now that you have this lens it's really simple. In brite light situations use a ISO setting of around 200 and a shutter speed of 1/60 or better. When in low light situations use I higher ISO like 800 and use a faster shutter speed. If you dont have an external flash...get one. This will make your life easier. This lens does make life so much simpler. I have gone from being extremely frustrated with blurred and out of focus pictures, to clear and viberante pictures and totally satisfied. But please note...using the ISO settings and shutter speeds help the lens in every situation. Not adjusting these settings could lead to unclear pictures.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|I love her music!  It's mellow acoustic guitar and she has such a beautiful and sexy voice.  I don't know what she's saying but i LOVE the way she says it!!!
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I actually liked this movie. it started out a little slow then picked up quite fast.
B0012Q732O|3.0|The '08 release '10,000 BC' is a visually alluring piece of cinema to be sure with a solid soundtrack that desires a little bit more storyline and originality to left it out of mediocrity. Numerous reviews have already compared this film to `Apocalypto' and I hate to be repetitive but I must agree.<br /><br />For me the most fascinating aspects of the film were the inclusion of pyramids and the beginnings of the Sphinx emerging from the sand. Further enhanced by the mention of rulers coming from the stars, or arriving from a sinking continent (i.e.: Altantis) there were definitely strong hints of a `Stargate' type ending on the horizon. From a personal perspective I believe the writers missed a great opportunity by not exploring the mythic and extraterrestrial aspects further.<br /><br />However that's just wishful thinking on my part. Not much here of interest for the adults, but a young audience will probably love it, you know how they feel about dinosaurs.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! BORING doesnt even describe it. The Sabertooth Tiger you see on the cover and in all the previews is in maybe....5 minutes of the movie. 75% of the movie is this guy walking around lost... \\"Whats the point\\"??? I like Roland Emerick's other movies but this was BAD! First movie I have EVER \\"walked out\\" on.
0307155102|5.0|I can't forget this book, because of it had several great factors. It covered almost every place a kid may see, with it's name to know what the object is. Each page shows kids different work spaces, lands, city life, even inside a home, room by room.<br />This would be an excellent book for preschoolers, and even younger as well. Children and their parents may create their own stories with the detailed scenes.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Very touching movie! Some of the story is quite unbelievable and hard to follow, but if you follow till the end you won't be disappointed.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|Based on Erich Kastner's book and a 1961 movie, which takes place in other locations is a changed one, although it starts almost the same as the book, it changes to a modern type of fairytale style.    The real amazment however comes from the selection of one actress (like the movie from 1961) to play two parts and it's implametation, unlike the Olsen twin movies, and enhancing it to a perfectly done technological breakthrough that REALLY makes you think the two characters are two girls.    The DVD is worth buying if you like TONS of special features about the movie and how it was done, and belive me, this one defenatly delivers.     On a sadder note, Lindsay Lohan seem innocent enough to play the part at that age but ten years later she ends up like many actresses and actors, in and out of rehab, which really makes you wonder if it is worth it and make you swear NEVER to send your kid to \\"the businness\\" in Hollywood or glamour anywhere else.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|Wow, that's all I'm going to say to this amazing boxed set. It was very different than what I thought it was going to be but I don't care. I originally bought the album and wondered what was in the boxed set. It wasn't until 2 years after the release of the Red Hot Chili Pepper's greatest album that they've ever made (next to Blood Sugar Sex Magik), that I would buy the box set. I think the best part of this set is the box itself. It's the 3-D logo of Stadium Arcadium. It's just awesome. Others have put in their reviews what's in it so I won't. But if this was the Chili Pepper's last album (it isn't, though, trust me), they went out with a freaking good album and boxed set to go with it. Everyday I find myself loving a new track (28 of them total). The last track that I fell in love with is \\"Hey\\", a nice jazzy track. You won't be disappointed in both the album and the boxed set.
B00164DWEA|4.0|The Good Things<br />*The action scenes / special effects do not dissapoint.  There is loads of carnage and fighting; probably some of the best I've seen this year!<br />*Compared to the previous film \\"Hulk,\\" the creature effects are vastly improved.  The Hulk looks more real, and is porportioned properly.<br />*Filming style is greatly improved from the previous film \\"Hulk.\\" There are no weird transitions; this film is more straightforward, with a rough, raw, dark, and realistic style.  It's very appropriate for this story.<br />*The story itself is simple, but engaging.  It's easy to understand, and is not slowly-paced like the last movie.  Also has a few humorous parts and some good romance.<br />*Even though the whole cast is new, they are better than in \\"Hulk.\\" All good performances.<br />*Look out for cameos by Stan Lee and another great superhero (guess who)!<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Can't think of anything...<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*A few parts seem a little inconsistent with \\"Hulk\\" (such as the opening, which briefly reveals Bruce Banner's genesis, but isn't the same as what happened in \\"Hulk\\").  Could be good or bad, depending on what you think.<br /><br />Eschewing the convoluted drama and weird special effects of \\"Hulk,\\" the \\"Incredible Hulk\\" is a substantial improvement.  Not only are the action and effects better, but the story and characters are way better.  This is truly what the Hulk was meant to become, and I'll be looking forward to the next installment (rumored to be called \\"The Ultimate Hulk\\"...).
B000H0MKOC|4.0|No one could ever accuse this movie of being subtle.  But hey, look at the title and the premise.  How could it be?<br /><br />Nick Naylor is one of the most interesting protagonists to come along in quite a while, and the topic is a very blunt \\"smoke smoke smoke!\\" message.  The movie is based on a novel which I haven't read but which must surely also be about him.  He's an interesting guy.<br /><br />What I see here is a brilliant balancing act.  The humor manages to go over the top without ever sacrificing character, credibility, or even plot.  I honestly didn't expect a plot, but rather a one-joke film.  So it was a pleasant surprise there.<br /><br />I will say that you have to be in the right mood, though.  The first time I fired up the DVD, I stopped after about 30 minutes and put it aside for later.  The second time, I was very impressed.<br /><br />(Fired up?  Oh no, I've been subliminally programmed!)
B000002MZ6|5.0|I played this recording often during a journey I made with my parents and chinese girlfriend, around south africa. My father was dying of cancer. We all loved the music - cross generational, haunting, seamless and seemingly endless -  ideal for a road trip. Several years after my fathers death, I played it again. I noticed my girlfriend crying. I asked why. The music instantly returned her to that wonderful journey and reminded her of my father. Can you ever ask for more from a recording?
B00005221M|5.0|\\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a film which combines fine cinematography, good acting, an excellent musical score, and very well filmed battle scenes.  Both the modern film and the nineteenth century novel were set in the French and Indian War and have some of the same characters.  However, anyone who has read the book will quickly realize that the film is very different.  That said, the movie is actually very good and an excellent tale of adventure, love, courage, and brutality.  There are some historic errors (the massacre in the film looks more extensive than what actually happened and Col. Monroe actually survived the real massacre).  As far as I remember, this film has relatively little cursing and no nudity.  It is a very violent film, especially in its last quarter.  However, the violence is realistic and actually less than some of the things which actually happened on the frontier (see some of Allan W. Eckart's books).  The natural scenery (filmed in North Carolina) is beautiful and makes an ironic though scenic backdrop to the chase scenes as well as battles that occur in the film.  Particullary memorable scenes include the bombardment of a British fort (Fort William Henry), a large massacre of retreating British soldiers, a canoe chase, and the final pursuit along rocky cliffs.  I should mention that some of Hawkeye's shots seem a little far fetched considering rifles of the time, but that doesn't take away from the film.  Overall, I enjoyed it considerably.
B00154GEFU|4.0|Strongly recommended for fans of the original members of Asia.  This CD is a great listen and reminds us of the talent of those musicians, but also the sounds and textures of their debut album.  If you listen closely, you can pick out some meories of Yes' Drama album, which Howe and Downes played on before the forming of Asia.  Phoenix does not contain as much hard-driving rock tunes as the debut, but replaces some of that feel with a more progresive theme and a return to the original sound of the four musicians playing dueling and sometimes overlapping licks.  Never Again is the hardest rocking tune on the CD and starts it off with a bang.  Frankly, that tune alone is worth the price Amazon sells the CD for.  Never Again will be in my listening rotation/Ipod/mp3 many years from now, just as Heat of the Moment is now, after all these years.  Buy it!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay has really worked hard on this album, and it's quite apparent if you listen to it the whole way through. Viva La Vida, it a large step forward for coldplay who seemed stuck in a rut, and released about 3-4 albums all sounding roughly the same.     This album shouldn't be considered their best, but it is a step forward to more innovative music. I can only hope their next album will go even further to surprise me.
B00005JKC3|3.0|The Good Things<br />*A few good special effects and action scenes.<br />*Some pieces of strong, interesting imagery.<br />*Despite being convoluted and slow, some of the drama and dialogue is interesting and thought-provoking.  The characters are deep, when you stop and really look at them.<br />*The style (even though very heavily saturated with strange transitions) does a good job at giving the film a comic-book look.<br />*The actors are not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The film's style, despite being somewhat nifty, is also a little too bizzare to watch.<br />*The storyline is slow, melodramatic, and hard to figure out in some places.<br />*Some scenes look too dark.<br /><br />This is a case where an artistic style has gotten in the way of what should be an exciting, brawling action movie.  What action we see is pretty cool, but we need to wade through a mile of confusing slow-paced drama and weird film effects before we get there.  I think it's not a bad start, but the sequel \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is truly way better.
1596680296|5.0|This is the best, clearest, step-by-step how-to for sock knitting. It goes through each step in the process with nicely laid out pages and photographs, and also gives patterns according to each type of yarn weight. In the back there are lists of varieties of stitches you can substitute. I had never knit a sock before buying this book, and I have no problems knitting them now thanks to this book.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Call me biased, but I can't help it. Any move that Pixar is behind is a good movie. It may be the same basic stuff, but every movie is unique in its own special way. Keep up the good work!
B000068TPN|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is an exceptional war film.  It may be the best war film I've seen apart from the Civil War masterpiece \\"Glory.\\"  The battle scenes are intense and brutal to watch.  The naphalm scene is especially horrific though I assume very realistic.  Mel Gibson does a fine job as Col. Moore and Sam Elliot is superb as a tough seargent.  The scenes of families at home and the arrival of messages telling of the death of loved ones were well used to illustrate the wider impact of war.  In fact, it was the combination of war scenes and more personal scenes which put it over \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (if only barely) in my mind.  Parents should be advised that this is not a film for children.  There is a considerable amount of violence and some pretty harsh language as well (I know that the cursing is realistic but I felt it personally detracted from both this and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\").  Anyway, I would recommend this film though I advise it is graphic.  On a side note, the film only covers part of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley.  The film was also judged to be mostly historically accurate by a commentator on a History Channel \\"History vs. Hollywood\\" show though there were inaccuracies such as the final charge.
0425200450|3.0|Agata Christie's 1934 mystery MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS has her Belgian sleuth investigating a murder on the legendary Istanbul-Paris route. After solving some case in Syria, Poirot hopes to unwind in Turkey for a few days, but receives a telegram urging him to come to London immediately. With some difficulty, he secures a berth on the train, finding himself surrounded by a lively cast of characters from Europe and the United States. Not long after departure, one of them is found dead, and Poirot is tasked with determining who of his fellow passengers is the culprit.<br /><br />Agata Christie did not become one of the world's bestselling authors by writing particularly deep characters or original narrative. Poirot's international companions on the train are ethnic caricatures, with the Italian initially fingered as the murder because of that nation's supposed blind passion, and Americans portrayed as uncouth and rustic. The solution is in many respects a deus ex machina. Nonetheless, the novel is an entertaining enough read if one wants some light to pass a couple of hours. Christie's depiction of her protagonist, ambiguous in his sexuality and lacking fashion sense, is always amusing. The investigative methods used will also provide a chuckle in how they violate the rights of suspects and ignore local laws.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|There were a few missteps this season, but over all I enjoyed it.  The second season is what got my husband watching and now we're going to watch the first and second seasons over again, since he managed to watch the entire third season.  Can't wait for that to come out!
B000X9PNOG|4.0|Based on other reviews, I was kind of skeptical to buy Meat's lastest DVD performance.  Then, one night DirecTV had an edited (shortened) version of the concert on one of its music networks and I was fortunate enough to catch it.  Meat Loaf rocked!  After that, I immediately bought the DVD for myself to the see concert in full.  What a show! Meat's vocals were pretty much on the mark all night...the only exception being \\"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth.\\"  He seemed to struggle a bit on that one.  Aspen Miller did a great job being Meat's leading lady as well.  The rest of the band was flawless with their musicianship...Paul, Randy, John, Mark, Kasim, and of course C.C. all rock!  Also, Meat delivered worthy covers of Black Betty and Gimme Shelter.  Considering his age, and the fact that this DVD was recorded on the tour that he would later discontinue because of a cyst on his vocal chords, Meat Loaf gave a great show...like he always does!
B00139W3NE|1.0|I was surprised by how boring this movie was, especially considering the quality of animation wrapped around its dumb and implausible plot.  No suspense, no drama, plenty of action but centered around a plot that no one cares about makes this movie a waste of time.  While its strange attempt to change the image of demon possession into a \\"good thing\\" is both disturbing and bizarre, that shouldn't be a problem for most moviegoers since the movie stinks.  However, a society that accepts the characterization of demons as being warm and fuzzy pets and the severance of the spiritual bond between people and their respective demons as being a tragedy is a society in trouble.   Perhaps the author (or writers) meant no harm, but if so, then they should have chosen a different terminology instead of rebelling against the English language.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|UFO is undeniably one of the best rock bands ever. Their well deserved top status is not for discussion.    This review is to indicate that the remastered quality of this CD is impeccable! You can play this CD loud and the bass' response is deep without distortions. Treble sounds are crisp and bright. Add that to the amazing extra songs and we get a treat I never expected would be possible. I cannot praise enough the excellent work that EMI / Chrysalis did. Thank you, justice is finally made!
B00000FC5H|5.0|I have loved Earth Wind & Fire from the very beginning.  I love their creativity and the energy of their music.  I purchased the album when it was orginally released.  We listened to the album quite a lot back then.  Since we no longer have a turntable, I wanted to have it in the CD version.  This will enable us to extend the life of the album.  This is definitely a collector's item and should be one of the all time best soul music albums.
B000BKJ78U|3.0|I am happy with my purchase except that one case was broken and the DVD does not hold in there and it rattles; really annoying and I don't think that will be good for the disc.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I've seen the guys several times live and have always enjoyed their music.  This one takes it to another level.  Welcome back!
B0010X745K|1.0|This was certainly one of the scariest movies I have seen in recent years.  The dialog was so bad it nearly scared me to death.  The rubber monsters and use of the mist to conceal them, not so much.    It is scary to think that someone was paid to write the tripe that is coming out these poor actors' mouths.  BTW, I think the acting was great.  It took tremendous acting skills to spout such absurd lines and act like they weren't utter nonsense.    On the bright side, the monsters do nail quite of few of these incredibly annoying and fake characters, just not soon enough.
B000TNF7NS|5.0|UFO is undeniably one of the best rock bands ever. Their well deserved top status is out of the question.     Instead, this review is focused on the remastered quality of this CD, which is impeccable! In my opinion, this is miles better than the BGO version and other Japanese re-issues. You can play this CD loud and the bass' response is deep without distortions. Treble sounds are crisp and bright. Add that to the amazing extra songs and we get a treat I never expected would be possible. I cannot praise enough the excellent work that EMI / Chrysalis did. Thank you, justice is finally made!
B0012Q732O|5.0|I was spellbound by the imagery and enjoyed every minute.  Thank you Mr. Emmerich for the engaging flight of fancy.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My daughter introduced our family to this game while on home from college. We've been playing it every weekend, including my 16 year-old son, my 19 year-old daughter, and my husband. If you use the random set-up, the game changes every time and poses new challenges.
B00062IDCO|4.0|I never saw the end, and instead of searching the television guides, I bought the last season on DVD.  The interface is a bit funny, but excellent quality video and sound.  I am enjoying it a lot!
B000GB775E|4.0|Ok so admittedly, the only reason I saw this movie in the first place, and the only reason I own this DVD, is because Lindsay Lohan is in it. Yes, I am a HUGE LL fan. Prior to what others say, I think she is incredibly talented, even in corny movies such as this one. In all honestly, this definitely isn't one of Lindsays best movies, and if it had been someone else who starred in it, I'd no doubt be giving it one star. But Lindsay adds charm to this movie and makes it worth watching.    Yes its corny at times, and yes its predictable (the basic gist: girl who has all the luck in the world meets boy who has all the bad luck in the world, they kiss, their fortunes get reversed, and of course develop romantic feelings for eachother...etc) and some parts are even downright ridiculous. But like I said, Lindsay makes it work, and she actually has really good chemistry with her co-star Chris Pines.    but if your not a fan of Lohan whatsoever, and if you in no way enjoy any type of chick flick, then I'm willing to bet your not gonna enjoy this one, so I don't recommend that you watch this movie but if you are a Lohan fan and you do enjoy chick flicks, even slightly ridiculous ones, then I do recommend that you watch this.    If anything, it'll atleast give you something entertaining to watch on a boring sunday afternoon!
B0009WQ3P0|5.0|Few bands have had the range of players as \\"Fleetwood Mac\\".  This box set shows as good a selection of songs from more than a great selection of band members.  As a collection, it goes along admirably, showcased in a nice small black box with a thick booklet full of photos, trivia and memories.  That part works.  But the arrangement of songs is odd.  The first two discs are composed of songs from the mid-seventies era of, \\"Rumors\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac\\", \\"Tusk\\" and their 1980 `live' album (well, one good song from there - \\"Not That Funny\\").  This was Fleetwood Mac at its most financially popular, with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham standing out from the original Mick Fleetwood and John and Christie McVie.<br /><br />The fourth disc contains most of their forgettable, but pop-laden songs from the eighties on albums that didn't fare well, like, \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Behind The Mask\\".  At least it pulls in four new songs, a Stevie Nicks \\"live\\" solo song and the great alternate version of, \\"Isn't It Midnight\\".  There is plenty of material to choose from in the eighties.<br /><br />The strangest thing about this box set is the fourth disc, which relegates at least six earlier albums, \\"Heroes Are Hard To Find\\", \\"Mystery To Me\\", \\"English Rose\\", \\"Mr. Wonderful\\", \\"Then Play On\\" and the classic \\"Bare Trees\\".  Nineteen songs from before 1975 doesn't seem fair.  You simply get a sampling of that era with great musicians like, Bob Welch, Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer.  It's definitely a more eclectic mix, but that is what Fleetwood Mac has always been about.  There should have been two box sets - one before 1975 and one after.  There is simply too much good material to choose from and any music aficionado would argue which era was the most critically productive.<br /><br />Collectively, this is one of the best box sets to have come from that time period and even if you can't have all the albums fairly represented, at least someone took the effort to include the absolute best from all the band members over the years.<br /><br />Trivia:  Amazing that out of all the songs over the years, \\"Dreams\\" (a former solo song from Nicks) was the only Fleetwood Mac song to go to #1 on the Billboard Charts.e years.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The Star Wars DVD was what I ordered and expected. It even came a day earlier than I had anticipated.
0316113077|5.0|I love this book!  I just made the swiss meringue buttercream (having never made any sort of frosting in my life) and it was delicious.  Took it to a birthday party and was enjoyed by all.  The instructions are laid out very well in this book, and that made it easy to cut the recipe in half and have it still taste good and look good.<br /><br />I also made the purse cake earlier this year.  My first try at fondant.  Again, I found the instructions to be very thorough and easy to follow.  And the chocolate cake recipe for that was delicious as well and past the taste-test of my co-workers who are very picky.  haha!<br /><br />Overall, the projects in this book are a lot of fun and I find they are helping me to learn to work with cake ingredients I hadn't before - such as gumpaste and fondant - and are making me get adventurous in my decorating.<br /><br />Looking forward to her next one.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|If you like hard driving percussion, distorted guitar, and piano all in one, then this is the album for you. Actually, Black Holes and Revelations is rather varied in its pace, vocal qualities, and use of instruments. There is certainly the sound of Radiohead, Coldplay, and The Killers mixed in with the likes of Keane and Snow Patrol. When this musical era is classified in the future, Muse will likely be in this mix.    Two representative tunes from Black Holes and Revelations that are worth the listen to test the waters are Starlight and Map of the Problematique. This is a very good album, but like usual, I reserve 5 stars for the extraordinary (e.g., Throwing Copper from Live).
0316143472|5.0|Sedaris has a talent not only for being hysterically witty, but also for poignancy. Each of his stories in this volume is a perfect package. He's especially mastered his endings; they blew me away, one after the next after the next. Each in a different way. I was fairly astounded that he was able to pull it off in every single story, making his neat little endings pack a punch each time. I feel for the people who don't understand Sedaris' wit and genius, because you're missing out on some universal humor here. He's brilliant.
B0000549B2|1.0|In the midst of the recent Eastwood-Lee controversy, I feel that I should submit this review.  When Eastwood's \\"Bird\\" came out,  Lee disparaged Clint because of the fact he was White and had no business doing a film on a prominent Black musician. Of course this was a ploy by Spike to promote this film which promptly alienated me from ever watching a Spike Lee movie in its entirety.  Along with \\"Jungle Fever\\", this has to be one of Lee's worst movies.  For instance, in one nightclub scene, all we see are mostly Blacks in the club but I know for a fact that most of the clients there are mixed, Black, White, Latino, Asian, etc.  Also what period was Lee setting this in? If it is the present then why does he have them wear Zoot suits which was a fixture of the '40. Plus the most objection piece of business Lee put into the film was the inclusion of the greedy Jewish clubowners.  To me this smacks of Anti-Semitism and to put injury to blame, he used an Italian-American (the often used but brilliant John Turturro) for this gross caricature. I know there are a lot of Jews do own clubs in NYC but they have also been been beneficial to the plight of the musicians, Black or White, by putting on benefits to cover their medical expenses by using their clubs.  Another ugly example of Spike's writing is the incident of the French woman who is mal-treated and made fun of by the musicians in the club. This struck me as plain mis-oygnistic. I know a number of African-American actors and writers who really hate Spike Lee!!  One female writer, in particular, told me at conference in LA that when she posed a question as to why there aren't enough Black women in his films, Lee shouted back at her, \\"Shut up you n--er B--h(euphemism for a female dog).  Now Lee is continuing his on slaught at Eastwood by saying why weren't there any blacks in his WWII films in order to promote his war movie.  Anyway, I'm sorry to digress here but if you want to see a better film on Jazz then see either \\"Bird\\" or \\"Round Midnight\\"- 2 films Lee himself put down. Perhaps I should give this an extra star for the excellent Terrence Blanchard score-maybe Spike should take screenwriting course before I change my mind.
B0002KQNJU|3.0|I purchased this movie because I,ve seen it before. Love those old campy B Movies.
B00005MP58|5.0|The absolute best movie overall I have ever seen. No vulgarity PERIOD. Colin Firth was perfect in every facial expression and executed every action perfectly. Everyone in this film was so good.     I never ever expected to see such excellence in a film. For the first time in my 66 years of life I wanted to know everything about the producers, directors, cameramen, stuntmen, or in other words absolutely every single person involved. It was SUPERB!!! WONDERFUL!!!!!    But!!----Most of all----IT IS PROOF POSITIVE----that wonderfully entertaining clean films can be done today with SUCCESS.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|For anyone that's actually worked retail, this is an excellent choice.  In some parts, it's painfully accurate; in others, it's a realization of what many wish they could do and not lose the job at which they work.  (At least it was like that for me.)  Upon the first viewing, it's obvious that it's low budget; but once you think about it, do you really need a budget to describe a day in the life of your average Clerk?  Not really.    All that aside; it's a hilarious, albeit filthy movie.  Additionally the special edition is chock full o' extras, including the somewhat more depressing director's cut.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Cloverfield is a great movie.  It is a movie you have to go see with no assumptions because if you do it will not be good.  I really like how we finally get a proper monster movie in America like they have had in Japan for decades.  The movie is making fun of the whole movie genre in its own way.  The cast is great because it doesn't have the big name actors which makes it more of a reality feel.  The shaking camera will make you sick if you have vertigo.  I did hear that when people were watching in the theathre Old People were having heart problems and e.m.t.'s were coming.  If you are really old or get Vertigo don't watch this movie.  This movie rocks it is a roller coaster ride of a movie.
0743297334|1.0|i had to read this book for my senior english class. now normally i try to be optamistic about assigned reading but that was nearly impossible to do conserning this piece of literature. one of the main things that annoyed me the most about this book was that the narrator doesnt even introduce new characters. or rather he will introduce them in fragments later on. he just talks about a brand spankin new character as if you had already known them your entire life.      another thing that bothered me is the fact the this book goes absolutely nowhere. the narrator just tells about his day. everyhting about his day. where he went to eat what he drank, what person he ran into. its like a minute-by-minute recount of his day. it takes so long reading just the filler that, when there actually is something important going on, you completely miss it.      also some characters go off on some completely random subjects, its hard to make out their point. if there is any point to be made at all.      through most of the book i was in a daze trying to force myself to read and comprehend this book when all i was really doing was looking at the words without paying attention to them. i COULDNT pay attention to them.      this book might be fine in dandy for people who like rambling, annoying, old style literature; but for younger, more modern people... it is a HUGE WASTE OF TIME. not that some of us really have a choice in the matter, we have to read it if we wanna have a decent grade in english class.
B000P0J024|5.0|Just received this three disc set and immediately watched \\"The Making Of\\" DVD.  I loved watching these power-house performers have fun and create such joyful music.  End Of The Line is so much fun to watch and listen to.  It's a great way to start your day.  Tweeter And The Monkey Man is Dylan to the core ... witty, puzzling and thought provoking, fun.  Handle With Care seems so happy and yet when really listening to the lyrics it's a bit heartbreaking too.  There's not a bad song in the bunch. It looks like they had a great time making the album and I had a great time listening and watching. The moon and stars must have aligned themselves just right to get these guys in the same place at the same time with a common goal ... to have fun and make good music.  Gonna run outside and see if the sky is yella! Thanks guys!
B0014I4KIK|2.0|This CD was a disappointment to me.  The song I had heard \\"Mercy\\" is excellent.  The rest of the CD is slow and not very good.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I am a big lover of anime and always looking to improve my collection.  This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, hands down.  Along with the beautiful animation is a story in which you can completely lose your self.  I don't want to go into the exact storyline of the movie, but if I had only one movie to own for the rest of my life, this would be it.  Enjoy ^_o
1559210400|5.0|Since I read the Good Earth, I fell in love with the authors' style and the wonderful way of delivering her message. This book is a piece of art.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|Seriously I love this album! I can't stop playing it. It's the type of CD you play when your in a lax mood. Fav tracks would have to be Hometown Glory and Cold Shoulder. This is a must have, Enjoy :o)
048622709X|1.0|i was excited to buy a book about drawing hands but the drawings in this book ended up being strangely stunted and deformed. they look nothing like real hands. the artist isn't very good and the instruction is crude at best. it was a waste of money.
B00003CWOL|3.0|If you like Kevin Smith movies, you'll recognize his style throughout this one: non-stop cussing, complex (almost incomprehensible) dialog, extreme irreverence, it's all there. Plus, a s*** demon.    If you don't like Smith, stay away. If you're not familiar with him, start with one of his other movies, preferably Clerks, to first get used to his method/madness.    There is a plot in this movie. It's a funny idea. But it doesn't really go anywhere. It really bogs down in the middle section, before pulling out a good ending, one in which Smith goes all the way with his premise. But don't expect any deep religious philosophy from this. We're talking about Kevin Smith here.    Some funny moments. Jay & Silent Bob are great as usual. So is Alan Rickman. Affleck and Damon play fallen angels like frat boys, which some might find grating. Jason Lee and Salma Hayek are wasted. Linda Fiorentino is unfortunately very hard to hear. Can she speak up, please? Maybe put some inflection in her voice? At least there are small cameos by Janeane Garofalo and George Carlin. And the actor chosen to play God is a funny surprise. (IMDB tells me it was originally supposed to be Holly Hunter, which explains one of Jay's bizarre lines in the movie.)
B001AACEP8|4.0|\\"One of the Boys\\" is great for what it is: catchy and timely pop music. No doubt about it, these are some very well-crafted tunes, designed to quickly grab and release without leaving any long-term damage. You might find yourself humming a few well after the songs end. Loaded with easy melodies and perfect production (Ballard has not lost his mass-appeal touch), it's harmless fun.<br /><br />But don't look for Alanis here. This is pure and simple \\"sing and dance\\" stuff. Nothing to trouble you or cause you to reflect. \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" is an irresistible piece of ear-candy and the cd overall is much the same.<br /><br />You'll like it fast and then move on to the next thing of the week. Enjoy!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|\\"It was Really Good!!\\"<br /><br />(I sent it to him for his birthday, plus an amazon gift card)
B0013D8LOK|2.0|\\"Sweeny Todd\\" is a failure on far too many levels to merit the accolades it has garnered from the press.  Its dark photography and over the top set design try to imbue the film with atmosphere, but the techniques employed are so self-conscious as to have the opposite effect.  The result is a visually flat, monochromic film without flair or genuine imagination.      Johnny Depp's acting performance is the film's only saving grace, but a singer he is not.  Then again, he is Pavarotti compared to the rest of the cast, especially Helena Bonham Carter, whose voice is so thin that she sounds like an ailing Minnie Mouse on helium.  With her rat's nest hairdo, she looks like a female counterpart of Tim Burton, which is a shame since she is an exceptional actress and (otherwise)easy on the eye.      Tim Burton's direction is so clumsily stylized that it becomes a parody of itself.  Ultimately, his helmsmanship gives us a film with all the dramatic tension of a Viagra commercial.   Speaking of which, there is no hint of chemistry between Depp and Bonham Carter, which ultimately renders their evil collaboration meaningless and as flat as the rest of the film.  Blood is no substitute for cinematic skill.  Leave to gore to George A. Romero, who does it with flair and style, two characteristics \\"Sweeny Todd\\" lacks in spades.    However, if you enjoy camp or merely suffer chronic insomnia, \\"Sweeny Tood\\" may be just the film for you.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia is a good thriller thats worth buying for many reasons:<br /><br />Its a top notch cast. Al Pacino gives one of his his finest late performances as the detective who can't sleep investigating a murder. Robin Williams matches Pacino in his second great role that year (see One Hour Photo for the other), and the always good Hilary Swank gives a very good performance supporting the two main leads.<br /><br />The director is Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige), who seems to have a natural talent for these type of films. He does a fine job with the actors as well as capturing the sometimes haunting nature of the Alaskan landscape. Nolan is helped by a taught script, and with a running time of less than 2 hours, you will find it difficult to sleep through.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original 1997 version of this film. From what I've heard its the better of the two, which means it must be very good. However for a mainstream Hollywood movie this remake is remarkably restrained and makes compulsive viewing.
B0018AK9RK|4.0|Priest is a band that has reinvented itself a number of times over the years to keep up with the times.  More remarkably, they have done so successfully.  After the synth guitar driven sound of Turbo and the rather flat Ram It Down, most everybody was taken aback by the brilliant intensity of Painkiller, an album many fans thought to be the regrettable, albeit fitting, swansong for the band as Halford left following that tour.  When they reconvened a few years ago to release Angel of Retribution, that album was also a hit with fans and critics.    Whether or not Nostradamus will receive the same accolades is an open question.  After the fast and heavy Angel of Retribution, the more down tempo of the majority of Nostradamus will doubtless not sit well with some fans, and at over two sprawling hours of music, there are some less than brilliant spots on the album. Nonetheless, Priest has on this record tapped into the wave of progressive metal explored by younger bands like Kamelot, in a convincing and enjoyable way, and there are great tracks (both up and down tempo) peppered throughout both disks.    The packaging for the special edition is really a treat.  The look and feel is reminiscent of a children's book, except for, you know, the demons and skulls and whatnot.  As promised, a code was included in the special edition that I was able to redeem for a free ticket to the Dallas show.  I was particularly suspicious about this.  I figured there had to be a catch, but no, you just have to register on livenation as you would if you were going to purchase a ticket normally, select the \\"metalmaster\\" ticket option, put in your code, and whammo, they mail you the ticket.  Not even so much as a handling fee.
B00005JNEI|5.0|After seeing this movie I can't imagine any thinking person supporting the Bush administration.  This producer is either loved or hated as is his material.  We will continue to support and purchase all movies produced by Michael Moore.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|First off I want to say that I didn't know what to expect from the latest Shinedown record. I was going to buy it regardless because I am a fan of this band, but I thought it would probably have a few great songs that I would listen to over and over, and then some songs that would be middle off the road. Was I ever mistaken. I logged onto the band's website the night before the release and was able to listen to the entire album right on their site. I was blown away by every song! This album might end up topping the success of \\"Leave a whisper\\" (Which was a 5 out of 5 album itself) and pulling in new fans who didn't know this side of Shinedown.     The album has more of an edge to it which I love, and then the few songs that are slower couldn't have been more heart-felt and beautifully crafted. Check out how good Brent makes \\"Call me\\" sound. Any other band might make this type of song one I skip over, but this is a stand out track. The album couldn't open any better (energetic and in your face), and it couldn't end any better. Although I want to point out that I purchased the fan club disc for $20 at bestbuy. Totally worth it for the 3 bonus tracks at the end of the disc (\\"I owe you\\", \\"The Energy\\", and \\"Son of Sam\\") and a year to the band's fan club.     All I can say is \\"Thank You\\" to Shinedown for making the year's best Rock album to date and I hope they set a Connecticut tour date soon, because after the release of \\"The Sound of Madness\\" I can't wait to see these songs live as well as all the other hits that make this band one of the best in today's Modern rock scene. Album is 5 out of 5 stars without a doubt. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|First off FINALLY!!! It took forever for this album to come out, and im still not sure if it was worth the wait. I think we can all agree that this is not the same offspring that we are used to, but that doesn't mean its bad. I'm rating this as I listen to the album for the second time and i have mixed feelings on one hand there are some great tracks on here \\"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\\" is on its way to becoming one of my favorite Offspring songs, it doesn't sound like a lot of the other stuff they've dont but it still has the great Offspring feel. On the other hand I would like to shoot whoever is responsible for \\"A Lot Like Me\\", because this is NOT an Offspring song. The whole album is a lot more melodic and vocaly driven than their other guitar driven albums, so ya i give it a 4 out of 5 because its not great but its still the Offspring and lets be honest, a couple great Offspring songs are better than most other albums.
B0013FXWX8|4.0|This movie was a real treat.  I basically didn't care for the idea of a Kung Fu movie, but I loved that Jack Black vocalized the main role.  I also totally was on board when I heard Seth Rogan had a part. (He's turned into quite the voice artist; he was wonderful in Horton Hears A Who and hilarious as the voice of a magical creature in Spiderwick Chronicles).  Now I don't mind watching a kids animated movie with my children.  Most of the time I'm at least slightly bored.  But this movie soars above similar movies...for instance Madagascar, Over the Hedge, etc. The plot line was clever and cute.  The story line didn't dumb things down for the kids...and the jokes were just plain funny.  Po was a character worth rooting for and so were his colleagues. The story often kept away from doing the expected thing which in turn made the movie all the more fun and entertaining.  This is one of the few animated 'kid' movies that I think is worth at least a matinee price to go see. Adults, as well as kids, should have a great time at this movie.
0385340567|3.0|Jack, what's the deal?  All that walking back and forth and back and forth between Hope and Despair made me tired just reading it.  There were only a few fist fights with people too weak to put up much of a defense.  The action was missing and not at all suspenseful.  What is with all the political rhetoric?  And why would Jack be so down on the Military?  I'm in healthcare and the scene from the VA clinic was beyond believable, come on?  Jack sounded very disillusioned and a little whiney in this book.  And for godness sake, buy a backpack or a suticase already.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. In fact, my daughter borrowed it, lent it to someone else and it was never returned, so this is my second copy! i don't think a movie with a cast like this can miss - Sidney Poitier, Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell (amazing scene where she tricks some guy into saying all the words necessary to gain access to his office) , Dan Ackroyd (in a brilliantly understated role!), the late River Phoenix and David Strathairn (wait till he drives!)! Even though the computer technology is ancient by today's standards, it is still a fast moving adventure. Plus it's fun to tell the kids - yeah, that's what a computer used to look like...
B000058983|5.0|No album, even Sergeant Pepper's, captures the ambience of the 1960's for me like this one. A bittersweet collection of often tender, Spanish-influenced melodies with a folk psychelic flavor and some sad racial overtones--Arthur Lee, like Jimi Hendrix, was an avant-garde Black artist doing rock at a time when music was segregated and his place uncertain and lonely. A truly great recording.
0805079831|5.0|THE SHOCK DOCTRINE clearly presents the current status of international economics that has been brought about by the global corporatist state.  It is the most enlightening and inspiring book that I have read for several decades.  It also made me very angry.  Although I could clearly see the consequences of global corporatism, I had only a fuzzy notion of how the present state of the world had come about.  Naomi Klein made it all clear, for which I most sincerely thank her.  The callous stupidity  of Bremer's actions in Iraq, such as firing thousands of policemen, firemen, and other state workers, and demolishing elections in order to install Saddam-era military leaders as local governors certainly made no sense until put into the context of the drive to privatization.  The Bush administration wanted us to believe that their war was not for oil, yet one of the outstanding consequences of the war is that US and European corporations now have completely taken control of oil away from Iraq.  If the war had actually been for \\"Iraqi freedom\\" it is almost certain that the US would have won.  Actually, the US corporations did win the war; only the US citizens and the Iraqi citizens lost, and neither of us count.    A recent Yahoo headline stated that only 17% of Americans are in favor of the direction in which America is heading.  Making an educated guess, I would bet that most of these Americans comprise the 4% to 5% of Americans who own 85% or so of America's wealth, and the Ann-Coulter kooks who are convinced that God wants America to conquer the Islamic nations and force them to become Christians.  I have to wonder where the majority of Americans have been for the past thirty years.  Did they not realize that America has been going in that same direction for at least that long?  Now we have travelled so far along this route that its effects are potentially far more disastrous than they have already proven to be.    Economists who bought Milton Friedman's claim of scientific economics have much of which to be ashamed, both from a professional standpoint and from that of human decency.  One gets a clear sense of both the flimsy ethical and logical grounding of laissez-faire capitalism in Adam Smith's WEALTH OF NATIONS.  Smith acknowledges that the \\"masters,\\" as he calls them, must pay their workers enough wages to support a wife and two children, so that the masters will have a steady supply of future workers.  He further acknowledges that the workers live in such miserable conditions that half of their children will die before the age of manhood so they must have four instead of only two children.  He neither defends nor condemns the economic system that results in this high death rate; he simply takes it for granted as natural. Smith also takes it for granted that all people naturally have no higher goal in life than to make as much money as they possibly can, and as long as governments do not restrict this natural inclination to self-interest, then the \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" will magically work to bring about the best possible state for everyone.  He states this as if it were a self-evident fact despite the lack of evidence to support it, and in the face of much evidence against it.  Friedman claimed that his economic model was scientific and mathematically sound, despite the fact that for at least for the last several decades economics has been recognized as a non-linear system for which precise mathematical models are not even possible.  Friedman's Chicago School economists also take it for granted that the bulk of humanity exists for no purpose except to supply non-unionized sweat-shop fodder.  It is incredible that any honest economist could ever have been naive enough to actually believe in the \\"trickle down,\\" or the \\"elevator\\" model of lawless capitalism - an outcome comparably improbable to the \\"withering away of the state\\" that was supposed to occur under Communism.        The mantra by which Friedman corporatists justify castrating all social programs:  \\"It is a major error to believe that it is possible to do good with other people's money.\\"  This assertion takes it for granted that an economic system in which the \\"masters\\" make 400 times more than the people who actually do the labor, including the creative ones who actually devise the products that make the masters rich, have actually earned and have an inalienable right to their wealth.  Since Corporatism requires constant growth it is often compared to cancer, the only other organism with a philosophy of constant growth and destruction of the organism upon which it feeds.  Klein convincingly demonstrates that corporatism has created an economy that thrives on, and has now become dependent on, disasters, yet she writes \\"the disaster capitalism complex does not deliberately scheme to create the cataclysms on which it feeds,\\" so no conspiracies are required.  I am not so sure.  Klein points out that over a third of the nation believes that the Bush administration was either responsible for the 9/11 catastrophe or knew about it but did nothing to prevent it, but dismisses the idea with no further discussion.  How remarkable is it that over a third of the US population hates the Bush cohorts so vehemently that they believe them guilty of the mass murder American citizens?  I once dismissed this accusation as lunatic paranoia, but I not bothered to examine the evidence.   Anyone watching the video recording of the collapse can see that as the top of one of the towers began to topple, there was an enormous explosion just beneath this section, followed by a series of explosions throughout the building as it underwent symmetrical collapse at nearly free fall speed.  It certainly looked just like planned demolition. One of the experts on the 9/11 Conspiracy Theory History Channel special assured us that buildings just naturally collapse like that.  If this is true, then the demolition experts whose job it is to make buildings undergo symmetrical collapse must be guilty of fraud.  The Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth organization have tested the rubble from the explosion and found traces of thermate, an explosive used to melt steel.  There are photographs of melted steel girders in the wreckage.  It is absolutely true that neither the heat from the jet fuel nor the inflammables found in the building could have melted those girders.         Though Klein depicts the world under the domination of corporatism as grim, her book ends with optimistic indications that people have caught on to how corporatists take advantage of disasters, so the method no longer work as well; unfortunately corporatism is still going strong in the US.  Corporatism has long gotten away with associating the evils of Communism with socialistic democracy, while at the same time the threat of Communism forced Capitalism to temper its extremists by adopting social programs.  Since the past fifty years have demonstrated that \\"free markets\\" and free people are contradictory concepts, we can only hope Americans will be able to learn from the socialist trends currently arising in South America and other parts of the world.  While the corporatists like to equate social democracy with fascism, what it really means is that production is controlled by the workers and engineers who actually produce the wealth, rather than by investors who do very little beyond sucking up the bulk of the wealth.
B0000027I6|5.0|I don't know what it is about Roger's work since 1977, but as much as I love the guy with Floyd and without and as much as I expect to like his work, I almost never do when I first hear it.  The Wall is probably the exception as I'd heard enough of that on radio to have some familiarity with it before I heard the whole thing, so the songs I knew and the overall theatrical nature of it pulled me in right away.    But the Final Cut (which is actually \\"Pink Floyd,\\" but many consider to be something of a Waters solo album since he wrote and sang pretty much all of it), The Pros and Cons of Hitchiking, Radio KAOS and now Amused To Death all didn't appeal to me on first listen, probably because there aren't many \\"catchy\\" songs that have immediate appeal.  But that's not what Pink Floyd was about (they rarely released singles), and it's certainly not what Waters' solo career has been about either.  He creates ALBUMS that tell a story or touch on concepts, so to evaluate it song-by-song is to miss the point.  One really has to listen to the whole thing, and more than once, before forming an opinion.    Plus, did you ever notice how the immediately catchy/appealing songs are usually the ones you tire of most quickly and the ones that grow on you are the ones you love for life?  Well, so it is for Waters.    Songs like the single \\"What God Wants\\" grabbed me right away as well as a couple of others early on in this one (\\"Perfect Sense,\\" \\"The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range\\"), but then the lengthy sound effects between songs and just the overall length of the cd made me lose some interest.  It wasn't as appealing to me as the previous album (Radio KAOS), which grew on me tremendously after repeated listenings and seeing the concert, so I wanted and expected to immediately love Amused To Death.  When I didn't, I just set it aside and said \\"Oh well....\\".      So there this cd sat for years with my opinion of it as being \\"so-so\\" until Waters went on tour in 1999.  When I found he was doing the song \\"Amused To Death\\" and \\"It's A Miracle\\" as part of his set (the two last songs on the cd), I figured I should give them a listen to familiarize myself with them, and when I did.... wow.  Those are two really great songs!!  So naturally, I went back and listened to the whole cd to let more of the album's concepts sink in and find out how these two final songs fit in with the earlier songs I had liked.  Then  I listened again.  Then again.  And again.  And again and again and again until it was quite obvious that this was indeed a(nother) Waters masterpiece.     So I can actually understand the reviews here that are luke-warm or even downright negative, but I will say that those posters would probalby like this album a lot more if they listened to it thoroughly at least 2-3 times in its entirety with special attention paid to the lyrics.  The music is solid too, particularly with Jeff Beck on guitar, but not so strong or catchy that much of it will grab you without the extra emotion that the lyrics deliver.    At the end of the day though, I agree with Roger that if you're going to have just 1 of his solo albums, this is the one to have, and that the holy trinity of Waters' albums is definitely Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall and this one, AMUSED TO DEATH.     Now if he would just put out ANOTHER one!!
B000VT6FAO|5.0|Dave has done a wonderful job in this album...he keeps his voice and talent...the colaboration of Eigner and Philpot makes this album fantastic. You can feel Dave's personal touch in hourglass, kingdom...some of the songs resemble a little bit Martin Gore's dark style....Love Martin Gore's writing and music by the way. Hourglass is beautiful music, made by talented musicians.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This record is absolutely beautiful! Not a bad track here. The saddest song is Not Enough, and my very favorite. Emmy wrote that one of course. I get chills everytime I hear her sing! No one on this planet can sing like her. Her voice is a gift from GOD! It sounds just like an angel. Not Enough has to be written for Gram Parsons. She has never been able to let go of the love she had for him. It is to bad that she never had the chance to tell him. She makes you want to run and tell that person exactly how you feel. Life is to short! Go run out and buy this CD. If you are a fan like I am, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY AT ALL. It is about time. I have waited 5 years for this record. Well worth the wait!!!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|'Coldplay' are unquestionably at their most creative peak right now.  Just like other great 'progressive' bands they draw some influences from (The Church, Rush, XTC, Radiohead), they have retained elements of their recognizable signature sound of previous 'albums', yet have managed to expand their musical forays in a slightly different direction later in their career.  There is a good mix of uptempo, and slower, more introspective and ethereal music on 'VLV'.  Brian Eno's 'footprint' is clearly evident here, and that is a good thing.  There is much texture and layers here without the whole thing sounding 'overproduced' or pretentious.  Frankly, this is a MASTERPIECE, and unlike ANYTHING i've heard since first listening to all kinds of music way back in the 70's while in high school.  Sonically, the CD sounds excellent as well, with much less 'compression' and good dynamic range.  Play it on a good set of cans (headphones) or thru a high quality sound system, and you'll be amazed (MP3's/iPODs are convenient, but pale in sound quality compared to a good CD or LP record)!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|This is a classic movie that will inspire you.  It is clean cut and great for the entire family.
B00006V9A0|5.0|For some reason I never even knew this album existed. It's basically a \\"Best Of\\" compilation with the last recorded song with Kurt on it. For a pretty good collective of the music landscape changing geniuses, this is pretty good. For a cheap starting point I would recommend the first two albums but for any not sure of where to go with Nirvana, this is an excellant CD including \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" and \\"Rape Me\\" - that is for sure, one of my all time fav performances by Nirvana.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|the alien trilogy is my favorite of all sci-fi films and i'm so thankful to amazon for making it possible for me to purchase the whole set on dvd so that i can enjoy them with my grandson who is also an avid fan. thanks again. also i want to thank amazon for their outstanding customer service.when i realized that i should have received them in the mail(and had not), i called them and even though the records showed that they had been delivered, they promptly sent out another one. thanks again Amazon!!
B000002J09|4.0|Everyone I knew had this album when I was a teenage stoner and it's not only because it's what all the other stoners expected you to have - it's just a damn good album and thanks to all those Zep heads out there, it's now been remastered with a little help by some of the members. So I get \\"Rock & Roll\\", \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and all the others in full glory. Makes me wanna smoke up, but maybe I'll just pour myself some wine and go back to the Carly Simon albums - age sucks.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|There are some very nice tracks on here, and I do enjoy the new sound Coldplay is adding to their body of work. Personally, I enjoy X&Y and Parachutes much more than this album as a whole. But this is still really good. \\"Lost\\" is one of my favorites, definitely a really encouraging song if you're dealing with failure in your life. (There is an acoustic version of this one out that sounds really good also) \\"42\\" is an amazing song, I particularly like the switch-up from the beginning to the mid-section. The hidden song after \\"Yes\\", \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\" is so relaxingly danceable (an odd yet refreshing contrast). Viva La Vida is my favorite up-tempo song from Coldplay...VERY VERY NICE, and Violet Hill is also excellent. I love the backwards-played guitars in Strawberry Swing. It has a great summertime feel. Death and all His Friends has a bit of a \\"Fix You\\" vibe to the vocals toward the end. Overall the album is really good, and finds Coldplay moving in a new experimental direction production-wise. VIVA LA VIDA!!
B000B5UL7G|3.0|Oh, how I love my hottie Robbie, for some insane reason this man can chalk up hit after hit in the UK but he has never found any real success in the US - other than my impassioned love for his hotness. None the less, Intensive Care is not quite as good as some of his previous stuff and for some reason I'm beginning to fear that my boy may be repeating his albums - they're starting to resemble each other in sound, but that's not necessarily bad. I mean this album contains \\"Trippin'\\" which has a very unique sound but then there's the standard ballads \\"Sin, Sin, Sin\\" and my fav ballad \\"Pure\\" (\\"oh lord, please make me pure but not yet.\\") and the cheeky lyrics we expect from the hotness that is Robbie. No matter what, I'll still buy all his albums and posters and snatch his wet towel from the stage, but that's just how I am.
B00154GEFU|2.0|Asia's new release, Phoenix, seems to be an attempt for the four seasoned musicians to recapture the magic of their 1980s success. The problem with this plan is the 80s are long over. Successful bands that have managed to survive and thrive over the last few decades (REM, U2, Rush, XTC, etc.) have done so because of their growth as musicians. These bands took risks to reinvent and redefine their sound. This is essentially why Asia continues to disappoint me. Considering that each of the core members of this super-group hails from a progressive-rock background, it seems ironic that Asia's output has been one of virtually no progression since their masterful debut album those many years ago.    On the surface, the music is okay. If I was 14 I might actually enjoy it. Where to begin? I'm reminded of a line in Spinal Tap where one reviewer remarked that Tap's musical growth could not be charted. Downes must be unaware that keyboards can produce a variety of sounds; he seems to use the same settings on every track. Steve Howe's talents are sorely wasted on this record; his guitar-playing is too-often eclipsed by the heavy-handed church-style keyboards of Downes. Palmer's effort as percussionist is pedestrian to the point that he could have been replaced by a session musician or a drum machine. From a song-writing perspective, Wetton (whether with Asia, Downes, or as a solo performer) seems to be content in treading through a sea of rehashed themes--too many monosyllabic songs about unrequited love and relationships that end in betrayal. Too many four-chord ballads. It's deja vu all over again. The two lengthier tracks on Phoenix are the record's only saving grace because there is enough going on to actually entertain the mind, though even these tracks do not even remotely compare with, for example, UK's debut release.    On one of Phoenix's tracks Wetton laments, \\"It's the end of the book with no more pages to turn.\\" I'm forced to agree. Asia seems to have peaked on itsdebut album and have been trying ever since to equal or surpass it. But, rather than simply opening the book and adding another page, it would be nice to see Asia actually begin a new book. Unfortunately, Wetton and company either cannot progress or they are consciously choosing to avoid progression under the assumption that it's easier to spoon-feed their fan base another bowl of unflavored oatmeal.
B000001FDK|5.0|The soundtrack to Grease is actually one of the five albums that changed my life. When I was a tee weeny little boy, this soundtrack and the film were the first real adult type of fare that I came across which actually affected me in any way. T    he film was so exciting to me I made every relative I had take me to see it claiming I had never seen it before. My Aunt and I listened to it on my Grandma's big record player in the living room - one of those things that look like a cabinet but actually house a record player and in Grandma Ferlie's case an 8 track player. Then I made my mom buy me the 8-track for myself.     I sang every song as if it were my own and as if I knew what half the words meant. \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"You're The One That I Want\\", \\"Greased Lightning\\" - not to mention the 1,2 punch of sassy pants Rizzo with her teaser \\"Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee\\" and \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\", plus the Sha Na Na whole middle of 50's dance music, and the Cindy Bullens sung \\"It's Raining On Prom Night\\", \\"Freddy My Love\\" and \\"Mooning\\" from the original play (which I didn't even know existed at the time). The soundtrack to Grease made me grow up and to this day I still get sucked in to both the flick and the soundtrack and it made me a life long Livvie fan.    Plus my very first ever time performing live was as a 6 year old kid getting up with a live band and singing the duet \\"You're The One That I Want\\" as a solo - yeah I was cool like Zuko.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|If you are a fan of The Offspring, you will like at least 1/2 the tracks on this album and that is enough for most people to make it worth a purchase.  For me, that is about right for most albums that I buy. Its the rate album that really comes through with every track.<br /><br />For the most part, the strongest tracks stick to the Offspring formulas that have worked in the past. Missing are one or two completely quirky, humorous songs and the band claims the album is simply a darker work than in the past.<br /><br />The obvious influence of Green Days album \\"American Idiot\\" are blatant. Not a bad thing but I wonder if the influence is from the band or the producers? Either way, the album still comes through with some really catchy rock/punk and even a few decent ballads and some of the same themes as American Idiot. And the Offspring style is still 100% in tact.<br /><br />So, Offspring fans can find a lot to like here as well as punk/rock fans.<br /><br />Favorite Track: You're Gonna Go Far, Kid<br />RIYL: Green Day
B00005J6T1|4.0|I am in no way shape or form a big Madge fan, but back when she was just beginning I admit it, I was on her jellied bracelet hand. The self titled debut, sometimes dubbed \\"The First Album\\" is a little piece of 80s fun from way back when I wasn't sick of looking at her. My pal Melsie and I listened to this album over and over when we were teens. The singles everyone knows but it's songs like \\"I Know It\\" that make this one a great little dose of nostalgia.
0452289963|5.0|I love this book.  Tolle describes ancient truths and applies them to life in the 21st century in a way that is inspiring and comforting. I took away from this book three simple, yet profound ideas. First and foremost, Tolle believes that we are all connected to each other and that everything we do matters and has an impact on our world. His second idea lies in the power of listening: he suggests that if we can quiet our egos long enough to truly listen, it is possible to feel a sacredness and inner harmony where everything has its perfect place. And lastly, the author speaks of the power of awareness. The moment you notice a pattern of behavior that is  no longer working for you, you are a success.      Reading this book reminded me of the writings of two of my favorite authors: Ariel and Shya Kane.  In their books [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]] and [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]][, the Kanes teach a fun and easy way to live fully and joyously in the moment.  Their approach is practical and magical at the same time.  If you like Tolle's work you're bound to love the Kane's.  All of these books are treasures to be enjoyed.
B000001FSP|5.0|I had heard of Ms. Marianne from her countless downfalls in the press in the 60s - once a high octave diva singing Rolling Stones covers but all that changed with this 1979 album.     I first discovered Broken English after reading about it in one of the Women In Rock books which talked about the song \\"Why'd You Do It\\" and once I read the great review I immediately found a copy. On and off my CD player since then, I had to take this out for a spin this week and it's just as good as I remember it. Gone is the sweet Faithfull of the 60s replaced with punkish dance rock, a cigarette filled voice and attitude personified. All you have to do is listen to the moody \\"The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan\\" about a mother's breakdown, or the aforementioned kiss off - \\"Why'd you do it she said/ why'd you let her suck ... well you'll buy it and you'll know the obscenity filled rest, she can even cover John Lennon with ease and all of that is only the beginning to this great album.
0920668372|1.0|I agree with the reviews that say this storyline is a little twisted. The mother running after her son until her weak old age and going to extremes to express her love. However, I don't think my kids thought anything of that. What I did have a problem with was the portrayal of a no good kid. As a toddler, He's flushing things down the toilet ( and my 7 year old thought that was especially funny...did I mention my toilet is behaving funny?!!)and he continues to be disrespectful and make various messes throughout the book with no apparent concern for his mother at all. I would have liked to have seen some positivity before he reached his own older age. Children not only watch everything we do, they can imitate the examples we allow them to be exposed to. I started to scribble out the lines to change it a little ( my kids will be able to tell if I am not consistently telling it the same way) but it was too much to change.This went in the trash!
B000003TA4|5.0|It's hard to believe the albums that changed my life all seemed to have been around the late 70's and early 80's and I didn't think that would change but then something happened.  In all fairness there wasn't all that much greatness after the beginning of the 80's - by the time I had worn out most of my vinyl from the early 80's I was mulletized, wearing name brand acid washed jeans and trying to hang with the cool kids of the Def Leppard crowd. Of course I never fit in with them but that's probably because I'd run home, watch the Aqua Net out of my hair and put on my Lisa Hartman album.     But by 1991 we had all had enough of hair bands and constant sexual innuendo. Sure, Lita Ford got me through some fits but come on I needed more, so along came a new Messiah and his name was Kurt. He didn't care if you liked him, looked at him or hit him, just as long as you heard him. And we did. But this goes beyond just affecting me with the thrilling moments of angst found on the album, Nirvana brought about a whole movement - I tore those labels off my jeans, I put on the thrift store cords and boots, the flannel and the big ratty sweaters, I let my hair grow. I have to admit though I never went so far as to only bathe by Pachouli but come on I was raised right.     In essence, Nevermind became a voice for people of my inner angst - my age, my outsider status, everything I thought was on the sidelines was suddenly there in front of me. The music had anger, the music had depth, the passion was there in the lyrics and in the performances, and it changed my whole life. I was finally in a place I wanted to be. My own style changed, my writing, my poetry and stories, my lyrics all took on new meaning and I was no longer afraid to write how I really felt - warts and all. It made me an artist - an unpaid artist sure but if you create art and no one's there to pay attention you're still an artist aren't you? Sure you are and so am I - thanks to the life altering album Nevermind.The opening riffs of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" through \\"Breed\\", \\"Come As You Are\\" - each one pushing and pulling at you until you feel the same angst running in your own veins. There's a reason this album is always a top with the critics, it's because it's that powerful, that entertaining and that good.
0452285186|4.0|For some reason, it's completely endearing and hilarious for bunnies to try to commit suicide. Perhaps it's because the ingenious and absurd machines, traps, and situations they put themselves in require a tremendously dark wit, and we don't expect these dandelion munchers to express such cynicism.     There are a number of people who try to imitate Andy Riley's bunny suicide comics, and they sometimes come out all wrong. For example, they tend to show the death of the bunny. This is unfortunate, because the joke is in the reader's mind, trying to figure what the bunny is thinking and how the suicide will work, not showing the reader the gruesome death.     People with a dark sense of humor will enjoy this book, and judging from the way it has been out of stock at some bookstores, there are a lot of us out there.
B000NA2776|4.0|I bought this album as soon as I heard the single \\"Grace Kelly\\" - at that time Mika was a huge deal across the pond and he was slowly making his way over to our side of the world. It's no surprise that he did end up making a bit of a splash if even it was based mostly on the hit single \\"Grace Kelly\\" with its clever use of keyboards, and minimal music tones, and Mika's falsetto, it is the perfect supplement in the world of Scissor Sisters type pop.     The whole album goes on from that catchy opening single including one of my all time favorite songs ever, \\"Lollipop\\" which is so sugary and poppy it almost rots your teeth threw the stereo - I want to do music like this. With each subsequent song Mika just reels in more pseudo love problems and rambling gambling beats. Even his attempts at heart felt ballads have a sort of ironic sense to them, is he really serious? is he just having fun? it's all so fun and undaunting it's hard to turn off even after going through the entire CD.     He's a little bit Freddie Mercury, a little bit Elton John, so basically he's a little bit Scissor Sisters, but there's so much happening here it's infectious. We'll see how his journey stateside treats him, and whether he can come up with another fun little notch in his belt when he gets around to making that next album.
B000NA2776|5.0|I hope that this CD was good, but I never thought that it was enough!!
B00005MNP8|5.0|..after seeing those lines and hearing that music.     Anyone who has ever heard Parallel Lines from start to finish should be affected by it as well. Opening with telephone buzz and breaking into the punky new wave \\"Hanging On The Telephone\\" through 12 songs of neon nuances, organ bounces, sultry cooing and downright new wave genius this is arguably one of the best albums released ever, and that comes from other real critics and not just my blonde head.     When I first saw Debbie Harry on TV singing; I was transfixed. I had to know who she was, what she was, where she was. Once again my Aunt Sarah stepped in by having the Parallel Lines album since they had done a cheerleading routine to \\"Heart Of Glass\\", I stole that record from her and I've never looked back.     The rocking jaunt of \\"One Way Or Another\\", the 60's popness in \\"Sunday Girl\\", the gloomy \\"Fade Away And Radiate\\", \\"11:59\\", \\"Will Anything Happen?\\", \\"I'm Gonna Love You Too\\" - there isn't a bad song on this bunch.     In fact, I used to act out the entire album from beginning to end in my room. There was also one of my neighbor's neices who bought the album and brought it to the the house where I insisted I knew all the words - they laughed at me until they started following along on the lyric sheet while I sang. That's how cool of a kid I was!     Just listen to some of the amazing lyrics and the incredible music and you'll be hooked too - \\"Your mouth is permanently entrenched where a molar should be\\" - how frickin' cool! Parallel Lines made me want to be a singer, it made me want to write songs, it made me proud to be blonde, and it made such an effect on me I can't go without it for more than a few months without pulling it out and playing it from start to finish all over again. And now there's a brand new 30th anniversary addition out and Deb & The Boys are doing the album live on tour! It doesn't get better than that.
B000M341QE|1.0|How is it that an American film director, who's wins a \\"Best Director\\" Oscar for a film that he Plagarized from a Hong Kong film get so much credit as being \\"Great\\" and a \\"Master\\" ????  I'm sure that when he won the Oscar, he wanted to make it sound like this film was an original piece of work.  He didn't even mention that he COPIED THE ENTIRE IDEA from \\"Infernal Affairs\\" during his acceptance speech.    I guess that American critics would call this as a \\"remake\\", but the entire idea of the movie was from Hong Kong.  However, if a foreign film company were to copy an American film idea, there would be law suits that the foreign company has plagarized an American idea.  Where's the justice?  What ever happened to the rights of others?  Is there some kind of double standard?
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|Declaring not only in song but on the promo sheets as well \\"THE QUEEN IS BACK\\" - Donna Summer returns and she ain't messin' with you. Crayons and its black and colored (and very much airbrushed cover photo) completely stands out and deserved to have reached #17 the week it came it out - her biggest in a long long time.     Donna has a ton of collaborators on this very High NRG piece and it opens on a strong beat, practically throwing you onto the floor with \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", also highly infectious and pushy is the aforementioned \\"The Queen Is Back\\" with such clever lyrics as \\"so many years ago/ on the radio/ she loved to love you...\\" Gee who could she be talking about?     Donna's voice is superb (as always) and each song is catchy as hell - my ultimate two favs are actually where she takes a break from the dance mode for a few moments - the title track is a duet with Ziggy Marley so it of course has a reggae-ish beat and the subject matter is of everyone getting along despite color lines which makes it all that more enjoyable to me. I love it.     I also love her poppy ballad \\"The Sand On My Feet\\" which could totally be my wedding song and a hit on pop radio for sure. With Crayons I think Donna has made one of her best albums yet and I can't stop frickin' listening to it. So buy it!     Best cuts: \\"Crayons\\", \\"Sand On My Feet\\", \\"The Queen Is Back\\", \\"Stamp Your Feet\\"
B0012GMVDK|4.0|Its an old one but a good one with lyrics that are as good today as when he wrote them
B000EGCITG|5.0|At one time, the Pink force was lumped together with Britney, Jessica and the like, but since her debut in 2000, she has constantly impressed not only me, but the critics alike.    Doing a 180 in music styles with Mizundastood, and then bringing in Rancid to help her with my favorite release Try This - Pink has continued to amaze me with her voice, her attitude and her take on multiple genres of pop music.    With I'm Not Dead, the whole thing continues. Dropping most of the hard rock feel of Try This, she doesn't go into dance mode or even dance pop, instead she creates a hybrid of everything and most importantly doesn't lose one ounce of that Pink punk spunk.     With the lead off single \\"Stupid Girls\\" her attitude shines through the pop blend but the other songs combine both her need to express herself and to indulge in various music stylings. Bringing on the Indigo Girls for the mostly acoustic and severely scathing \\"Dear Mr. President\\", Pink and the girls force feed Bush some medicine (\\"What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away/ and what kind of father would hate his own daughter if she were gay/ I can just imagine what the First Lady has to say/ You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine...\\").     On the poppiest of the bunch \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" we are led into the all too familiar mode of wanting to be alone while wanting to be with your lover - \\"All I ask for is one f*cking hour.\\" There's the tender ballads that Pink makes all her own as she even has a conversation with her 13 year old self. There's also fun little tracks where the brunt of     Pink's wrath is her own self worth and in sarcastic tones, Pink can celebrate money and fame then turn around and denounce - which may seem like a jumbled mess on paper, but when she pulls it off it says tons about her talent. The critics on this one are not wrong - this is one hell of an album and I can't recommend it enough.
B000002KIE|4.0|I try to come off as some kind of music afficiando all the time, but truth be told I didn't even own this album until two days ago. An album that pretty much changed the landscape of music in the 70s, an album that is revered by all punks through out the world.     So when I was at Tower Records the other day, they had a huge display declaring What's missing from your collection and there it was this Sex Pistols album for only $7. I felt more than compelled to pick it up when also in that rack of what you should own was Stevie Nick's last album which of course I do own. So I picked up this classic album and of course already knew most of the songs.     It's amazing how something at one time so radical can sound not so radical thirty years ago. Of course the reason for that is, is because everyone who wanted to make punk rock started by listening to this album and adding or subtracting from the elements. None have come close to reproducing it because no one else can be the first radicals. Though \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" and \\"God Save The Queen\\" along with \\"Pretty Vacant\\" are forever branded in the mind, there are 9 other classics on this album and through pissiness, thick accents and a lot of drum rolls I am finally in the know... are you?
B000002J2B|3.0|The decline starts in earnest here. There's a few occasional moments of classical melodic prog Genesis raising it's head but the overall experience is like watching a rare graceful animal dying of old age in a sea of commercial banality. The production on the opening track is a giveaway. Essentially a prog song but dressed in the cloths of commerciality that were to become the trademark of 80's genesis. Heavy synth sound abounds, while the guitar and bass, mainstays of the old Genesis, are drowned in the mix. Highlights - \\"One for the Vine\\"- faint echoes of \\"Firth of Fife\\" to be found here; \\"Blood on the rooftops\\" - the standout song, a slow atmospheric ballad that draws you in; some vaguely interesting instrumental tracks; er, that's about it really.
B00009MGGI|5.0|After many years of having been filmed, this trilogy remains a powerful lesson in pragmatic politics. In spite of his evilness, you end up admiring Frances Urkhart for his strategically political thinking, always geared towards pragmatism for achieving his very personal goals. Whoever or whatever stands in his way for reaching his objectives, he always finds a wat out-even if this means corruption and murder.  Definitely any young aspiring politician should watch the series, not for emulating Mr Urkhart, but for aquiring the knowledge of the intricating web of politics and interpersonal relationships that derive from it. A strong lesson in politics, indeed.  Extraordinary performances, very well filmed, and a truly close adaptation from the book.  Every two years I watch the trilogy, and every time I discover new aspects about the plot and complex personality of Mr Urkhart. What a political thriller!
B000002J27|4.0|This is my favourite Genesis album after \\"Selling England\\". For me, the other Peter Gabriel albums are too dense and impenetrable, with too many competing interests, while the Collins era Genesis, while possibly stronger on melody, became way too saccharinely commercial for my tastes.    So what sets \\"Trick of the Tail\\" apart? It's a struggle between the melodic prog leanings of the Gabriel years against the commercial sappiness that engulfed the band in the Collins years. It encapsulates the best of both worlds without being particularly groundbreaking, unlike \\"Selling England\\". It's strong on memorable songs, unlike the sprawling \\"Lamb\\", the melodies and sounds lodge in your mind. \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" and \\"Squonk\\" are excellant musically. Tracks like \\"Ripples\\" and \\"Mad Moon\\", while firmly in the Collins Ballad mould, and \\"Robbery Assault and Battery\\" and the title track, both in the Collins pop song mould, succeed in being blessed with the proggy touch that was to evaporate once Steve Hacket departed. This is their saving grace.    In summary, genuinely good, strong melodic songs with clever prog playing - the balance is just right.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Yea I know what your thinking and yea this DVD is Pricey (Seven Samurai - 3 Disc Remastered Edition Criterion Collection). But The transfer is great, the special features are sweet, and I believe this is the best possible version of Kurosawa's most influential / exciting film ever.  If you are new to Kurosawa this film is a perfect treat to cut your teeth on. Great story, characters, and Plot combined with excellent cinematography add up to one excellent buy.

0385720920|2.0|Choke is a moderately cool and unconventional story with a number of clever elements that unfortunately get lost in a sea of depravity.  Yeah, main character Victor Mancini is a sex addict, and so detailing his exploits is necessary to develop his character- I get it.  But dedicating the vast majority of the book's pages to gratuitous carnal minutiae mires the book's positives in a swamp of bodily fluids.  And the gross stuff isn't limited to just sex, either: Palahniuk projectile vomits the gory details of nose blowing, scatology, and ear candles on Choke's pages (not to mention the particulars of the story's namesake act).<br /><br />As a result, Victor is the only character that fully forms; Palahniuk is a good enough writer to convince us of Vic's slowly-developing Christ complex, which Vic artfully tries to dodge through behaving according to the question, \\"What would Jesus not do?\\"  The others merely remain a collection of bizarre and depraved habits, however: Everyone is on drugs at all times, especially while working at 18th Century replica Colonial Dunsboro.  And Vic's fellow sex-addict workshop are living, breathing (and moaning) embodiments of clich&eacute;d sexual urban legends.<br /><br />Choke also has too many flawed premises, each responsible for collapsing Palahnuik's house of cards: (i) that people who saved Vic from choking somehow felt indebted to him, instead of the other way around; (ii) that Vic had logged over 300 choking episodes in roughly the same area; and (iii) even if you accepted (i) and (ii), that the choking gig brought Vic a nearly $3K monthly income.  [See others below the spoilers line.]<br /><br />And despite some cool themes woven throughout the story, like the technique of tracing shadows, Palahniuk never fully earns the extra style points with Choke that he did with Fight Club.  Both works share a fast paced and hip style, but here, the style seems too hip by half.  Devices are overplayed and grow tiresome (\\"see also: wearying\\"; \\"see also: draining\\").<br /><br />The movie was recently made with the talented Sam Rockwell.  Let's hope the film emphasizes the book's more clever aspects- and good sexy bits- and sheds the excess to maintain an R rating.<br /><br />***SPOILERS******SPOILERS***<br /><br />...

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|By plunging into uncharted territory ,the Scottish quartet is boasting its resiliency and unique songwriting and playing skills.This album is full of new sounds seldom experimented with in previous  Cds,making this work all the more appealing to a wider audience.As for the lyrics,the songs \\"42 \\"and the title track  ponder on the notion of an  afterlife in a rather sarcastic and at times witty fashion.\\"Lost\\"surely appeals to their teenage listeners whereas \\"Loves in Japan\\" loudly speak to more mature audience.Overall, an awesome gem.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A sci-fi movie for adults. It contains graphic violence, but the darkest scenes are softened with well-placed, incredibly funny wry humor. The characters interact incredibly well, and even the bad guy is made to be understood by the viewer. My greatest disappointment with the DVD was the outake section of the menu. The outakes were not only unfunny, but the actors responded by uttering the most vile profanities.

0156027321|5.0|Very few books make a lasting impact on me.  However, this book has not left my mind.  It is such a good book I've told all my friends about it and even bought them copies of it so I can have someone to discuss the book with.  It is by far the best book I've read in a long long time, if not the best ever.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Keith Gordon gives a truly creepy performance as Arnie Cunningham, a geeky, intelligent, 17-yr-old outcast who is bullied constantly, seems to have no luck whatsoever with the ladies, or with anything else, really.  He has only one friend in the world, Dennis Gilder, a popular, good-looking football player, played far less convincingly by John Stockwell.<br /><br />Arnie falls in love with an incredibly dilapidated '58 Plymouth Fury.  His feelings for the car are beyond those of which he has ever felt for any human being...and the intense feelings are mutual.  The love turns into an obsession and doom for anyone who tries to interfere.<br /><br />While Christine is one of my favorite horror movies it falls just shy of being truly horrific and scary, like most John Carpenter films, in my opinion.  But thanks to Keith Gordon it most definitely leaves you with a very uneasy feeling and it manages to get under your skin a bit.  Usually Gordon's self-pitying vibe and his dark demeanor which are somehow present in nearly everything he does turns me off, however, if in his acting career a part was made for him then this was most certainly it.  If the look in his eyes during certain scenes in Christine does not give you the heebie jeebies then maybe you're not quite human.<br /><br />A high point in the film is character development as far as the two leads go: Arnie and Christine.  The movie certainly succeeds at making you feel for Christine to an extent.  One scene in which the bully Buddy Reperton exacts revenge on Arnie by taking his wrath out on Christine is truly cringe-worthy partially because it's gut-wrenching (for some) to see a beautiful car trashed for no reason other than pure hatred, but primarily because by that point you feel that she is more than just some car.<br /><br />We see Arnie evolve first from the dorky high school kid who gets pushed around into a man who seems to have confidence and charisma then into a downright scary, unpredictable, angry borderline lunatic.  Gordon clearly portrays Arnie during each phase rather than falling from just one extreme to the other.<br /><br />Another nice element in Christine is suspense.  There are not any truly slow parts and there is a nice ambiguity as far as whether Christine is running around by herself taking care of business, or regulating as it were, or whether Arnie is actually with her during certain shenanigans.  Once again, Gordon's performance is what sells it.<br /><br />On to the less-than-good.  The main thing about this movie that leaves me cold is the ending.  It's a little silly, although no sillier than the entire premise itself, I suppose.  I cannot even really say what I felt would have been better, if anything.  It may simply be that the end of the film is carried on the virtually non-existent shoulders of the two worst actors in the film, Stockwell and the always-terrible Alexandra Paul who, as always, leaves me feeling befuddled as far as how she ever broke into the biz.  At any rate it is possible that the ending is actually okay but the acting chops are not there to back it up.<br /><br />Christine is not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if one can stomach some of the weak supporting cast and a lackluster ending it is certainly worthwhile.learly portrays Arnie during each phase rather than falling from just one extreme to the other.

B000VWYNNW|5.0|A good example of the band in their hey day. After viewing the movie of the same title, I can visualize the band as they perform all of their hits. Some of the early as well as the later songs are on these CDs. A good example of the reason they were so popular. Would recommend to any Zepp fans or others who only know of the band by name.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I've read some of the reviews for this album, and it seemed to be pretty mixed.  I think this album is great. WAY better than Miss Independent, maybe not quite as good as Breakaway, but it'll be hard to top that one.  There are a lot of stand-out songs Never Again, Sober, Maybe, Judas, just to name a few.  Id recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to venture out away from the \\"popular\\" songs that play on the radio right now.  :)

B000YABYLA|4.0|First off, I really loved this movie.  I thought the characters were well written and very well played.  I loved the over all tone of the movie.      The funny thing is I almost turned it off within the first 15 minutes or so because of the oh so hip and clever dialog.  It was so hip it became stilted.  I am glad that I hung with it because the dialog calmed down and then everyone settled in to a wonderfully subtle and tender movie about a not so subtle subject.    I highly recommend this movie.  As a caveat one of my best friends loved the first 15 minutes...so there ya go!
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Alannis has moved into the realm of techno and dance with several of the songs featured on her new album.  There are also a few ballads that one can only assume were inspired by her ex-fiance are relatively pleasant and not reminiscent of Jagged Little Pill.  As Alannis has grown and matured, so has her music.  This is a must have album.
0316067598|5.0|This is a tragic, yet inspiring true story. Anyone who reads this will be proud of our fighters, yet will be overwhelmed by the tragic power the media has to make our valiant warriors second-guess wartime decisions they KNOW are right. I didn't need convincing, but this book certainly reinforced that the good old USA has the best fighting warriors in the world, bar none. If only our country would allow our fighters to fight to WIN!! This book will spell it out, draw the picture for you and shout it loud and clear...Shut up and let our warriors fight to win. Lift the ridiculous rules of engagement and let common sense war minds make valid war decisions to put this terror war into history. We can only do that by being brutal, ruthless and smart. Every American, no matter your politics, should read this book. Marcus Luttrell is a patriot who has been there and done it and then some. Until you know what he knows, you are uninformed. God bless him, the Seals and all our warriors from all branches. The NEXT Greatest Generation.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|Impossible to rate, because whether you consider this genius or stupidity depends very much on you--it's one of those films.  There is little action--and what little action there is, a raid on an African village late in the movie, seems completely contrived.  Instead, we come in late to the action scenes in almost every case--or in the final one, early.  But almost nothing is shown directly, only the consequences.  Much of the film is told in flashbacks or jumpcuts, making the story somewhat difficult to piece together; and the one scene in which most of the dubious characters are introduced happens quite quickly.  I have to confess to quite a lot of confusion about who was who and what was happening--most of it cleared up, but frankly the ending didn't seem terribly satisfactory to me.  My whole family was left saying, \\"hunh\\" and my 24 year old son further opined that it was much ado about nothing.  The 'hero's' revenge was pretty understated, too--a public shaming doesn't really seem enough to pay for your wife's murderer, does it?  It's certainly not an American action flick; exactly the opposite.  But if you enjoy British reserve, this might be the film for you.  As others have said, the acting, cinematography, and music were excellent--it's the plot and it's telling that left me cold.
0375842209|5.0|The story of Leisl, the book thief, written with sensitivity and tenderness against the background of war-torn, Jew hating, Nazi Germany.  A stunning contrast..  I didn't particularly like it at first, but I kept at it and was richly rewarded for my patience. One of the cleverest books I have ever read.  I am puzzled as to why it is categorized as a book for youth.  While I certainly think that many young people could enjoy it I think it is an adult book.  I questioned the youth classification many times thinking I must be mistaken about that.  Apparently, I'm not.
B001ACY8D2|1.0|Agaetis Byrjun, () and takk are incredible albums. Even still, I get so much power and emotion from them. Their last album was a step down, but still enjoyable to me. Now, they have produced this. Unfortunately, this is not the sigur ros sound I love. This album sounds like a completely different, poppier group. Their last album was heading this way and now they are there. Everybody, if you love the albums I have mentioned (earlier work), this will be a dissapointment. If your fond of their more recent works, enjoy. However, for me, this is bad music.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|After Shinedown's brilliant premier album \\"Leave a Whisper\\", their second project \\"Us and Them\\" was a bit of a disappointment. Of course, for any other group, a Gold album with a couple of hit songs wouldn't be that bad, but considering how good their first album was, their second one simply wasn't that good by comparison.     Brent and the boys stepped up to the plate for their third attempt \\"The Sound of Madness\\", and promptly hit it out of the park. From hard, in your face rockers, to soulful ballads, this one has it all. \\"What a Shame\\" might be the best new song I've heard in several years, and just about everything on the album is excellent. It won't be long before the awards and accolades start rolling in. Better see them on tour while you can still afford the tickets, because after this one, they'll be touring stadiums and arenas, not local clubs.
0679409920|4.0|Most popular espionage novels, those written by Frederick Forsyth for example, feature intelligence agents with remarkable skills.  Men and women who interact with their equally skilled enemy counterparts as if espionage and counter espionage were games of three dimensional chess and all parties involved grandmasters.  The Human Factor by Graham Greene is a completely different kind of spy novel.  The smoothly written narrative of this very entertaining Cold War work concerns itself not with the intricacies of \\"tradecraft\\" or the details of information nations choose to keep secret from one another.  Rather, this is a novel about flawed human beings.  People whose motivations and actions are influenced by love, fear, jealousy, greed and, surprisingly often, good old fashioned stupidity.  In the Cold War world depicted by Graham Greene in The Human Factor, intelligence agencies on either side of the iron curtain all have their fair share of bumblers and sometimes the bumbling leads to some tragic consequences.  The Human Factor is a well written novel about human fraility that plays out against a backdrop of international espionage.  Adding to the book's overall appeal are a generous infusion of understated British wit and the author's obvious respect for the intelligence of the reader.
1596061855|4.0|Altered Carbon was the first of it's kind that I read this summer. I'm a huge sci-fi fan so I'm biased when it comes to sci-fi books like this. However, this was my first dive into the cyberpunk sub genre of sci-fi and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Altered Carbon is set in a dystopia like high tech future during the 25th century. Death, for those that can afford it, is essentially a thing of the past and at the very worst a \\"minor\\" inconvenience by the process of being re downloaded into new \\"sleeves\\" (bodies). The United Nations has become a multi-world, multi-galaxy policing force and maintains order via the use of carefully trained peacekeepers (closer to assassins) known as the Envoy Corps.<br /><br />In comes a renegade Ex-UN Envoy, Takeshi Kovacs, who was put away as a criminal last time and is assigned to Earth to investigate the suicide of Laurens Bancroft, a very rich/powerful man. Kovacs ends up on a dangerous goose chase as he finds himself merged among city and global politics, skirting the line with enemies that become allies and allies that become enemies, and above all ends up learning a bit about himself as well in this excellent debut from Richard Morgan.<br /><br />As my first cyberpunk novel, it was a very good reading experience. My only qualm is I'm not used to reading sci-fi that has elements of a detective story in it as I would forget characters that were recalled from the first few pages of the book. Other than that, no qualms!
B000JLTR8G|3.0|I like certain elements of this film, however, this movie moves at a rather slow pace and some of it is more than a little bit cheesy.  It does have a good tone and setting.  Ken Takakura is great in this movie.  I am a Robert Mitchum fan (Out of the Past is one of my all-time favorite movies) but, although he is ok in this movie, this is not his finest hour by far.  That being said, if you can get this movie for less than 10 bucks it would be worth your time.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Concept - 8/10<br />Music - 9/10<br />Vocals - 8/10<br />Lyrics - 6/10<br /><br />First, kudos to the Priest for not doing the same old, expected thing and putting out another heavy album of metal riffs, hooks and hits.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, \\"Retribution\\" was the quintessential, definitive Priest album. No matter what era of Priest you like, there's something there for you.<br /><br />This is not more of the same. Instead of cranking out another useless disc of the same stuff, Halford & Co. took a chance. And in so doing, showed all of us what Prog Metal should sound like. I've only listened to this twice and that was in the car, so I won't do a track-for-track review, but I will say I'm impressed. The musicianship is fantastic. Rob's voice, while older and less soaring, is no less impressive. He is the leather-lunged Metal God! Thank goodness they included some mellower songs that show what a sensitive vocalist he can be. The concept is interesting and makes for good subject matter. The only fault I find for now is the lyrics. They are a bit too elementary and simple. The Priest is capable of much more complex, deep poetry than this album displays.<br /><br />Don't listen to the reviews panning this album. If you're a Priest fan, get this to see what they're capable of. If you're a prog-metal fan get this to see how it's really done. If you're not a fan of the Priest or prog-metal, then what the heck is wrong with you??? Get a clue!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have bought plenty of workout DVD's in my time due to the fact that it makes better sense for my life. This DVD is incredibly easy on time and it packs a punch. On the DVD are 3 20-minute workouts that increase in intensity. If you're like me you may think that 20 minutes is not enough time to make you feel like you've had a good workout and to get quality results. NOT SO with this one. Jillian is intense and does a good job of keeping you motivated. I like to think that I'm fairly in shape, but after the first day of level 1 I was worn out. By day 7-8 I felt like I could conquer level 2 and it kicked my butt again. I am about to transition to level 3 and I'm sure that it will step it up one more time. If you want a challenge, this DVD is a great purchase. Results will show and for the price, you can't beat it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I've just started re-watching \\"Planet Earth\\" and find it as fascinating as I did on the first viewing. The photography alone makes multiple watchings worthwhile and Sir David Attenborough's narration is excellent, as always. Watching this reminds me of what a wondrous place our planet is, how we're all a part of the various ecosystems, and how important it is to care for this great treasure. I can't praise this series highly enough.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|It is sometimes the case with films that sequels fail to match up to their predecessors.  \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is one of those times.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's latest incarnation of Indian Jones sees the story largely unchanged.  That is, Indy is still an archeologist whose life is more frenetic that the average university professor.  He is still fighting baddies.  He is still getting into scrapes but always comes through remarkably unharmed.  Never a broken bone in sight!  In the \\"Crystal Skull\\", the only change of significance is that a decade of time has passed and the bad guys are no longer Nazis but Russians.  This is after all, the peak of the cold war.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does an admirable job again as Indiana Jones but the show is stolen by Cate Blanchett who plays an evil Russian intent on bringing Indy undone.  Without Ms Blanchett, I'm not sure where this film would have ended up.<br /><br />My advice to Steven Spielberg is to put Indy out to pasture.  The brand is being tarnished.  Let's call a halt to the process so that we can fondly remember the films and not have the earlier works denigrated by these attempts to wring very last dollar out of the concept.

B000002TQV|5.0|... as we know them today.<br /><br />As a longtime Radiohead fan (one of my 3 favorite groups), I thought I'd finally start reviewing some of their albums. Looking at them comparatively with each other and as albums on their own right.<br /><br />I start with the Bends because this is the album that really made Radiohead who they are.  Previous to this album, Radiohead was going to be a one-hit wonder.  Thom Yorke didn't want that, so they put out what is probably one of the best albums of the 90's.  Unlike later Radiohead albums, The Bends is a straight out rock/alternative album. There isn't anything terribly complex about it in terms of accessibility, although the song writing does show the greatness that has evolved over the years. I think the accessibility of this album is what really made Radiohead a popular band. It is also what is responsible for the loss of fans that followed with the release of albums like Kid A and Amnesiac later on down the road.<br /><br />Songs like The Bends, My Iron Lung, and Black Star are rockers not unlike Creep. High and Dry and Fake Plastic Trees are ballad like rock songs that were stereotypical of the genre.  What made the Bends stand out though was the creativity in the lyrics, the symbolism that isn't always present in the stereotypical rock album.  Add to that the musicianship that while not unlike the popular alternative and rock albums of the time, started to demonstrate the talents of the musicians, especially Johnny Greenwood (whom has only become better with time).<br /><br />The Bends really is a great album.  It's a great album for the fan of the 90's alternative rock as it has almost a grunge like sound (although by a British band) that stretches beyond that sub-genre.  It's a great album if you are a newer fan of Radiohead and you want to see where they came from.  Again, it is probably Radiohead's most accessible album, so it is really an album that almost any fan of rock or alternative rock music would enjoy even if they are not a fan of the Radiohead of today.Radiohead of today.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|This movie is a time travel movie where the 'jumpers' are being hunted by a government group that has been around for years and years.  It was fast movie and overall a great escape movie.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|When Fleetwood mac took a longshot chance on an obscure Los Angeles duo named Buckingham/Nicks, even they probably had no clue just how greatly their fortunes would turn. But the creative chemistry was almost immediate: the [[ASIN:B00009RAJH Fleetwood Mac]] album made huge inroads in the US and \\"Rhiannon\\" became the greeting card that marked the arrival of Stevie Nicks.<br /><br />That is where this double CD Best Of picks up the story. For all you whiny purists who grouse that the pre-Buckingham/Nicks material is not here, this is a HITS compilation. It covers a quarter century of a band that centered on the core members (even as they revolved in and out) from 1975 on. While Bob Welch and Peter Green each contributed, they came and went quickly and the alchemy that gelled when the band entered the studio for [[ASIN:B000002KGT Rumours]], frankly, didn't happen until this line-up was in place. Nicks' sensual spaciness balanced Christine McVie's earthiness, Buckingham's guitar playing brought new spark to the band, and his sonic ingenuity prodded Mick Fleetwood and John McVie to new heights.<br /><br />Which means that most of these songs are from that incredible one/two punch of \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" and \\"Rumours,\\" with the band baring themselves even as their emotional lives were splintering.

B001AQWC2C|4.0|to grow on you. I have this on my Ipod along with the rest of the Priest catalog. I wasn't impressed after the first run through but that's probably because I didn't know what to expect. It's an album that needs to be experienced as an entire work. After a few listens it has really grown on me.  If you're going to pick out a song here and there to download and listen to, you won't get it. It's not a DOTF or SFV with singles to listen to. It's larger than those works. Congrats Priest on a solid epic!!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|The concept of \\"Wicked\\" is great. Unfortunately, the songs heard on the CD lacked an igredient to make you sing it repeatedly after hearing it initially. There were no block buster hits such as we heard in the original \\"Wizard of OZ\\" or the \\"Wiz\\". I still am glad I bought it and plan to see the theatrical performance when it becomes available in Florida.  Thank you  HV
B00009MGR6|4.0|I'm not sure why this album gets lumped in with the other post Back in Black 80's albums.  To me, this is their best album since Back in Black.  It is more consistent than Razors Edge.  The guitar tones are great and great riffs abound.  Give it another listen!
B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx was the first pop artist I saw in concert and listening to this Greatest Hits CD brings back all the memories of that amazing night.  These are the songs you dreamed of girls to, kissed girls to and danced with girls to in the '80s and early '90s.  The music is emotional and moving and the liner notes are incredible because Marx gets personal (especially in the dedication to his father - wow).  For the price, you simply CAN NOT beat this if you are a fan of Marx's music or you were in school during the time these great songs were released.<br /><br />No regrets on this purchase ... promise.<br /><br />PS:  Check out the great solos on Angelia.  :)
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I picked this up to replace my old Presto disc.  The music is great and this will always be a special Rush album for me but the remastering leaves a lot to be desired.  It sounds pretty much exactly like my old Presto cd.  They didn't even increase the volume much to match the other remasters.  If you don't already have this album buy it immediately but if you're looking to replace an old copy, save your money.

A key instrument of the recovery process is a Mont Blanc, Meisterstuck, presumably belonged to Victor Hugo.<br /><br />Some biographical information on the author: Carols was born in Spain, is a screenwriter living in California. He wrote this book in Spanish. Nothing gets lost in the translations. The book reads the same in English as it does in Polish. The style and structure remains the same. Much of this structure is 'filmic'. That is to say, this book can be made into a film easily. Was this intentional? The author's screen-writing background crafted a book that is both literate and filmic. Does this help or hinder the enjoyment of the book? Part of me thinks it does. I want to read a book for its medium unique in book form. Sometimes, I thought it was like reading a movie, everything fitted too neatly, in a way that is formulaic. I definitely wanted to find out more, much more about the mysterious author, Julian Carax. I did not get the sense of what his brilliance is or about any of the books which he had written. (Is it too far fetched to compare this book to the 'English Patient'? It has elements of secrecy, romance, betrayal and a burned patient whose story is being told in reflections and refractions of the other characters involved, as though in a prism.) I bring up the `English Patience' as a comparison also for its style and structure. Ondaatje, wrote `The English Patience' in a poetic tone and style. It seems difficult to translate this into the film, but the film version tells the same story, just in a different way and just as compelling. I guess this is what I mean by saying that a book should be a book and not a veiled screen play? It is ironic that, the book is about books and paean to books, yet the form is not true to its form.

1592220045|4.0|Those who think the storyline and characterization are \\"shallow\\" are missing the point. The classics of SF were about IDEAS as much as they were about people, and this is what \\"Tuf Voyaging\\" offers.<br /><br />Yes, Tuf is an odd and unsympathetic character. He's solitary and finds human contact distasteful; he admits to several flaws and possesses even more; and his seeming arrogance is, at times, distinctly unappealing.<br /><br />But more importantly (as the other main character, Tolly Mune, notes), Tuf is ETHICAL. His code of conduct will not allow him to let injustice or brutality stand unchallenged. And, where a simpler man might respond to dogfighting arenas or similar cruelty with ineffectual outrage, Tuf takes it a step further. He turns their own behavior--their own shortsightedness, selfishness, or greed--against them. He teaches them a better way, even as he systematically disrupts and dismantles their socities to replace them with better, more ethical ones.<br /><br />The world that demands monster-killers after heedlessly slaughtering some native sea life is forced to the bargaining table by the world's TRUE natives. The culture where status is based on arena dogfighting is overrun with a new ecology where large predators can no longer exist--and neither can the arenas. The reckless breed-at-any-price world constantly teetering on the brink of starvation or war is offered salvation in the form of miracle crops that also cause sterility. And so on.<br /><br />Tuf is cold, yes, but his relentless pursuit of ethical solutions forces the cruel and cowardly societies to change, unwillingly, into better ones. The concerns about \\"absolute power\\" are inevitable, and are not answered in a reassuring way... but the simple truth remains. The intelligent man of ethics has a responsibility to force change on the brutal and stupid (if they won't accept it any other way), for the benefit of all.<br /><br />It's not a democratic conclusion--but in times of ecological and ethical crisis, it's the only option. \\"Tuf Voyaging\\" offers thought-provoking case studies for the philosopher, and thoroughly satisfying (vicarious) vengeance for the animal-lover.\\"Tuf Voyaging\\" offers thought-provoking case studies for the philosopher, and thoroughly satisfying (vicarious) vengeance for the animal-lover.

0143038419|4.0|I was surprised at the many negative reviews of this book. To me, this book was a home run and presented a glimpse into what changes us. Yes,Elizabeth Gilbert may seem narcissistic and sometimes callous, but that probably is who the author really is (or was). What is surprising about this book is the humor and depth of introspection. I imagine some of this was very difficult to write. Most autobiographies tend to be self absorbent!    This autobiography of \\"finding one's self\\" is just so hilarious and full of irony. Time after time, Elizabeth found that the answers to her problems of unhappiness lay in overcoming what she thought were obstacles and in embracing life's crap rather than trying to divorce one's self of the unpleasant parts.    Although many may consider this a \\"chick\\" book, I would have been proud to write it as a man. It is full of truth.
0199206589|3.0|Dobbs clearly knows his stuff, but this book raises more questions than it answers and drifts off into a general critique of globalization. Dobbs explains how the Nazis appropriated geopolitical analysis, and how that discredited the concept for decades. He is also interesting when describing the shift to polar projection during the \\"air age.\\" He correctly notes that geopolitical thinking is not just something that military strategists do, but is part of popular culture. But he spends a lot of the book taking shots at America (a whole paragraph on the Wag the Dog movie, a bit of an indulgence for a Very Short Introduction). There is a chapter on the British and German origins of geopolitics, and sections on Argentina and the Falklands and Al Jazeera, but the rest of the book is devoted to a critique of the American worldview. Dodds can't seem to decide between the modernists and the post-modernists: is geopolitics a real strategy for power projection or is just a series of sound-bites to fool the public (such as \\"axis of evil\\"). Strangely for a book on geopolitics, there is not much direct engagement with geography and cartography. No discussion of the Peters Projection for example. There are only five maps - but 22 other illustrations including a still from a James Bond film. He talks about the importance of Isaiah Bowman's maps in 1919, but does not show any of them. There is a glaring error in the map on p. 128 showing Europe in 1914 - central Poland (the duchy of Warsaw) is shown as part of the German empire, which was not the case.

0790740443|2.0|Starring action hero Kurt Russell ([[ASIN:B00004Y87O Escape from New York]]) and directed by genre resident Paul Anderson ([[ASIN:0790729997 Mortal Kombat]]), I expected \\"Soldier\\" to be a veritable action-powerhouse, yet the film goes beyond missing its mark and lacks any definitive direction - unsure if it wants to be a an action flick, a survival story, or a story of social critique. I'm unsure which of these it eventually ends up being, but the one thing I'm sure it's not is a good time.<br /><br />The story: Todd (Russell) is a soldier born into a lifelong military program turning out ace killers. However, when a rival program pits its stronger, faster units against the older models in an exhibition, Todd is presumed killed and his body is dumped on a designated garbage planet. Here, he settles in with a close-knit community of exiles and slowly begins to attain a level of humanity he never knew...until the new breed of soldiers, in an effort to gain combat experience, is dispatched to the planet to weed out its inhabitants.<br /><br />As said before, the film lacks action - or, at the very least, lacks satisfying action. With the exception of two encounters with rival soldier Caine (Jason Scott Lee, [[ASIN:0783226985 Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]), Russell has no hand-to-hand fights, and the only firefight - a slow-moving 17-on-1 shoot-`em-up - doesn't occur until the film's last twenty minutes. The rest of the movie focuses solely on Todd getting acquainted and trying to fit in with his hosts, and frankly, this is very boring. Though an accomplished actor, Russell lacks the subtlety here to make his near-stoic character appear like anything other than a dummy who doesn't understand what the heck is going on at any time. Expect lots of pursed-lip, wide-eyed staring.<br /><br />The rest of the performers - including Connie Nielsen ([[ASIN:B00007976T One Hour Photo]]) and Gary Busey ([[ASIN:0790729695 Lethal Weapon]]) - are generally passable in their portrayals but aren't given much opportunity to add to the story. The film's graphics are visibly outdated, and the sets range from okay to dollar-budget. However, the more significant fault lies in the film's sense of morality: the faction that bred Russell's character is seen exercising cruelty and infanticide, yet when the bigger and better soldiers with the cockier commander (Jason Isaacs, [[ASIN:B000ZHB6R4 The Patriot]]) arrive, the folks behind Todd's creation are suddenly turned into good guys. Call me square, but I don't buy it. In addition, the over-the-top militarism displayed has no purpose: it's never revealed why a program to turn out such soldiers is even required, and the attack on the exiled colony happens for no other reason than that the commander being a jerk.<br /><br />While I was expecting Anderson's trademark style of pop-direction and not much of a story, \\"Soldier\\" is a significant step beneath even his personal average. It's not hard to see why the film flopped back in 1998. Kurt Russell devotees have definitely seen better from their man. Leave this one on the shelf.portunity to add to the story.

B0016H97LY|3.0|The author does a good job entertaining, but swings wildly from style to style.  At times this book is a self help book with catch phrases and bullet points.  Other times it is an interview or a history.  Some may think this keeps it fresh, but I think it results in a stilted, odd read.   Additionally, it's poorly edited with fact/story repeats way to close to one another.  The whole thing feels rushed.  All that said, however, the book is enjoyable for a gadget geek and/or apple fanboy.

From Amy Winehouse to Duffy to young Adele, these ladies are harking back to everyone from Diana Ross to Dusty Springfield to even Peggy Lee. Winehouse and Duffy have already set the bar very high, and Adele comed right behind them and raises the the bar for the next in line.<br /><br />Infused at times with her folksy guitar playing, Adele has a voice that already sounds like a finely used instrument. Husky and strong at times, but sweet and mournfully tender at times, she showcases it at her best on songs like \\"Chasing Pavement,\\" \\"Right As Rain,\\" \\"Make You Feel You love,\\" and others.<br /><br />Adele is another rich British talent, and one hopes that she keeps herself together with all the challenges that fame and huge talent bring.

It was the first time in years (decades actually)that I have been in a movie theater and audience broke into spontaneous applause at the end of the movie. I think it was a testament to the excellent performances of Adams and McDermitt, and the all around excellent film making.  This is my new feel-good movie.

The only song that rocks is Bang a Gong, which I have heard a hundred times on the radio. The rest of the songs are slow and boring.

Thankfully, he was.    Fair warning though - if you were not satisfied with how many times the \\"good\\" characters of Pillars were brought down, you will especially hate World.  To me, it seemed that there were even more times when I just wanted to scream in frustration and remorse for the main characters, and there just was never enough retribution against the \\"bad\\" characters to make things seemed evened out by the end.  Of course, this is part of the realism of the book that makes it all the better.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|I am Legend is an absolutely brilliant and fascinating movie. Breathtaking scenery and an impressive silence which dominates a large part of the movie. As far as I am concerned it has only one slight flaw: the use of CGI generated creatures instead of flesh and blood actors. Why the makers opted for this is beyond me, because real actors would have been much cheaper I think and the creatures aren't exotic or weird at all, merely hyper-agressive zombies. In my opinion simple make-up would have done the trick quite excellently. It does not subtract from the tension, though, which is riveting, but for me it would have been the icing on top of the cake. For this reason and this reason only I award it 4 stars instead of 5. Now I must go and read the original novel by Richard Matheson as quickly as possible.

B0001CNRS4|1.0|I really really wanted to like this movie- love it more like! But I just can't. The dancing that I looked forward to the most was few and far between and even then some of it (due to choreography/camera angles/both) looked rather cheesy.    Plus the acting on Jessica Alba's part was cheesy as well. Her voice changes tone when talking to the younger actors which makes it really hard to believer her when she seems so awkward.     Finally, it's hard to believe. Dancing in one video does not give the dancer the kind of money this movie wants to make the audience believe. In the real world, if a dancer is lucky enough to make the cut for a video- they make around 500 dollars- not 9 thousand.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This really is a pretty movie- but lets cut to the chase. Keira Knightly sufficiently butchers her role by concentrating waaay too much of her energ into puffing her lips out in an extremely annoying fashion. Any scenes with her are ruined by her aweful habits. So basically the whole movie. Yeah..     And the actor wo plays darcy is flat so any chemistry that might be is nipped in the bud between the lippy twit and the flat guy.     Finally, the Bennetts were a part of the lower UPPER class which means that, no,there would not be livestock running about their house. Sorry! So this movie is not worth your time- watch the one with Colin Firth for some amazing acting and more accurate interpretation.
0743298039|5.0|[[ASIN:0743298039 The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel]]<br />As a writer of non-fiction, I have very little time for fiction reading, though I love it, so I'm very picky about what I read.  Most modern critical darlings leave me cold.  So, I wasn't expecting too much when I opened this book, but I found myself loving it!<br /><br />Yes, it has suspense, off-stage violence, and even a ghost -- none of which I usually like, but it also has gorgeous writing, fascinating characters, and a great plot. It was fascinating to my psychologist's mind, and enthralling.  It is part Gothic; part fantasy fiction, part suspense novel.  I loved the protagonist's love affair with books.<br /><br />It's the most enjoyable novel I've read since \\"Possession\\" -- and, although there's no great romance, it is a love story.  I don't know if it will be made into a movie, but it probably should.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This season was awesome.   It gave us just enough info to keep the mystique alive and interesting.  If they explained everything it would deflate -- you can't explain everything with a non-linear storyline otherwise the interweaving floats away with the absence of conflict. There are 2 more season left, why would you want to know everything now?   Instead spend some time exploring what the show alludes to: the books, philosophers, religions, scientific theories...it goes on. Take some time to enjoy it as it is rather than have the whole meal stuffed in your face all at once. LOST is not a KFC meal bowl.  I was just re-reading A Brief History of Time with the echoes of some of my fav episodes of LOST (Casimir effect) and it enhanced the already great read.

B0012Q732O|3.0|If, while munching popcorn and viewing Roland Emmerich's latest saga, \\"10,000 B.C.\\", you keep sensing an acute case of deja-vu, don't be alarmed...the film is eerily similar to Mel Gibson's 2006 \\"Apocalypto\\" (simply switch the Mayans to Atlanteans, and toss in some mastodons), with moments of the Karl Urban 2007 Viking/Native American epic, \\"Pathfinder\\" slipped in for good measure, and a finale lifted from Emmerich's own 1994 Sci-Fi near-classic, \\"Stargate\\" (I half expected Kurt Russell and James Spader to emerge from the rubble of the fallen pyramid). Clearly, these 'lifts' are something for the Writer's Guild of America to muse over, but for a non-discriminating viewer, the film is an acceptable time-passer, if no classic.<br /><br />The story, surprisingly, is often a bit flat, although the CGI mastodons, man-eating ostriches, and a saber-tooth tiger are fun (if not particularly believable). As is frequently the case in these tales (at least since \\"Conan the Barbarian\\"), prehistoric humans were so hardy that they could survive near-Arctic cold in a minimum of clothing, were so unfamiliar with horses and boats that they referred to them as \\"four-legged monsters\\" and \\"big birds\\", yet had mastered engineering to a point where they were creating spectacular structures rivaling modern Las Vegas at it's gaudiest. The logic of all this escapes me, but Emmerich is a master of \\"don't think, just watch\\" storytelling, and makes it all work.<br /><br />With bloodless battles, little romance (other than talk), and clearly-defined 'good guys' and 'bad guys', this is a film you can view with the entire family, which is a plus, these days! So, if your expectations aren't too high, this may be a good addition for your library.

It introduces the concept of anti-authority, and what America was like back then (and it somewhat still is).<br /><br />\\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is one of two five part suites on the album.  It's really the opening song of the story, and it really makes you feel like you know the Jesus of Suburbia, who is a young teenager trying to make his way in his home town, but he feels a lot of pain.  It ends where he runs away from home.  This song has such beauty but such anger as well.<br /><br />\\"Holiday\\" is what \\"Amazing Journey\\" was on the Who's album, Tommy.  It's where the story really begins.  The Jesus of Suburbia ran away from home, and this is a song about what America was like at the time, and it works as the Jesus of Suburbia's journey to the big city.  It's a very agressive tune as well.<br /><br />\\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is where the Jesus of Suburbia has arrived, but he feels alone.  \\"Holiday\\" was referred to as the night you're drunk and having fun, and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" was referred to as the hangover.  This song really shows the loneliness of the Jesus of Suburbia.  It was the big hit single, and it's a beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"Are We the Waiting\\" is where it's realized that the city has problems as well, but there are others here who question as well.  These people are all ignored by the high authority as well.  It shows such beauty and such questioning about the authority.<br /><br />\\"St. Jimmy\\" is about the Jesus of Suburbia's alternate identity.  He is like a spokesmodel for all of the people who question the authority.  This is a tough rocker tune about rebellionism, but it's also an uplifting and happy song.<br /><br />\\"Give Me Novacaine\\" is about being in a lot of pain, but using drugs to forget that pain.  This is one of the most popular songs on the album from most people I've talked to.  It is a very beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"She's A Rebel\\" is where we first meet the girl known as Whatsername.  She also becomes St. Jimmy/Jesus of Suburbia's girlfriend.  It's a song that describes who she is.  She's called Whatsername so it could be anyone, and there's a part about having forgot her name at the end.  Like St. Jimmy, it's an uplifting but still agressive rocker.<br /><br />\\"Extraordinary Girl\\" is about the relationship problems that St. Jimmy/Jesus of Suburbia and Whatsername are having.  It also has a bit of influence from East Indian music.  It's almost sad in a way.<br /><br />\\"Letterbomb\\" opens up with a recurring melody sung by a woman, the opening of the song is reprised later on the album.  It's about Whatsername leaving St. Jimmy/Jesus of Suburbia, telling him that he isn't the person he was when they met, and that he has become someone that he swore to never be.  Also, things are happening to the group that they would all hang out with.  It's a hard rocker that shows fear and anger.  This song is like the climax of the story.<br /><br />\\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" was written even before they recorded their album, Warning, a few years earlier, but September 11th gave it a second meaning, this album gave it a third meaning, and the video gave it a fourth meaning.  When listening to this beautiful song as part of the album, it's about things looking hopeful for others, but not St. Jimmy/Jesus of Suburbia.  He feels lonely without Whatsername.  It really works as part of the album and is right after the climax, but it isn't the resolution.<br /><br />\\"Homecoming\\" is the resolution of the story.  It's the second five-part suite.  It also reprises the opening melody of \\"Letterbomb,\\" probably sung by the Whatsername earlier, and is a voice in the mind of her.  The song starts where the Jesus of Suburbia decides to proclaim that St. Jimmy died, but the idea of who he truely was had died much earlier.  Jesus of Suburbia then realizes that he isn't who he used to be, and is upset about the loss of Whatsername.  Soon later, he gets a letter from one of their friends, who seems to be doing well (that segment is called \\"Rock and Roll Girlfriend,\\" written by Tre' Cool; I think the rock and roll girlfriend was Torry Castellano of the Donnas).  After that, Jesus of Suburbia realizes that there isn't anything for him where he is, so he goes home.  That's how the story ends.<br /><br />\\"Whatsername\\" is the final song.  It really is a conclusion of the story.  The Jesus of Suburbia is remembering the part of his life that the story is about, but he's forgetting Whatsername.  However, he's still curious about her.<br /><br />To conclude, this is a great progressive punk album.  It really shows such deep emotion.  This is probably the best album that Green Day will have ever done.omb,\\" probably sung by the Whatsername earlier, and is a voice in the mind of her.

B0012Q732O|4.0|Original Dvd review: GREAT CGI, ACTION AND SOLID ACTING...WHAT ELSE ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN A POPCORN FLICK? IF YOU LIKE ACTION/ADVENTURE SET IN A TIME BEFORE HISTORY YOU'LL LOVE THIS LITTLE MOVIE. THE FORMULA HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE BUT THE SETTING IN HISTORY IS RARELY USED SO IT MAKES FOR GREAT VISUALS. IT'S NOT APOCOLYPTO BUT IT SURE IS FUN.<br /><br />Updated: I just watched this again on Blu-ray. I'm not sure if it was the beauty of the print but I enjoyed this movie more the second time around. All holds true from my first review.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: All the extras are carried over. The picture and sound are so much better on Blu-ray. The scenes with the Sabre-Tooth Tiger look so good you feel that the animal is alive and well! UPGRADE WORTHY!
B000001ELR|5.0|First, I usually don't pick favorites in bands, but, for me, it's hard not to favor Ace Frehley.  Peter Criss is probably my second favorite although most people despise him for his solo effort; I feel that he is one of the best jazz drummers to be in a rock band, but having studied with Gene Krupa probably helps.  The truth about Ace and Peter is that the two of them care most about the music, while Gene and Paul seem to care most about the audience (and maybe also the money).<br /><br />Peter Criss was voted out of KISS after Unmasked, which he didn't do any recording on, and before that, he only played on one track from the album before that, Dynasty.  Criss was replaced by Paul Caravello, who became known as Eric Carr.  They recorded Music from \\"The Elder,\\" which was their first and only album for the critics.  Those three albums had been moving them away from the rock and roll style that KISS were so famous for.  Right before recording what would become Creatures of the Night, Ace Frehley decided to leave.<br /><br />The other members of KISS, hoping that Ace might change his mind, had Steve Farris, Adam Mitchell, Bob Kulick (who almost was the lead guitarist before Ace joined), and the legendary Robben Ford filling his shoes for tracks.  When they realized that Ace wouldn't change his mind, they found Vincent Cusano, who would soon become known as Vinnie Vincent, take his place for the rest of the recording process.<br /><br />This album is actually my favorite KISS album.  As a line-up, I prefer the original line-up.  However, with their six studio albums as a band, and two live albums, they had more than enough TOTAL AWESOMENESS.  It's not that much better than Love Gun and Alive!, probably my two favorite original line-up albums.<br /><br />Vinnie Vincent didn't get much of a chance to express himself in his way, like he did with the Vinnie Vincent Invasion, but the guitar solo he did for \\"War Machine\\" is truly Vinnie.  I think that the members of KISS wanted to try to hide the fact that Ace was gone, so they had these other guitarists try to imitate him.  However, they failed to bring in that Ace Frehley style, but what they brought in, I feel, works much better for the songs.<br /><br />Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley have their heaviest songs written on this album.  Even the power-ballad, \\"I Still Love You\\" is heavy.  This album also, I feel, tops the energy of Alive!, Alive II, and even their new live albums.  Every single track is incredible, which is what makes this album so great.  This review should really just be one sentence...<br /><br />THIS ALBUM IS A HARD ROCKIN' ALBUM THAT IS SURE TO BLAST YOUR SPEAKERS!!!Ace was gone, so they had these other guitarists try to imitate him.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|I got to give it up to Rhianna.  I will admit that she really didn't catch my attention until I saw her perform \\"I don't want to be a murderer\\" at the world music award.  She was in rare form for a relatively new artist.  Her attire and demeanor was striking.  On this new album, Unbrella is a true standout, her video performance is just icing on the cake.  Other's like, Don't Stop The Music, Shut Up And Drive, Breakin Dishes, and the duo Hate That I Love You w/Neo and standout's as well.  This is a very strong pop album with crossover R & B elements. So far her recordings are making a strong presence and is truly the way to build a music career. She is also very beautiful in a very subtle but noticible way.  Her eyes are very striking.  And if the word about her and Chris Brown are true I think they make a very nice couple and appear to be equally cloaked,i.e.compatable.
B001794FOK|3.0|A lot has been said about the content of the movie. It doesn't offer much, however if you want to enjoy the stunning aerial view of Rome, the Colosseum, the neon lights of busy intersections of Tokyo, the backdrop of Burj Al Arab (the shape of ship's sail) and the Pyramid in high definition and on real location instead of CGI, then this is the movie for you.   One technical problem though, the menu doesn't seem to work properly on this disc, when it is in playback, I can't switch it to menu (both menu and disc menu don't work), so if I want to jump to bonus feature, I have to reload the disc, and we all know how slow the Blu-ray loads!

A must read especially for anyone without small business experience contemplating such a venture.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|In an effort to make `An American Monster Movie' in the vein of Godzilla, JJ Abrams (Alias, Mission Impossible 3) launched his idea of a mysterious creature coming out of New York Harbor and trashing the city with an intriguing teaser trailer.  A group of young Manhattan yuppies are in the middle of a going away party for their friend who is leaving, suddenly there is what feels like an earthquake, then an explosion up in the distance that collapses a skyscraper.  Then the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the middle of the street and slides to a halt, showing a lot of damage and leaving us wondering...'What the HELL?\\"  There ends the teaser trailer.    There are few things more terrifying then seeing a catastrophic event unfold in the eyes of a person who is actually seeing it happen and recording it at the same time.  Lets put aside the questionably realistic aspects such as how this one person came across so many events of the attack that we get to see so much.  And that these young people would venture back into the city to rescue their friend who they believe is trapped.  Focusing on those things just raises skepticism.  Let's remember, this is a MOVIE...about a MONSTER; basic suspension of disbelief is required when you first walk in on this one.      So, moving on.  The concept of the movie being shot with a hand held camera is not new, everyone remembers `The Blair Witch' project.  Some remember it and get nauseated at the thought of it.  This one is not nearly as bad, however it is like watching the entire story through a drinking straw.  You only gets specific pieces of information at one time.  The film makers use this to their advantage whenever possible.  It actually cuts on production costs and allows things like off camera sounds to have a greater affect.     Now for the plot;  The video starts at the beginning as if being viewed by an official group, probably Military or high Government.  It is deemed `Classified' and titled `Cloverfield'.  Thedrama starts with two young people who have had an intimate night together.  Then the video kicks over to the preparation for the aforementioned party.  The party is for Rob, who is leaving for Japan.  Rob is in love with Beth (the couple at the beginning of the video), and vice versa. Apparently they have been for a long time.  But only recently did they consummate their feelings and then document their day afterward at Coney Island on the same video camera.  Once the party is in full swing, the festivities are abruptly interrupted by explosions and earthquakes.  As Hud, one of the party goers, documents the attack, there are moments where he stops recording and you see glimpses of Rob and Beth's `Good Day'.  This is a reminder of why Rob goes back into the city for her.  He regrets not following up on his feelings for Beth after their night together, especially after she shows up at the party with a date.  He feels compelled to go rescue her if possible because he won't just wait to find out what happens to her later.  This is the stuff of young compulsive love, and over the top drama; `do anything for it, damn the consequences'.  But it is a somewhat valid reason as to why the four turn to go back into the city to give us better glimpses of this creature who is tearing up the city.    The movie has some genuinely terrifying scenes and the special effects are top notch.  You get a good sense of this being real and you don't ever really find yourself telling the guy to point the camera in a specific direction.  They seem to get everything you need to see.  The monster itself is a strange sight to behold.  There is never any explanation for it's appearance or it's purposes.  Many theories are thrown out but nothing is really confirmed.  The ending is very ambiguous and really leaves things out in the open.  I have to say I liked this movie but mostly for it's single perspective use of the camera and how well it's told through this method.  Had it been shot in a standard way, it would not have been as entertaining.  Nor would it give any clout to the ending.  I give it three and half stars.
B000002H97|4.0|I was introduced to this album via the radio when I was about 4.5 years old.  I heard Enter Sandman and there was just something about that very first note, that unmistakable sound that got me hooked.  My parents got the tape and I remember sneaking this into my room and cranking it up.  I also remember the Freddie Mercury benefit concert in Wimbledon back in 92 and Metallica playing to start out.  This album introduced me to ...And Justice for All and I like that album, however, I could not fully dig Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets.  I think that Metallica for me was a phase- I listened to it when I was 4 to about 8 or 9, then listened to it from about age 12 to 14.  This album, the songs Enter Sandman, Holier than Thou, Wherever I may Roam, The Unforgiven, Sad But True, Of Wolf and Man, Nothing Else Matters and God that Failed were probably my favorites of the album that kickstarted my fascination with rock music.  I admit, I haven't listened to the Black Album for quite a few years and it may reignite my passion I once had for this album.  Maybe I've outgrown it.  Only time will tell, however, this is a fine album that brings back many fond memories.
0394800184|5.0|This was one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books when I was little. I am 24 now and I still have my book (and yes its falling apart). I am keeping it to read to my kids someday. Cute story about a baby bird who goes looking for his mother who went out to get some food. He meets all sorts of things along the way and asks them all \\"Are you my mother?\\". I saw another review about this book saying that it was \\"Scarry\\" and I can't help but roll my eyes. I never once thought the book was scarry when I was little nor did my brother. I am sure your kids will love it as much as so many other generations have. Hey it's Dr. Seuss, you just can't go wrong! :)
B0018AK9RA|1.0|Rob and Glenn need to sit in a quiet room somewhere and listen to Screaming for Vengeance, British Steel, and Hell Bent all the way through, and then try to write some songs that sound like THAT.  That is what made them famous and rich.  This cd should come with a warning from the surgeon general that it may cause drowsiness and you should not play it while driving or operating heavy machinery.
B00005JPSM|5.0|I don't care what some say.  There is nothing new under the sun... so yes, you can figure out the story.  So what?    There was no nudity and I can't recall profanity but I do have TVG.  It was a sweet, romantic story.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have seen the musical on stage, and this captures it well, especially if you never had a close-up view.  My daughter, who is 5, watches it over and over.  We just took her to see the musical live, and it was amazing, of course, but she had to watch the DVD as soon as we got home.
0446402389|5.0|Having never written a review of any sort, I could not help but express my thanks to the author for this reality check describing Stalin's Russia. The atrocities of the serial killer and those experienced by the Russian general population are the same in their brutality and insanity. This is a serial killer story straight from the pages of Animal Farm. If you are a grandparent give this book to your children. They will appreciate a good fiction story and gain a better picture of what happens in a totalitarian state. Later they can share this book with your grandchildren.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Layered, interesting, funny, and full of action, nothing is quite as this appears in this crazy non-stop kung fu action movie. During a time of economic crisis the Ax Gang takes control of most of 'China' in the 40s.. the story seemingly focuses on the plight of one particular impoverished ghetto 'Pig Sty Alley'.    The genius of the movie is how the focus constantly shifts, the references to other classic movies, brilliant camera work, and brilliant action sequences. A must have for Stephen Chow fans, and if you've never heard of Chow but love comedy/action/martial arts movies.. this is something you NEED to see.    The Blu-Ray disc is phenomenal to watch (repeatedly.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I'd like to say first that I am not an Austen fan. I generally don't like the movies made about her books, nor do I like her books. However, this movie was cute. I would assume that is because it doesn't catch the essence of Austen's works like some people say it doesn't, and since that very essence is what I don't like, I loved this movie. If you're really into Austen books, try the other version (I haven't seen it, so I can't recommend it more than that), but if you're just looking for a good, happy chick flick, this is a great one. Go Mr. Knightly! I want to know his first name...

Beautiful music, highly dramatic, and both movies really should be sold as a pair.

0670020745|1.0|I am a young stroke survivor. I had an ischemic stroke when I was 34 (3 years younger than the author) in the right hemisphere of my brain.    The absolute worst thing about this book is how the author romanticizes strokes. There is nothing great or cool about a stroke. While I realize that someone can't walk away saying \\"wow, strokes are cool, I want one\\" and go out to get one, I can't stress how dangerous it is to romanticize strokes in this manner. They are medical emergencies. This book is irresponsible and does a disservice to stroke survivors and stroke fatalities in the world.    She minimizes the pain, suffering, agony, and fight to reclaim movement and abilities. No stroke experience is the same - mine was 'minor' and although it was years ago, I continue to fight in recovery. Therefore, even with 'minor' strokes, the recovery is difficult and not 'cool'.    I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book.
B001794FOK|2.0|I really hate it when a movie that I was really excited about seeing ends up completely disappointing me once I finally get the opportunity to watch it. Such was the case with the recent release of \\"Jumper\\" from director Doug Liman (\\"The Bourne Identity\\" and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\"), starring Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Rachel Bilson, and Jamie Bell. The previews were entertaining, showcasing the film's impressive visual effects, and showing what turned out to be the best scenes from star Hayden Christensen's performance, in order to paint him in a much more positive light in regards to his less than stellar acting ability. Not surprising to me and many others was the fact that the film was universally panned by the majority of critics across the nation, yet I still wanted to see the movie, because I figured it would still be entertaining due to the fact that critics generally despise science-fiction, and well I generally disagree with them on that genre. Sadly, after watching the film, I now find myself having to say that I completely agree with the throng of critics that blasted the film, and I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back on what is possibly the worst film of 2008.    \\"Jumper\\" is the story of David Rice (Hayden Christensen), a man who was bullied throughout his childhood and ends up leaving the love of his life, a girl named Millie (Rachel Bilson) to start over, and is now living the good life with all the wealth he could possibly imagine. He's a man who appears to have everything a person could ask for, except he's never had to work for any of it; instead, he uses his amazing ability to teleport from place to place taking anything and everything he wants for himself. David believes he is the only one of his kind until he meets another `jumper' named Griffin (Jamie Bell) who warns him of a group known as the Paladins, that are led by a mysterious and deadly man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), their goal is to findand eliminate all `jumpers' from the face of the Earth. Now, David finds himself stuck in the middle of a war he doesn't understand, with the fate of not only himself but everyone he cares about hanging in the balance.    While I was watching \\"Jumper\\" a couple of things went through my mind over the course of the film. First, is the extreme confusion in regards to why executives in Hollywood continue to believe that Hayden Christensen (best known for his work in the `Star Wars' prequels) is even a remotely decent actor? Lets face it the man cannot act, he was mediocre at best in his first starring role in the smash hit \\"Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones\\" and seemed a little bit more comfortable and skilled in \\"Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith\\"; however, even in those films (which are by far his best work to date) he was nothing to be all that impressed by as far as his acting talent was concerned. In the recent release \\"Awake\\" co-starring Jessica Alba, I thought Hayden had possibly improved his acting game to the point that he was finally an average movie star, but with his work in \\"Jumper\\" he quickly put that thought to rest, and firmly cemented himself in my mind as quite possibly the worst actor in all of Hollywood. Well, now that I've got that tirade out of the way I can continue on with what other thoughts occurred to me while I was watching this sub-par movie.    The next thing I wonder is why is it that good, sometimes even great actors lower their standards in order to star in drivel such as this. Veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson (`Star Wars' prequels) has made so many great movies throughout his career, along with a few stinkers along the way as any actor does from time to time, but why would he even be remotely interested in wasting his considerable talents on this movie is beyond me. The same goes for Diane Lane (\\"Untraceable\\") who has gained more and more credibility as an actress in Hollywood throughout the last decade or so, but thenshe does a film like this, and you wonder if maybe she's starting to lose her ability to discern between good and bad movie roles. My only guess, and the only way that I figure these stars can keep their respect and reputations intact, is that they only made \\"Jumper\\" for the paycheck, which I would hope was a ridiculously large amount, otherwise the choice just doesn't make sense to me.    The story in \\"Jumper\\" began with some possibility of being interesting to me, but then things began to unravel when Hayden Christensen began speaking his lines as blandly as possible. Aside from that, the story quickly appeared to be too shallow to really draw me into this supposedly ancient war between `jumpers' and the zealous Paladins. I wanted more depth to be given to what drives the Paladins to hunt the `jumpers', explanation as to why the `jumpers' always seem to commit crime instead of using their ability for good, and most importantly what the writers were thinking when they chose to make the hero of the movie, Hayden's character David, into such an idiot and a weakling. I mean he's always getting caught, and whenever he gets into a fight he always gets his rear handed to him, that is until he teleports to achieve the upper hand, but in a fair fight he always loses, how are we supposed to root for someone like that. Not to mention the fact that when the other `jumpers' are caught by the Paladins they seem to have a much harder time of escaping, yet David escapes with relative ease by comparison, and his partner in crime, Griffin (Jamie Bell) even points out how stupid David is for getting caught all the time when he makes the statement, \\"How is it you have survived this long?\\" (or something along those lines). All in all, the story written by Simon Kinberg (\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\"), who rewrote the film after two previous scripts from writers David S. Goyer (\\"Batman Begins\\") and Jim Uhl (\\"Fight Club\\") were rejected by the film's director Doug Liman, was full of so many holes and instances in the story where it seemed the audience was just supposed to fill in the gaps to make the movie make sense, that I wonder if there was a lot of content that had been edited out of the final film, and if a director's cut of \\"Jumper\\" would possibly make for a better movie experience, although I don't think I could sit through any more of Hayden's horrible acting in this film than I already have.    From a visual effects standpoint, \\"Jumper\\" is virtually flawless thanks to the extremely talented group at Weta Digital (\\"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\"). The teleportation sequences are fun, and at first are exciting to see; however, the film uses the effect so much that it becomes tiresome and each `jump' sequence looks and feels just like the last to where you don't look forward to seeing them anymore. Now, I've seen special effects be repeated within movies before (\\"bullet time\\" in the critically acclaimed \\"The Matrix\\"), but generally when an effect is used more than once something is done to make it feel different than the previous, and that just did not seem to be the case in \\"Jumper\\". I don't know if the increasingly bland feeling I had towards the film's over-reliance on the same effect was because of a lack of imagination on Weta's part (which I doubt, given their stellar work in the past) or a lack of imagination and/or creativity on behalf of director Doug Liman (which is where I'm more inclined to assign the blame for not only this, but the entire failure of this movie).    Overall, \\"Jumper\\" had the potential to be an extremely entertaining, science-fiction action adventure film; however, weak acting, an overly simplistic storyline, and visual effects that went from brilliant to boring brought this film quickly to its knees and left me feeling like I lost a couple of brain cells in the process of having to turn my brain off in order to even sit through the 90 minute run time for the film.    \\"Jumper\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.
1400032717|5.0|This story, though not actually a mystery, captivated me from the very beginning. Seeing the world through Christopher's eyes is both entertaining and educational. I've never read anything like this before. It's both simple and complex at the same time. I'm suggesting this book for my book club. This is a great book for anyone thirteen and older (my estimate).

B0015519VS|4.0|If you have expectations for this album to compare to his past ones (8701, Confessions) then you will probably be disappointed... that is how I felt when I first popped it in my car.  However, the more you listen to it and understand where Usher is in his life (i can relate since I have a young son and wife), then you can appreciate this album... It has it's hits and misses, but overall i enjoy it
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|This is a solid effort by Elbow, filled with medium tempo songs which are both musical and competent. If this seems like damning with faint praise, I guess it is. There is nothing wrong with this disc, and to be fair I know this is purely a matter of taste. The fact is that some discs hit you and others don't. This one doesn't. Oh it will remain on my iPod, and I'll enjoy the songs when they pop up in shuffle mode, but I won't seek this one out, or look forward excitedly to digging into it deeper. There isn't really a \\"deeper\\" there with this CD. It is good, not great. Musical, but not inspired. You will enjoy it but, if you're like me, it won't change your life.
B000JSI7AI|3.0|This movie deserves the 3 academy awards for its excellent acting ... but because I knew in advance that both main actors where hetero I was not drawn into the plot. I even good bore.     Sure, it's a good thing that this movie was made, if only to bring forth the fact, that gay people are not \\"freaks of nature\\" or \\"abomination from hell\\" as repeatedly told to us by the conservative righteous holier-than-thou evangelists.     I much preferred \\"SOLDIER'S GIRL\\" which is an extremely moving \\"true\\" story that shows the drastic impact and consequences, when we are dealing with hatred, bigotry, ignorance, homo-odium and intolerance.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Pretty good.  Little boy Anakin is great.  Much less whiny than his older self.  My husband pretty much loves Qui-Gon Jinn and there's that crazy sith with the red and black face paint.
B00004BZ16|5.0|This is the album that turned me onto music when I was a kid. Before that music was \\"nice\\" but not necessary. That aside, this is still my favourite album of all time and I can't believe I lived without it for almost a decade. Since being reunited with \\"Sandinista!\\" I have listened to it almost every single day. The best album by the best band ever.
0307276902|4.0|Regardless of how I feel about the whole controversy surrounding this book, it turned out to be a good story and I'll rate it for what it is...A work of fiction, based on a true story.<br />As a story is wasn't bad - not bad at all, especially after the first couple hundred pages.<br /><br />For me, the beginning was so redundant that I came close to giving up on it.  The first 200 pages could have easily been summed up like this...My name is James Frey and I'm a total mess. I'm 23 years old. I've been an alcoholic for the last ten years. I'm a drug Addict, and a Criminal. I'm currently in a treatment facility. I hate myself and deserve whatever physical and or mental pain and agony that comes my way. In fact, I'm such a crazy alcoholic, such a tough drug addict, such a hardened criminal, I'll take any pain you got - bring it on!<br /><br />The rest of the novel is a compelling story about the author's time spent in a treatment facility for drug and alcohol addiction.  It is a story worth the cost of the book and the time spent reading it.<br /><br />As far as the hullabaloo - I knew all along that many of the facts presented in this memoir were not true; the author himself has admitted to lying.  Therefore, I didn't experience that surprising feeling of betrayal when you believe something to be true, only to find out otherwise.  However, when schools, universities, colleges, newspapers, etc. are so intense about not tolerating plagiarism, why do publishers, editors and most of all readers accept any lack of honesty and integrity when it come to labeling literature?  Why sort literature by genre at all if we aren't going to have some standards set that we can trust?  Yes, I guess it (labeling this book a memoir) really does bug me.
B0018RWD1S|4.0|I have been so amazed with Amy Winehouse's voice. I love the music, totally 60's meandering through the CD. She may have her problems and she does need to get over that if she really wants to keep up the wonderful work of her music, but to listen to her sing you are transported to those 60's thoughts.
0743564170|4.0|\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a Gothic-style novel set in modern-day England and in the 1920s.  It begins with the story of Margaret Lea, an eccentric and reclusive young woman who spends her days writing obscure biographies and helping her father manage his book shop.  Ms. Lea has a number of demons she struggles with..primarily a mother who pays little attention to her and a preoccupation with a traumatic family secret she uncovered as a child.<br /><br />One day, Ms. Lea receives a letter from Vida Winter, a famous writer who is looking for a biographer.  Vida has had many biographers write for her in the past but she has never told \\"the truth\\" and, thus, nobody really knows who Vida Winter is.  This time is different, however, because Vida Winter is terminally ill.  This time, she has promised to tell the truth..<br /><br />Ms. Lea agrees to the project and soon learns that Vida Winter's story is full of mystery, intrigue, scandal and ghosts.  The book alternates between Ms. Lea's voice and Vida's voice and, as Vida recounts her life's story, Ms. Lea is able to come to terms with her own demons.<br /><br />This is an extremely well-written book.  The language is superb and full of rich detail without being tedious.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys novels in the female Gothic genre.<br /><br />As a post-script..I listened to this on-tape and have no complaints save for the fact that the woman who narrated Margaret Lea's character had a voice that was a little grating at times.  Though, I found that I was so absorbed in the story that I failed to notice it after awhile.
0691126658|1.0|For the SECOND time Amazon sent me the incorrect addition of this book!! What is advertised vs what was shipped is unacceptable!! They shipped an old copyright instead of the newest!! I'm very disappointed in Amazon!!
B0017U7PT6|2.0|When I heard that line in the movie, I could only chuckle.  By that point, I was bored to tears.    You can make a movie with wild historical innacuracies.  You can make a movie with bad actors.  You can make a movie that defies the laws of physics.  You can make a movie without a semblance of a plot.  What you can't do is make it boring, and that is this movie's biggest fault.  I was not expecting much from this film, either.    I'm giving this movie one star, but an extra star for the digital copy.  Of course, that's not a big deal for a movie this bad, but it is still my favorite special feature.  I like to watch movies on the train or plane on my iPod; this is a welcome feature from the studios, and I hope it continues.
0743289692|4.0|This book relates the heroic story of a young woman and her struggle to   live out her life in freedom. It starts with her terror at 5 yrs. old being held down and circumcised along with her sister and brother. This episode will haunt her the rest of her life. She then struggles to get an education and stands up for what she believes women are entitled to--freedom to pick the man they want to marry and freedom to choose a career in life.  Her harrowing flight to escape an arranged marriage to a much older man is vividly detailed as she struggles to reach Holland and her asylum. Her life is threatened but she holds firm to her beliefs. She also reveals the Koran and its teachings that make women second class citizens. A fascinating and fast moving book about her life and struggles in the Moslem culture and her religious journey that eventually makes her an atheist.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This album rocks. Shinedown is back people! Was kind of dissapointed with Us and Them... this album proves Shinedown is a powerhouse of talent. Just go listen. You wont regret it!
B0018TLRTU|5.0|This CD/DVD set has the fantastic Billy Idol videos that we loved on MTV!  I'm thrilled to be able to watch these videos again, with beautiful quality.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Priest has always tried to be different on almost every release. They succeded on this one too. And hats off to them for making the cd they wanted to make. I like it but it wasn`t the side of priest I had hoped would be on this cd. There are shades of Old Priest( rocka rolla, sad wings) thruout this one. Not bad at all if you are a long time fan. If you were looking for painkiller... look elsewhere. Better than turbo and point of entry. Buy it so they make another Cd... a METAL ONE!   My complaints are as follows :   1. Weak guitar mix   2. No big tube guitar tone!! Sounds like Digitech crap!!   3. No real barn burner tunes. IE painkiller, freewheel burning, exciter.   4. NO bass as usual   5. Scott could have played all the drums w/ one hand.( & may have)  I give it a 3.5
0385340567|2.0|[[ASIN:0385340567 Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher Novels)]]  When an author needs a villan, who does he call?  If really lacking in imagination, how about that old stand-by, some facet of the U.S. government?  Add a dollop of Christian fanaticism and abracadabra: the latest/worst Jack Reacher novel.  Uninspired, implausable, and uninvolving.  Difficult to belief this is the same Lee Child who made Jack Reacher so readable in previous outings.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Well, the movie was not remastered, but personally I could care less. This movie is hilarious and one of the absolute best! Plus, I love the \\"Holy Grail in LEGO\\" that is available off the 2nd DVD's menu. Buy this movie, as it is one of the best!
B001ACY8D2|5.0|It would be truly unfair to compare \\"Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust\\" to Sigur Ros's previous three records. First, this offers a new direction in sound and has little to do with their ethereal if entrancing previous LP's. Second, it incorporates a more joyous view on every track. And thirdly, how can one compare four albums that flow like a continuous stream, with music so dispair and no lyrics whatsoever?  The departure from the beautiful yet claustrophobic sound of their first two albums can already be heard on some tracks form Takk, but it isn't until the first track and lead single of Med Sud... that we see that they can as well succeed as a \\"pop\\" band.   As absurd as it appears, this is just one of those albums that needs to be listened to from beginning to end to be appreciated in all its beauty and complexity. Do not be fooled by the simplicity of opening track: there are some gems mixed in with the radio friendgly stuff(to name one, 'Festival\\", one of the best songs they've ever composed) that make this record strong from every corner it's seen.  That said, Med Sud is a grower. Its appeal will not show immediately like it did with Takk or even Untitled, but it grows in magnificence slowly with every listen.  The live rendition of the new songs is outstanding as well. If you are lucky to have them play near your hometown go see them by all means. One can only witness the complete Sigur Ros experience (music and feelings) by seeing them play live.   If this review lacks of any concrete mention to specific tracks is because I consider it incomplete to dissect an entire piece by unit. I recommend this record to anyone who liked or even to those whose liking was manning after Takk. It will sound like a nice fresh surprise and get you back on track with their music.

0385338724|3.0|As a fan of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series I was really looking forward to reading her other books.  This one was somewhat of a let down though.  Lexi, the main character, was not nearly as likable as Becky Bloomwood (from the Shopaholic series) and I was frustrated throughout the book with her lack of honesty to herself.  Many things are obvious right away to the reader, but it takes Lexi much too long to figure things out for herself.<br /><br />Also, I'm surprised there haven't been many (if any) complaints about the end of the book.  I suppose it is somewhat of a \\"happy ending\\" but ****** SPOILERS ****** what about her memory?  I assumed throughout the story that she was eventually going to have that moment where all her memories came rushing back.  Yet it never came.  All those memories she had with Jon are gone.  I realize there is still the possibility that she could get her memory back later, but I'm disappointed Kinsella didn't wrap up the ending with Lexi recovering the last three years of her life.  Sure, there are probably parts of it she'd like to forget, but there's probably a lot worth remembering.  For me, the ending was disappointing, to say the least. ****** END SPOILERS ******<br /><br />\\"Remember Me?\\" had its share of humorous moments though.  I did laugh out loud quite a few times.  And up until the end I was pretty pleased with the book.  However, I expected more and was left unsatisfied.
0896760839|5.0|love the book - you can use this book to re-create period fashions. It will also detail the construction and materials used in the period. the sources used are quite extensive.    I do have a major problem ordering from an overseas country - very difficult.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|I'll keep this one short and sweet. I had the pleasure of seeing testament live during 1 of thier 4 american tour dates last year. Nick Barker had been deported and Paul Bostaph(my favorite all time drummer btw) filled in on 48 hours notice. They played a blistering 21 song set with The Afterlife off of this as a taste of what this would be like. Well, it was a good taste but this album is unbelievable on all accounts. The Afterlife is a killer song and holds up well but there are many strong tracks on this release. I'm glad they kept Bostaph as thier permanent drummer also. He brings alot to the band. All you can really say is it's a Testament album, That's all the compliment it needs. For the glory of just is the build up for the damn bursting. The next 3 tracks(more than meets the eye,the evil has landed, the formation of damnation) all run at a blistering pace with excellent playing by all involved and chuck billy's powerful vocals standing above all. In short, this album is a heavy metal lovers dream, a band who never sold out or gave in to any trends release another master piece on thier own terms and it is incredible. The other standout tracks for me are the persecuted won't forget, henchmen ride, killing season, afterlife, leave me forever(with some of greg christians great bass playing holding it together). Do yourself a favor if you haven't already, pick it up. You won't be disappointed. Can't wait to see them on the metal masters tour. Gonna rule.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is on my list for best movies of all time! I love it. He was an extraordinary man and the movie was clean and so well made. The details were wonderful. It was like watching an adult rated G movie, b.c. of the lack of filth so many other movies have today, yet it was still so suspensful and engaging! If I could give it higher than 5 stars I would and I am not usually drawn into political history, but this movie made it so interesting. Well worth the money. Enjoy!
B0017I1FO4|3.0|I know everyone is gonna hate this review but their hard rock songs have lost there edge. You can no longer tell Shinedown from every other average hard rock band. Devour just sounds like an average band, making an average song. They had a sound about them on there first cd, that was so much different from anything else out there. It is gone on the harder songs. With that being said.. There slower songs.. Are AMAZING! Which is good for me because I have always liked them better. But I can listen to leave a whisper over and over again. With this cd, I find myself looking down at every hard song, only to see its half over and me wanting to push the next button.        Now to the good stuff.. Second chance is very good.. The crow and the butterfly is just as good. Then you get to 3 of the last 4, and I can't pick a favorite. What a Shame, Breaking Inside, and Call Me are 3 of the best songs Shinedown has ever made. If only the whole cd had the quality these do. And while they are a little different, you can tell its Shinedown. But I do still miss the sound of Leave a Whisper..      *UPDATE: After a lot of people not liking my review, I decided to try and really give the hard songs a chance. My decision and review hasn't changed much. I tried focusing on the 4 songs people seem to like the most. The sound of madness- its just average, really. The chorus is good and when it comes on I can listen to it, but as soon as the chorus ends I wanna change the song. Cry or help- I'm sorry but I don't get this song at all. I feel like any hard rock band can make a song just like this. I can't listen to it. Sin with a Grin- is boring.. Not much else to say here, its super repetitive. And Devour, it is just plain bad in my opinion.   When I say they lost their distinct sound, I did not mean the voice. Any Shindown fan can tell Brent's voice from anyone else. It is very easy to do, I mean the \\"sound\\" as in the music. It just isn't as distinct, it is more like the rest of the rock world. And just remember, this is an opinion, nothing more. Everyone likes different things. I like their softer music because the harder stuff doesn't seperate them from all the other bands out there.
1594489505|4.0|Just when you think you're left with nothing but cynicism from all the difficulties and pain in life, you come across a novel such as this and you find yourself marveling yet again...<br /><br />It's not so much as a celebration of a woman's spirit, but a tribute as well to unshakeable hope and the humbling capacity of humans for sacrifice.<br /><br />Reading this novel, I can't help but feel thankful that I have not, so far, experienced the kind of oppression that women in Afghanistan ultimately suffered (at least, from my own standpoint, what I could discern as oppression...but who knows...). Between Mariam and Laila, it's difficult to decide who got it worse. At the surface, it's the former: born ostracized, poor, and, later, unable to bear children; whilst the latter is almost the complete opposite. But such differences pale in the face of a husband's despotism and a country's devastation. One would think that a person can just take so much, and, yet, these two never flagged. They drew strength from one another and from the selves they're left with after every blow from Fate. And always, there was that conviction to fight to survive, in the hopes of finally waking up to that day where the Afghanistan they knew comes back to them.<br /><br />All-in-all, this was another provocative story by Hosseini. I have to confess, though, that I loved The Kite Runner more. I don't take it against this novel--I guess I was unfairly hoping for a repeat performance of a flawless storytelling. Though still very dramatic, it's not as heart-wrenching-snot-dripping as the first (I'm afraid that's usually how I rate books). But that is just one reader's opinion. This is still a rewarding experience that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
B0014JOLI8|5.0|A dark and fantastic beginning for the trilogy Amulet of Samarkand is an excellent book. Bartimeaus is surely the wittiest djinni known to our world (and his). The first book of the trilogy takes place on an alternate earth where magic takes a new and dark twist. Magicians rule with an iron fist and enslave magical beings for their dark purposes. Bartimaeus offers incredible ingenuity and impertinence guaranteed to make you laugh your brains out (quit literally I'm afraid).  Darkly funny and creative Amulet of Samarkand is sure to get you hooked on the series.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This can be watched again and again and never gets tiresome. The scenes are like you are right there with the cameraman. You have to watch it often as there is so much you could miss. You are taken in with the scenery and action. Each time you see it you see something you missed previously.
B0016A2FFG|3.0|Is he really laying it down? Uh,,,,,I'm not sure actually. Sure this has the trademark Al Green sound and isms that did the business back in the day, and it's good to hear all that again, but to be fair, the strength and quality of many songs isn't really what I'd prefer to have Al wrap his tonsils around. Is there a monster track on offer? Hardly. It's a pleasant enough album, but then I go, wait a minute, this is Al Green, cmon dude. Is there a Let's Stay Together, a I'm Still In Love With You, a Back Up Train, a Love And Happiness, a Have You Been Making Out O.K., even a Judy on offer? (I could go on obviously, I mean this IS Al Green) Well they are nowhere to be found. Again, it's all riiiiiight, but Lay It Down is not a playlist staple on my ponderosa. Having said all that, I do like the title track, and love the groove of both I'm Wild About You, and Standing In The Rain, and upon reflection, feel this trio may indeed have sat well with the aforementioned tracks on those great albums he was making. However, I'll go back to his earlier stuff when I've got to get my Al on, or I need to remind the young uns what real music is all about.
B0014I4KIK|1.0|Ok , So I bought the album because I kept hearing that she has a really nice old school jazzy sound to her and that her music surpasses that of Amy Winehouse. All I can say is that this album is WHACK!!! . I love music and listen to every genre. Believe me I usually buy albums and if they suck whatever who cares but this one I thought would be a hot one because of all the publicity, but none-the-less it proves again that a good marketing team and plenty of money to pay radio stations to push this album has made her a success. If you dont believe me just listen to the free clips. this album blows .
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|A little disclaimer to begin this ramble in the form of a review.<br />I have never liked a Coldplay record.<br />Now that is not to say that I didn't like Coldplay. At one time or another I have owned all three of their previous studio records and found each one to be loaded with filler, with a few great singles thrown in. And that's an okay thing to be, to be a singles band.<br />So I was kind of reluctant to buy the bands forth studio effort, \\"Viva La Vida or Death and all His Friends\\", feeling that it would be more of the same. But the one two punch of lead songs \\"Violet Hill\\" and \\"Viva La Vida\\" piqued my interest enough to fork over my heard earned ten dollars at the local record store when I saw it.<br />And I can honestly say that \\"Viva La Vida\\" is by far the groups strongest, tightest and most accomplished album to date.<br />\\"Viva La Vida\\" has been written up as Coldplay's \\"experimental\\" album, in the vein of their two biggest influences Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" or U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\", or a record that would rewrite the rules of what the band is capable of.<br />This is not true. What the band does on \\"Viva La Vida\\" is streamline their attack, not trying to write larger than life anthems, but rather keep things earth bound. All the things that made Coldplay successful are still here, only improved and feeling less forced that they did on the groups previous album, 2005's \\"X&Y\\".<br />The group does deviate from formula, not depending so heavily on the verse chorus verse structure of most pop tunes. The group also flirts a little more with different drum patterns and instrumentation, but instead of going overboard with these sort of things, the group incoporate them into their sound.<br />The lead off instrumental \\"Life in Technicolor\\" is a gorgeous, beauitful introduction that moves at a perfect pace, leading into the morose but not depressing \\"Cemeteries of London\\". \\"42\\" and \\"Lovers in Japan\\" both feature interesting, unpredictable melodies that keep them interesting but also ensure that they should become live staples for years to come. The two lead off singles, the title track and \\"Violet Hill\\", probably my favorite song here, but take the Coldplay formula of larger than life hooks and choruses and alter them slightly to great effect. And am I the only person who hears a little of the Beatles psychedelic swirl in, uhm, \\"Strawberry Swirl\\"?<br />Musically, the band pulls out all the stops here, proving themselves to be more accomplished and versatile than they have on any previous record. The guitars bend and add to atmosphere, the drums are pounding and the bass carries counter melodies that always enhance the songs.<br />Lyrically, there are enough changes to the formula to show growth from lead singer Chris Martin, though as much as ever it's really how he sings than what he is singing, really.<br />Really, I have no real complaints with this album. There are moments that work better than others, but the record moves at such at brisk pace (right at forty five minutes. And am I the only one feels that that is roughly the perfect length for an album?) , that these moments are few and far between.<br />So if you are a fan, I would highly recommend this album. And if you are not a fan, you might find yourself surprised by \\"Viva La Vida\\".should become live staples for years to come.

0316166685|5.0|Yes, it is hard to read about the rape and murder of a young girl, or anyone for that matter. But this book is about so much more than that. It is about family, life, death, love, and the cold hard fact that this world is not always a sunny place. This was my first Alice Sebold book and after I finnished it, I was compelled to buy Lucky, her memior, and The almost Moon, her latest novel. If you're read Lucky, then you know that Alice sebold is not just some freak who can make up a gruesome story about the rape and murder of a child. She knows the details because she's been there herself. Anyways, I got a bit frustrated when I read some of the reviews for this book. Some people are just so mean. If you didn't like the book, fine. But don't sit there and bad mouth everything about it or question the author's abilities. All in all, I thought this book was amazing and I would definately recommend it.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|the chances of anyone having to fight off a regime of oppressive Christians is almost non-existant.  It would have been much better if the government was being oppresive based on environmentalism or a police state for \\"our security\\".  Small gripe, but a gripe none-the-less.  Otherwise it's a pretty good action flick and a good reason to check the power of the state.
0307237702|2.0|I tried and I tried and I tried to read this book.  Now that he is the presumptive Democratic Party candidate for the U.S. President, I thought it was time I read something about him. This book didn't tell me anything.He is the champion of writing super long run-on sentences.  You get done reading one and you have no idea what he just said.  Some sentences take up an entire paragraph! He tries to dumb down the use of big words but it is just the sentence structure that made the book totally unreadable for me. He brings up some interesting questions about our culture in general, about the two party political system, about religion, etc. but he makes no attempt at providing any answers. Now obviously this book was written before he got into any Presidential campaign, but if he was asking these questions back then, why did'nt he provide any solutions in his primary platform? One has to wonder if this guy is all talk and no action???  FOr our country's sake, I hope not.
B000QGEB12|4.0|This is such a great movie! Great Martial arts -- and great comedy! All in one...
B000NVIXFK|4.0|About half of the songs on this album are very good actually but I could skip the other half especially the slow songs.   I would say this is a departure from previous albums.  Songs I like are Far Cry, Armor and Sword, Workin' Them Angels, The Larger Bowl, Spindrift,  Malignant Narciscism.
B000053VAZ|4.0|You'll never hear me say that `Benny & Joon' is a perfect film, but you will hear me say that it is a good one, one that I personally enjoy very much.  Do I think that it accurately portrays the handicaps of a mental illness?  No, I do not.  But, keeping in perspective that this is a `quote-unquote' family comedy you don't really expect it to portray the mentally ill perfectly.  To me, `Benny & Joon' is less a film about mental handicaps and more a film about family relationships; and in that respect it works just fine.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Benny and Joon, brother and sister, who live together.  Their parents are deceased (or so I would gather) and so they have each other, and that's about it.  That is until Sam comes to town.  The strange cousin of one of Benny's poker buddies, Sam winds up staying in Benny's house when Joon loses a poker hand.  Sam turns out to be the best thing for Joon, and ultimately for Benny as well, for he teaches them both valuable lessons about life, love and relationships.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is highly preposterous when you think about it.  There is no way that a man in his right frame of mind would leave his mentally ill sister in the care of a complete stranger (especially one as eccentric as Sam).  It took me a minute to take this film seriously when I first realized that that was where this story was going, but the performances are so heartfelt (I'm tempted to say this is Depp as his very finest) that it elevates the material and allows the audience to connect and care about what they are watching.<br /><br />Of these performances, Depp is the surefire standout.  As Sam he is endearing, intriguing and all around entertaining.  Depp delivers one of his finest comedic performances to date here, in my opinion surpassing that of his fan favorite `Jack Sparrow'.  As Sam, Depp is genuine and sincere; likable and charming and all around a great comedic hero.  Aidan Quinn is superb as Benny, the overprotective older brother.  His reactions towards Sam and really everything involving his sister is genuine, you can see that.

B000WQWPJQ|4.0|The movie is well known so I will just state I was very happy with the picture/sound on this disc as others have stated. Was nice to revisit the movie, not sure how many times one would want to replay it but it has some great demo scenes!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|It's interesting that in all the supplemental material on this DVD I don't think anyone mentions [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], but that modern horror classic is the obvious jumping-off point for \\"Cloverfield.\\"  But \\"Blair Witch\\" is a subtle masterpiece of steadily mounting terror.  You have the time to get to know the characters and see how their awful fates are ingeniously worked out.  By contrast, \\"Cloverfield\\" overwhelms you with its visuals and special effects, but the experience proves to be exhausting and emotionally remote.  Because so much happens so fast the filmmakers apparently decided that such niceties as character development and psychological and even physical probability weren't really necessary.  Even given the context of a 300-foot monster smashing Manhattan, I found the characters' actions in rescuing a damsel in distress to be highly unlikely.  And who are these kids, anyway?  Some reviewers said that they were so obnoxious by the end of the movie the reviewers were rooting for the monster to eat all of them.  I wouldn't go that far.  But aside from the beauty of Beth (Odette Yustman) there's nothing memorable about any of the humans in \\"Cloverfield\\".  But the monster is pretty cool.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  If you want to start somewhere, this is a good start.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Listening to Duffy's \\"Rockferry\\" is like discovering an unknown Motown artist.  It is delightful on a warm, summer afternoon or a rainy Sunday morning.  My personal favorite is \\"Stepping Stone\\" in which the lyrics and rhythm create a pro-feminine anthem.  You'll want to hear this again and again.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|I missed the 60's and 70's raising children.  I heard a voice in the background of a video thru the internet.  I asked around and finally found that it was Leonard Cohen.  I love his voice.  He tells a story thru his songs and they are calming to me.  I'm glad I found him.  It's never too late.  I now have 6 of his CD's.
B000EBD9TY|4.0|Elia Kazan's 1951 classic captures the liquor drenched ambience of post-war New Orleans and inserts the beauty of Williams's characters as they live out their lives of \\"quiet desperation.\\" Vivien Leigh's Academy Award winning performance as Blanch Dubois strained the limits of her emotional stability; according to her husband Laurence Olivier. Her commitment is evident in this complex portrayal of a southern belle who looses the battle for sanity. Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden all turn in deeply personal performances making this film ahead of its time. Their work in Streetcar is a rare window into the development of American film acting at a time when this unique, highly naturalistic style, popularized by the Actors Studio, revolutionized cinema.
B000EGFVQS|1.0|My daughter was assigned The Lovely Bones for tenth grade reading.  I really feel that the graphic man-child rape that goes on for several pages and  perhaps the later sex scene are not for 15 year olds.  Unless your child is used to this sort of thing from movies or reading, I would ask that they be allowed to read another book although the way they are picking these summer reading list books these days it will probably be just as edgy or as I see it - offensive.  Well anyhow, read it for yourself, it's OK for more mature readers and if you find it on your youngsters required summer reading list, let the school know if you find it too sick or disturbing.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|The new album is quite simply another masterpiece of modern musical work from one of the world's most innovative and unique music group - Sigur Ros.  The first track, Gobbledigook, is absolutely amazing. To those who have dismissed it as a \\"pop song\\" - if it is, in fact, a \\"pop song\\", it's the most ADVANCED pop song I've ever heard, musically. What pop song can shift between time signatures and meters so easily and fluently, and drives your body to move along, that you're left with a dizzying sense of, \\"What... just... HAPPENED?\\" (one can also hear influence of composer Steve Reich in this song, so if you like it, check him out).   Don't put any prenotions of music history ahead of you when you listen to Sigur Ros. They working by their own rules, not the mainstream music scene's. This song was not written for \\"pop song\\" standards. It was written for THEIR standards alone, and it is a brilliant introduction to the new work as a whole.    They have not sold out - how can they sell out when they are as separated from the mainstream (US) music scene as they can possibly be?    The whole album floats through emotional territory with as much vigor and paitience as their past albums, but it's like staring at a beautiful landscape and simply... turning around and seeing the beautiful landscape that you could have missed if you had spent all day looking in one direction. This is a new direction. A new landscape. The sandbox that the members of Sigur Ros have been playing and creating in has just become bigger...    This album is also significant because it contains the first song ENTIRELY in ENGLISH (the only use before this was a name in \\"Heysatan\\" from \\"Takk\\"), and for us English-speaking fans, we should feel honored that Jonsi and the others decided to do this.    For those who like their earlier works, the minimalistic nature of the songs may come as a shock (but yet their work has ALWAYS been minimal in nature...), but it is enjoyable as MUSIC.    So listen to it as such. Not just as Sigur Ros, but as beautiful music. Which, obviously, it is.
B0017U7PT6|2.0|I took one star off for the bad science, another star for the plain acting, and the last star because it wasn't that interesting. It started off fine with a Eurasian hunter/ gather clad in an Ice Age period of 11,000BC chasing woolly mammoths. Strangely a raiding clan that looked like they were from the Iron Age (with metal) or even the Persian Empire plundered the small tribe like in Pathfinder. After that, things just doesn't make any senses anymore, nor was the acting very intriguing. Camilla Bell the main attraction was almost speechless and acted like in \\"the Quiet\\" where she played deaf. The lead character happen to wondered upon some prehistoric Terror Bird from 62-2 million years ago. Maybe there were saber-tooth tiger in the desert of African right by the Pyramid. Or somehow slave woolly mammoth were used to help build the pyramid. I believed the first Egyptian's Pyramid was built in 2600bc way later. We can forgive the movie for the bad science if the characters were more interesting or believiable, but they weren't. Why weren't there any sloth in this movie.<br /><br />This is a pointless movie that took elements from other great movies and decided the timeline that would fit all this mess is 10,000BC.<br /><br />Apocalypto - better pyramid slavery movie. Pathfinder- better raiding clan movie. This isn't a very good caveman movie either. Ice Age I and II had better human to animal interaction/relationship. Gladiators had better acting then this. The Geiko's Cavemen are a lot funnier then this. Being in the desert seem more agonizing in Passions of the Christ then this movie. The Beastmaster was a better beast-master then our hero here. At least the Pyramid scenes here were cooler then in the Mummy or Stargate. OK, one plus star because this film looked great on blu-ray.  I like the first 1/3 of the movie.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Brick is a great homage to the noirs of the 40s, but with a modern high school setting. Gordon-Levitt is a brilliant actor, and the rest of the cast is spot on too. The script and camera work are awesome; but the characters and style drive this movie the most. The dialogue is interesting because it has sort of a 40s feel to it. The movie has a bunch of cool twists that I didn't see coming. A few scenes are very funny, but mostly its a pretty intense drama. Definitely worth seeing for anyone open-minded

I read it in spanish and enjoyed the rich language, the love story, the twists and turns, the suspense, the characters... Definitely a book I will reccommend for many years to come!
073936474X|5.0|This is the 4th book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  Although Rick Riordan writes each book so that it can stand alone, I would recommend reading them in order starting with the Lightning Thief.  Anyone who is interested in mythology would find this series both entertaining and informative.  Our whole family loves this series.  Jesse Bernstein does a great job as the reader.
B0018AK9RA|2.0|Judas Priest have kicked butt on many albums over their career. When they reunited with Halford on the reunion album they returned to that classic sound on Angel Of Retribution after experimenting with Ripper Owens (more sucessfully on Demolition than on Jugulator). After doing that though I see why they thought it was a good idea to try something new. They can't just churn out another album recreating their past, that would be pretty stale where AOR was a welcome revisiting. So on Nostradamus they decided to do something bold when something bold was called for to keep their comeback rolling and made a double disc concept album.     Sadly its too long and cheesy. If they trimmed it down to one disc it might not have been so boring and given more songs a chance to stand out. Visions is the only song I really like. I have all of their albums, and the ones that were less than good (Jugulator and Ram It Down, which the production on this one sounds exactly like the latter) at least didn't bore me. Nostradamus is the only JP only album just can't get into at all.
1401302378|4.0|PROS: Well written, fluid prose, clear headers guide the reader, useful observations on how the Internet has changed many industries, excellent for the business reader and entrepreneur.<br /><br />CONS: Although the author generally writes in a concise writing style (which is nice), the book could be even shorter. Indeed, it grew out of a Wired article.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wasn't left amazed and blown away. It's a nice book. Well written and researched. Get it if you're an entrepreneur or you love to read how the Net disrupts industries. If you're only moderately interested in these subjects, then just read the Wired article and/or the user comments on this book.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|I usually don't like listening to Iconic musicians when they cash in or appear to cash in and do an album, when they should have 'left on a high note' and hung it up to preserve the music canon. Like Rod Stewart. Used to love his early stuff, but with his weak voice, I can't bear to listen to him NOW.     But BB King. When he is \\"ON\\" or putting in the effort, no one can sound like him. He actually is in 'better voice' here than his earlier works! It's a bit raw-but the energy is all there. He can just blow the doors off other tenors. It's a cutting contest what he does to Van Morrison in the vocal dept.; but it is all in good fun with \\"Early In The Morning\\", a good drinking song.    What I like about this album in a few words:    1) Eric Clapton doesn't sing on The Thrill Is Gone. EC uses his guitar to sing behind BB's superb vocal. Sounds better than in the 70's when he first got the Grammy for the tune.    2) On Tired of Your Jive, with Billy F. Gibbons-the bass player of choice plays an awesome walking bass line (who is this guy??) jazzy-so in the pocket and up medium in the mix-that it lets BB and Billy do what they do best!    3) Bobby Bland and BB did some sensational recordings on the Coconut Grove Live albums like \\"Together Again\\".  Real treasures if you can find them. Bobby is BB's favorite singer, and Mr. Bland simply loves \\"B\\" with all his heart and soul. They converse during their songs and with this track, you hear Bobby say once again to BB, \\"take your time, B...\\" To hear these two rogues stir it up in song, maybe for the REALLY LAST TIME, almost puts me in tears. Each has a killer vibrato and tenor set of pipes that can wet cement.    Others have made choices of their personal favorites, and I will go on to say there isn't a bad track on the album.    I play in clubs, and over the years -your ears get to know the 'real deal'. BB is full on-AND the guests are inspired to offer their best and they 'give it up' ...to the KING.    Enjoy!

B0018TLRTU|5.0|I have been a Billy fan since I was a kid, and he just gets better with age!!! John Wayne is a GREAT song, one of the best songs out there right now! All his greatest hits are on here, and are still great to listen to after all these years!!<br />The videos are AWESOME!! Just really takes you back to younger, more care-free days of watching MTV and listening to all your favorite CASSETTES and ALBUMS. Billy's voice has always made me shiver, and when you can actually SEE that perfect specimen snarling at you, life is pretty darn SWEET!!!!!!!!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|COLDPLAY is one of my favorite rock bands, and I own every album they have done, and I think this is the most courageous album they've given to us thus far. The band presents themselves as more closely knit, in that each musician and their offerings are much more distinctly and clearly heard.  The guitar work is more \\"out there\\" than I can remember in previous albums.  The contribution of the bass guitar and drums are very much in partnership with making the music rhythmic and energetic enough to get up on your feet and dance.  I don't know if dancing was what COLDPLAY intended, but several number definitely inspire movement.  My favorite jump around song is \\"Lost.\\"  It is hard for me to stay in my chair when listening to this one.  A few other that might raise one's blood pressure are \\"42,\\" \\"Lovers In Japan/Reign of Love,\\" and \\"Yes.\\"  The strongest and most addictive song on this project is \\"Viva La Vida.\\"  This is a throw your hands up in the air and celebrate.  I must admit that I'm not sure what is to be celebrated, in any case though, the song projects an air of rejoicing.<br /><br />The album certainly is not the COLDPLAY that we're used to hearing and loving, and I would not be surprised if some people will be disappointed with it's step away from the ordinary.  I believe that for an artist to occasionally test their talents by doing what they don't usually do, only serves to strengthen their ability to be more diverse.  I respect artists willing to do this.  When I listen to \\"Viva La Vida,\\" I hear bits from other well respected rock bands. Of course we will all hear a bit of U2, but I also hear brilliant sounds from bands of the 80's - like Genesis.  Chris Martin's singing sounds to me as though it is a challenge.  He is best known for his signature falsetto, but on this album he uses a lower register of his voice, that sounds like someone other than himself - very dark and dusky in quality.  Sounds great.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that all fans of COLDPLAY purchase this album, and give it a good listen, and be patient and open-minded in your listen.  I can guarantee that if you do this, you will come away having experienced something creative, risk taking, and simply enjoyable.  And for those who think COLDPLAY is a popcorn, sugar sweet band; well if you open your mind, and abandon judgement, you will certainly come away with a new found appreciation and respect for the band - COLDPLAY.is album, and give it a good listen, and be patient and open-minded in your listen.

1596680296|5.0|I've been a knitter for several years, but never brought myself to knit socks. I decided to get this book to teach myself how to knit socks, and I couldn't have been happier with it! The instructions are so clear, and I was able to knit my first pair in a matter of days with minimal mistakes. I also enjoy all the patterns that are included within the book, as they go from a basic sock pattern to more complex cabled and lace patterns for when you progress. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is intimidated to tackle knitting socks...you'll have your first pair of handmade socks before you know it!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Before any of the Coldplay *fanatics* jump all over my back, do know that I am a fan of Coldplay's work, especially \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  Good stuff.    ...BUT, despite the quality of their new album (it's pretty good), I personally can't stop thinking \\"Radiohead does it better\\" whenever i listen to anything Coldplay has made after \\"ROBTTH.\\"  I am always left with the thought: Radiohead does it better.  No disrespect to Coldplay, but no matter what they do, They will always live underneath the shadows of Thom Yorke and Radiohead.      Don't get mad at me, Chris Martin said it for me in Rolling Stone.  \\"I'd give my left ball to make anything near OK Computer...\\"
B0018M6J90|5.0|IF YOU ARE ONE THAT COMPLAINS THEY NEVER MAKE MOVIES ANYMORE LIKE THE OLD CLASSICS ---THAN THIS IS A FILM FOR YOU!!!!    This movie is fantastic---It tells the story of a down on her luck nanny( played to utter delight by the talented Frances McDormand) who gets a job as a personal assistant/maid to a \\"ditzy\\" starlet wannabe (performed by utter perfection by Amy Adams who deserves an Oscar nomination for this. If you loved her in ENCHANTED as Gisele, you MUST buy this gem)who is got in a \\"jam\\" of what man to choose. Should she choose a man for fame, or one who provides material means, or one for true love. Oh what will she do?    This movie is played out against the backdrop of Europe on the eve of dawning into WWII. And the costuming and sets are fantastic.    In many ways this film reminds me of old Marilyn Monroe films---such as the torch singer scene in SOME LIKE IT HOT.     The bad language is almost null, and truthfully this film could have gotten by with a PG rating. There is a brief scene of nudity---which mainly entails the buttocks of a man having sheet covers pulled off him (he is in the bed alone--non-sexual).     This film will truly and honestly make you smile, it has romance, enduring life lessons of being selfless, caring for others that may not be as fortuanate as yourself, friendship, making the right choices in life, integrity, and for the women who might be viewing this film---it touches on choosing the right kind of man who will respect you and not treat you like a possession. This is an excellent \\"feel good\\" movie.    Film lovers take note and buy this film. Women take note---YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY ENJOY THIS FILM---so buy it for yourself or for a gift.    THIS IS A LOVE STORY, AND COMEDY---AND NO IT'S NOT A CHICK FLICK---IT JUST HAPPENS THAT THE TWO LEADING ROLES ARE FEMALE---THIS FILM IS SOOO SOO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK.    I WILL BE BUYING MANY COPIES OF THIS FILM---DESTINED TO BE A CLASSIC.

B000B8IA2G|3.0|I think the Stargate series (both Atlantis and SG-1) are great. I already had seasons 1-10 for SG-1 and had watched all of the dvd's several times. So I decided to get the season 1 of the Atlantis shows. I purchased the box set from iNetvideo along with other dvd merchandise from other sellers. iNetvideo's shipment was delivered within a couple of days prior to the the deadline date. And the shipment arrived more than week after I had already received the merchandise from the other sellers eventhough the same shipping method was used.    After inspecting the merchandise and playing only the first dvd, I did gave an excellent seller's feedback. When I finally was ready to play the 5th and last dvd I instantly realized that something was wrong. The exact same episodes that are on Disk 1 Volume 1 were on Disk 5 Volume 1. I removed the dvd from the player and looked at the label - the label said Disk 5 Volume 1. I read the DVD case cover and it listed the episodes that were suppose to be on that disk but were not.    Now, how one dvd can get mislabeled and placed into a 2005 box set without a massive recall because other customers experienced the same problem is strange to say the least. My girl friend and I have order quite of few dvd through Amazon's website and this is the first time there has been a problem. I removed the feedback that I had previously give and contacted the seller via the Amazon website about this defect.    After two and no response from the seller, I contacted Amazon. They quickly responded and taking care of the situation with their A-Z guarantee. Meanwhile, I have download the last 4 episodes using Amazon's Unbox feature. I want to view these esipodes and found out what happens. I really like this series - it's as good as SG-1. Great originality in the storylines. There's actiion, humor and sometimes a tear jerker (my girl friend, of course). The characters every once in awhile make a comment about Star Trek (in a good way - I like Star Trek, too).    After I am refunded, I'll be returning the box set to the seller and will probably just download the rest the season 1. Lesson learned - watch all the dvd's before giving a seller's rating. I'll be purchasing season 4 but not from this seller regardless of what their prices are.
B000KP62MA|5.0|The best band ever! I'm 47 and I absolutely love this band.  Jared Leto is a very talented singer, writer, actor.  I can't wait for what's next. The lyrics are amazing and I can listen to them over and over again.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|Can this be the same band that sang \\"I'm your Turbo Lover\\" and \\"Breakin' the Law\\"?  A quite ambitious album to say the least.  And they pull it off fairly well.  Halford is f*&$ing unbelievable.  With the low cost, just hearing the high notes blasted out in Prophecy is enough for any serious Priest fan.  And he's pushing 60!  Unreal.  But from there on, it's a long strange trip.  If you can't handle classical music in the middle of your metal, don't bother buying this.  Many of the lyrical tones come straight from the 1500's, including Halford singing Latin.  When was the last time you heard a metal act do that!  Of course, despite what I'm sure our parents thought, true metal is a direct decedent of classical music (check out a performance of Carmina Burana live sometime), and Priest does a good job of integrating the orchestra.      After 2 listens, I'm giving it 3 stars on the Netflix scale.  For those who don't use Netflix, 3 stars means I like it.  It just doesn't live up to other concept albums, such as Operation Mindcrime (5 stars) or Dream Theater's Scene from a Memory (4 stars).  And doesn't live up to the Scorps latest either.  Still a good album.  I'll listen to it some more and maybe it will grow on me.  I'll update if it does!
B000005HLV|5.0|This is one of my favorite black metal albums and i must say that in my opinion is a mandatory addition to the library of any fan of the genre. While \\"deathcrush\\" may be more influential, this album's importance cannot be denied. This was the transition between the early black metal of Bathory, and Venom to the modern style of bands like Emperor, Gorgoroth and such.     There are two ways to go when it comes to the early second wave material. The Burzum route, with a more ambient approach, and the Mayhem way, simple brutal music. On this cd mayhem shows a bit more maturity going past gore ridden lyrics like Chainsaw Gutsf**k to a more depressing, darker outlook. Most likly the influence of former vocalist Dead. the reason this album stands out for me is that each song is a classic. From Funeral Fog with its brutal thrash opening, To the title track's dark Riffs. The highlight of this album is easily Freezing Moon which is without a doubt Mayhem's greatest song. opening with pure dark ambience leading into a furious verse and chorus going into one of Euronymous' only solos (and a great solo at that). The production is also better than most black metal at the time.     The things that most people seem to dislike about this album is Atilla's vocal delivery. which is certainly not typical black metal shrieking, but rather a very low almost gargle. I find that the way Atilla delivers the vocals gives the music an even darker edge, and the way he \\"sings\\" Freezing moon i find superior too Dead's version on \\"Live In Liepzig\\".     Bottomline this is a great cd seething with fury and hatred that encapsulates the modern black metal movement, and is a must for the collection of fan of the Second wave of black metal.

0440238609|5.0|You know how there are those people who say that children's literature is meaningless? Personally, I think they all need to be forced down in a chair (perhaps as in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") to read \\"His Dark Materials.\\"    Like other reviewers, when I finished reading \\"Harry Potter\\" I was still on a fantasy kick, but I was rather jaded by the titles I saw out there. They seemed boring, predictable, and fluffy. I found Pullman long after he had written \\"The Golden Compass\\" (I first read the UK edition, which is called \\"Northern Lights\\") so all three books were out and ready for me to read. This was very lucky, as I raced through them in about two weeks between classes.    Honestly, Pullman deserves every comparison to Tolkien he's gotten, and then some. For me (and I LOVE J.K. Rowling), \\"His Dark Materials\\" was  more engaging than \\"Harry Potter.\\" Don't get me wrong, \\"Harry Potter\\" will always, always be one of my favorite series. I just like Pullman better in different ways. For one, I found myself more able to relate to Lyra than to Harry. And the symbolism. Oh, the symbolism. Not heavy, not snobby- just amazing. The last installment, \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" absolutely left me sobbing. I was upset, I was happy, I was in awe, then I was more upset. I've had few books do that to me. They make me emotional, but they certainly don't make me sob for half an hour over the fate of the characters.     [...]    \\"His Dark Materials\\" also read very similarly to Tolkien- it really reminded me of \\"The Hobbit,\\" although a bit more complex. So somewhere between \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" in terms of style. If you're a Tolkien fan, I'd give Pullman a try. It isn't an exact match, but then, where would the fun be? Pullman is more wry, a little more humorous, and extremely ironic.     The plots of all three books, both continuing and sub, were fast paced and creative. I know the book isn't marketed as science fiction, but it's almost more of that than a fantasy. Maybe some of you are familiar with the term steam-punk, referring to books/games where elements of the modern world, science fiction, and the Victorian (sometimes Medieval, but in Pullman's case, Victorian) age are thrown together to create a new world. This is the best example of steam-punk I've ever read. Not that, of course, you have to be familiar with the genre to enjoy \\"His Dark Materials\\" at all.    I guess it could be worth mentioning that the whole trilogy loosely parallels \\"Paradise Lost\\" and if you're a literature nerd, you might find that to be a bonus. But it's definitely not necessary to know beforehand or even afterwards.     It is, after all, mere \\"children's\\" literature.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I agree with most of what the 1st 7 reviews have said!! This album is an instant classic. This album can be listened to from start to finish with absolute enjoyment. The songs are deverse in nature, from solid rockin' rock to beautiful ballads, I can't over-state how much i enjoy listening to this entire album.  2 enthusiastic thumbs up!!
0394818237|5.0|I still have this book from when I was young; it is now 36 years old and has survived all of my children.  I cannot bear to part with it and I will save it for my grandchildren.  (Along with Richard Scarry's find your ABC's) I am buying a copy for my niece though so she doesn't have to do without.  Thank you Richard Scarry
B00132D808|4.0|this album very good. i was surprised to hear a kind 60s influenced album since their last album was so up beat and just... fun. if you really LOVED their last album it will probably disappoint but if you love the beatles, beach boys, (those type of artists) this album is for you. i even had my mom listening to this album because she was a beatles fan back in da day. so hope this helps ;)
6304907648|5.0|Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter is the best cat and mouse game of all-time. Released in 1995, I still find this film intriguing and nail-biting. The two stars are dynamite together, look out for a creepy Harry Connick Jr. who plays a copycat serial killer. Dermot Mulroney also stars, this guy is so under-used! I love, love, love this thriller, gotta see this one, enjoy!
B00135EUPC|4.0|There are two versions of the score. The original soundtrack (green cover with orange fireball behind Mel Gibson) and Original Motion Picture (darker cover with no fireball) - both have the same track listings, number of tracks and length of tracks. Both say '1995'. So I guess you're just choosing between the artwork.    I can't fault the 18 tracks included in the original score, they're all good and true to what's in the film BUT, why did they exclude the music we hear when William's dead father is brought home? There are echoes of this theme in track [18. End Credits: Braveheart - Original Sound Track] and at the end of [9. Son's of Scotland] - a real sore point for me, especially as it didn't make it onto the 'more music from..' disc. No excuse!    Also missing is the festival wedding music before prima noctre is demonstrated. (this however IS on the 'more music from...' disc, as is the london wedding choir music!)      COMPOSITION: 5/5 - Events unfold in the same order as the film.    CONTENT: 3/5 - Not all of the music from the film is here. There are at least 3 memorable pieces not included, which is a let-down.    MIXING: 5/5 - The way it sounded in the film as you watched it is near identical. Some themes absent from the score do echo naturally in other tracks, but this happens in the theatrical score as well and is intentional.    Overall: 85%
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Ever After - A Cinderella Story is a sweet period piece starring Drew Barrymore. I saw this movie in the theatre when it was released in 1998 and I loved every minute of it. Barrymore brings warmth and sensitivity to the role and Anjelica Huston is just plain nasty as her wicked stepmother (just how I like a villian to be played). This Cinderella Story has a little bit of a twist, I highly recommend purchasing this gorgeous chick flick, enjoy!
B0015519VS|5.0|I love this CD. Usher is one of my favorite artists. This CD just verifies why I like Usher so much. Thank you Amazon!!!
1600241824|4.0|I love David Sedaris. I think he is funny and quirky and smart and clever. That said, I didn't love this book. Many of the stories in it were recycled - they were still funny, but I was looking forward to new stuff.  Definitely get the book for your collection - the story about his quitting smoking is worth the price of admission, but don't expect all new tales.

032147404X|5.0|I am an assistant wedding photographer aside from my regular job as an accountant.  I have read this book and I can say that there are so many great tips!  I love how he says \\"if you want this type of picture, you do this\\".  I took a photography class, and got a bit confused with the numbers, and I was so glad to have run across this book.  It has helped me tremendously!  After reading this book, I also read his book on Photoshop CS2, and that has helped a lot too, as I bought the software, but knew nothing on how to use it.. now I take great pictures a lot easier, thanks to his cool tips, and I can use Photoshop CS2 like a pro.    Do yourself a favor and buy this book- you will not be sorry you did.    Here is a funny thing.  I was at a wedding, and noticed the photographer (i was not shooting this wedding) used a lot of the techniques he said to use.  I asked her if she read the book, and she said that is her \\"photography bible\\".
B000P0J09C|5.0|Awesome movie!!  If you were ever in the Marines or trained as a Naval Officer under the Marines prior to the mid 80's, you will greatly appreciate the first half of this movie.  Highly recommend it!!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is an excellent collection of the Sex and the City series: it has every episode from all 6 seasons, plus a bonus disc (the only thing missing is the Movie)! It is a well put-together product: cute pink presentation, practical binder, discs well organized, and is chock-full-of photos from the show. Makes for a wonderful addition to your personal DVD library or a really great gift for a true SATC fan. So grab a cosmo, hit \\"play\\" and have a Fabulous time!
B0000C172X|1.0|This is NOT the movie!!!.  This is an audio DVD with a selection of pictures.  I think the seller did a poor job in the description of this product.  As far as the recording, Neil did a great job with this recording!  I have it on a couple different media.
1428166556|4.0|The research based information on the psychology of marketing, buying and selling that are described in the first two chapters are little known, facinating and extremely useful for those at many levels.  Detailed discussions of \\"decoys\\" in marketing products, the relative comparisons involved in almost all buying decisions and the incredible effects of \\"free\\" merchandise such as Amazon's free shipping are given in an interesting and engaging way.  After that the impact and interest of the information declines with each chapter and by chapter 7 it is hard to tell what the focus of the book (audio) is.  A guess would be that after chapter three it just goes on to whatever the author found interesting and researched.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Contemplative, moody, pensive, deep - Madeleine Peyroux!  Range, timbre, in love with love, earthy - Plugged into something greater than herself.  This album sends me! The vocals, the musicianship, the sound craft and engineering: \\"Careless Love\\" is a must have for anyone who appreciates music.  Every cut is a well-crafted gem, the best forty-minutes you'll ever spend on a lazy summer (or rainy) day.  \\"Dance me\\"..., \\"You're gonna make me lonesome when you go\\", \\"J'a deux amours\\", \\"Weary Blues\\", \\"This is heaven to me\\", absolute gems!  Madeleine Peyroux is a national treasure.  Reminiscent of Billie Holiday upon first impression, her vocal styling really is unique and speaks to her no doubt many influences and experiences in their own right.  Can't wait to pick up the rest of her songbook.  Recommend it, I would!!!
0783225857|5.0|Excellent affordable price for a classic movie that is 3 to 4 times as much cost every place else!  Fast delivery!  Amazon is the best!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay's newest effort seems to dabble into the realm of progressive rock. I can sense pieces of Marillion and the Ray Wilson era of Genesis in this amazing album. This album is very mature, polished, and darker than their previous outings. There are not many pop-laden tunes here (in fact, I'm not even sure what the kickoff single will be), but instead, you'll find intelligent music which requires the listener to sit, take it all in, and absorb the various nuances and sound layers which Coldplay has created in a most masterful fashion. Highest recommendation for Viva La Vida!
1400049628|3.0|I'm writing this review as a parent, in case there are any other parents who have heard of the book or seen it and are considering buying it for a kid.  My son is middle-school aged and found the book in the bookstore and immediately started reading it.  When he showed it to me I read the back cover (and laughed at a few of the Top 10 lessons) and spent a few minutes flipping through it.  Info on terrain types, home defense, and equipment seemed exactly like the sort of thing my son would like, being a typical boy interested in the outdoors, survival issues, equipment, etc.    Once home he proceeded to absorb the book, but later told me that it kind of \\"freaked\\" him out.  So I spent some more time flipping through it.  The detailed, somewhat gruesome accounts of the physiology of zombies is probably what he meant.  I then found the weapons chapter and pondered my wisdom in buying this book for my son.  It's probably his favorite chapter, but be informed that it contains discussions of such things as which blunt instrument is best (\\"Can it crush a skull in one blow?  If not, can it decapitate in said blow?\\") and the relative merits of weapons like Molotov cocktails.     Just be aware that its packaging is a bit different than its content and use caution when buying for a child or teenager.
0316143472|3.0|Here you will find essays as funny as anything Sedaris has ever written.  Unfortunately you will also find some of the most self-indulgent.  When Sedaris writes of relationships -- with family and friends and lovers -- we can relate.  He takes the ordinary and stretches it to the absurd, often tapping into secret feelings and emotions we thought only we had, and that makes us laugh at him and ourselves.  But when Sedaris takes several months off to quit smoking and rents an apartment in Tokyo, as he does for about the last third of the book, he loses something.  It's not that he has to smoke and be high to be funny (he doesn't), it's that most of us don't have the time or the dough for such extravagant vacations.  We have jobs and we have bills.  When Sedaris becomes not an exaggerated one of us, but a neurotic twit with so much money and fame he can slap his name on the cover of anything and know we will buy it, it is hard not to feel a bit duped.  The last section of the book is mostly a collection of paragraphs, not essays.  It feels lazy.  It's hard to imagine anyone outside of his loyal fans (I consider myself one) finding any pleasure here.  In the beginning the Sedaris wit says, \\"Look at us.  Aren't we funny.\\"  Here, Sedaris is simply saying, \\"Look at me.  Look at me.\\"  The joke is growing stale.  I am reminded of Picasso, who in his last years would scribble on paper, sign his name, and laugh all the way to the bank.  \\"I am so brilliant, I deserve this.\\"
B0018AK9RK|5.0|So by now all of you have seen or purchased this release and if you havent your a fool. This is pure Judas Priest \\"Sad Wings of Destiny-Sin after Sin\\" era of the 70's with a dash of new Priest on the title track.<br /><br />This is the best cd I have heard in a long time, Fans of Manowar and Iced Earth will like this double dosage of metal conceptitis!<br /><br />Judas Priest have done a splendid job of taking the bull by the horns and doing what made them happy and not fall into \\"We need another Painkiller or Jugulator (AKA Ripper Owens)fast paced lp!\\"<br /><br />This is great stuff! IF you loved the old style of Judas Priest get ready this is for you and for those of you who will complain about the guitar synthesizer parts- deal with it, its intro's and outro's like Iced Earth and Manowar do on every cd. It adds to the ambiance of the whole \\"Nostradamus\\" concept they have achieved on this grand opus!<br /><br />Judas Priest have returned in great style.
067003830X|4.0|This book begins as promised, delivering a few stories of the 'recovering against all odds' variety, while explaining in not overly technical terms the neuroscience - or in some cases the likely neuroscience - behind these recoveries.  In fact the first hundred pages or so I feared I'd stumbled upon an Oprah Winfrey style, inspirational love-in.  The author will begin 'Jimmy had [inserting debilitating condition here] and was hopeless and suicidal until he stumbled upon [insert one of Doidge's hero doctors], who began working with Jimmy on [insert program plug here].'  Then Jimmy's symptoms miraculously begin to recede and everyone weeps for joy.  But  whenever the reader is beginning to feel they're reading an infomercial cleverly disguised as a book, the author, to his credit, will delve back into some of the fascinating experiments relating to brain plasticity, or some of the historical science which informed the general consensus in the field of neuroscience.<br /><br />The book then veers off alarmingly into the demented world of sadomasochists (to the mortification of thousands of Oprahmatons, I like to imagine), where the author somewhat dubiously attempts to tie brain plasticity together with nauseating sexual fetishes, which he unfortunately decides to ennumerate in detail.  Luckily this section is not too long.<br /><br />His fawning descriptions of the men at the frontiers of neuroscience read almost like an escort agency for science geeks' advertisment, bordering on obsequiousness, which contributes to the lingering suspicion that you are reading some of subtle tract of propaganda.  And while the author's unbridled optimism appears a little too abundant to be considered scientific, the brain is still mysterious enough that some of the more incredible claims are believable, and the book as a whole is well worth reading, if only to discover the neurological justification for the incredible power of the human brain.
0385340567|1.0|Lee Child has reached the limit to his military expertise.  The fight scenes are repetitive and slow.  The land navigation is OK but his knowledge of Army ethics are abysmal.  The worst problem with this book is his use of the saying:  \\"Unit, Corp, God and Country\\".  He attributes this to the Marines but it comes from the movie, \\"A Few Good Men\\"  Military ethics stress the correct order is the reverse, God, Country, Corp and Unit.  Child's error is echoed in the politics of the plot.  This is Child's worst book.
B000NA28A2|5.0|Excellent CD with a great variety of his music. Certain to improve his name recognition and following here in the States.
0756404746|4.0|This book was well written, engaging from the very beginning. I literally could NOT put it down, resulting in less than 2 hours of sleep! There is alot of material covered in this book, and the interruptions in the story within the story are more distracting that engaging. Also, Kvothe's fascination with his love interest is frustrating as well. For a man who is so smart, he is incredibly obtuse when it comes to figuring out the opposite sex. Granted this could be an interesting character flaw, the only thing that prevents him from being perfect. Whatever way you put it, this is a very interesting book, definitly reccommended as a read. I look forward to the next installment in the series!
B000OYC3J8|3.0|I wanted to write an article about the White Stripes since their release last year 2007, Ickythump, but didn't have the inspiration until now.<br /><br />The White Stripes, Meg and Jack White are a Alternative rock group out of Detroit Michigan, which formed back in 1997. They originally portrayed themselves as a sister and brother duo, when in fact they were married for a period of time at the beginning of their careers. Even after their divorce, the band has remarkably still stayed together.<br /><br />The White Stripes use a do-it-yourself, low fidelity approach to recording songs, using a very raw, minimalist simplicity of composition and arrangement primarily inspired by early punk rock, and blues. Personally as a newer fan of White Stripes, I have grown to appreciate their stripped down, Lo-Fi primal sound. Furthermore, their playfulness and general quirkiness make the albums never too heavy or too bizarre for mainstream listeners. With their newest album Ickythump, the Stripes have returned to this analog, scratchy, Detroit garage rock sound after their experimental departure with their 2005 release 'Get Behind Me Satan,' and its piano based pop. However even though Ickythump is a return to earlier styles, it seems more over produced then previous recordings since this is their first and only release with Warner Bros.<br /><br />It was pointed out to me that Jack White has an obssession with the number three with his recordings, and live performances. As stated on Wikipedia: \\"Jack has emphasized the significance that the number three holds for the band, citing it as inspiration not only for their tri-colored uniforms (red, white, black), but their pared-down approach to what he considers the three elements of song: storytelling, melody and rhythm. The number three also frequently appears in White Stripes' album artwork, and texts written by Jack, such as liner notes or messages written on the band's website, are often signed with \\"Jack White III\\" or simply \\"III\\". There are also only three sounds--drums, guitar and vocals--in most of their songs; sometimes keyboard or piano is substituted for guitar.\\" The one thing which I found interesting in Ickythump is that his supposed rule of Three wasn't as honored as previously in other albums. In songs such as 'St. Andrew(The Battle is in the Air)' the recording has bagpipes, raging guitar, drums, and Meg White all churning together at the same time - the additional layers which lend to making the track sound more lush and full also detracts from the White Stripes' strict regimented style of three-is-best.<br /><br />After writing an article about Death Cab for Cutie and the lyrical genius of Ben Gibbard, it is a bit of let down to come to Jack White's lyrics. Jack White's lyrics are not profound or deep, however they do showcase the playful, ramshackle style that the White Stripes have become so famous and loved for. Lyrcially the songs that stood out strongest for me were the albums title track 'Ickythump' and the folksy 'Effect and Cause.' The song Ickythump deals with the topic of immigration, and criticized America's current stance on immigration policy, as such the song is the first political song which the White Stripes have put out since \\"The Big Three Killed My Baby,\\" off The White Stripes (1999), the bands debut album. The defining point of the song comes when Jack White states:<br />\\"White Americans What? Nothin' better to do?\\"<br />\\"Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too.\\"<br />\\"Who's using who? What should we do?\\"<br />\\"Well you can't be a pimp And a prostitute too.\\"<br /><br />The whole song with its abrasive guitars leaves the whole question of the immigration debate uncomfortably unresolved; lyrically and musically.<br /><br />With Jack's marriage to British model Karen Elson and in a dedication to his own Scottish heritage, the White Stripes showcase a mini-suite with 'Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn', and 'St. Andrew(The Battle is in the Air)'. The two tracks on the album are a a nice homage to his roots with soaring bag pipes, and raucous drums, which sounds strangely like Led Zeppelin and 'The Battle of Evermore.' Unfortunately, to a lot of hard core White Stripes fans these tracks may come across as alien and a radical change from their previous song stylings, but I found them entertaining and to be strong tracks in the middle of the album.<br /><br />Another stand out track was their rendition of Patti Page's 1950's song 'Conquest' which was originally written by Corky Robbins. The song originally was a 50's song jump blues tune about the battle of the sexes, which the White Stripes turn into a raging garage rock bullfight, complete with dramatic mexican trumpets, and malaguena guitar riffs. Their new rendition takes the tune to a more darker place than the original.<br /><br />Even though I am not an over the top fan for the White Stripes, I can appreciate and respect their spontaneous tempo shifts, their song dynamics, and their prog rock influences - which abound on this album. People have pointed out that this is easily the White Stripes loudest, in your face album, and at first it was hard to digest, but after a few listens it does grow on you.<br /><br /> -Andrew D.B.

B00116GHMM|4.0|Putting a label on the debut album by MGMT is a toughie. They're sort of a synth-psychedelic-space-indie-noisepop band.<br /><br />And they break an awful lot of rules in their debut album \\"Oracular Spectacular,\\" a vibrant, colorful little album that sounds like a cascade of summer flowers. They have a few wrinkles yet to iron out, but their music has a unique and striking sound, and they obviously know how to craft solid pop music with a foot-tapping beat, and a slightly eerie sound.<br /><br />It opens with squeaks, bubbling noises, and finally with a slow-building electric riff smothered in twisted synth. \\"I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw, I'm in the prime of my life/Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives... This is our decision to live fast and die young/We've got the vision, now let's have some fun...\\" the soft layered vocals intone.<br /><br />Well, at least there's no pretense about plans for the future, even if it means \\"I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home,\\" and ends up with divorce, more models, and \\"We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end/We were fated to pretend.\\"<br /><br />They slow down a little with the guitar-led, sparkling pop of \\"Weekend Wars,\\" and the shimmering psychedelic echoes of the languid \\"The Youth\\" (\\"We could flood the streets/with love or light or heat/whatever!\\"). But then they happily speed back up again -- beat-heavy funky tunes, undulating playful synthpop, and rapid-pattering electronic psychedelica. Styles are jumbled seamlessly.<br /><br />As the album's end approaches, the songs get even more complex, as if the band is learning the ropes as they go along. We have an acoustic-led ballad, a sly rippling pop melody, and a dancy, intimate-sounding finale -- not to mention the utterly sublime \\"Of Moons, Birds & Monsters,\\" a deliriously beautiful psychpop melody strung with colourful synth, spacey sound effects, and guitars that chime like church bells.<br /><br />\\"Oracular Spectacular\\" is the sound of a magnificently talented band that is still getting its bearings, and exploring the blended sound they've created. Most of the songs on this album are of good quality but not brilliant -- and then MGMT suddenly bursts forth in full-blown musical splendor, with some truly larger-than-life pop rippling with exquisite instrumentation.<br /><br />Much of that instrumentation comes from the subtle percussion, and a series of guitars that can drive the melody forwards like a speeding car, then can suddenly turn into a mass of psychedelic blurs, murmurs and chimes. You can hear some handclaps and what sounds like kettle drums buried in there as well, plus the occasional bashed cymbals.<br /><br />But the synth is nothing short of gorgeous, and it permeates every song in the album. Sometimes it's a chirp, tweak, squeak or electronic chime on the edges, but sometimes it's a sweep of truly exquisite shimmering sound. \\"The Handshake\\" sounds like it was recorded underwater at times.<br /><br />Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden's soft voices are layered through most of the album, although occasionally one of them sings solo. It adds an otherworldly sound as their vibrant lyrics explore youthful revels, rock'n'roll, otherworldly transformations (\\"My liquid silver arms extended/These waves aren't far apart... I am fire, where's my form?\\") and who knows what else (\\"Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?/Don't you know about the temperature change/In the cold black shadow?\\").<br /><br />\\"Oracular Spectacular\\" lives up to its name -- outstanding music that only promises to become better, shimmering with colorful pop and boundless imagination.lented band that is still getting its bearings, and exploring the blended sound they've created.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|I have listened to this album probably a couple dozen times in the last few weeks.  On day 1, I would have rated it 3, maybe 4 stars, but most songs that I didn't like immediately have grown on me (with some exceptions).  Particularly, the first 5 songs are some of the best work The Offspring has ever done, ever.  After that it's slightly spottier, but overall I still find the album worthy of a 5 star rating, barely (maybe a 4.5 rounded up to 5 since Amazon doesn't do half stars).    1.  Half-Truism (9.5) Very good album opener.  Nice contrast between the fast verses and slower chorus.  Bring the album in with a bang.  2.  Trust In You (9) Another very solid song VERY old school Offspring.  Gotta love that fast palm muting (not enough of that on this album).  3.  You're Gonna Go Far, Kid (10) This one didn't win me over on first listen, but after a few more listens I can't get this out of my head.  Very catchy, sort of mainstream sounding, but still very Offspring.  If this does in fact end up being the second single, it's an EXCELLENT choice, as I think this song will satisfy the mainstream and the hardcore fans like nothing has since The Kids Aren't Alright.  4.  Hammerhead (8.5) Solid song.  I like the strength of the riffs; heavier than a lot of their stuff.  Not a bad choice for the first single.  5.  A Lot Like Me (10) This doesn't sound like most of their other stuff.  Maybe reminds me of Gone Away in some respects.  The intro with the piano, meh, sounds a little like it's gonna be a Coldplay song (Coldplay is whorendous).  But I can overlook that small complaint which only applies to the first 5 seconds of the song because this song is unbelievable.  Dexter's vocals are outstanding, and the song just seems to have a huge amount of power (even with the piano).  Another one that didn't win me over on first listen, but now it's my favorite of the album.  6.  Takes Me Nowhere (8) Essentially classic Offspring.  Catchy song, keeps the album going strong; picks upthe pace from the slower A Lot Like Me.  7.  Kristy Are You Doing Okay? (6) The pace that we just picked up has now gone in the tank.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a bad song.  For what it is, it's fine.  I just don't know how I feel about it on an Offspring album.  It gets a 6 because I still like the song, but it's nothing compared to tracks 1-6.  8.  Nothingtown (7) This one's alright.  A little too generic sounding maybe.  Picks the pace back up again at least.  9.  Stuff Is Messed Up (8) This song comes the closest to being the \\"joke\\" song of the album, but it's more serious than any of the other \\"joke\\" songs.  Catchy chorus.  I think if anyone else did a \\"la la la la la\\" chorus like this it would sound lame.  Only The Offspring can pull it  off.  10.  Fix You (6.5) Screeeech.  The momentum we've build back up over the past two songs comes to a halt.  Again, not a BAD song, and I still like it.  Similar thoughts on this one as with Kristy.  Okay song, but meh.  11.  Let's Hear It For Rock Bottom (8) I like the guitar work on this one.  The chorus is sort of generic, but a good song overall.  12.  Rise and Fall (7.5)  First off, Green Day comparisons here are preposterous.  The chord progression is not even close and neither is the subject matter.  I just don't get it.  This is a decent song, but would have been nice to have a stronger album closer.  Something epic like Pay The Man (my favorite Offspring album closer) would have been cool.      As you can see, my ratings are very strong, then sort of drop off.  Still, when I listen through the album, I don't reach for the skip button at all (even for Kristy and Fix You).  I have been a fan since 1994 and this album does not disappoint.  Not sure how much there is here that will bring in new fans (though I do see potential with songs like You're Gonna Go Far, Kid and A Lot Like Me), but I don't see how any true Offspring fan will anything but love this.    I hope the second single is not Kristy AreYou Doing Okay (as has been rumored; this may be the second single in Europe, but it's looking like You're Gonna Go Far, Kid for the U.S.).  This one will not be removed from my car stereo for months.  Buy it.  Buy it now.
B00125WAWS|5.0|The Great Debaters is now on my list of great Movies! It ranks with Casablanca, To Kill A Mockingbird and White Christmas. When Professor Melvin Tolson chooses his first Wiley College Debating team it includes Samantha, Henry, James Farmer, Jr and Hamilton who wishes to be the Teacher's pet!    Since there are many excellent reviews, I will not repeat the awesome listing of great actresses & actors like Denzel Washington & Forest Whitaker & Denzel Whitaker! For my top choices of the debaters, I choose Samantha & James Farmer Jr. The young man who plays the part of Henry is a tremendous actor who makes powerful speeches for his arguments & resolutions. I am turned off by his weakness for drinking & fast moves with women!    There is a powerful contrast between white sharecroppers, who seem to be in authority with the local Sheriff and the Debaters who play the part of defenders as origins of the Civil Rights movement in the 1930's! Those first debates with other African American Colleges are soon overcome with the debates with white Oklahoma City U. and finally the climaxing debate with the Harvard's top notch debating team!    There is included as special events, some older students of Wiley College who were the original members of the first debating team! These older men & women provide quite the vivid contrast for the original debaters! Especially, the man who is portrayed by Henry, whose last name was Heights is said to be \\"arrogantly intellectual!\\"     Some of the most potent scenes are speeches from the debaters against the white college students! There is tremendous writing of those speeches quoting Gandhi, Thoreau & Du Bois! All-in-all this is one outstanding portrayal of the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement later by Matin Luther King, Jr!      Gratefully from Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood.
B000YAA68W|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is an animated film based on Marjane Satrapi's autobiographical [[ASIN:037571457X graphic novel]] of the same name about her childhood in Tehran during the last Iranian revolution and coming of age after emigrating to Vienna.  It is an extraordinarily ordinary story about an average woman coming to terms with herself and with the world around her.  Did I say \\"average woman\\"?  My bad.  I meant dynamic, charming, intelligent, and fiercely individualistic.  Ms. Satrapi's story is among the finest works ever animated and bestows upon the viewer the endless virtues of knowledge, a broadened mind, and a true perspective on humanity.  \\"Persepolis\\" will break your heart, make you smile and laugh out loud, cheer, possibly sing, and restore your faith in humanity.  The fact that this was passed over for an Oscar in favor of yet another mediocre Pixar effort (about a rat that controls a chef by pulling his hair, no less) is the ultimate proof positive that that award (or any other, really) has no merit whatsoever.<br /><br />Young Marji walks down the street to the place where shady characters reside.  As she passes each bootlegger, they whisper the names of the forbidden fruit they possess.  \\"Lipstick\\" whispers one, \\"Jichael Mackson\\" mispronounces another. She continues on until she hears what she wants: \\"Iron Maiden\\".  She quickly negotiates a price and makes off with her prize just as a group of overbearing religious figures tower over her.  They have taken issue with her shoes: plain sneakers.  Marjie insists they are for basketball, but another spots her Michael Jackson patch, a symbol of American greed.  Then the coup-de-gras; she has \\"punk is not dead\\" scrawled across the back of her outfit.  Thinking fast, Marjie bursts into tears, sobbing lies about her parents having died in the war with the Iraqis and a cruel guardian who will burn her with an iron if they turn her in.  Safely back at home, having tricked the local oppressive religious posse, the young girl grabs a tennis racket as a guitar and bangs her head to the sweet, hard-earned reward of heavy metal.  The scene then segues -music still rocking- to the frontlines of the war where the new Iranian Islamic rulers are sending young men unarmed to rush the Iraqi army, acting as human shields/martyrs.  Their parents are rewarded by the government for their sons' sacrifices with little plastic keys which are promised to open the door to Heaven for their dead children.  Such are the complications of everyday life in Iran at this time.  The duality of these scenes speaks a lot for the power and message of this film.  But while there is highly enlightening political commentary and historical information to be found here, the focus is on the everyday life and struggles of our protagonist with the horrors of her surrounding often being downplayed.<br /><br />The animation is minimalist art of the highest stylistic brilliance.  The endearing nature of Marjie and her family is only highlighted by the ultra-simplistic black and white pencil-and-paper artwork.  All of the CG in the world could not improve on this film in any way; the focus is on story, characters, and stylistic integrity, as it should be.  The film's philosophies run deep and broad, ranging from harsh commentaries on authority to harsh commentary on purposeless counterculture.  Wisdom comes from Marjie's grandmother, from her imaginary chats with God, and her memories of her communist uncle.  These are life lessons about integrity, prudence, and acceptance that one should always carry with them and produce many, many quotable quotes.<br /><br />Do not think for a second that this film is all about heaviness of spirit and preachiness.  No, no, no, no; nothing could be further from the truth.  Ms. Satrapi is a brilliant social satyrist who fills \\"Persepolis\\" with pointed jokes, lighthearted moments, and heartwarming charm while pointing out that at heart, we are all the same.  There is a time in Marjie's lifewhere she becomes a lifeless, jaded cynic unable to do anything but watch TV and let life pass her by.  Then one day, she wakes up angry again.  The result is a musical montage that will likely make you laugh hysterically or jump out of your seat to sing along.  Possiby both.  This is just that kind of film.  Throw in some animated love for [[ASIN:B000FA4TLQ Godzilla]], [[ASIN:B000A9QK9Q Bruce Lee]], and [[ASIN:B00008PC2O Terminator 2]] and I am beyond sold.<br /><br />The DVD has a few behind-the-scenes special features that show us the woman herself at work.  Having already fallen in love with her animated doppelganger, seeing the vivacious Marjane Satrapi made flesh is a real treat.  We get a view of the old-school animation processes and are able to watch Ms. Satropi act out different characters for the animators to see. This is nearly as much fun as the movie itself.  Wonderful feature.<br /><br />  This is a near-perfect film that I would recommend to anybody who isn't going to run away from a mostly black and white animated film with subtitles.  And if you are: well, enjoy your life of closed-minded cinematic ignorance.  \\"Persepolis\\" is a revelation whose duty is to entertain us while reminding us just how good we have it and simultaneously educating us about a culture and history few in the West have made any attempt to understand.  Ms. Satropi's insisted that this story be animated and not filmed for this reason: animated characters are more universally identifiable.  Set a film in Iran and fill it with Iranians and you have an ethic film that many will subconsciously refuse to identify with.  But with animation, all things are possible; even bridging a gaping cultural divide.  But at it's heart, this is a film about the enthusiam of youth, the hardships of adulthood, and the triumph of personal integrity.  Do not miss this.a lifeless, jaded cynic unable to do anything but watch TV and let life pass her by.  Then one day, she wakes up angry again.

8590379825|4.0|The information in the book is clear, easy to understand, and worth reading.  The formatting of the text, the fonts used, and the overall style of the book is lacking.  The end of the book was actually a few mm shorter than the spine on my copy, but nothing was cut off, so it doesn't matter beyond looking a little odd.    I would buy it again, even if the previous version is available for free online.  It's great to read when you're not near a computer, as (for a programmer) the book is easy enough to follow without needing to try every example yourself.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Putting a label on the debut album by MGMT is a toughie. They're sort of a synth-psychedelic-space-indie-noisepop band.<br /><br />And they break an awful lot of rules in their debut album \\"Oracular Spectacular,\\" a vibrant, colorful little album that sounds like a cascade of summer flowers. They have a few wrinkles yet to iron out, but their music has a unique and striking sound, and they obviously know how to craft solid pop music with a foot-tapping beat, and a slightly eerie sound.<br /><br />It opens with squeaks, bubbling noises, and finally with a slow-building electric riff smothered in twisted synth. \\"I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw, I'm in the prime of my life/Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives... This is our decision to live fast and die young/We've got the vision, now let's have some fun...\\" the soft layered vocals intone.<br /><br />Well, at least there's no pretense about plans for the future, even if it means \\"I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home,\\" and ends up with divorce, more models, and \\"We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end/We were fated to pretend.\\"<br /><br />They slow down a little with the guitar-led, sparkling pop of \\"Weekend Wars,\\" and the shimmering psychedelic echoes of the languid \\"The Youth\\" (\\"We could flood the streets/with love or light or heat/whatever!\\"). But then they happily speed back up again -- beat-heavy funky tunes, undulating playful synthpop, and rapid-pattering electronic psychedelica. Styles are jumbled seamlessly.<br /><br />As the album's end approaches, the songs get even more complex, as if the band is learning the ropes as they go along. We have an acoustic-led ballad, a sly rippling pop melody, and a dancy, intimate-sounding finale -- not to mention the utterly sublime \\"Of Moons, Birds & Monsters,\\" a deliriously beautiful psychpop melody strung with colourful synth, spacey sound effects, and guitars that chime like church bells.<br /><br />\\"Oracular Spectacular\\" is the sound of a magnificently talented band that is still getting its bearings, and exploring the blended sound they've created. Most of the songs on this album are of good quality but not brilliant -- and then MGMT suddenly bursts forth in full-blown musical splendor, with some truly larger-than-life pop rippling with exquisite instrumentation.<br /><br />Much of that instrumentation comes from the subtle percussion, and a series of guitars that can drive the melody forwards like a speeding car, then can suddenly turn into a mass of psychedelic blurs, murmurs and chimes. You can hear some handclaps and what sounds like kettle drums buried in there as well, plus the occasional bashed cymbals.<br /><br />But the synth is nothing short of gorgeous, and it permeates every song in the album. Sometimes it's a chirp, tweak, squeak or electronic chime on the edges, but sometimes it's a sweep of truly exquisite shimmering sound. \\"The Handshake\\" sounds like it was recorded underwater at times.<br /><br />Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden's soft voices are layered through most of the album, although occasionally one of them sings solo. It adds an otherworldly sound as their vibrant lyrics explore youthful revels, rock'n'roll, otherworldly transformations (\\"My liquid silver arms extended/These waves aren't far apart... I am fire, where's my form?\\") and who knows what else (\\"Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?/Don't you know about the temperature change/In the cold black shadow?\\").<br /><br />\\"Oracular Spectacular\\" lives up to its name -- outstanding music that only promises to become better, shimmering with colorful pop and boundless imagination.lented band that is still getting its bearings, and exploring the blended sound they've created.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I actually had low expectations for this movie, and I will admit that I was mainly interested in it because of Gerard Butler - he is beee-yooo-ti-ful... :)<br />Also, Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress, very talented, a double Oscar winner, so I figured, I would check this movie out. I am also not usually much of a chick flick watcher (even though I am a chick), I'm usually a big action adventure movie fan, intense dramas, that type of thing. I expected to have this movie on in the background, not really pay attention to it, work on other things, and only look up when Gerard Butler was on screen. So, from that perspective, this movie was a very big, very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Pretty much from the get-go, this movie grabbed my attention and lo and behold I didn't do any work at all while it was on (I tried a couple of times, but then I just had to rewind something I missed, so I happily gave up). A big part of this was the fact that I expected predictable dialogue, and a predictable story-line. A big credit to this movie belongs in the fact that it had very sharp writing, it actually dealt with things that seemed real-life. Of course there are lines here & there in the movie that are \\"hollywood\\", but for the most part, this movie has a lot of heart.<br /><br />HUGE, HUGE, HUGE credit for this movie's heart & soul must go to Hilary Swank & Kathy Bates. These two ladies do an INCREDIBLE job in their roles, they imbue them with so much authenticity, I was really taken aback. In fact so much so, this movie actually had me crying repeatedly through it (thank heavens I didn't see this movie in public, that would have been very embarrassing & I would have most certainly run out of kleenex). Plus, it had me laughing in between! What an emotional ride this movie was, and I was somewhat prepared for \\"heart-string pulling\\" because I knew the premise of the movie.<br /><br />In fact, it has been days since I watched this movie, and I keep thinking about it. It moved me, not only with the emotional journey of Hilary's character, what she learned, how she grew, but because it also makes you think about your own life. I find myself reflecting on my own relationships, appreciating them more, it really touched me. It also has a secondary theme about Hilary's character trying to find happiness in what she does for a living - lessons in finding your passion, and stop doing what doesn't make you happy, what you may hate, for a living.<br /><br />This movie also has a measure of unexpected outcomes, which is a breath of fresh air. So many times we can predict what is going to happen, then when a movie doesn't do that, it's such a delight. This movie has lovely journeys of forgiveness, selfishness, confusion, what are our lives all about, who knows, but we keep putting one foot in front of the other.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie as a worthy watch. I loved it. And I want to visit Ireland soooo bad now!!! My heart is still tender, from the highs, the lows, the questions this movie raised. Hilary - wow, you are amazing in this role...I hope you will get the recognition you deserve for it.<br /><br />Rai Arenl journey of Hilary's character, what she learned, how she grew, but because it also makes you think about your own life.

0345495004|1.0|It is hard for me to imagine that I read the same book as the other reviewers.  Perhaps I didn't, since even though it is against my religion to not finish a book once I have started, I just could not make myself trudge through more than half. I should get a medal for that accomplishment.  The writing was barely half a notch above bodice-ripper level, and the author managed to miss all the complexity and nuance for which Wright is known. Talk about dumbed-down!  She took really interesting lives and a fascinating relationship and turned them into cartoons. First I was disappointed, now I am ticked off.  I'm sorry I wasted my time. Unless you are looking for formulaic, romantic fluff, mediocre writing and one-dimensional characters who don't have the slightest relationship to their real name-sakes, save yours and read something else.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I'm not sure what's happened to people's standards these days, but apparently, they've droped, drastically.  Because while the recently  released \\"do-over\\" of \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" won audiences over and scored big box office success and praise from viewers, this film, the first attempt at bringing the Marvel super hero to the big screen, from 2003, was lambasted and rejected, both by critics and movie goers alike.  Sadly, it speaks to the impatience and unwillingness to think on the part of American movie audiences.  I said in the beggining that standards have dropped, and I said that as evidenced by the failure of THIS film and the success of the recent remake.  \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", out just this month, is your typical, boring, paper thin plot film with absolutely zero emotional connection, relying of big, but boring special effects to wow it's viewers.  This film, starring Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly is vastly superior and probably the best of the super hero genre films ever created.  Not only does it wipe the floor of \\"Incredible\\" with it's more in depth and intelligent story, but it also beats it, hands down, on the action sequences and in showing what the character of The Hulk is actually all about.  Rather then representing him as some big, dumb monster who likes to smash stuff, as the most recent incarnation portrays, this film shows the character to be emotionally damaged, due to childhood trauma, thus the cause for his subsequent rage.  But it also shows him to be a sympathetic character, one who simply want's to be left alone, but because he is different, because he is unique, the world will not let him, and he seems doomed to be forever harrassed by those who fear him.    The acting in this film is also superior to the recent remake.  Eric Bana, a fine actor, very convincingly depicts his character, Bruce Banner, as emotionally scarred, and the sequences in which he begins to transform in to the Hulk, he creates the perfect body language and facialexpressions of someone losing control of their inner rage.  Jennifer Connelly, as Bettsy Ross, is also incredible in the film, creating a feeling of sadness and helplessness as she watches someone she loves fall in to an uncontrollable, frieghtening situation.  You get the feeling, watching Connelly, that she actually truly cares for Bana's character and when she cries for him, you feel it.      And for purist fans of the comic book, this film is a much better rendering of the main character, exampling better shows of strength on the Hulk's part.  I've heard people who disliked the first film complain that the Hulk is able to jump too far a distance, etc...  Which shows they are a part of the general audience, the ones whom the remake is obviously geared toward, and aren't aware of the comic character and his capabilites.  The Hulk is supposed to be the strongest being in the Marvel Universe.  He's so strong that his leg muscles are able to carry him to the moon in a single leap, if he so desired.  \\"Hulk\\" had far more excititng action sequences, which better displayed the Hulk's unparalleled strength.  He picks up 65 ton tanks and tosses them miles in to the distance, with ease, or he runs full out across the desert, outpacing rockets. And showing his outrageious endurance, he's taken in to outer space, riding a fighter jet, and still fails to pass out.  These are the things the Hulk is SUPPOSED to be able to do, that's the kind of strength he's supposed to have.  Unlike in the remake, in which the Hulk sees fit to make fan-like weapons out of 3 ton cars and shred things with them, and that's about ALL he does throughout, besides getting knocked senesless by a big, bad monster.  The Hulk isn't supposed to actively seek out weapons.  In \\"Hulk\\", they portryed him using weapons only when he stumbled upon them, which is how it is in the comic.  He doesn't make weapons.  He relies on his physical strength.  Compared to the action sequences in this film, the ones in \\"Incredible\\" are weak and yawn-enducing and fail to dipict the main characters abilities.  The more enraged the Hulk grows, the stronger he gets.  Yet in \\"Incredible\\", despite the fact that he is repeatedly smashed in to a wall by the monster in the climax, he seems to get weaker, not stronger.  Or they show him getting shot with bullets, which bounce off his skin like pebbles, yet when he hits his head on a rock, it hurts? It's just an overall inaccurate portrayle, while in \\"Hulk\\", it is far more accurate.  I may sound like the proverbial fan who was angry that the most recent film didn't show the Hulk as he is from the comics, but it's the truth.  Not only did they fail to show just how strong the Hulk is actually supposed to be, but they made his character one dimentional and boring by showing absolutely no emotional reasoning behind his anger.  In truth, the Hulk is probably one of the most interesting comic character ever created, along with Batman.  \\"Hulk\\" displayed why.    It is a great film and, as I said in the title of this review, the best Marvel hero film out there.  Unlike in othres, such as \\"Spiderman 1, 2 and 3\\" or \\"X-Men\\", there are no corney, half-hearted attempts at humor thrown in to lighten the supposed to be, \\"heavy\\" revilation that one must use their superpowers to better the world.  The Hulk doesn't want to be a super hero, he doesn't want to fight and save the world.  He simply want's to be left alone by his persuors and attackers, and finds himself in an almost cruel situation facing the world's scorn and rejection, just for being different.  While every other super hero films I've seen offer little to nothing in the way of material that actually moves you or causes you to care about the characrers and what happens to them, \\"Hulk\\" delivers, and strong, in that department.  It makes the Hulk human, despite his inhuman capabilities and appearance.    I think Roger Ebert had it right.  He loved this movie and pretty much hated the remake, because he saw that this film actually had all the elements of a truly good, human story, along with pulse pounding action that truly awed you.    And for the record, the special effects in the remake AREN'T better then in this film.  In fact, I liked the way the Hulk looked in this film much more then in \\"Incredible\\".
0060557818|5.0|Incredible ride indeed. Neil Gaiman did it again. Just heard that they want to make a movie about Neverwhere. I saw the BBC adaptation and it was somehow dissapointing. Then again, this review is about the book and make no mistake it will take you London Below in a blink of an eye. At some point you could almost feel claustrophobic while your mind follows Richard, Door and the Marquis thru the endless passages. Great book indeed.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|I don't think there has ever been such a disparity between quality of a film and a soundtrack.  \\"A Good Year\\" the film is oh, so mediocre-but this CD is a wonder.  It makes one want to throw a sophisticated dinner party just to have it on in the background.  I especially like the instumentals on Track 14.  Watch the movie if there is a blizzard and it's on cable and you have a crush on Russell Crowe.  Buy this CD NOW!!!!
0316143472|3.0|Okay, so it's funny. (ish). There were probably a total of six pages that gave me the kind of squirt milk out of your nose laugh that I love. The rest were just mild chuckles that were spread further along than usual with a Sedaris book. i can't say I found it disappointing, I just wanted to bellyache a bit more. The only conclusion I can come up with after finishing the final longest essay about him quitting smoking, is that like everyone else he's growing older, maturing, and feeling a sense of responsibility. While this made for a sweet and somewhat poignant conclusion, I couldn't help but feel like some of his comedic acid was mellowing with age.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I'm on my 10th-12th listen of this album and it is really one of the best rock albums I've heard this decade.  It brings back so much of what was so excellent about late 70's rock (though, it by no means has a 70's feel)...so  then what do I mean?  I think it is the resulting beauty of the straight-forward but thoughtful lyrics, the tempo changes within songs, the crunchy delicious guitars, and the delight in having two lead singers take on different songs.  It is extremely well-produced and an absolute pleasure to listen to.  It's never pretentious and seems rahter devoid of ego.  I always feel good listening to it and love the \\"stories\\".  I am so proud of this work and am glad someone finally took this sort of thing on.  It will forever remain in my collection and always bring a smile to face.  Fantastic.
0375413405|4.0|Being french and a lover of cooking, and living in United States for the last 15 years, I was intimidated by this thick and presumably academic American Cook Book, until I read \\"my life in France\\" also written by Julia Child.<br />In this book,the way she describes how she wrote \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" was so lively and appealing that I decided to give it a try.<br />And I was not disappointed.<br />Not only she gives all the equivalent proportions, quantities and temperatures, but she explains very clearly and simply how to make a dish a success. I tried several of the recipes, my best being a \\"souffle with orange and Grand Marnier\\" .<br />To get the most of her explanations I also borrowed a couple of DVDs of her first cooking shows from my local library, and I got the same good feeling.<br />The reason I gave only 4 stars is because of the presentation of the recipes, with a very detailed master recipe, and just a few lines for the variants. That makes a little bit uneasy to go back and forth during my usual rush cooking time. But that is part due to my own lack of organization.<br />I was so thrilled by this book that I also gave it , as a gift , to a friend who loves cooking.
B0000CAXID|5.0|This CD is fantastic! Great songs and highly recommended. Very talented band! Foo Fighters is one of my all-time favorite bands.
0679746323|2.0|I bought this book because I was hoping to read a new account of one of history's most glossed over mass murderers, but I was very disappointed by the lack of simple foot or end noting of the authors' sources. One can not write a book that calls into question the veracity of some of the most prominent events and people of the 20th century and then not offer actual evidence. There are many better books than this about Mao that do offer sources. Read those instead.
B00001IVQT|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent performance and quality of recording.  Both Piano Concerto 2 and 3 on this CD are recorded in 1963 when Ashkenazy was just 26 years old, and it shows the passion and the energy of young Ashkenazy.  The quality of remaster is good.  The dynamic range is somewhat limited, but still decent considering the recordings are more than 40 years old.    His later recording with Previn might show superior virtuosity, but I found the performance to be a little too reserved and lacks the excitement.  This recording shows stark contrast in performance in terms of passion and energy.  This recording just draws in the audience more.  To me it's as good, or better than the any other recordings of Rachmaninov Piano Concerto that I own, including Horowitz, Argerich, Cliburn, Volodos, or Lugansky.
B0017U7PT6|2.0|...Because surely this couldn't be Earth we're talking about.<br /><br />As far as the BD is concerned, it looks and sounds great.  As far as the movie itself:<br /><br />If someone had access to a huge budget and modern CGI techniques back in the 1980s 10,000 B.C. would be the result.  Trust me, I wasn't expecting anything of Oscar caliber, but congratulations on making a movie that makes marginally more sense than Bestmaster or Clash of the Titans (no offense to either classic film).  BTW, note to Director Roland Emmerich: Your own movie Stargate and Mel Gibson's Apacalypto called and they want their respective plots back!!!  Also William Wallace and General Maximus are pissed!  If brainless fantasy masquerading as historical fiction is your cup of tea, look no further.<br /><br />And man o man;  I took a peak at some of the few special features on this disk.  Are the director and that writer/historian Graham really serious in that short documentary about there inspiration(s) for coming up with this preposterous story?  I guess so.
0978607651|5.0|We also saw the program on CBS Sunday Morning and immediately purchased the book. We have had it now for 3 or 4 months. My husband and I bring it out often and keep looking and looking. You see something different every time; the complexity of the simple and the simplicity of the complex. This man's mind was amazing. We are going to buy another one so we can dissasmble it and create a wall of pictures in our son's room that can be changed from time to time. It is one of my favorite treasures. I can't wait until my kids are a little older to look at it with them.    We are not graphic artists or book people. We just buy what we love. Our book does not seem to have any issues or problems. Just beautiful picutures that inspire our mind. Oh and the box it comes in is beautiful too.
0446310786|5.0|Jean Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates this tale that covers roughly 2 years of her childhood starting from shortly before she started the 1st grade.  The story is a mixture of many elements including a mysterious neighbor named Boo Radley, various coming of age issues regarding Scout and her brother Jem, and her father, Atticus, defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.  As the story is set in Alabama in the 1930s, the rape case is particularly incendiary.    To Kill a Mockingbird is such a classic piece of American literature that most people read it in high school.  I somehow missed that experience and curiosity prompted me to pick it up and give it a try.  While there were a few descriptions of rural southern life that ran on a bit long for my taste, the novel was well worth reading.  For sheer entertainment value, I enjoyed the Boo Radley subplot the most as it is both mildly suspenseful and immensely interesting.      Of course, the novel is most famous for the rape trial and this is also compelling in a fairly horrifying and very sad way.  Harper Lee paints a vivid portrait of the extent to which African Americans were relegated to a status far below even second class in that place and time.  Atticus Finch does a masterful job of defending the accused, but he knows that the all-white jury has practically cast their votes before ever entering the courtyard.  The author uses the narrative voice of the children to highlight the blatant injustices and the outrage that any decent person would feel as a result.  The technique is highly effective if not exactly subtle.    To Kill a Mockingbird is easy to recommend.  The story is interesting, the characters substantial, and the subject is still relevant today.  It's a shame that Harper Lee has not published a second novel but this single book is likely to ensure that her voice will continue to be heard fro many years to come.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Whale Rider is the story of a young girl whose mother and twin brother died at her birth.  This tragedy has profoundly affected her family, which includes her grandfather, who is chief of a long lineage going all the way back to the Maori ancestor called the Whalerider.  Her grandfather is strong but stubborn that only a male can be the next chief.  He cannot look to his two grown sons for this, and so he creates a school to teach the first-born boys in his village the secret ways of the Maori warrior, in hopes that one of them will emerge as the rightful chief.<br /><br />The movie is slow and drawn-out, and that is why I rated it four stars instead of five.  And, I expected much more at the climax.  The performances, setting, music and acting are outstanding.  The little girl , her character and the actress, is so inspiring for her courage to follow her own path in the face of constant, withering criticism from the one person she wants to please - her grandfather.  Truly, some of the things he says to her are horrible.<br /><br />I do recommend this film, but younger children might lose interest because of the lack of action.  Also, there is some brief, but very crude and inappropriate \\"guy humour\\" in one scene at the grandfather's school for boys.<br /><br />Whale Rider is worth seeing for the outstanding performance of this young girl.  I can't wait to see her future projects.

B000GX57YK|5.0|Editorial Reviews    Amazon.com  Though it bears little resemblance to the original 1969 thriller starring Michael Caine, the 2003 remake of The Italian Job stands on its own as a caper comedy that's well above average. The title's a misnomer--this time it's actually a Los Angeles job--but the action's just as exciting as it propels a breezy tale of honor and dishonor among competing thieves. Inheriting Caine's role as ace heist-planner Charlie Croker, Mark Wahlberg plays straight-man to a well-cast team of accomplices, including Mos Def, Jason Statham, and scene-stealer Seth Green in a variation of the role originally played by Noel Coward. As the daughter of Croker's ill-fated mentor (Donald Sutherland), Charlize Theron is recruited to double-cross a double-crosser (Edward Norton in oily villain mode), and once again, speedily versatile Mini Coopers play a pivotal role in director F. Gary Gray's exhilarating car-chase climax. It's perhaps the greatest product placement in movie history, and just as fun the second time around. --Jeff Shannon
1932100660|5.0|I just completed The China Study and I feel it was a very interesting, informative read.  It's kind of a scientific thriller as in what else will our good scientist T. Colin Campbell reveal?   The end of the book was the most interesting to me...how the establishment ignores easy, inexpensive ways to heal disease thru diet, how doctors who espouse nutritional therapy are rejected and how industry and government are intertwined and, as a result, the public is left ignorant on how they can easily and simply heal themselves. One thing to think about:  I am sure many who read this book want nationalized health care.  I am not sure that would be a good thing at the moment with a government that is unable to give us the information we need right NOW.  It is addicted to costly procedures and drugs making everything more complex, painful and expensive.  In fact, people are DYING from our conventional medicare...one of the biggest killers of Americans.  Do we really want to hand over the reigns of our healthcare (and money) to a government that is unable to act in our own self-interest?  If we did, our money would be wasted in furthering the pharmaceutical and medical industries at the expense of our health. I don't think it's a good idea unless it can be cleaned up and the motives clean.  I'd rather give my healthcare dollars to people and institutions that espouse the truth...something the government is incapable of.
B000THCFA2|5.0|I recently downloaded this album from Amazon and while listening to it I noticed that tracks \\"People\\" and \\"The Diff'erence\\" are the same exact track. Both tracks in this store are the track \\"People.\\" I had to download the real \\"The Diff'erence\\" off of emusic. Someone needs to fix this. Anyway this album is a great end to J Dilla's career and I highly recommend if you like good beats. And if you really like this album I suggest you search for the unfinished album entitled \\"Jay Love Japan.\\" It's a very short album because he died while he was still making it, but it is some high quality stuff.
B0013527I4|4.0|The quality is good.  Each season has fewer and fewer special features.  Not much behind the scenes info in this set, especially in comparison to the first season.  But it's Jim Henson's Muppets - it's all good.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|Love them or hate them, (New York Times writer, John Pareles, called them \\"the most insufferable band of the decade\\"), Coldplay know who they are and have since their first release. That may just be the problem.    Mr. Pareles may have overstated things a bit. After all: are Coldplay more insufferable than the collective boy-band movement we all lived through? Hardly. Still, in his seminal 2005 article, \\"The Case Against Coldplay\\" Mr. Pareles does, in fact, make a good case against Coldplay. In spite of being a fan myself of 2000's Parachutes and 2002's A Rush Of Blood to the Head, I couldn't help but agree with most of what he wrote.    Coldplay are, to their detriment, acutely aware of themselves, down to every note on every song. And therein lies the rub. Rock music, at its most brilliant, is built on \\"happy accidents\\". Nothing about Coldplay's music is accidental, spontaneous or organic in any way. Add to the mix a high-profile front man who has cultivated a \\"Whoa is me, I'm just like you\\" image - while being married to Gwyneth Paltrow, no less - and you have the makings of a band flirting dangerously with self-parody.    Viva La Vida is the culmination of their ascendance into super-group status. It's been produced with surgical precision, marketed with sublime aplomb and even found its title track used to indirectly promote iTunes before its release date. These are all the hallmarks of a band finding its stride - at least commercially, if not artistically.    In the case of Viva La Vida, track after track of overproduced anthems drip with all the sincerity of a Hollywood air kiss. What's worse, the lyrics throughout the album, if read on their own, possess the depth of a sixth grade girl's first attempt at poetry. The opening lines of song \\"42\\", for example, find Martin proclaiming, \\"Those who are dead are not dead / They're just living in my head.\\" Well, it does rhyme.    To prove they are a super-group, Coldplay hired the producer-extraordinaire, Brian Eno,to coax pearls of brilliance from Viva, although it's far more likely that his pedigree was employed as a means of establishing both the record and the band as being among the musical elite. Unfortunately, especially given the result, one is left questioning the validity of and motivation for hiring such a musical luminary to produce for a band already graduated to product endorsement and sitcom background music. In the end, Eno's employment here does little more than draw attention to the band's desire to be spoken of in the same breath as U2. Sadly for Coldplay, Eno could not do for them what he did for U2 - not by a long shot. But then Coldplay are no U2 - not by a long shot.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I had a mixed reaction when I started listening to the \\"Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust\\" by Sigur Ros. The opening song was just not like your typical Sigur Ros: it was too... pop.. I was confused: was this Death Cab for Cutie? Had I clicked on the wrong MP3 on iTunes? \\"Gobbledigook\\" turned out to be a poppier track, indeed, but even at performing pop they rocked!<br /><br />From the second track, you go back into familiar Sigur Ros territory. The main difference (besides the opening track) this time around is that the band gets more intimate, with acoustic guitar-based tracks, such as \\"G&oacute;dan daginn\\" and \\"&Iacute;llgresi,\\" and quiet piano-based tracks like \\"Flj&oacute;tav&iacute;k,\\" the closing \\"All Alright\\" and \\"&Aacute;ra b&aacute;tur\\" (which later evolves into a majestic epic that only they could have recorded).<br /><br />After 8 listens, the album keeps growing on me. There is only one other album that could be as good this year (though it most likely will be in second place: [[ASIN:B0016MJ2IW Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow]] by Hammock. Otherwise, Sigur Ros did it again and make any wait for their music worth every minute.

I sat in my living room wondering how a kid could go through such a life like his.

0515141429|5.0|I just read this book last year and I really liked it.  The first Jack Reacher book I read was The Hard Way, which was O.K.,  but I decided to start at the beginning and work my way forward.  This was a great introduction of this character and I have read   the whole series now, up to and including the new one called  \\"Nothing to Lose\\".  The best ones are \\"Killing Floor\\", \\"Tripwire\\", \\"Die Trying\\",  and \\"Nothing to Lose\\".  The only one I didn't like that much was  \\"One Shot\\".
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|Elbow may be, for many over here in the States, the best band you've never heard of.    The better British acts are producing music of a sublime quality compared with many of their American counterparts. Manchester quintet, Elbow, may be the most unheralded of that bunch. While Coldplay and Keane have gone on to see their works used to hock everything from indie films to consumer goods, Elbow have remained on the fringes of commercial success; quite possibly by their own doing, but certainly not in spite of themselves. They have progressed both logically and measurably with each release while eschewing the temptation to write albums rife with catchy singles for the radio-fed audience. At the same time, they've not gone the avant garde route of other bands more fixated with being respected as serious artists, rather than admired by their loyal fans. Elbow's brilliance lies in the details and this new release is packed with all the sublime subtlety and vivid accents that have become the hallmarks of their sound.    Overall, Elbow records are designed not as delivery devices for occasional, epic singles, but as complete works to be heard in their entirety. In fact, vocalist Guy Garvey has been particularly outspoken in his disdain for iTunes' selling practices taking away from artists who, like Elbow, write records designed for uninterrupted listening. The Seldom Seen Kid may be their finest example to date of this deliberate approach. This isn't to say Elbow don't write the occasional toe-tapper. \\"Grounds For Divorce\\", in particular, is a Zeppelin-esque thumper designed for repeat play on many an iPod. \\"The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver\\", in particular, is an astonishing standout and worth the price of the whole album.    Elbow's songs are accessible without being glib and inventive without being ostentatious, driven by their big, Manchester sound and buoyed by Garvey's astute lyrics and haunting vocals. Overall, The Seldom Seen Kid finds Elbow in remarkable form. Previous releases, while brilliant in their own right, were characterized by clever interplays of stadium-sized romps and sparsely-tuned ballads. This new work shows Elbow at its conceptual best, marrying a collection of richly-composed tunes into a complete and masterful showcase.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|After their previous album, I had dismissed Coldplay, but having enlisted Brian Eno may have been one of the most brilliant moves ever made by British band. They actually sound a LOT better than U2 (one of the bands whose sound Eno helped shape) these days.<br /><br />From the opening instrumental \\"Life In Technicolor,\\" you know you are in front of a great album. Viva La Vida blends diverse ethnic influences in a brilliant way (in \\"Yes\\" there are Middle Eastern sounds and in \\"Cemeteries of London\\" there's clapping reminiscent of Flamenco music). Yet, you still get the \\"classic\\" Coldplay sound, with Martin doing some basic piano stunts with a background of strings (as he does in \\"42\\"). There are SO many great songs in the album that it's hard to single out one of them: the title track really stands out; you will also enjoy the vibe of \\"Lovers In Japan\\" and \\"Strawberry Swing\\" which reminds of Travis at times.<br /><br />The second half of the album has three songs that clock at more than 6 minutes. The final track, \\"Death and All His Friends,\\" is the closing parenthesis that complements beautifully the opening track, wrapping up the album in an uplifting way. All in all, Viva La Vida will easily make it to my list of Best of 2008.

0385340567|2.0|I've read most of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, and some of them, like KILLING FLOOR and ONE SHOT, are the very best thrillers that you will ever read.  Others Reacher are less impressive, usually bogged down my implausable plotlines, irrelevant details, and cartoonish characters.  For the most part, NOTHING TO LOSE falls into the latter category.<br /><br />NOTHING TO LOSE takes place in a small town in Colorado, where Jack Reacher gets in trouble with the town's inhabitants.  What results is pretty much a bunch of recycled scenes from earlier Child novels: Reacher gets into a bunch of fistfights, and wins them easily.  Reacher meets an attractive (and tough and smart) law enforcement official, and beds her within a few days.  Reacher drinks a lot of coffee.  This is fun as far as it goes, but very little of this is original.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the villains in NOTHING TO LOSE are more pathetic than threatening.  Reacher has become such a superhero that you rarely worry about his personal safety, which adds up to zero suspense.  This novel also meanders quite a bit, especially during the middle, when Reacher literally seems to be walking in circles, getting from point A to point B with excruciating slowness.<br /><br />Even worse, Child has decided to inject his own politics into NOTHING TO LOSE, which turns into a heavy-handed polemic against the Iraq war and religious fundamentalism in the United States.  The last third of this book is pretty much dominated by Child's obvious contempt of the American right-wing.  While I don't mind political themes in books, Child is so heavy-handed and didactic in his approach that I found this novel rather exasperating in spots.<br /><br />Child is a genuine superstar of thrillerdom, and even his bad books are readable to a degree.  Still, I would really avoid making NOTHING TO LOSE your first Jack Reacher book.  My advice is to try KILLING FLOOR first, to see what Child is truly capabale of when he's writing at his best.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie has had a HUGE impact on me, it is definitely in my top two movies(along with Moulin Rouge!). Across the Universe has made a Beatles fan out of me, and everyone I've showed it to. The music is great, the cast is awesome and even though this movie is set 25 years before I was born I loved it and it has changed the way I think about a lot of things(Yes, I am totally obsessed). So go rent it, you wont't be sorry!
B000UR9T7I|5.0|OK... I just don't know what all the complaining is about.  Spidey 3 was a phenomenal movie.  The story continued from #2, the action scenes looked amazing and there were fanstastic acting performances from all the major players.  It had heart and substance and a great moral.  I can't wait to watch it again on Blu-Ray!
B000P0J09W|5.0|I first watched this years ago when it first came out, but I didn't remember much about it, except that I had enjoyed it.  I re-watched it now with my kids, and it is reminiscent of Indiana Jones or possibly National Treasure, but with kids as the protagonists.  It is rated PG for some juvenile humor at the beginning (which mostly went over the kids heads), and a couple of scary places.  It was still enjoyable for me, and the kids all gave it a thumbs up.
B00005JPTK|5.0|This is definitely The Omega Man in an updated version.  It's the same story and Charelton Heston's character in The Omega Man was named Robert Neville.  To me, this is definately a must see movie.  You should also see The Omega Man.
1594200106|4.0|This book, \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" was one of the best I have read in a long time. I found it in a library cast-off sell. Oddly enough; after reading it, I discover that it may be the book that found me. If you don't understand the premise behind that statement than you need to read the book. This book is excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of reading it. It was the best ten cents I have ever spent. It is one of the books that I will read once or twice a year for the next ten years.<br /><br />I'm not much of an academic; just an average reader with a voracious appetite for good books. That being said, I don't deem myself qualified nor interested in reviewing the details of the book line after line. What I will tell you is that if you're looking for a book that will hold your attention and keep you interested until the last page; you will find it in \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\".

B000683VI4|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this film because of the overwhelming mainstream adoration.  Everytime I saw the cover of the DVD with Allie and Noah kissing I rolled my eyes and mocked.<br /><br />I enjoy passionate movies, not cheesy love stories.  I was CONVINCED this would be such.  I did read the book many years ago and was certain this would be a watered-down disappointment.<br /><br />One evening I happened to catch the last 40 minutes of the film (the scene in the boat with the white ducks swimming), I could not stop watching.  I was completely infatuated with this film.  I immediately rented, then purchased this movie.<br /><br />I promptly made a date with my husband to watch the film.  I was delighted by his enjoyment...Noah is enough of a \\"man's man\\" that men relate to him and empathize with him.<br /><br />The Filmmakers did an amazing job of pulling the most beautiful scenes from the novel to project onto the screen.<br /><br />If you ever hesitated watching this movie, based on principals which deny you from watching a favorite book turned to film...PLEASE WATCH.<br /><br />This is the exception to the rule.<br /><br />This is officially my favorite film.  I do not know what to compare it to, as there is no other love story that moved both me and my husband to just want to hold one another and stay in love forever.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Mr. Lee has directed a romantic masterpiece for the 21st century with the magnificent Brokeback Mountain, creating an instant classic. A story that could possibly shock due to the two men looking and behaving as typical family men involved with women and children...who fall hard for each other. The perfectly cast leads not only excel in their acting but capture the essence of the intensely passionate relationship that seemingly develops out of the blue between two handsome,masculine,rugged cowboys hired to manage a flock of sheep in a spectacularly majestic mountain setting. An environment so outrageously romantic and isolated that it's impossible to imagine resisting any kind of attraction from occuring...between any two human beings.  This beautifully handled film allows anyone who watches it to identify with the emotions of erotic attraction,electric passion, tender romance,internal conflict,dramatic tragedy and life changing loss that are a big part of the human experience. The elegant, leisurely pace and classic-mythic-cinematography heightens the gut-wrenching story as it unfolds.A stunning achievement in all catagories that sets a new standard for cinematic love-story-telling for the 21st century. A classic love between opposites that anyone can relate to and identify with ,opposites not in gender, but in personality and spirit. One cowboy is the optimistic extrovert who wants it all with his man by his side and the cowboy he falls for, is the emotionally tortured intovert....who owns the film from his first shot. Mr.Gyllenhaal and Mr.Ledger's on-screen couple has become a modern legend. It'll be a long time before anyone will be able to out do this work by a pair of intelligent, brave, extremely secure and gifted actors at the peak of their craft....who really understood and felt the characters and the difficulty of this very complicated, highly emotional situation. How fantastically refreshing to see homosexual desire portrayed by two very believably masculine young men with absolutely no trace of any theatrical, selfconcious, Will & Jack style-\\"gay\\" mannerisms. And in doing so, showing the world that there are plenty of \\"regular\\" men discreetly enjoying the \\"power of love/lust\\" privately with each other right under everyone's noses! Wishing Mr. Ledger's soul peace and love...he left us with a piece of work that will hopefully inspire people to seek  inner happiness by bravely facing one's inner, deeper truth. An important film for women to see to help them better understand those men who were never able to fully commit to them.
0307386171|3.0|This book explores a relationship between newlyweds where communication problems lead to a sad result (I don't want to spoil it for you). The woman seems to be abnormally fearful of sex and in fact, revolted by the idea of it. There are hints that perhaps she was abused. The book details a painfully awkward wedding night and the fallout its unhappy outcome. The book is beautifully written, moving seamlessly between the present and past.  The book shows how a moment in life can lead one down a path from which there is no turning back. A few pages near the end quickly recount what becomes of these young people and though their lives are not tragic, the reader does wonder what might have been. It's a good read though soon after I closed the book, it slipped from mind.
0689829590|4.0|This is a short story about a girl who wants to play with the moon, sending her dad to get it. We go through a half a month until the moon is small enough to take home, and then it disappears - but it comes back in the sky in the next half a month.    Several of the pages have fold-outs of some sort, most noticeably the big spread where the full moon talks to Monica's father. These fold-outs are a little delicate, possibly too delicate for the small hands who expect to use board books. You might want to wait until your child is older and then simply get the bigger, non-board edition.    Unlike some commenters here, I have an actual board book, with the same ISBN as listed. I don't know what happened with their books.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Life is Beautiful is an amazing story of total selfless love. The courage and strength for which the main character strives throughout the film is a message in charity.

0689825498|4.0|Children like a repetitive structure because it helps them understand what's going on and predict what will happen next. (For that matter, adults like it too! Repetition is a crucial part of traditional storytelling and modern-day speechifying.)    This one is about a child who wrote to the zoo for a pet and, being a zoo, they sent him/her all manner of exotic, but unsuitable animals before finally hitting on a puppy. Each animal is hidden inside a box of some sort, that's where the flaps come in.    It's great fun (at least the first thousand times, then it's only a little fun) to lift the flaps and adlib some animal sounds to describe whatever's hiding. And, as a plus, the flaps on this book are actually fairly sturdy - we haven't had a rip yet, and we've had this book a few years.    Definitely a keeper.

B000YAA68W|5.0|Well.... As an Iranian woman (a bit younger than Marjan)I remember those days very well. It is a very accurate movie about that era. It brought me many sad memories from the time that Tehran was attacked by missiles. I was too young to remember the actual revolution and the street demonstrations and I have a very vague memory of the Shah's era, but I remember the war and the post war era. She draws a very accurate picture of the hidden parties in Iran, the alcohol consumptions in parties, the Islamic police, the secretive dates between boys and girls, the security guards in the airport etc..     The moral of the story is that Marjan had to immigrate from Iran for the second time (which was her last time) simply because she felt like a stranger in her motherland...She had to start her life all over again in another country. Iran was not her country any more... The same story happened to millions of Iranians who left Iran in some point after 1979 and now live in exile including myself.     This is a true story of the dreams that were shattered after the Islamic revolution...the families that were broken.... and the collapse of the most ancient civilizations on earth...It is the story of one of the biggest human tragedies in 20 century and the movie very cleverly shows that.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second studio album, Ride the Lightning is a great thrash metal experience. The album's theme revolves around death; this is apparent from the album art alone, which depicts an electric chair. Some songs are fast, some songs are slow, but in my opinion each track is great in its own right. Enough foreplay.<br /><br />Fight Fire With Fire: The opening track, this song is about nuclear war. It starts off with a calm acoustic intro, reminiscent of some sort of old instrument (a harpsichord I believe). If you didn't know any better, you'd think it was a recording of the National Symphony Orchestra leading up into a masterpiece by Beethoven. But all of a sudden, you get a fast, heavy, low guitar. It's a pretty good song overall, but it isn't the greatest. 8/10<br /><br />Ride the Lightning: This titular track is nice because it simply sounds great. Hetfield's voice sounds angry, maybe even a bit spiteful. The song is about a man on death row, about to be executed on the electric chair. The solo is killer, as is the bridge leading into it. Great to listen to. 10/10<br /><br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: This one is interesting, because it's a bit slower than the previous two tracks. The song seems to be about soldiering and the Hemingway book by the same title. The intro riff is cool, as are the various solos throughout the song. That said, I think it's a bit overrated. Not bad, just overrated; there are better songs on here. 9/10<br /><br />Fade to Black: This song arguably started the 'tradition' that would be followed in the next two Metallica albums of having the fourth track start slowly but end heavy. The song has a catchy acoustic intro leading into a distorted riff. The song focuses on suicide, the mental struggle of a man. Once again you can hear some anguish in Hetfield's voice, and overall the song has a gloomy mood to it. It is definitely one of the slower tracks on the album, but it's very well composed and the solo is great. A classic. 10/10<br /><br />Trapped Under Ice: Basically Fight Fire With Fire in terms of how it sounds. I like it, but it's basically 'another thrash song.' The song's title speaks for itself. 8/10<br /><br />Escape: One of my favorite tracks on the album, and interestingly it's the only one that's got a more positive mood in the lyrics. The chorus is one of the best parts, just because of the way it is structured. The song seems to be about escaping from prison or from the shackles of life. Sadly, Metallica has never played it live (or so it would seem), because they don't like it that much. 10/10<br /><br />Creeping Death: A song about the plagues from the story of Moses and the Ten Commandments, told from the perspective of the creeping fog that killed the first-born of each family that didn't paint the X on their doors (or however the story goes). It's a heavier track than the others, and has a good sound to it. 9/10<br /><br />The Call of Ktulu: Inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, of whom the late Cliff Burton was a major fan, this song is purely instrumental. I do think it drags on a bit long, but it's still a good showcase of Hammett's guitar work. The ending is one of the best parts, because it simply sounds epic. 9/10<br /><br />If you want to get into Metallica, this MAY not be the best album to start with; I would recommend the classic Master of Puppets or even the Black Album. If you've already heard some Metallica (I'm talking about early Metallica, not the Load/Reload and beyond years) then you should definitely get this if you haven't already.ire With Fire in terms of how it sounds.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|didn't care much about the band until kidA, even though i was their BIGGEST fan since 1993, meanwhile, i was also the biggest fan of nirvana, sublime, &lt;strike>debbie gibson, alanis morrisette, poison, mc hammer, jason priestly, ninja turtles, boyz ii men, baywatch&lt;/strike> bjork, and batman- the animated series all at once. i was 5, what do you expect? goethe? actually...<br /><br />but now according to my maturing tastes, there's something wrong with the album which i can't quite put my finger on.<br /><br />so i will be as double-edge and creative as possible, to match my FAVOURITE front man in the world! *squeak* he's practically a jain!<br /><br />in rainbows is not nearly as embarassing as 'hail to the thief'. this album totally covers their butts on the false prophetry from the previous effort. citing Faust, multiple times: that covers everything, before, now and after. dude i totally found the hidden meaning. they certainly give you your money's worth.<br />and, as prophesized, they have moved on from shaping culture to making history: pricing based on personal value and independently distributing music. that's both original and brave, like kicking EMI to the curb after umpteen years, that's like finally moving out of your mom's house. EMI, goooooodbyyye!<br /><br />i price this at $1200:<br />my hourly rate is $100, i spent about 15 minutes with bit torrent and another 2 putting it into itunes. i listened to it 7 times according to itunes, conservatively estimating another 7 in other situations. album is 42.5 minutes long, about 10 hours spent. through radio, probably 2 singles combined total of 7 times, 4 minutes per song, that's 28 minutes. another hour and a half writing and proofing this bit, that comes out to just over 12 hours. i'll around down for old times' sake. that's $1200 for my time, and the appropriate commission of course. i trust that they are gentlemen.<br /><br />music was ok. more of the same. at least they use allegories to whine. if i have to listen to another song that keeps talking about how much this guy wants to off himself, or about their mom and dad, or pot, i am going to listen to in rainbows again. since not whining is too much to ask for.<br /><br />what happened to bands that know how to make an exit? more importantly, what happened to personal growth? i take that back, entrenchment answers everything. people must be trapped in life in order to not off themselves. but since this is the year of my campaign, i'll have to stick to my original stance of posing important questions to the citizens of the world. a vote for me is a vote for change.about how much this guy wants to off himself, or about their mom and dad, or pot, i am going to listen to in rainbows again. since not whining is too much to ask for.    what happened to bands that know how to make an exit? more importantly, what happened to personal growth? i take that back, entrenchment answers everything. people must be trapped in life in order to not off themselves. but since this is the year of my campaign, i'll have to stick to my original stance of posing important questions to the citizens of the world. a vote for me is a vote for change.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is largely hailed as Metallica's crowning achievement, a great piece of thrash metal. The album deals with control, manipulation, free will, etc. It showcases some of Hammett's best guitar work, and it's definitely got a more polished sound than the previous two Metallica releases.<br /><br />Battery: Not my favorite track in all honesty. It starts off with an easy acoustic intro but leads into a heavy battery of guitars and drums. A pretty good intro. 8/10<br /><br />Master of Puppets: Arguably one of their best tracks. The song starts heavy, and has a very melodic sound to it. I think what's so great about this song is that it's not just mindless shredding, but it actually has a very strong structure and varied sounds. The solo is great, as is the interlude before it. It could be interpreted to be about anybody controlling, but it's most obvious reference is to how drug addiction can take over someone's mind. 10/10<br /><br />The Thing That Should Not Be: Meh. It's heavy, it doesn't sound terrible, but I just find it boring. Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's work. 6/10<br /><br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium): After the last track you need something really good, and this does the job pretty well. It's one of the slower songs on the album (though not as slow as The Thing) and it deals with the minds of people in insane asylums. Good solo, solid song. 9/10<br /><br />Disposable Heroes: Much faster and heavier than Master of Puppets or Sanitarium, this song is about how the government treats its military as some sort of disposable force, rather than realizing that the soldiers are real people. It's got strong solos, a pretty good structure, and it just gets your blood pumping. 9/10<br /><br />Leper Messiah: For some reason I love this song. It's about evangelicals, especially televangelists, who try to sell religion. You can simply hear Hetfield's anger in this song (his parents were strict followers of Christianity, and his mother died soon after she left his dad). The song is heavy, and a bit slower than the others, but there's just something about it that I like. 10/10<br /><br />Orion: An instrumental piece of art. It starts off with a dreamy intro, and is simply wonderful to listen to. It's hard to call it heavy or slow or fast... it is changing throughout the song. Perhaps one of the best parts is the middle, during Cliff's bass solo. It simply invokes ideas of outer space (Orion being a nebula and constellation) in me, and is arguably one of the better metal instrumentals. 10/10<br /><br />Damage Inc: Probably the best closer to a Metallica album other than Dyers Eve. The first minute or so is a soft intro (I'm guessing some sort of synth, either that or a guitar with an effects pedal) that makes you think you're still listening to Orion. Then you hear a heavier note, and suddenly the guitars start. The same note a few times, then you go into thrash mode. The guitars simply do not stop going fast, Hammett hitting you with everything he's got. The solo comes out of nowhere, thrashing and flailing. Fun to listen to. At the surface it seems to simply be about some sort of mercenary corporation or killer, but it can be interpreted to be about self determination. 10/10<br /><br />If you want to get into Metallica's heavier stuff, then without a doubt you should pick up this album. It's well-produced (compared to RtL and KEA) and is a bit more accessible than And Justice For All (not to say that it's worse than AJ4A... I think it's actually better).an the others, but there's just something about it that I like. 10/10    Orion: An instrumental piece of art.

B000JIJPZY|4.0|My baby loves playing on this mat, obviously he has nothing else to compare to, so he doesn't know what he is missing from the larger dome style playmats.  I bought this for the size and portability.  Downside, not enough toys and long enough music for him to play and hear.  I attach more toys to the bar for him to play and also bought a kick activated musical board.  Overall a good buy for the size.
0385340567|4.0|I don't agree with some of the highlighted reviews that say this book is a miss for Child.  As far as I'm concerned a not-quite-as-good Lee Child is better than some other authors' best efforts.  Lee Child knows how to write a story, and Jack Reacher is just as wonderful in this book as he is in others.  In this book Jack is caught in between Hope and Despair (these are actually two small towns in Colorado that are about 14 miles apart in distance, but miles apart in everything else.  Hope is a clean, happy little town, and there's a pretty cop there that Reacher hooks up with.  Despair is a closed-ugly-company-factory town that does not like strangers, and they are hiding a very deep, dark secret.  Of course, Reacher cannot rest until he uncovers that secret.  When he does, it's even more ugly than even he imagined.  I enjoyed the book.  I love Reacher.  Bring it on Lee Child!
0679722610|1.0|While this novel may have an important place in the history of crime fiction it is simply an awful read. The plot is convoluted and the violence is over the top. If you were going to read only one Dashiell Hammett novel please make it The Maltese Falcon which I have read over and over.
0743277708|4.0|A well written, fast moving tale with a happy ending.  It was so refreshing to read a children's story which remembers it's audience and while there are realistic losses - all of the main characters survive.
B000HGBTW0|3.0|it winds itself beyond the point of no return...it starts to speed up and you have to continuously set it back like twice a day...otherwise it is great...you should invest in the Seiko Kinetic or the other Seiko model and not this one...I know the Kinetic is like 600 dollars but i guess it would be worth it...No more setting back your watch twice daily.
0316067598|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be in attendance at the National Rifle Association convention in Louisville, this past May, where Marcus Lutrell was a featured speaker. As soon as I returned home I ordered his book from Amazon, and found it very hard to put down. It speaks of almost impossible training (only twenty-some men finished out of the 180 that started), and the incredible men who love their country so much they not only endure the training, but then perform special operations all over the globe, to defend our freedom. And remember, these are all volunteers. Every American should read this book, then get down on their knees and thank God that we have such people on our side. Every politician who is trying to hamstring our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan should read this book, and make a vow to support, not try to hamper our efforts.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Pre-ordered this one with great expectation. But it turned out to be such a huge disappointment like a third-grade, street rockers' works. Loud, clueless, and souless.
B0013FNC38|4.0|Quite possibly his best CD yet.  Tracks 2,3,4, and 10 are my favorites, but the whole CD is great.
B00151HZME|3.0|The sound of this album is very different than what I tend to listen to. It has an eclectic feel. It's very Indie. Overall it is fairly good.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|While most of hard rock & metal was stale as 2000 began, Iron Maiden roared back w/Bruce Dickinson once again piloting the vocals to deliver a superb album! Where to begin: The lead track, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is vintage Maiden as they roared through the opener. \\"Ghost Of The Navigator\\" is a beautiful piece, and \\"Blood Brothers\\" is perhaps their most moving song ever, in this reviewers opinion. The entire album is excellent, but for me, the best track is the final song, \\"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate.\\" A very moving piece that once again shows Maiden has a beautiful quiet side to compliment their razor sharp metal side!<br /><br />While Paul Di'Anno was good for the first two Maiden records as his voice was somewhat punk in approach, and Blaze Bayley did a commendable job for two records in the mid 90's, the true voice, the ONLY voice for Maiden shall be Bruce Dickinson as he remains one of the finest true \\"singers\\" in all of music, not just metal.<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!
B0013LKZWS|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs.  Her songs are different and intersting and witty.  her piano work is lovely and the songs flow nicely.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I am floored. I didn't think it was possible for Pixar to surpass [[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story]], but it has. A sophisticated treat for adults and teens, a cuddly romance for the juice-box set, this comedic science fiction thriller romance (really!) takes the company to a new, more mature level. Filled with artistry, depth, meaning and a lot of humor, WALL-E is a masterpiece. Where [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars]] was a kid's movie with added adult themes, this is an adult movie with added value for children.<br /><br />DIALOGUE SCHMIALOGUE<br /><br />Before I saw WALL-E I had read about the lack of dialogue, and how it might be a risky move for Pixar to make a film with characters that don't talk in a traditional sense. Well, trash that. The most emotionally powerful scenes in this movie are those with the LEAST dialogue. Fully developed and indeed almost human, the two main characters are Wall-E himself (the letters stand for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class; there's also a WALL-A) and EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), two machines in love.<br /><br />After about a half hour I was wondering if Pixar could continue to pull off this less-is-more concept for the rest of the film -- then the two robots started playing Pong! Such imaginative screenplay carries the film to what should be a Best Picture nomination. Seriously.<br /><br />A TOUCHING STORY<br /><br />WALL-E is a lonely little robotic trash compactor who was left behind after Earth was abandoned some 700 years earlier. He has been methodically cleaning up the trash-ridden planet ever since, and harboring a tiny plant he has found among the garbage. Eve, meanwhile, lives on the immense spaceship Axiom, which is also home to the fat, blob-like remains of the human race. She is a probe robot that flies to Earth to determine if the planet is ready for habitation. WALL-E takes one look at the streamlined, angelic Eve and falls in love.<br /><br />It didn't take long for me to fall in love with the little robot. As soon as he giggled (after his pet cockroach tickled him) I was hooked. This hardworking rusty guy with his small home full of collected treasures is so poignant. His lonely life is so human. Eve is just as likable, but much more sleek. Near the end comes a heartbreaking moment when a key character seems to lose all personality, all self. So well done, it made me think of how families must feel when a loved one disappears inside him- or herself with Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />All ends well, of course. As the credits roll, the artwork illustrates how everyone and everything lives happily after ever.<br /><br />AN ADULT MEANING<br /><br />For adults, WALL-E is not so much about a cute little robot as it is about the future of man. What happens when humans become such creatures of the consumer culture, so fat they can't even stand up without assistance, living literally on auto-pilot, that they do nothing but buy cheap merchandise, stuff their faces at the Regurgitated Food Buffet and lie around watching video screens? Can they ever get back to the land and set their souls free? Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young asked that question decades ago; Pixar asks it today.<br /><br />There is even a sly political reference. Broadcasting a message to the passengers of the spaceship, the CEO of monster corporation Buy 'n' Large -- played in live-action by the inimitable Fred Willard, and named Shelby Forthright -- says they will be continuing on their never-ending, hopeless cruise to nowhere because they must \\"Stay the course!\\" Hmmm, haven't I heard a president use that line?<br /><br />EXTRA TOUCHES<br /><br />WALL-E has so many wonderful touches! After the little robot is charged using his solar panels, he \\"turns on\\" with a sound any Macintosh owner will recognize. The robot's collected objects, much like the thingamabobs of [[ASIN:B000F8O35U The Little Mermaid]]'s Ariel, are things that are uniquely human: bubble wrap, an iPod, a Rubics cube, a singing plastic trophy fish and -- blink and you'll miss it -- a carrousel horse from Walt Disney World. Especially inspired are the two things on this future Earth that are totally indestructible: a cockroach and Twinkies.<br /><br />Stay for the credits. Recalling cave drawings, hieroglyphics, Monet and Van Gogh paintings and early computer graphics, the progressive sequence of art within them sneaks in the history of dialogue-free storytelling.<br /><br />ANIMATED? REALLY?<br /><br />The look of the movie is hard to describe. In one scene, when WALL-E and EVE are investigating a piece of bubble wrap, you can't tell it is an animated film. It actually appears to be live-action. Likewise, the outer space scenes have the same level of realism as any of the [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] movies. The trailing tower of squiggly smoke that's left behind by a launching spacecraft re-creates the Florida sky of a Space Shuttle launch to a T. For the most part, it is only when humans are portrayed that you are consciously aware that what you're watching was generated on circuit boards, not in cameras.<br /><br />I've seen the movie three times, first in digital projection and then from a film projector. The digital showing was much sharper, which made all the realistic touches far easier to appreciate.<br /><br />MOVIE REFERENCES<br /><br />It's obvious the Pixar folks are movie lovers; there are so many cinematic inspirations in WALL-E that I lost count. The \\"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\\" sequence from [[ASIN:B00005JL1P Hello, Dolly!]] shows up -- literally -- maybe half a dozen times. (Disney World fans may also remember the song as one of the background melodies along Main Street U.S.A.) The Axiom spaceship's computer is clearly an homage to HAL from [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001: A Space Odyssey]]; that film's signature overture \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" plays at a key moment. WALL-E himself combines the purrs of [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T.]], the attitude of R2-D2 and the moves of Charlie Chaplin. There's a brief reference to [[ASIN:B000VS6R26 Titanic]].<br /><br />OPENING CARTOON<br /><br />The movie is preceded by a Pixar short, \\"Presto,\\" that had the entire audience I was sitting with in stitches. Its plot: When a magician neglects to feed his bunny a carrot, an escalating disaster results. It's so nice to start a feature with a cartoon. I wish other studios still did it. (Disney fans will note the magician's hat is similar to the one used by Mickey Mouse in [[ASIN:B00003CX9W Fantasia.]])<br /><br />Will it ever run out? This continuous font of imagination from Pixar? With WALL-E, it sure doesn't look like it.<br /><br />-- By Julie Neal, author of [[ASIN:0970959672 The Complete Walt Disney World 2010]].lly inspired are the two things on this future Earth that are totally indestructible: a cockroach and Twinkies.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|I like most types of music from classical to Hard Rock and even the occasional Hair Metal.  I have always had a soft spot for Priest and have found something to like about every one of their releases... Until now.    I don't know where to begin.  The music is lackluster, poorly produced, the lyrics are awful - even for this type of metal (you know - Metal Gods, steel wheelin' hell rats and such).  I mean they are terrible.  My 9 year old daughter can weave a tale better than this.    The cheese factor is through the roof with the Gothic 80's keys (and I LOVE keys in all types of music.  I found 1 songs on here that came close to making my best of and that was Alone due to the chorus.  Yikes.

B00008WT49|4.0|\\"Come Away with Me,\\" American chanteuse Norah Jones' first CD, initially released in 2002, was a sensation, but you probably don't need me to tell you that. It won five Grammies, including \\"Best Album of the Year,\\" and \\"Best New Artist,\\" for its vocalist. And it eventually sold more than 16 million records in this country; 39 million, worldwide, making it almost the most popular album ever, just behind the Beatles' work.<br /><br />The album was produced by that living legend, Arif Mardin, who'd previously turned his hand to helping out the likes of Aretha Franklin, and Dusty Springfield; most people agree that he really knows how to showcase a woman's voice.  And Jones' voice: well, that's what the fuss was about, wasn't it?  Sultry, sexy, smooth, smoky.  A jazz/pop voice that's sensual, plaintive, soulful, folksy, and a little bit country.  In short, an album best classified as mellow acoustic pop -- some listeners find it a bit reminiscent of Eric Clapton's [[ASIN:B000002MFE Unplugged]]; which was a big hit in its own right. \\"Don't Know Why,\\" a revealing, introspective, personal number, first track on the album, was also a big hit single.<br /><br />The beautiful young Jones, a native of Brooklyn, New York, is also appearing in the odd movie these days.  But she was born with music in her veins.  She is, as is well-known, the daughter of famed Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar, and American jazz vocalist Sue Jones, and half-sister of sitarist Anoushka Shankar.<br /><br />However, young Miss Jones can't yet be said to swing: best she can do is sway, occasionally. But listen to her take on Hank Williams' country classic, \\"Your Cold, Cold Heart.\\" The girl's got the jazz chops to go yet farther: from any point of view, she's worth keeping an eye on.  If you've worn out the original CD, you might want to replace it with this SACD; the sound's enhanced,if you've got the right equipment.
0756603749|5.0|My boyfriend checked this out from the library (to learn knots for his sailboat ropes) and loved it so much that I got him his own copy :-) He says it is the best knot book ever made! The photos are amazing and super easy to understand, and this book is so useful! It shows ALL types of knots and even shows how to make a net (using a bunch of knots). **This book also came JUST in time for our fishing trip out out on his sailboat - I had never fished before and didn't know how to knot the fishing line onto the hook. This knot book had super easy illustrations for me to understand, and it shows maybe 3-4 handy fishing knots. :-) Very helpful for both me and my boyfriend.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|My God, what are they thinking? The guitar sound is the worst since their 80s pop attempts. The production lacks the professional sheen of their classics both old and new. The lyrics are simply awful.<br /><br />Just to give my metal heroes a little respect, I'll say the playing is generally up to snuff and Rob's singing is fine. But the songs are among the worst they've recorded.<br /><br />This is the most out of touch recording any 'classic' metal band has released since Metallica's St. Anger. I know I already said it, but what were they thinking? Angel Of Retribution was a fine comback. A kick but album. What happened?<br /><br />Priest, if you ever happen to read this, stop trying to reinvent the wheel. As others have pointed out, you don't need to appeal to juvenile interests anymore, and besides, most teenagers these days are into newer bands that take a harder approach to the music and generally a more mature approach to lyric writing. Nostradamus just won't do. Kids won't like it, they'll laugh at it. And most intelligent adult fans you've had for years will be insulted just like me. Silliness is the problem here. You music was never intellectual, but it wasn't silly either. All anybody wants from Judas Priest is to kick mother fu**ing a** in a black leather attitude kind of way.<br /><br />This album should have been written and recorded in the spirit of Hell Bent For Leather, British Steel, Painkiller and Angel Of Retribution. This crap just won't do. Please record again and go out with a bang, not with a wimper.<br /><br />I am so depressed by this thing I would have given this no stars if I could have.

B0016AJU2C|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that I have been an Alanis fan since Jagged Little Pill, which hit the airwaves when I was right in the heart of my own angsty teenage years.  In a way, I feel like Alanis and I have grown up and matured together, as each new album that she released has always seemed to connect so precisely with where I was in my life at that time.  She has always been one of the VERY few artists whose albums I will pick up instantly, on sight, and unheard.  As such, I was very much looking forward to this, her newest release.  Unfortunately, this album strikes me less like a compatriot who has been with me on my journey, than a random encounter on the street with an old friend who I *used* to be close to, but with whom I now have very little in common, and find myself unable to talk to without awkwardness and many lengthy silences.<br /><br />I will dispute previous reviewers who criticize this album for containing too much \\"I\\" and \\"me\\" than previous albums.  I submit that Alanis' lyrical focus has ALWAYS been highly self-referential and very grounded in her personal life experiences.  The key to her popularity is that she takes those very personal issues and makes them IDENTIFIABLE and PARTICIPATORY to her listeners.  Even though I have never had a problem with running into no-smoking signs on my cigarette break (I've never been a smoker), I know EXACTLY how it feels when life hands me a truly ironic piece of pain, and therefore I can sing along with \\"Ironic\\" and own the feelings it describes.  I have also always been a huge fan of Alanis' ability to play with the way in which her words go with her melodies and communicate a precise feeling, even if the sentences don't make any sort of grammatical sense in any form of written or spoken English. ;)  That, at least, is still present in this album...but for some reason, this time, I'm not \\"getting it\\" as well.<br /><br />The thing that this album does differently, which I believe is leading to my disconnection from it, is the fact that, with a few exceptions, the songs here are NOT SINGABLE.  They are do not invite the listener to PARTICIPATE in the emotional experience described in the lyrics.  They are very much performances in the traditional sense, and as such, seem to ask the listener to put them up on glass pedestals and simply admire their brilliance.  There are no defined melodies, aside from those offered by Alanis' voice, and the tempo of the vocals is so unpredictable as to be unsingable.  The heavily electronic dance-pop accompaniments often do more to obscure the lyrics than highlight them, and they certainly do nothing to provide meaningful musical \\"hooks\\" that would make me want to come back for repeated listenings.  There are a few slower tunes, but they, too, lack focus and connection to the listener's experience.<br /><br />I disagree with reviewers who say that Alanis is trying to reclaim her Jagged Little Pill roots.  JLP may have been loud and angsty, but it was never difficult to relate to.  This album give us an Alanis overburdened with the self-reflection of Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, but inexplicably trying to excise it by sounding like Madonna. :P<br /><br />*sigh* I will probably keep listening to this album for a while longer, to see if any of it grows on me, and to try to reclaim that feeling of camaraderie that I used to so treasure from Alanis.  But with all of the wacky synth, and lyrical obfuscation, I'm not hopeful that I will connect with many of these songs.  I will hope that Alanis' next album will represent more of a return to her melodic roots.is the fact that, with a few exceptions, the songs here are NOT SINGABLE.

B0018TLRT0|3.0|My gosh, how many time are they going to re-release this album?  It is a good album but except for the bonus tracks it's an exact copy of the version that was released in 2001.  I was hoping this version contained the original version of \\"Heart of Glass\\" rather than the disco version. The original version is on older cds of \\"Parallel Lines\\" but the sound quality is a little weak.  As far as the videos go, most if not all of them can be downloaded for free off the internet.
0786948523|4.0|The new rules almost feel like a tribute the old days of D&D. Just in concept really. These are just rules and guidelines. You do with them as you see fit. You are the roleplayers. Stop saying that 4th edition is not for roleplayers. Heck look at LARPERs, their roleplay sessions are nothing but beating on each other with foam bats, yet they are role playing. You aren't very imaginative if you can not roleplay using 4th edition rules. Posers.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this CD is not the huge fan as they claim to be. I am sooooooo tired of hearing people compare everything Alanis does against Jagged Little Pill. You people have to move on with your life get over that CD (JLP). That brought Alanis to most of us but it isn't what makes her. As much as I love that first CD It is also my least favorite.  I saw her on tour during her 3rd and 4th CD's and although half the songs in her shows were fron Jagged Little Pill (which really pissed me off) she still has grown with each new CD she puts out.
140130916X|5.0|I loved this book.  It was different enough from the movie to hold my interest.
B0014DBZY2|4.0|I can't believe how much I have become addicted to this album. I first listened to it while driving on the NJ Turnpike, a long, boring trip that I must take twice a week during the school year. About halfway through the album, I thought it was too repetitive or, at least, the songs seemed too similar. But then things clicked. My favorite tracks have to be \\"Two Steps, Twice\\" \\"Big Big Love (Fig. 2)\\" and \\"Tron.\\"<br /><br />This is a great driving album. Enjoy!
B0007LCNKM|4.0|When I first got this CD I thought it was just puffery and couldn't get into it.  Today it clicked for me and I haven't stopped listening to it, though I can't quite say why.  This group needs to watch their step... they're dangerously close to having their music overwhelmed by that chic, hip and... empty ooze that sticks to many irksome indie bands when they get attention.  I guess it's about not being too clever for their own good, staying humble enough to take risks and especially not pursuing polish for its own sake or, worse, cultivating an absence of polish for its own sake.  Get it?
1878424505|4.0|The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz is a very practical and eye-opening book.  It teaches that by adopting the following four agreements: (1) Be Impeccable With Your Word, (2) Don't Take Anything Personally, (3) Don't Make Assumptions, and (4) Always Do Your Best, an ordinary life can be transformed into a magical one, filled with happiness, integrity and love.  I was particularly inspired by the fourth agreement -  \\"Always Do Your Best.\\"  Adopting that agreement supported me in being proactive in each moment of my life, regardless of the task at hand and regardless of the outcome.  I felt alive and passionate even while doing activities I once thought were boring or mundane.     Another practical and inspiring approach to transformation can be found in the work of Ariel and Shya Kane.  Their books: [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]]; [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]]; and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], demonstrate how being present in your life, exactly as it is showing up, leads to satisfaction and well being.  The touching stories shared by the Kanes are supportive of living a magical life, regardless of the circumstances, and without having to work on yourself.  I highly recommend the Kanes' books and The Four Agreements for a simple and practical approach to transforming your life.

B0013HA838|4.0|In scanning the reviews that Amazon has printed I note that the only criticism leveled at the set are the sonics. Oddly enough they don't mirror my reaction.     I should begin, however, with positive  reactions to the set and clearly they are predominant, although I wonder what McVicar was trying to accomplish by moving the action forward to the Regency period. With the exception of a few of the costumes (notably those for the Countess) I tended to forget that we were not contemporaneous with Mozart. This is doubtless due to the genius of the composer. The political aspects of the work do not have any resonance with today's audience, but the morality does. Whatever. If it works then I can live with it and with this glorious cast I have no problems. Persson is a wonderful singer; her Fiordiligi and Sophie are delightful. Any singer who sings this well and looks this good can have the career she wants. Schrott is already on his way to an international career and he keeps his shirt on! Besides his warm and beautiful voice do carry the day--and he can act as well. Finley is the only real known quantity and he delivers. Ten years earlier he was a Figaro or charm and substance. His elevation to the Count is definitely in order. Rinat Shaham's Cherubino was the only unknown quantity to me, but ROH casting have delivered. She is quite engaging and possessed of both acting ability and a lovely voice. Will she have the career that other Cherubinos have had? Time will tell.    Now, my only criticism re the sonics. For long stretches of the secco recits, the harpsichord cannot be heard. The other criticisms that have been leveled sonically would seem to be endemic to live performances and the engineers can't always adjust sound levels as they would in a studio performance. But to the hear the singers chattering on without the usual harpsichord/cello accompiment is irritating and unmusical. It isn't a deal breaker, but it would weigh in as a factor if I could only have one Figaro. You can be sure that in the Rene Jacobs performance on Bel Air there is no problem in hearing the harpsichord. I am surprised that Opus Arte weren't able to correct this in the mixing process. I did write to them and did expect at least a \\"boiler plate\\" reply. Surprisingly it has been silence.

B001ACY8D2|5.0|I normally do not take the time to write reviews on amazon but this cd blew my mind. It's absolutely flawless from beginning to end, and as a previous poster implied, I might just listen to this album before going to bed every night for the rest of my life. I've been listening to Sigur Ros for about 10 years, but this album is a huge step forward in my opinion. Every song is cloaked in the ambience that drew people to this band in the first place.<br /><br />Buy this album now!!
B000002O1Q|4.0|I was on a soundtrack kick for awhile which emerged cause I was looking for some EG Daily music, well I came across this soundtrack really cheap and though there's no EG there's plenty of interesting songs and stories to keep me listening.     A complete 80s creation, Streets Of Fire is dubbed a rock & roll fable and though I remember seeing it as a child I can't recall much of it, but luckily it's sitting on my TV thanx to Netflix and I'll let you know how that goes - as for the songs the two main gems here come from Jim Steinman - the man behind \\"Total Eclipse Of The Heart\\" and the Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell series to name but a few - I love Jim's take on theatrics; everything's a rushing flame of passion and intensity - the two songs on here performed by Fire Inc. (I'll have to do a search to see who that really is) are \\"Nowhere Fast\\" and \\"Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young\\" - high energy duets with a male and female lead and that 80's synth drum and heavy back vocals pushing it to the end - \\"even if you've got nowhere to go/ you and me we're getting nowhere slowly/ and we gotta get away from the past/ there's nothing wrong with going nowhere baby but we should be going nowhere fast..\\" I love it, it makes me feel like a kid; though the middle part of \\"Nowhere Fast\\" (godspeed, speed us away) is a little theatrical even for this campy boy.     The main reason I purchased the CD is because Marilyn Martin is on here - I love her and her booming voice and to kick it all to the curb the song she does on here is \\"Sorcerer\\" written by Stevie Nicks. And as much as I love Marilyn, I love me my Welsh witch as well. Stevie even shows up singing back up and taking a lead on the Marilyn song - and the song itself obviously written awhile ago ended up on Stevie's 2001 album.     A strange ethereal (this is Stevie after all) the lyrics seem to be talking of cocaine addiction but who knows with that woman (Sorcerer / who is the master/ man or woman / in the middle of a snow dream/ Sorcerer/ come inside/ let me put you on ice) Even with Stevie only on the back and side lines the song is just as dramatic sung by Marilyn, and one day I will make that Marilyn Martin comp I've been thinking of.     On top of these three gems, there's the hit single \\"I Can Dream About You\\" by Dan Hartman - though I would prefer the Lisa Hartman version of it; and Maria McKee of Lone Justice doing \\"Never Be You\\" a Tom Petty written number that would end up on Rosanne Cash's album a few years later; and both are genuinely good. There's even \\"Deeper & Deeper\\" by The Fixx pushing the earthy fire ambience of the whole album together. If the film version of Streets Of Fire isn't truly a rock & roll fable, this little collection of a soundtrack certainly has all the elements of one.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Testament really makes a solid return on 'Damnation'. It sounds unbelievably fresh and is very well produced. The best SOUNDING CD of their career, thats for sure. I mean this is crisp and drum heavy. just what the band needed.<br /><br />There isnt much new, but most fans dont want a new direction. Besides, people would only bitch if it was 'different' after such a long hiatus. What i will say is that if you love Testament, especially 'Souls Of Black' and 'Gathering', this CD will not disappoint. To me it sounds like a mix of the 2. Chuck Billy sounds in good form, without the death metal stylings and Alex Skolnick plays some great leads.<br /><br />There is no need to break each song down because this is a TRUE TESTAMENT CD. But the best tracks are 'The Persecuted Wont Forget', with its incredible riff that sounds like 80's thrash sped up, but really hits hard and the track 'Killing Season' is killer as well. to name a few. But If you like their stuff before, you will only like it more now. Not many bands can create one of their best career CD's 20+ years in, but Testament have done just that.<br /><br />It really is a killer CD and well worth the wait.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|For Try This, P!nk opted to continue in the vein of previous singles like \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and bring her music up a rocking notch or two, so she took the help of Tim Armstrong of Rancid, and came up with a damn fine album.     Not quite as meandering as her latest album, this album does have the hippity hoppity fun of dance in songs like \\"God Is A DJ\\" but with the opening rock hit of \\"Trouble\\" and the poppy stylings of \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Save My Life\\" this isn't anywhere near that first album she put out there.     There's even a Peaches duet for crying out loud on the soothing and oh so gritty \\"Oh My God\\"; and of course Pink's raspy laced attitude is everywhere from the searing opener to the ballady closer. To me, Pink is the talent that is going to outlast them all and this is the album that everyone should own.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This movie is hands down one of the best of the last decade.     I'm not one to rate movies, but far too many people are too quick to judge this film. I, like many, went into this movie expecting a swashbuckling thriller, only to find a much more thoughtful piece. The pacing is measured, but perfect for the story - one which is more about 19th century sailing and the bonds of friendship than swords and cannons. Like other movies by Weir, including Gallipoli (I believe this movie to be far superior to that more widely hailed film), it is hard to place this in a single category.     That's not to say there is no action. The movie has quite possibly the most visceral and entertaining ship-to-ship combat scene I have ever seen. This caps a movie that is incredibly detailed and beautiful to watch. Everything from the wardrobe to the knots is near perfect in representing this period, creating an understanding of the place and times that is truly unique. The inherent beauty of 19th century sailing, the dramatic landscape of the Galapagos and the incredible cinematography make for a truly awe-inspiring movie. Add to all this the incredible sound effects and the absolutely perfect score (just go buy the soundtrack, performed by Yo-Yo Ma), and you have a complete viewing experience.     Yet all of this would be for naught if not for the incredible acting of this movie. Crowe and Bettany give succinct and underplayed performances, making their characters truly live. Similar kudos go to all involved, from the recognizable Billy Boyd to a number of relatively unknown actors who make even the smallest roles perfect (witness the character of the young Mr. Blakely or the grizzled, gregarious sailing master).     Historically accurate (this coming from a trained historian), beautiful to the senses and well acted, this movie has become one of my all-time favorites. Admittedly, having mixed reactions after first viewing because of its admittedly slow storyline and accurate recreationof shipboard life, I now watch this movie at least once a month. Just buy the darn thing.     **Just a word on the extras: they are good, but they really didn't blow me away. In regards to how the film was made, they are impressive, but there isn't much on the history or even on the author. It's really a shame, since this movie deserved so much more. While I would recommend buying this edition, buy the cheaper one if you are worried about spending the money.
B000002IO1|5.0|When I first saw the video for Alannah's hit \\"Black Velvet\\" I knew she had something special about her. Her big black unfortunate hair, her tight leather skirts, the way she slithered all over the stage, I just knew she had a bit of Benatar in her. So I ran out and bought this album the minute I could get to a record store.     For the past umpteen years, this album still puts a smile on my face, and I was right, the bulk of the album is actually straight up rock and roll with a tad of blues tinged fun thrown in.     Of course Alannah remains fairly under the radar as her only big hit here is the \\"Black Velvet\\" scorchy ballady rock song; but the album opens with a real rocker, \\"Still Got This Thing\\" and keeps going with ups and downs of rock chunk and funk; \\"Love Is\\" was a follow up single that didn't do much, same with the one real ballad on here, \\"Lover Of Mine\\", which downs Alannah's normally scratchy scath for an upper register and it really touches you, \\"Why does it feel like I'm losing you?\\", of course the guitars kick in as does Alannah's soul. It's really great.     But nothing compared to the straight up rock of the rest of the cuts starting with \\"Kick Start My Heart\\" which would make someone like Great White proud; the pop influences with hooks are all over \\"Just One Kiss\\" and \\"If You Want To\\" until ending with the countrified blues of \\"Hurry Make Love.\\"     This really is one of my favorite albums and I always felt had she thrown another album out right away instead of waiting 3 years, she could've been the Benatar of the 90's. Oh well this debut album did debut at #1 in her native Canada and I think that was pretty impressive at the time.
0385340567|1.0|Fans of Lee Child's Jack Reacher, Beware! Nothing to Lose misleads in every way, for this is not the Jack Reacher we've come to know and love. This Jack Reacher came only to promote his anti-military, anti-Iraq, evil U. S. Government, poor, little, ignorant soldiers fighting an evil, unjustified war opinions, and threw in some trite anti-Christianity, to boot (i.e., all Christians are narrow-minded and cult maniacs). I knew something was woefully wrong when I had to faithfully trudge through over 100 pages before the slightest interesting thing happened. And even that wasn't all that interesting. I suppose it had to happen: Lee Child had the growing audience and a building irritation with the current administration's Iraq involvement. He has done a Jekyll-Hyde with our beloved Reacher, who, in this book, applauds soldiers going AWOL.     I had so looked forward to Child's next book! I'm embarrassed now that I had recommended him to good friends, avid readers, because they most certainly will want to pick up his latest. I will tell them immediately to disregard Child's latest effort(?).    I don't even want to put this on my bookshelf.
B000GY729M|3.0|First, I have two probs with this album; one is the fact that they open the album with the title track then have a little acoustic styled track `enterlude' which you would think is the beginning of the album as the last cut is `exitlude' and is basically just a reprise, so why put a full song on before the `enterlude'?     And the second is there aren't any lyrics in it, and if they want me to sing along, and I know they do, then they should give me a lyric sheet.     Okay, with that off my chest, I like this album. I don't love it, it's not going on my top ten list of all times, but it definitely is better than a lot of the stuff that has not only been released lately but that I've actually bought.     I definitely love the energy of Sam's Town, and the kick off single \\"When You Were Young\\" actually makes me quite giddy. The pseudo classic style of \\"For Reasons Unknown\\" and the music build up to the end is pretty thrilling and reminds me of many bands before.     \\"Read My Mind\\" is probably one of my favorite tracks on the album, and again has that sort of retro feel. Supposedly influenced by Springsteen this time around, Brandon Flowers' vocals remind me more of classic singer Roy Orbison than Springsteen's growl and even the music doesn't seem as Springsteen-ish as it does 80's rock/new wave people like The Fixx or even INXS.     Of course there's a little more rock steam in these pipes than INXS and that comes through on almost every song even the ballads like \\"My List\\" which I like a lot as well. The winding guitar loops of \\"Uncle Jonny\\" and Flowers' voice is cool and once again it reminds me of songs that have come before.     In fact, almost every song reminds me of someone else and it becomes a tad distracting trying to figure out who they sound like in each song. Oh well, I guess I'll just keeping playing Sam's Town until I have all the answers I need.    exitlude
B00005JKHP|4.0|I must admit that I did not see Star Trek during its initial run.  I was only 4 when it started airing in 1966.  I did see it in syndication, and I saw The Animated Series on Saturday mornings.  In 1979, my parents brought cable TV into the house, and it was on one of the Los Angeles stations that I saw my first trailer for Star Trek - The Motion Picture.  I thought the Enterprise looked gorgeous.  So when that December came, I saw the film in the theatre.  It looked like Star Trek - all the people were there, the ship was there (and nicely updated), the basic premise of Star Trek was there.  But it didn't quite feel like Star Trek.  I still devoured it - it was Star Trek, which meant to me that it was still better than the vast majority of junk which showed up on TV and movie screens at the time (and still persists to this day, although SF/Fantasy has made great strides).    Then came the Extended Edition on VHS.  Yes, the added special effects were very nice, but it still didn't feel like Star Trek.    This edition - Star Trek - The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition) - finally gives Robert Wise the chance to do what he wanted to back in 1979 - finish the film he started making.  Gone are the Red Alert \\"beeps\\" and silly computer voice-overs (\\"Intruder Alert!  Intruder Alert!  Location - a sonic shower.\\"), and in its place is dialogue and the familiar Red Alert Klaxon (albeit not as strident as in the series).  The editing has been tightened up and effects put in place to remind you that you're on a starship in space.  All minor tweaks to the film.  That's what it needed.    After 22 years, Star Trek - The Motion Picture finally feels like Star Trek, even while holding to Gene Roddenberry's initial vision of Star Trek as shown in \\"The Cage\\" as opposed to the remaining episodes.  It's not the best film in the series, but it's not the worst, either, and its success at the box office paved the way for the film series.  This is definitely the edition to get.
B000002UB3|4.0|So it occured to me one day that I didn't own a single Beatles CD. Can you even believe it? Arguably the best band in all of rock and roll and not even a greatest hits on my shelf.     Since I'm a tad obsessive when it comes to stuff, I decided I didn't want any run of the mill Best Of, but instead wanted to go through and buy the albums from these boys the way they were originally sent out, so I decided I'd start with the albums that were what many considered to be innovative and the ones I knew I always wanted but never got.     Now my first impulse was to buy \\"the white album\\" but upon closer inspection I realized I wanted Revolver and Abbey Road first. And this week we have been playing this little gem on and off. I    I knew this was one of the last Beatles albums but what I didn't know is that it WAS the last Beatles album ever recorded, Let It Be was released after this but it had already been recorded by the time the boys headed into Abbey Road. I knew I wanted this album the minute I realized \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" was on here as for some reason that is my ultimate favorite Beatles song, I know I'm very strange.     But also on this 1969 masterpeice is \\"Come Together\\", \\"Octopus' Garden\\", and \\"Something\\" to name but a few of the familiar tunes.     A sort darker than the way the Beatles bounced into the world only a mere 5 years before, the reason this band is so important and influential is the fact that those 5 years saw these boys doing what no one had ever done before, coming up with insane and strange mixes to add to the guitar pop they brought to life.     From one direction to another these four boys are remarkable and every single piece of genius is evident on Abbey Road. The songs are more experimental than most of what you hear even today yet they are familiar and long lasting. I sing along with every single song, I feel every single emotion and believe me when you hear me running around screaming \\"I Want You\\" you know it's absolutely stunning!     There are probably more important Beatles albums and perhaps more entertaining albums in the catalog but since this is my very first Beatles ever (a hundred and one years later) I think it will remain a favorite for years and years.
0061191752|5.0|This book grabs you from page 1.   Anyone who thinks they know Gordon Ramsay -- even after watching him on TV -- will be taken aback by what they read.   Here is a climb from despair, through mine fields of restaurant kitchens, to the heights of fame and fortune.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|Not many people do music like this anymore; you know the over the top heavy metal grunge hybrid that was so popular with kids in the late 90s, Live is gone, Candlebox has been snuffed out and yet Evanescence not only continues to do this type of music, they sell millions of gazillions of CDs doing it. Of course they do have the angst ridden Amy Lee to lead them, something those other bands never had.     Despite myself I really like Evanescence, the first album blew me away due to the fact that I didn't think it would ever get more than a passing glance on my CD shelf, but every now and then it ends up back on the stereo. So I figured I'd take a shot and get The Open Door. If you liked the first album, you're going to like this one. There's nothing new from the band, perhaps the songs are a tad more personal on the lyrical level, but Amy studied her Tori Amos lyric sheets and is a princess in training at lyrical ambiguity.     I can tell by her overpowering vocals and the band's rigid jumble of quiet guitars, louder and louder guitars and pounding drums that they are in pain, it's just hard to relate to what that pain is sometimes. Sometimes it's obvious, the first single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" couldn't be more direct, however that's the title, the lyrics aren't quite as simplistic, but it's still a really good songs.     In fact all the songs are really good, they're all heart wrenching and dripping with emotion, it's just that as a whole; the package can burn you out. 13 songs of bombastic woes and pain is a little too much for my little blonde head, but should I ever have a fight with my lovah, this one's going on the stereo and playing very loud.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Not listening to radio much these days due to the appalling lack of quality of 99% of the material aired, I was first captured by the opening riff on \\"Mercy,\\" which was playing on a co-worker's XM radio. At first I was put off by Duffy's warbly vibrato, but after hearing the song several times, I bought the CD.    This a pop gem, with great production, strong songs and Duffy's unusual and amazing voice. The lyrics may not break new ground, but oft-visited themes of love and heartbreak are reworked so that, at least, they are not boring.    Props to Duffy and all the production team; the sound is light years beyond the usual \\"loudness control\\" settings that ruin most mixes these days. The sound is open, balanced and everything seems in perfect proportion to Duffy's vocals.    Sweet! Looking forward to her next project.
B00000GUZP|4.0|KooKoo is an album that had me and the masses very confused in 1981 - after the enormous success of Blondie and the latest album 1980's Autoamerican, Debbie went solo and at the time it was a bit of a disappoint for a great number of people. Listening to it all these years later, I can't believe how overlooked this album can be. Utilizing Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic, Debbie went funk and at the time I didn't understand it, but now, boy do I get it.     A deeper more urban version of Diana Ross' Diana (\\"Upside Down\\", \\"I'm Coming Out\\") which Chic had done a year earlier. Debbie kept her New York cool and her attitude, and most importantly her delivery of strange and etheral images. Sure there's a few lackluster numbers, the closing number \\"Oasis\\" does remind you of a Sci fi film soundtrack but so did \\"Europa\\" from Blondie's Autoamerican album.     The production is minimal but that's the Chic brilliance, funk guitars, a few horns and a lot of Debbie's cool voice at the forefront. \\"Backfired\\" is still one of her best solo songs while my favorite the funk/rock fusion of \\"Under Arrest\\" and the uber fabulousness of the rap/white funk/hippity hop \\"Military Rap\\" is so humorous it's completely serious.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I had just about given up hope that REM had one more good CD in them.  Then I heard this.  If you enjoyed early REM run out and get this tomorrow.  I realize this didn't get much radio airplay, but then again what good music does these days???
B000HIVO64|4.0|I love Beck and not just because on a good day people have told me I look like him, which is better than being compared to John Denver which is what the guy who works at the corner cigarette stand tells me all the time while informing each time that it isn't my song he's playing, as in he isn't playing John Denver which he doesn't have to inform me of since I know there's never been a thumpity thump gay mix of \\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy.\\" Oh where was I? Oh yeah, Beck.     I have a great respect for this man, who has been deemed a musical rock genius by many many in the press and I have to agree. Each release has the man mixing and mashing new and exciting sounds while somehow being able to not make it into an electroclash mess. However, the last two albums didn't blow me over - Sea Change was a little too depressing, slow and dare I say boring, while Geuro, just didn't lift out of the speakers like I had hoped it would, but now the man is back with a collection of songs he's been working on for three years - The Information is as good as you've probably heard.     Opening with \\"Elevator Music\\" an electric piece of classic Beck before moving to one of my favs \\"Think I'm In Love\\" which sounds new, yet calmly familiar and most importantly catchy.     In fact, the whole album is very infectious and I love that in an album. \\"Soldier Jane\\" and \\"Nausea\\" are two other brilliant pieces of Beckisms, and the whole thing though containing 15 songs seems to go by before you even know it.     All you can really do is go back and play it again. And I do.     Incidentally, in what I think is an awesome sales pitch, the album doesn't have any artwork instead you get four pages of graph like paper and a book of stickers to decorate it as you see fit. I haven't done it yet, as I was thinking I should save the stickers for future generations but since the whole thing is already opened I may just up and do it.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|For those of us who are avid Coldplay fans and thought (prior to this CD)that there was no way they could top X&Y, we were right. My opinion is that X&Y was their best work to date. My first listen through this album was \\"Wow...this is different\\". Nothing like the previous albums. I wasn't overwhelmed and I wasn't underwhelmed. By my 4th time through it I found that Coldplay had once again captured me with their music. It really made me appreciate their departure from previous works. Why is it that some people just want and expect predictability? Were the Beatles predictable over their career? Viva La Vida was just what I needed from Coldplay but I didn't know it. If you listen to this album on a nice stereo at a good volume four or five times and you're not hooked, then you can go back to listening to the canned Top 20 radio songs. This is a great composition of unique songs. Buy it and enjoy.
B000301YY8|4.0|I didn't want to like James Blunt, I don't know why but I didn't. Perhaps it was my boyfriend loving the video so much - I do get jealous still when he notices other men exist in the world, or maybe it was the fact he was a crictical and air play darling, but once I just gave up and bought the CD I realized for once in the world of music, the people were right.     Back To Bedlam is a really good album, clocking in under 40 minutes, it's just enough heartbreak, mourning and the like; any longer and you may want to kill yourself or someone near you. The lead single \\"You're Beautiful\\" and its haunting video is what captures the world but I ended up liking every single song on this album.     The opening \\"High\\" is a bit of an inspiration at mid tempo acoustic guitar and drums, then onto the single, the beautiful and painful \\"Goodbye Lover\\" which is so simplistic yet so compelling. Those two words could pretty much some up Back To Bedlam and for anyone who thought the hype was well just that, I would ask you to check out the album.     It's not just the ballad heartbreak mania of a \\"sensitive\\" guy but rather some really interesting if not random words and thoughts. A song called \\"Goodbye Jimmy\\" seems to be bidding goodbye to the good ol days of recording in your living room before stardom hits you, which seems a tad premature on a debut album but what do I know? There's sarcasm and bitterness thrown in almost everywhere and you know how much I like that. Definitely worth getting if you haven't already.
0393035158|3.0|My sister (an atheist) gave me (a practicing Catholic) this book and asked me to read it. She said someone at a bookstore thrust it upon her, practically begging her to read it and write a review of it. \\"No one reads this book,\\" he said, \\"but everyone should!\\" My sister doesn't have time to write reviews so she gave it to me. (That's her story and she's sticking to it.)    I have to admit, it's a lot better read than \\"The God Delusion,\\" which I just finished struggling through. Harris is not as angry as Dawkins, and he has a solid background in philosophy, which is conspicuously absent in Dawkins' works. (In their own ways, they're both very good writers, actually, but Dawkins' anger really turned me off.) Harris is erudite, often open-minded, humorous and has a gift for language. He also addresses many of the counterarguments to atheism.    That said, this book has glaring lapses in rationality. Harris is a good thinker on relatively small-scale matters but comes to bizarre conclusions on the big stuff. He's very good transmitting what he's learned about philosophy and neurobiology, but in regards to human history, either his knowledge is spotty, or he wears blinders when he reads. He asserts religion is an almost-altogether evil influence and must be abolished if the human race is to survive. He provides lots of evidence of the evils of religion: the Spanish Inquisition, of course, and the Holocaust (which, though Hitler called Christianity a religion of weaklings was, according to Harris, Christianity's fault because it encouraged Antisemitism). He spends a lot of time on Islamic terrorism. But for every example he raises, another one clearly could be found of religion's good effects: the brokering of peace (the Pope, Jimmy Carter, etc.); the protection of the defenseless (the Jesuits in the New World, etc.); the grass-roots works done by religion in inner-city schools, soup kitchens, hospitals, clinics, leper colonies....    Harris argues that the few good things religious people do is not due to religion's effect on them: that they would still do good if religion didn't exist. So religion gets full credit for its failures and no credit for its successes? Not exactly rational or fair.    The religionist's reply to the Spanish Inquisition example has always been that, in the 20th century, far more innocent people were murdered by atheists (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Mussolini) than by religionists. I give credit to Harris for naming this objection, but his reply is inadequate, to my mind. He says that Stalin and Mao created movements that were religion-like. In other words, these atheist movements were capable of evil because they were really religious movements. But isn't that argument fallacious? Couldn't he, using this method, label anything that weakened his argument \\"religion\\"?    And what about other examples of atheist violence? Marat, who perpetrated the September Massacre during the French Revolution? the Hebertists during the same? These men clearly had little creed other than, perhaps, anarchy. And what about the Bolshevik terrorists? Wasn't the word \\"terrorism\\" first used during the French Revolution and then coined during the Russian?    Do we now have to relabel the international worker's movement a \\"religion\\"? Maybe we should just condemn all gatherings of people (other than at universities, of course).    I remain entirely unconvinced that the world would be a better place without religion. Being religious is an aspect of being human. It's a tool for good or evil, depending on how we exercise our (God-given) free will. You could just as easily argue that art should be abolished because of what the Manson family got out of the song \\"Helter Skelter\\"; or the human family because of child and spousal abuse; or even science, because of global warming, Bhopal and Chernobyl, the ozone layer, antibiotic-resistent germs, the dangers of cloning,...    Harris also seems to have some quite odd ideas on other matters. On page52 - 53, he seems to say that it is okay to kill someone for having dangerous ideas. Could it be that I misread that? But what about pages 192 - 199, where he argues for the morality of torture? or pages 199 - 203, where he writes that pacifism, on the other hand, is immoral? and the long section (pp. 158 - 164) in which he shows complete disdain for opponents to the legalization of drugs - surely a debatable issue? - and blames drugs'illegality on, irrationally but not surprisingly, religion's influence on our society.    At the end of the book, Harris offers his substitution for religion and his cure for the evils of the world: mindfulness meditation. He praises Eastern religions for having invented it and suggests that, if we adopt it, we'll find happiness and become more empathetic and, therefore, more moral. (He seems to see no problem, by the way, in reaching these states by using hallucnogens. Ever study the Mayan and Aztecan civilizations, Harris? They took a lot of hallucinogens, too, and were really into human sacrifice. A connection there? Possibly?)    I myself meditate in the yogic sense as well as pray in the old-fashioned, Christian sense. But if meditation works so well, and the East has had access to it for thousands of years, why isn't the East a happier place? How did Mao, Pol Pot, the Japanese Empire, etc., rise to power? And there are many reports that life in some monasteries and ashrams is often no more admirable than in some of their western counterparts.    I have a lot more to say but, alas, no room. I would recommend this book to others, as long as they're capable of questioning what they read.    Okay, Sis, I've written my review. And I've got a few books to send your friend in reply: William James' \\"The Will to Believe\\" and \\"The Varieties of Religious Experience\\": Stephen Jay Gould's \\"Rock of Ages\\"; Dostoyevsky's \\"The Brothers Karamasov\\"; and a historical movie: Anchor Bay's \\"Amazing Grace.\\" I wonder if your friend will read (and watch)them?
B000A59PMO|5.0|A few months before the second season began, I decided to rent the entire first season of the TV series Veronica Mars, I had watched one or two episodes during repeat season and really got into it, so we spent countless hours hooking up with the kids and their adult counterparts in Neptune, California and believe all the hype cuz this show is really, really good....    set all around teenage Veronica Mars, who's father is the fired Sheriff and now works as a private investigator, Veronica when she's not all sassy and ostresized from the richy rich, also does a little dabbling in the private investigation area - part Beverly Hills 90210, part Pasadena, and part Charlie's Angels - I just love it.     There is a continued mystery through out the first season regarding the death of Veronica's best friend Lily, the daughter of the super rich Kane family - whose son was also Veronica's one time love affair; as Veronica spends the season hanging out with her one friend Wallace, and fighting with just about everyone who used to be her friend, she ends up solving the murder and winning my complete adoration... and now all three seasons are on DVD - so relive those Neptune moments - you'll love it.
0440241413|2.0|I really should have known from the title that this wasn't the book for me. In the immortal words of Eve Dallas, \\"I don't shop; I buy. There's a difference.\\" But I enjoy chick lit, and I've liked other characters who aren't like me, and everybody loves these books (4.5 stars  with over 800 reviews), so I decided to give them a shot.    Rebecca Bloomwood is, as the title states, a shopaholic. She's also a financial writer, though she mostly fakes her way through her job. She's deeply in debt. Mostly, she's a pathological liar. She hides her bills and apparently believes that if she never opens them, she's not liable for them. She convinces herself that she's actually saving money by buying an expensive scarf that's on sale. She stiffs her best friend and roommate on the rent and her share of expenses, but goes out and buys frivolous things on credit anyway. She buys a lottery ticket and is absolutely certain that she's now a millionaire--to the point where she's devastated when it doesn't win, and is sure it must be a mistake.    She decides that the way to get out of debt isn't to spend less; it's to earn more. So she goes about trying to accomplish that by even more lying. And in the end, she succeeds--gets a great job and gets the guy. This isn't a spoiler--you knew it would have a happy ending.    What is a spoiler, but a worthwhile one, if it keeps others from being as disillusioned as I was, is that Becky never learns a darn thing in the book. I'm not at all trying to convince anyone not to read this--obviously it doesn't bother the vast majority of readers--but since expectations have so much to do with one's enjoyment of a book, you should know not to expect Becky to grow or change.    So there are two reasons I didn't like this book:       1. I couldn't sympathize with the main character at all, or even understand her. I've been in debt before--who hasn't? And I've bought things I couldn't afford. But the incessant lying and complete disregard for anyone besides herself made her utterly unlikeable from my perspective. She didn't have any redeeming qualities that I could see. You know, I like stories with characters who start out as unlikeable, then grow and change and develop into someone I can like. But she doesn't. Which leads me to:     2. The structure of the story. It's about a static character. Things happen to her, and she reacts to them. More things happen. She reacts some more. Her problems get solved, but not by her own efforts, rather in spite of them. There's no conflict, no value change, no antagonist. A maxed-out Visa card is not an antagonist.    Periodically, while I was reading, I could appreciate the humor in certain situations, and I enjoyed that while it lasted. It's not the worst book I've ever read, but I'm not going to be in any hurry to get the other Shopaholic books out of my TBR pile.
B0012Q732O|4.0|It boils down to this...the finale is what redeemed this bore.  I was in utter shock in how this movie is presented...it was really strange. The problems I had with this film are:  1. The way they talked  2. The acting  3. Boring scenes  4. Did not have showdown with tiger (false advertisement)  5. The last scene in movie (Kind of voodoo)  And here are the good parts of this film:  1. The stunning visuals  2. The epic final  So I wasn't thrilled but it got their.  So you be the judged of this so-so film.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|It's the movie version of the book by Neil Gaiman, about a star that fell to earth (Claire Danes) and the young man (Charlie Cox) who sets out on a quest to find her.    It's seldom that I think a movie is better than the book it's based on, and that's not really the case here, either, but I did enjoy the movie slightly more. The book is a wonderful fairy tale, but the movie is a vivid rendition of it. It's how I pictured the book as I read it, only brighter, shinier, more alive.    I know I'm not making sense, but it's just a gorgeous fantasy movie, and one that's not dumbed down for the preschool set--you really don't see movies like this very often. I absolutely loved it.
B00008NRI8|5.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are great together. Hugh plays a rich guy who considers only the important things, like which tie to wear. Sandra plays an activist who cares about the important things like saving the community center. Thrust together by Hugh's need for a lawyer, and Sandra's being one, her superior talent and ability dovetail perfectly with his need for someone stable and organized. Working together, they find each other indispensible, except for the fact that Hugh is utterly unconcerned with reality, and drives her insane. She gives him 2 weeks notice and helps him 'find' a replacement (who turns out to be young, sexy, intelligent, and attractive) which makes Sandra jealous in her competitive nature. They finally admit that they love each other and there is no one else for them besides each other. Classic lines include during the private flight in his $2 million helicopter around New York: she says: \\"This is what dreams and alot of money can accomplish. You can use your life for good...\\" to which he responds \\"If only I would..\\"  and  'Like a twisty bobcat pretzel..\\" ;-)  A classic must-own movie. Both stars are stellar, and a great ending.  -Christian
0385340540|4.0|Joel Backman is \\"the Broker\\"--a Washington power broker-lobbyist. Then his empire collapses when a deal collapses involving a hacked spy satellite that nobody acknowledges, and Backman ends up in jail, broke.    Six years later, he's pardoned by a lame duck President, and whisked away to Italy by the CIA. Everyone's after him, including the CIA, though they're more interesting in finding out who kills him than in either killing him themselves or keeping him safe.    So Backman is completely out of his element, under constant surveillance, and kept deliberately short of money and paperwork so he can't run far, even if he tries. But he didn't get to be \\"the Broker\\" by being stupid, either.    This was a fairly low-key suspense book, but I enjoyed the transformation from wealthy cold-hearted power broker to someone who's dependent on others for everything, and who's learning to reevaluate his priorities. It was also quite lovely to revisit Italy.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|As portrayed by Giametti, Adams seems so depressed I'm amazed Adams was able to accomplish anything.    And hearing Brits try to speak American English is very funny.  One actor pronounces Maryland as \\"Mary Land,\\" which always catches the English.  And shooting in Eastern Europe for Philly, etc. is always a joke.  Do producers think we don't notice?  Takes away from reality.      It would be nice for once if HBO used American actors to portray American actors.  or to film movies where they take place.    Stephen Dillon, playing Jefferson, showed no such passion.  I have not read the book yet but I have read bios of Franklin, Jefferson, Lafayette and the characters were real.  What it hints at but does not show is the duplicity of America in its early stages.  Helping England steal Canada from French while begging France for money (helping to bring down the fall of Louis and Marie because the support for the American Revolution drained France's bank).  So much double dealling and the US was not good at paying back it's supporters.    Adams was a difficult person to be sure but this series shows him as a loser and depressive.  I doubt that he was depressive.    Abigail had wits and brains and a voluminous correspondence with Jefferson over the years and had Patsy stay with her before she went on to join her father Jefferson in France.  Adams and Jefferson in their last years wrote extensively and became close.     This series, for all its length, does not capture the passions of the times and just seems another historical drama.    Too bad this was not another Rome, full of intelligence, accuracy and brilliant acting.
B00166996S|5.0|I am incredibly impressed with a band that can sound so great live.  The vocals are incredible, the lyrics amusing, and the riffs energetic.  Muse is somewhat like a peppier Radiohead-- if you are a Thom Yorke fan I suggest you give it a try.  I run to this album, and it gets me going for almost an extra mile :)   Amazon's mp3 downloader thingy kicks the pants off of itunes.  No DRM!
B00138EWZ2|5.0|I have never ever understood RCA's neglectful treatment of Elvis, who was without a doubt their biggest selling star for a while there, and still rakes in millions for them.  I understand the whole \\"Colonel Tom\\" business.  Still, that is PAST history.  They should step up to the plate and rework his catalog with respect and give it some new marketing.  Elvis is still hugely popular and could make them a fortune with a whole new generation.  Dumb people.....    As for the CD....Moody Blue is a sentimental favorite, having been his last album.  As for From Elvis Presley Blvd. Memphis TN, well that and Promised Land are my all time two favorites outside of his gospel and Chirstmas work.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Lost my 1st...Not sure how!  They just keep getting better and better in my opinion.  If you like this one you HAVE to get Viva La Vida!
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I really was a huge Coldplay fan, not the type looking for a second of excitement, falling for the songs with the commercial sound! I really enjoyed their first two albums, overflown with very high quality songs. Even the third album, although a little bit on the commercial side compared with the previous ones, made me still believe in them mainly for songs like \\"Swallowed in the sea\\". I of course was very excited about their fourth baby especially that everybody was expecting so much from their collaboration with mister Eno. Such a big disappointment for me!!! First time I listened to the album I couldn't even believe that I am actually listening to Coldplay! The album it's a big huge mess! It's sounds to me like a novice band, like their were forced to produce this album, like it was a huge effort for them! I heard there was a lot of pressure on their shoulders with this album and this is exactly the way the final product sounds like! Like they were composing songs under pressure, like they were annoyed! Of course I'm up for a change for coming out with something new, for stretching ones boundaries but this album is far far away from doing that! It is a changed Coldplay indeed,   but regrettably I must say, it's a change in a wrong direction! I was so looking forward to seeing them perform live, as I did two years ago, amazing live performance by the way, but this time I think I'm going to skip it! So once again big disappointment, from the number 1 band for me! Still a huge fan and hoping for the better! Meanwhile for anyone reading this review and interested in high quality music, I recommend my actual number 1 band, EDITORS!!!
B000WC3864|4.0|For it to be TRULY ultimate, it needs to include the short WITHIN THE WOODS. It doesn't. So I guess we'll be seeing more of the same in the future.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Leave A Whisper was great.  Us and Them was OK, but few killer tracks.  This new album is powerful and melodic with a good range of tempos.  The vocals are outstanding as usual.  In my opinion, this ranks right up with Leave a Whisper, possibly even better.  If you are going to get it, I would recommend the limited edition with 3 bonus tracks.  \\"I Own You\\" is one of the best tracks on the record and the other 2 are great as well.
0786838655|3.0|What initially attracted me to this book was the whole concept of the ancient Greek gods living in modern day NYC...sorta reminded me of a YA version of Neil Gaiman's American Gods.<br /><br />But what ultimately turned me off was the fact that it's pretty much a Harry Potter rip-off, right down to the character archetypes. The misunderstood \\"chosen one\\" Percy, goofy nerd Grover and smart and straight-laced Annabeth are EXACTLY like Harry, Ron and Hermione respectively, Ares' kids are EXACTLY like the Slytherins, etc. The author is clearly trying to milk the HP cashcow.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's a well-written book and is full of action, and I appreciated the fact that the author touched upon many topics important to kid's lives these days, such as the loss of a parent, enduring the anguish of having to switch schools and putting up with mentally abusive step-parents. And all those mythology aficionados out there will definitely get a kick out of this series...I however, considered it too much of a rip-off and couldn't finish it. Perhaps I would have liked it better had I not already read American Gods and Harry Potter, the two books this book clearly borrows heavily from. But I have, so I didn't.
B000002KXV|5.0|I agree....this album is an all-time winner, totally enjoyable, and should be in everyone's rock/jazz collection......
B000WZAE1I|5.0|There was SO much talk about how this movie was 'Princess Bride' for the next generation- and it was said as if it wasn't up to the task. As if Stardust was a remake of Princess Bride. That sort of talk kept me from seeing the movie for quite a while. I finally watched it last night with my wife and we were both utterly blown away! This movie was one of those movies you're watching and hoping beyond hope that they don't drop the ball in the next scene because 'so far...' it's perfect. They never drop that ball. From start to finish it's one of the best movies I've seen in ten years. All the 'Princess Bride' talk is strictly because it's a fairytale movie- that's pretty much where the line between the two stops. I'd recommend this to anybody at any age. Easily a 'top ten' favorite movie!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I never thought that I would be addicted to a show, but I am. I love the show. I own season 1 & 2, and can't wait for season 3, wish they would release it sooner.
0670020745|4.0|Quite revealing to see a real life example of science supporting the our ability to balance yin and yang.  Not overly well written, but gets the point across. Very applicable to real life, not just for those who are dealing with someone who has had a stroke, but more importantly for those trying to understand the concept of self without the new age fluff in some other books.
B000002KEV|5.0|I was told Made in Japan is considered the ultimate live album by a hard rock band from the 70's.  In the top five live albums from the 70's, with Frampton Comes Alive and Kiss Alive being the only two albums to surpass it.  Made in Japan is actually my favorite of the three.  While it's not perfect, nothing is perfectly really, so that's hardly a reason to complain about the albums *very* few flaws.    Highway Star- probably an improvement over the Machine Head version, but only slightly.  The extended keyboard and guitar solos are nice, but Ian's vocals were pushed somewhat in the back of the mix.  The song packs the kind of excitement you'd expect in a live setting though.    Child In Time- probably the only song on the album NOT an improvement over the studio version.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the band members wanted to give this version more of a Japanese vibe.  I can sense it in the vocals and keyboards.  While that intense guitar solo from the studio version isn't quite as melodic here, it's still really really good.  Who knows, maybe this version will grow on me with repeated listens, and one day I might end up actually preferring it over the In Rock version.    Smoke on the Water- A LOT better than the Machine Head version, because of extended guitar playing, a keyboard jam at the end, and the riff, you know, the MIGHTY POWERFUL GUITAR RIFF, has been changed slightly in the beginning, and it's pretty cool.  My local radio stations in Baltimore and Philadelphia used to play this version about 10 years ago.    The Mule- It starts off with vocals and that dazzling guitar riff, before quickly turning into a drum solo.  An extended drum solo at that, over 6 minutes long.  At least it offers enough fills and energy to make it good enough to never become boring.  You have to understand (all you young people out there) this is the kind of thing rock bands used to do quite often back in the day, especially live.    Strange Kind of Woman- It begins quitesimilar to the studio version we all know very well, before turning into a funky guitar jam that sounds MUCH different from anything I've ever heard the band attempt before.  The vocals and guitar solos seem to be playing the same notes back and forth a few times.  It's very interesting and I love it.  Never knew the band would attempt something like this.    Lazy- Awesome version!  There's keyboards, guitars, and harmonica jams scattered all over the place, and only a little bit of vocals.  This is really a fantastic version.    Space Truckin'- Wow.  A 20 minute track!  The song sounds normal for the first several minutes, and you'll be singing along to the vocals and the riff if you're familiar with the song.  Then it gets all adventurous and mysterious with the guitar jams that sound very unusual in places, and the keyboards that are played at lightning speed.  I was thinking about Alaska and all the huge mountains up there while hearing some parts of the song.    I actually recommend you check out a band called Soft Machine and an album by theirs called \\"Third\\" if you like the jamming on this album.  That band along with Deep Purple were both on the music scene around the same time, and share some similar ideas.  Give it a shot.  As for Made in Japan, YES, it's one of the best live albums from a hard rock 70's band.    UPDATE- June 29th, three days later.  I originally said \\"Child In Time\\" wasn't as good as the studio version, but you know what?  Just because this version isn't as melodic during the guitar jam doesn't mean it's any worse.  The intensity is unbelievable, and I seriously wonder if the Mahavishnu Orchestra deserves the award for \\"heaviest 70's band\\" when Blackmore's guitar solo probably surpasses everything the MO ever did, in terms of sheer heaviness.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I'm at a loss as to why Cloverfield has gotten such wildly varying reviews. This is one of the best \\"giant monster\\" films of all time, and I can only assume that some people are just put-off because it doesn't follow the usual template. The effects are fantastic, but not over used as is the current Hollywood practice. Also, unlike most monster movies, this film is character based, and that's the secret of its success. Make up your own mind... see the movie!
B0018TLRTU|4.0|I can not give this cd 5 stars because it is missing two great songs: \\"Adam in Chains\\" and \\"Heroine\\". Granted, they were minor hits but they are two of Billy's best singles - after the height of his popularity.And they were better and bigger than anything off of Devil's Playground\\"  These songs deserved to be included on here, since this is suppose to be \\"The Very Best of\\".  With that being said, i think \\"John Wayne\\" is excellent and has what it takes to give Billy Idol another hit.  It is one of his few songs that really showcases his great vocals.  I think he has always been under rated as a great vocalist.  This is a great collection of songs.  As I mentioned before, I feel it is incomplete to consider it a very best of. It's pretty much a re release of his last greatest hits package.  But well worth picking up just for the DVD.  Billy Idol used to rule MTV.  Back when they played videos.  If anything, this collection of songs will take you back to a better time, and bring back a lot of fond memories.  I know it did for me.  \\"White Wedding\\", \\"Eyes Without A Face\\", \\"Sweet Sixteen\\", \\"Money Money\\", \\"Rebel Yell\\"---Enough said....
B000Q66PXE|5.0|If you like the HBO shows Deadwood and Sopranos, you'll like this.<br /><br />Acting and writing is top notch, especially for season 1.  Season 1 is amazing.  Season 2 writing is not as good... and they obviously knew they were being cancelled during season 2 and tried to wrap everything up... which they did, but comes across as rushed and unnatural as season 2 progresses.  But season 1 is aces. But this also happened with Deadwood & Sopranos where the storylines weren't as good as they were in the beginning.<br /><br />If you are reading this, you've probably already seem them anyway.  The pricing is a bit steep... might be better just to Netflix them as the extras aren't anything to write home about.  Or just buy season 1 only... nah, if you're buying this, you're probably a collector and need both anyway... heck, you've probably already made up your mind to buy them before you read this, so stop reading and buy it already.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|This is a brilliant and exciting concept-album by Judas Priest. \\"Nostradamus\\" is an excellent choice to direct a progressive Hard-Rock journey.Now this kind of music structure is nothing new. Great bands like \\"DREAM THEATRE\\" and \\"SAVATAGE\\" have been doing this for years. And the truth be told, it takes a really talented band to tell a story, using ALL of the songs on an album. This is why \\"Nostradamus\\" is a 2-CD set. You can't tell the story of a legend in 72 minutes or less! As for the quality of the music on this album; I find it to be superb. Rob Halford still retains the power and majesty of his vocal range. The guitar playing is stellar, and the drum tracks are very creative throughout the album. I find this music to be thought provoking and visionary. This is not party-music, so save the beer and bimbos for another occasion. I look forward to seeing Judas Priest on the next world-tour! 5 stars.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|I give Priest high marks for stretching out, it's just unfortunate that the album turned out so dull. Sound-wise, in the car at least I think these are some of the nicest guitar tones they've gotten to date, but what we have here is something along the lines of an Arjen Lucassen or Dream Theatre project and they're not quite up to it. Some virtuoso \\"special guests\\", particularly on keys and backing vocals, could have made the difference here - but even then, the concept is just too unfocused to really take off.
B0014I4KH6|3.0|Vocally this is a superior album.  The songs are very \\"high schoolish\\" which isn't suprising since the artists is only 17.  I'm looking forward to hear other songs by Ms. Swift as she gets older and begins to write more complex songs.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO has taken the excellent David McCullough non-fiction award winner and adapted it to the screen in a manner that does the book proud.    While the book begins with Adam's birth and early life, the HBO series begins with his brilliant, but controversial defense of the British soldiers who took part in the event known as the \\"Boston Massacre\\".    The series does an excellent job of portraying not only Adams brilliance, but his shortcomings as well and his lifelong dependence on Abigail is treated as the unique and beautiful relationship that it actually was.    Here is a man (and a woman) who dedicated their entire lives to the founding of the country and the system of government that we enjoy today.  They did this at not only great personal sacrifice, but unfortunately to the sacrifice of their children and others close to them.    John Adams was a great man ... Abigail Adams was a great woman.  Together, they had as much or more influence on the early years of our democracy as anyone.  Unfortunately Adam's own prediction that history would say that \\"Benjamin Franklin smote the earth with his electrical rod and out popped George Washington and Thomas Jefferson ....\\" has proven to be all too accurate until now.    I have now read two wonderful books that completely changed my perspective on John Adams' career.  One is \\"Setting the World Ablaze\\" by John Ferling, the other is \\"John Adams\\" by David McCullough.     This HBO mini-series ... the best screen adaptation of a book I have seen since \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is simply the icing on the cake!  Enjoy!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is fantastic, funny, intelligent and full of characters that you either have in your family, or would want in your family.  I went from not even wanting to give it a chance when my husband brought it home, to falling in love, episode by episode, and then mourning when it was over.  I do get comments on my Browncoat t-shirt, which reminds me that the fanbase for this show is very much alive, but I really miss her...and her crew.
B0010358EE|5.0|I ordered this for my husband.  He was really interested in it.  Reluctently I sat down and watched it with him and I really enjoyed as well.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Honestly Ghostface is one of my least favorites, i don't know why but he just is. His debut album is a classic tho and there is no denying that. This is the last of the Wu-Solo albums where RZA handles all of the productions, and that is the reason why the future Wu-ALbums don't live up to the ealier ones because RZA is a musical genius and without his productions, the Wu-Tang Clan would not be the same. This album is a great one, Ghostface flows very well and the production value is top notch(tho it might seem dated now). The only complaint I have is that Ghostface should have had a couple more solo because Raekwon and the rest of the Wu-Tang are on this too much not letting Ghostface show his skills as much as he could. Other than that this is a must buy in my book and a lot better than mainstream rap music by a long long mile.<br /><br />Top 5 Joints<br /><br />1) Iron Maiden feat. Raekwon & Cappadonna<br />2) All That I Got is You feat. Mary J. Blige<br />3) Daytona 500 feat. Raekwon & Cappadonna<br />4) Wildflower<br />5) 260 feat. Raekwon
B000002I53|3.0|Virtuosity that tilts toward easy listening<br /><br />John's Coltrane's genius and inventiveness are on display on this album of public favorites, though little of his edginess. The format is easy-listening four-piece jazz -- sax, drums, keyboard and bass -- and is unlikely to offend or challenge even those unfamiliar with the genre. At least as amazing as Coltrane's wild improvisational flights are pianist McCoy Tyner's rapid fire runs up and down the keys.<br /><br />Not groundbreaking, but there's ear-catching virtuosity here if you're really listeing. Aand not a bad choice for background music at the office or a party.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  I thought the story line and the dance numbers were very funny.  I hope to come across more like this and buy more like this.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|I am very unhappy with Amazon. How dare you sell the Bluray for $16.95 (2 weeks after pre-order) after selling us on the pre-order for $19.95? This is not ethical. In this case you all should never pre-order. In fact pre-ordering is to help the retailer on matters of inventory planning.    People who bought on the pre-order, demand our money back!
0060930349|5.0|I 'ain't' smart enough to see that much of a political slant. Especially early in History, I forget the position the whigs had on immigration.     Forget all that liberal/conservative stuff this book is just a really good, in-depth american history. You cant read it in a weekend. I couldn't read it in a month...but I kept picking it up till I finished it. Considering how big a volume it is and my preference for only reading the 1st third a book. The only explanation that I got through this one is that it is really well written and interesting as hell.     I recommend this book to anyone.
0553288105|3.0|I really enjoyed this book as I've enjoyed all the Asimov books that I've read, but I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by a couple of aspects. The book is divided into three parts. The first part takes place on earth and the third part takes place on the moon.  The second part takes place in the para-universe on the planet of the para-men. The para-men are actually not men at all. They are an alien life form radically different from human beings. At first I got bogged down in this middle chapter but I quickly got into it and enjoyed the story taking place on the alien world very much.  The Gods Themselves is typical Asimov in that there is a lot of intellectual talking and discussion that develop into plot twists between bits of action. However, the major twist that is illuminated at the end of the book let me down (WARNING! spoilers ahead). The idea that it was the grand plan of the lunarites to use the \\"electron pump\\" to thrust the moon out of earth's orbit and essentially turn it into a starship struck me as being a little silly. Obviously the electron pump would be much better utilized as the engine to propell actual spaceships away from the earth and into other solar systems, for those earth-hating-lunarites who wanted to go. The villian's motivation for wanting to move the moon was his fear of coming out of the lunar caves (his agoraphobia would presumable prevent him from traveling in spaceships). C'mon, give me a break.   Secondly, I was disappointed that the aliens weren't more involved in the outcome of the novel. After a very exciting second chapter (an entire third of the book) where we learn about the social structure of this alien society, we never hear from them again. The way the chapter ended, it seemed that the third and final chapter would involve them in overcoming the crises that threatened the universe. But there involvement was very slight.    Aside from these two points, I loved the characters (especially Selena) and I loved thelunar and alien cultures. The sexual and domestic mores that developed and evolved on both the moon and the para-planet are fascinating and very different from earth's.  I felt the book was essentially flawed but still enjoyable and a must read for all Asimov fans.

B00104QSOM|5.0|This would not normally be my \\"type\\" of movie, however I thought it was great. Maybe it was long in spots and didn't need to be but the acting alone was absolutely PHENOMINAL. Anyway, don't listen to what a lot of the reviewers said... I would check it out anyway!
B000M9BPEY|5.0|Visually and conceptually brilliant! A very well written, creative movie that is fun and touching!
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Fun enough for a mindless evening on the couch. The bad guys are, of course, religious (\\"only God should have that power\\"), so minus one star for tired cliches based on a popular but uninformed outlook on reality*.<br /><br />The jumping sequences are interesting, and the bad guys, the Paladins, have some interesting technology for their job. Paladins were responsible, we are told, for the Inquisition and witch hunts ...<br /><br />One wonders how the Paladins did their job before they had this tech, because it would seem to be ... not at all, it being impossible to follow jumpers easily. So that doesn't make much sense. But it's still fun to watch. The protagonist's dad looks like a jerk at first, and perhaps he was, but you feel for him later.<br /><br />There is another part of the story that doesn't make much sense, but it's a spoiler, regarding another family relationship.<br /><br />*(A problem which can, fortunately, be remedied: read Dinesh D'Souza's \\"What's So Great About Christianity\\").
0385340567|5.0|this book is just as great as all of his others...  so worth the time
0143038583|4.0|When I opened this book, I expected something along the lines of the social history of food...but what I got was something much better!<br /><br />Pollan's writing, always self-effacing, humorous and insightful, became the perfect and certainly never preachy vehicle for a painless exploration of exactly what's on my plate and how it got there. Politics, animal rights, organic foods, economics and even mushroom-hunting all make an appearance amid farm machinery and well-cooked, tasty meals. Marvelous!<br /><br />His always-witty first-hand observations of the increasingly tragic state of affairs in American (and perhaps World) farming were not only informative but thought provoking. Visits to the grocery story will never be the same.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anybody who has never set foot on a farm, to those who (like me) grew up surrounded by cows and corn, and to those who simply like to cook and eat...and would like to keep eating.<br /><br />We owe it to ourselves and our world to understand that our foodchains do not begin with the supermarket.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I have to say that if ur a hard core rocker Three Days Grace is the band for you. There second cd release \\"One X\\" is a very powerful cd filled with lots of hits. I have to say this is one of my favorite cds in my collection. Songs like Pain, Animal I've Become, and Never Too Late are very lyrical, emotional, and filled with hard core messages. If u ever felt pain, isolated,etc. u can relate to this Band. Adam and the gang know how to do their music. Yes, their debut self titled album was a success but \\"One X\\" will mark these guys into mainstream stardom. It's a must buy!! You'll enjoy.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This film wasn't what I expected, from what I could glean of it from the cover picture and the blurb on the back of the case. I assumed V had a silent role, and that the film would be set somewhere in the former Communist eastern Europe.<br /><br />Once I watched it, however, I ended up getting much more than I bargained for. In short, this movie can be interpreted as a very stern warning to those who abuse power---and reminds us who gave them that power. John Hurt plays perfectly the megalomaniacal chancellor who is consumed by a desire to control everything in sight, and Natalie Portman does an excellent job of portraying Evey, who first regrets being caught up in the deadly game V plays with his former tormentors, but finally becomes his willing tool.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie has scenes which appear to be based on events in real life, as well as scenes from other movies. The analogy of the chancellor to Hitler is obvious, with the oversized symbol, marching before the platform, effective use of red and black to reinforce the propaganda effect, and the suggestion of a mentality meant to pervade all; the chancellor's chief servants eventually start to turn on each other, with disastrous results to his cabinet, a clear indictment of the infighting which shook the Bush administration to its core; the subway scene near the end, in which Portman cradles the dying V a la Luke Skywalker toward the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\"; the ruling party's infuriation at being parodied, so reminiscent of Fidel Castro's ire toward the late cartoonist Antonio Prohias; the ending with thousands of extras which was based on an actual incident in the former Yugoslavia which resulted in the downfall of Milosevic's regime; and V's disguise, his chivalrous manner, and his expertise with blades, so reminiscent of Zorro. V reminds us in brutally graphic fashion why a gentleman should never hit a lady. The only thing absent from real life is the character who holds to account everyone who took part in the conspiracy which brought them to power; presumably, that is the greatest fear of some of our leaders who've failed us (and you know who you are).<br /><br />As for the plot, I found it easy to follow despite its complexity and the penchant which most British film makers seem to have for dwelling a little too much on drama. About the worst I can say of this movie, however, is that Hugo Weaving as V can be a bit of a motormouth, though an impressively prosy and witty one. We eventually realize that a number of elements are introduced into the plot as it progresses, but the makers of this film do a good job of tying up all the loose ends and bringing the bouquet together, as the villainous party members take to feuding with each other as V picks them off one by one... except for the last, who finds out the hard way what it will be like to live in a changed world in which he is stripped of his power. Can you say \\"emotionally castrating\\"?<br /><br />The crowning virtue of this film is the question of V's true identity. We realize at the end that the question is a moot point, but we still want to see the man behind the mask. But then, V wouldn't want me to spoil the ending, now would he?<br /><br />I fully recommend this film. Control freaks will find it traumatizing, but I daresay the rest of us will find it well worth the price.o account everyone who took part in the conspiracy which brought them to power; presumably, that is the greatest fear of some of our leaders who've failed us (and you know who you are).

B000050FEN|4.0|This is one of my personal favorites because you can go back to it and enjoy it like the first time.  It is gritty, dark and very disturbing however Morgan Freeman, Gwenyth Pawltrow and Kevin Spacey are superb in their roles.  Good dialouge, stylistic and very twisted ending that will get under your skin.  If you have not seen it, rent it and then decide which if it is a movie you can appreciate.

1591841992|5.0|Dan Roam's The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures, is a wonderful instructional manual that teaches you the power of visual thinking in four lessons - introduction to visual thinking, discovering ideas, developing ideas, and selling ideas.<br /><br />Dan explains how you don't have to be a \\"visual person\\" to take advantage of the power of visual thinking. He lays out a specific four step process of visual thinking that anyone can follow. I can't draw to save my life, but I'm already benefiting from following the process and using my crude sketches to capture and work through ideas.<br /><br />This is a practical book that provides you with a set of frameworks for solving the different types of problems you will run into in business. Roam also provides simple to follow rules to help you decide which framework to use to solve your particular type of problem and communicate your ideas to your particular audience.<br /><br />The last section of the book presents an MBA school style lesson. The author presents a walk-through of a complete case study. He demonstrates all the tools outlined in the book and you get to see how one progresses from one tool to the next to first help define the problem, then explore solutions, and then present those solutions to the key decision makers.<br /><br />In the last chapter, the author walks his talk by demonstrating how to create a picture to describe your new visual thinking toolkit to your colleagues. Using a simple sketch of a Swiss Army knife, he summarizes the 3 basic visual thinking tools, the 4 steps of the visual thinking process, the 5 questions that help us open our mind's eye, and the 6 ways that we see.<br /><br />Be sure to check out his creative acknowledgements section in the back of the book. This was the longest I've ever spent looking at an author's acknowledgements.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It won't take you long to read, and your problem solving skills will increase so dramatically, you'll wish you read it 10 years ago.ars ago.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL.E is probably my favorite movie of the year so far. It's original, imaginitive and actually one of the best science fictions movies despite being an animated film. It's also fun while being sweet, charming and romantic.<br /><br />  It's smart as well with how mankind is off getting fat on a ship after they ruined Earth. They are so used to technology doing everything for them that they don't even walk. Hey, it could happen eventually with how things are going lol. Oops I hinted at Global Warming, I forgot that ignorant people say it's a myth so they can continue driving fancy cars and big trucks lol. Anyway Wall-E is one of Pixar's best next to Toy Story 1-2 ,Finding Nemo and that rat movie that I can't spell lol.

B0011NVC98|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CGI just wasn't up to it; it was almost good enough but not quite. And while I loved the bits that stuck true to the original - most of the beginning - the \\"plot twist\\" which took the movie away from the original epic poem was kind of depressing. If it were a normal movie taking place in Viking society with characters named other names and they ended it this way, that would be great; but once again someone had to go take a perfectly good classic and use the \\"brand name\\" to sell a story that bore only loose relation to the original tale.  See the most recent \\"King Arthur\\" for another one of these unnecessary alterations.
0525950079|3.0|I am a Ken Follett fan. I enjoyed his previous book in this series entitled \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" One thing I really enjoy about this book is the descriptions of life in early England. A second is the unusual underlying theme-construction of early English cathedrals. It is obvious that the author has done a ton of research. The big disappointments are the multiple number of plots and the huge cast of characters that, at times, seems to number in the thousands. About mid-book, you realize you may need a guide or program to remember who they are and how they fit in the story.  It is a great book that suffers from too little editing; reducing the number of pages by 200-300 would improve it immensely.

B00154GEFU|2.0|My impression of \\"Phoenix\\" virtually repeats that of their 1982 \\"Asia\\" debut.  These are technical wizards coming together in order to make a pop album.  It worked well a quarter-century ago, but times have changed and this Asia basically has not.  \\"Phoenix,\\" for the most part, could have come out the very next year after \\"Asia.\\"  Instrumental passages are the album's high points, offering small glimpses of big talents.  Wetton's rather unremarkable voice, though matured, remains unremarkable.  The lyrics still get pretty corny.  The keyboard sounds are only slightly updated.  I wonder, did they expect to repeat the quadruple-platinum album sales of yesteryear by basically recycling the album?
B00004YZFR|5.0|I have always heard that it is difficult to make a rock and roll film, let alone one that is also a documentary.  Gimme Shelter is both- a filmed  concert experience but one that also documents those events that take place behind the scenes.<br /><br />This one gives the viewer virtually unlimited access to the Rolling Stones for their 1969 tour of America. We see the Stones as they perform at Madison Square Garden, working in the studio, and checking into hotel rooms. For Stones historians, there are brief glimpses of Ian Stewart- founding member and so called \\"sixth Stone\\", including one of him at the Altamont concert, asking for a doctor to please come to the front of the stage.<br /><br />Some of the most fascinating scenes do not even have the Stones in them. These are the meetings that would take place in the office of famed attorney Mel Belli. Here is where the ill-fated Altamont show would be planned.<br /><br />Last of course, is the Altamont concert. It was here that peace & love would collide with extreme violence with fatal results. Was it the end of an era? Did Altamont somehow symbolize the dawning of a new age in America- one in which Flower Power was replaced by death and destruction illustrated by the war in Vietnam?<br /><br />Perhaps so but at its heart, Gimme Shelter was never intended to be a comment on the sixties nor was it supposed to make some sort of political statement. Gimme Shelter started out as a concert film about the Rolling Stones and it just happened to record something that went very, very wrong.
B00004W3L3|5.0|This album is a stunner, every track is outstanding.  In my experience with Marillion (so far I own this cd and Script for a Jester's Tear), this one really hits the ball out of the park, and it's from this cd where we see Fish and the band really hit their stride.      There is alot to enjoy on this disc, but the real highlights for me are \\"Kayleigh\\", \\"Lavender\\", \\"Childhood's End?\\", and \\"White Feather\\".  If you're at all curious about Marillion, I'd say this is a great place to start.  I highly recommend this cd.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This is a re-review of this movie. I reread The Other Boleyn Girl and I decided to give this movie another chance. But I was able to get it for free this time rather than paying for it.<br /><br />Upon watching it again I'm still not completely sold on it. It's only moved up to three star for me from the original two. I'll say why.<br /><br />It's only loosely based on the book and history. Instead it more focuses on the rivalry between the sisters over the history that was really all important in that day and age. But I still felt that Mary was missing in a lot of the film, as was George, who was so instrumental in the book.<br /><br />Natalie Portman's Anne grew on me in the second viewing, but I still prefer Natalie Dormer's Anne.<br /><br />I'm still horrified that the director had Henry rape Anne. That was totally and completely unnecessary. This man was in love with this woman and I highly doubt he would have done so. That was truly a shame.<br /><br />I also still feel that this movie was rushed in the end. You went from seeing Anne on top to a steep descent to the bottom. And sure, it was quick, but this movie add G's to it.<br /><br />And again Katherine of Aragon should have been given a larger part in this film. Ana Torrent(?) I believe would have been phenomenal in this role had she been given a larger part.<br /><br />The costumes and the sets were amazing though. The colour is real and you almost want to touch. It's like visual eye candy. That's a real redeeming quality to this film.<br /><br />Overall I'd still say I'm going to wait until this becomes cheaper before I invest in a copy of it.
B00026WU64|5.0|Released the year I was born, 1963, \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" became the album which best represents a turbulent time in America.  Put this cd on, for those of us who spent at least a part of our lives in those stormy years, the album evokes a lot of memories, and a lot of feelings, particularly about the America we could've become before Kennedy fell, before Viet Nam, before King fell, before we lost our innocense.      The first track \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" became the anthem of the day, redone and popularized by Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Yet the original carries such weight that did not carry over.  \\"Girl from the North Country\\" is a peaceful sort of ballad, whose lyrics will remind you just briefly of \\"Scarborough Fair\\".  Here we have Dylan in his acoustical element, just him, his guitar, and harmonica. \\"Masters of War\\" could've been directed at the White House, speaking directly to those who would go ahead and approve our nation's involvement in a hopeless war. Bluesy \\"Down the Highway\\" is next, perfect in it's simplicity.  \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" starts off with Dylan talking, a bit about the song's origin, \\"written somewhere down the United States\\".  \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" sees Dylan as the prophet, predicting the dark days to come. \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" is another simple song, but gentler.  \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" is an awesome track, Dylan dreams a dream \\"concerning myself and the first few friends that I had\\".  Beautiful, and poignant.  \\"Oxford Town\\" is a country song, about the persecution of a black man.  \\"Talkin' World War III Blues\\" starts off with Dylan dreaming yet again, \\"a bad dream\\", but \\"only in your head\\" says the doctor. Just an ambling sort of song, evocative of Arlo Guthrie.  \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" is a slower sort of love ballad (a soft drum is added to the recording).  \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" is a kind of funny song, but good (once again just Dylan, his guitar, and harmonica).  The closer \\"I Shall Be Free\\" is a story song, classical Dylan all the way, perhaps a bit more optimistic, which is a nice way to end the album.    There's a reason Dylan still registers on the mindset of us Americans who grew up in the 60's.  That's because he spoke truth, life and of all those ordinary things.  I strongly recommend this album.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I had bought this CD because I'd heard \\"Mercy\\" on the radio & HAD to have it & it's one of the best CD's I've bought in a long time! It's truly rare to have a CD/album that I've enjoyed ALL the song's on it-this is one of them!
B0015D3YQI|1.0|This movie could have benefited from so many things.  Acting, Acoustics and Story line were the major shortcomings.  When I read the other review, words like dreamlike and 80's classic horror were used.  Maybe a hallucination but not dreamlike, and defiantly no classic.  I consider the time watching this movie well wasted.
B00140PK6O|5.0|If you love Masterpiece Theater British Productions . . . you will love this! Absolutely Fantastic Story! You just want it to go on and on . . . I'm not going to go into details because that would just spoil the whole experience of watching great actors playing great roles!
0385340567|1.0|This is far and away the worst of the Jack Reacher novels.  While all the stories are implausible, which makes them kind of fun, this one is just too contrived. Child's forte has never been character development, but his two dimensional characters in this novel are the nadir of his writing. I have never been as in love with the military as is his character, whose reasons for leaving the Army are long forgotten, but the iconification of the Military Police is hard to swollow.  The worst problem with this book however, is that it is boring.  The trudge between the towns of Hope and Disaster goes on endlessly.  If I had not been on a boring trip with that being my only book, I never would have finished it.  I would not recommend this book to any but the most die hard Jack Reacher fans who need to plough through to keep their reading record intact.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I found this movie incredibly boring.  The actors were pretty bad and the whole thing was just completely unbelievable.  The only good parts of the movie were the few laughs I got from the guy who was supposedly filming the whole thing making nerdy comments.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter, the movie is now one of my wife's favorites.  The period setting, the romantic story based on the life of Beatrix Potter, the English countryside, the example of good stewardship of the land - this, coupled with great acting, make this a clasic movie. It earns a big 10 on the Wife-O-Meter!
068485743X|3.0|I have to agree with the February 2001 review by \\"A Customer\\":  This book doesn't teach much about writing.  I would go farther and say that some of what it says is either wrong or at least very unhelpful.    One can. of course, empathize with literary agents and editors who are deluged with manuscripts and must move as quickly as possible to extract a few needles of quality from the haystack of junk.  There is value in this book in terms of bringing a writer -- particularly an unpublished one -- some sense of reality as to what he or she faces in the competition for attention.  There is also value in making people sensitive to some of the most common \\"red flags\\" that will kill their chances for consideration.    But I found this book maddening, for a couple of reasons.  First, Lukeman himself has much to learn as a writer.  He writes in an overly elegant, self-absorbed style that should have earned the red pen of any competent editor.  It becomes a little difficult to accept his wisdom about how things should be written when his own product is deficient.  He constantly switches from the first person (both \\"I\\" and \\"we\\") to the second and third person, for example, often within the very same paragraph.  What grated most on me, however, was his addiction to purple in his prose:  \\"If you look back at your dialogue and realize you have scenes that are unsalvageable (like the last example), don't collapse in despondency.\\"  (p. 90).  Collapse in despondency?  Puh-leeze.    The second problem, to me far more serious, is that many of his exercises and proposed solutions to the problems he identifies are either useless or wrongheaded.  For example, to solve the problem of pointless and mundane dialogue (\\"Hi there, how are you?\\" \\"I'm fine, and you?\\" \\"Nice weather we're having, huh?\\") he doesn't send people to reputable sources of help for writing effective dialogue; rather, he suggests that a writer should \\"train [his] ear.\\"  He writes:  \\"Begin to pay attention to how dialogue is used in everyday life by different types of people.  Eavesdrop on people -- in the subway, in a diner, walking on the street, in a store; especially try to eavesdrop on people who might be similar to your characters.\\" (p. 89).      This suggestion is a recipe for disaster.  Writing effective dialogue requires far more sophistication than the aimless guesswork that Lukeman suggests here.  It would be far better for an aspiring writer with problems in this area to spend time with Gloria Kempton's  [[ASIN:1582972893 Dialogue]] or Tom Chiarella's [[ASIN:1884910327 Writing Dialogue]], to name just two helpful resources.    My suggestion, then, is that this book might be worth a look for the insights it provides into the most common mistakes that inexperienced writers may make in writing and submitting their manuscripts, but not for much help in solving these problems (except for those that can easily be avoided, like improper formatting of manuscripts).  Rather, a writer who wants to create a commercially viable work should take advantage of some of the excellent resources available that really get into the hard issues that a writer must confront.      Some of the most valuable books I have benefited from include:      [[ASIN:0898799058 Beginnings, Middles & Ends: How to Get Your Stories Off to a Roaring Start, Keep Them Tight and Crisp Throughout, and End Them With a Wallop]] by Nancy Kress;     [[ASIN:158297294X Plot & Structure: Techniques And Exercises For Crafting A Plot That Grips Readers From Start To Finish]] by James Bell; and     [[ASIN:1582973164 Characters, Emotion & Viewpoint: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting Dynamic Characters and Effective Viewpoints]], also by Nancy Kress.      There are many others, of course, but a writer who thoroughly applied the advice in these three -- provided he or she had the basic ability to write in proper English -- would have a significant leg up in getting into print.
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes provides the reader with the chance to explore the reasons for campus killings plaguing our society. I was drawn to the book because, as a teacher, I've witnessed bullying first hand. A few times I was bullied growing up so I could empathize, but as an adult some bullying goes past the radar.     The book provides the causes of a school shooting, but not solutions. It would be great for this author to write a \\"good news\\" book in which bullying  conditions are resolved - perhaps even at the same Sterling High School of Nineteen Minutes.    Some reviewers have mentioned the book seeming disjointed, but I found the hopping around of events to be enlivening as a reader. It kept me alert. I also felt prepared for the trial of the student murderer by knowing the background of the case.    I absolutely have no complaints about this book - those who criticize are a bit too harsh - the book provides a lot of insight. A great book to read for everyone! Though the results of the bullying were extreme, all people should be aware that bullying is an act of violence.
B0018AK9RK|3.0|2005 saw the reunion of the mighty Judas Priest and vocalist Rob Halford with their excellent comeback album \\"Angel of Retribution\\"; an album that was the best to come from Judas Priest in ages.  The final track of that album, entitled \\"Lochness\\", was a long and experimental-ish dirge that suggested a new direction that the band could possibly go in later on, which they seemingly have now with \\"Nostradamus\\".  A two-disc concept album, \\"Nostradamus\\" just seems to going for an epic, grandoise feel, but instead comes off as more overlong and self-indulgent than anything else.  Standout tracks like \\"War\\", \\"Prophecy\\", \\"Visions\\", and \\"Death\\" really display the excellent guitar work of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, and Halford sounds great as usual, as if the operatic tone starts to wear thin.  As much as I love Judas Priest, some of the tracks featured here, including \\"Sands of Time\\" and \\"Plague and Pestilence\\" among others, just come off as overly campy and dull.  That in itself is disappointing, and while I applaud Priest for trying something somewhat new this time around, the end result is just something that the band as a whole is above creating.  \\"Nostradamus\\" isn't all bad though, and chances are that there will be plenty who will love it for what it is, but for the rest of us, the album ends up being a slight disappointment.
032147404X|5.0|Bought this book to start getting more detailed information about photography. This book helps you to learn some tricks to get better photos, it is a very practical book, the author goes straight to the point when describing what camera settings to use in each situation (aperture, shutter speed, exposure, etc) without going too deep into the physics of how the camera and lenses work. If you are just migrating from point-and-shoot cameras to SLR/dSLR, this book is definetely recommended.
B000E5KJDE|5.0|I love this movie; I had been waiting for it to come out on HD DVD since I first heard high definition DVDs existed.
0790749815|5.0|I've avoided this movie for years.  I don't really know why, but what a mistake!  The storyline may seem tired by today's standards because we've all seen it before.  However, the acting, the lines, and the photography are outstanding... especially the photography!!  There were some scenes such as as when Grant and the traveler are waiting on the bus to arrive that are just breathtaking.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The biggest cry that people make against My Chemical Romance is that they are an emo copy-cat band. They have said time and time again that they originally were this way to get into the industry. However, as they evolved from their first album to their second (VERY easily noticed) their third takes yet another massive step forward as it delves into the realms of classic rock at its best.<br /><br />The biggest and most obvious influences here, notably even mentioned by the band itself in multiple interviews, are three rock masterpieces. These are The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" and Queen's \\"A Night at the Opera.\\"<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's influence is noticable right before you even put the CD in the player. Open up the booklet and the first two things you'll notice are the old newspaper-styled formatting and the photo of the band in black and white \\"death\\" versions of the clothes of the band members of \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" Beyond that, there is notably the very experimental feel in entire album, and some songs even seem to have a gentle yet brilliant anthem-like sound to them.<br /><br />Queen's influence, as well as Pink Floyd's, comes in the overall quirkiness in the album, which can also somewhat be said about Sgt. Pepper's. The track \\"Mama\\" sounds like it could be right off \\"The Wall\\" (no pun intended) both in its sound and its lyrical content as well as possibly taking a certain level of direct inspiration from \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" The final hidden track of the album, Blood, sounds an awful lot like the short but brilliant Queen track \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon,\\" albeit being a tad more vulgar (though offering the same sort of hilarity in the song on both the uncut AND edited versions of the album nonetheless).<br /><br />Where the album stands strong is with its catchiness and its power to hook you in. Even though the first single, \\"Welcome to the Black Parade,\\" was overplayed to the point no one wanted to hear it anymore (similar to with Green Day. I still say American Idiot was a genuine masterpiece), it really does strike a nerve somewhere. It's a powerful song and truly one of the best on the album.<br /><br />Two other singles, \\"Famous Last Words\\" and \\"Teenagers\\" are also among the many highlights on this album. The latter of the two is so catchy that you will find yourself screaming everywhere \\"TEENAGERS SCARE THE LIVING S--T OUTTA ME!\\" The last single, \\"I Don't Love You,\\" is a solid song, but there was a much greater potential in songs like \\"Dead!\\", \\"House of Wolves\\" and the true winner on this album \\"Cancer.\\" The last song mentioned there is especially powerful when you have seen a person die or dying of cancer as the song is told from the perspective of someone with it. It's very grim and very sad.<br /><br />Where many will consider them to be \\"emo\\" is in the overlying and highly prevalent theme of death. However, where this theme is most commonly and strongly used here is in the idea of moving on past death and understanding it better. I personally feel the examination into it is very thorough and almost feels like you're seeing a person's life in your mind as you listen to this album.<br /><br />Overall, as mentioned in the very title, this album is a winner, whether you believe they are \\"emo\\" or not. This is a band with a future and a lot of potential. I, like many others, will keep an eye on them in the future and I highly recommend that if you have not yet picked up this album, do so. You may find yourself with the same sort of fixated eye as myself.<br /><br />*****5 stars*****t anymore (similar to with Green Day.

I fell in love with his complex, finely tuned characters and their chillingly stark universe that manages to be full or surprises. Most other writers fall far short.  His books are not for everyone and certainly not for lazy readers.  You have to pay attention.  There is no spoon feeding in these books.  But the brain work is worth it.  I have been reading science fiction for almost 50 years now and it takes a lot to satisfy me the way these books do.

0679745203|5.0|In reviewing Michael Ondaatje's recent novel [[ASIN:0307279324 DIVISADERO]], I remarked that his narrative technique involved writing short fragments, loosely connected in theme but jumping around in subject and time, and leaving it to the reader to connect them. Such an appeal to the imagination is rare and gratifying, and the results are complex and evocative. If I try to forget the movie, the same could be true of the earlier ENGLISH PATIENT, although here Ondaatje is dealing with a subject of greater historical resonance -- the Second World War in Egypt and Italy -- and the interplay of personal narrative and hard fact is more difficult to bring off than the largely private scale of DIVISADERO.<br /><br />Both books are about people recovering from trauma. In DIVISADERO, the scarring was psychological; here, it is physical as well. The setting is a ruined Italian villa north of Florence, just after the German retreat. It had been used as a temporary hospital, but now only one patient remains, the supposed Englishman of the title. He is attended by Hana, a young Canadian nurse, who has seen so many men die that she can no longer weep the recent death of her own father. She is joined by David Caravaggio, an old friend of the family, a professional thief recruited to work in intelligence, who has had his thumbs cut off during an interrogation. And camping in the garden is Kirpal Singh (Kip), a Sikh bomb-disposal expert, who has only his rigid self-discipline and skills to protect him from disaster. The English Patient himself is an unrecognizable figure, burned all over his body, brought out of the North African desert by Bedouin tribesmen. It later becomes clear that he is not English at all, but a British-educated Hungarian count, Ladislaus de Alm&aacute;sy, an explorer of some renown.<br /><br />Each of the characters is gradually opened out. Caravaggio is the least fully realized emotionally, but he becomes increasingly significant in the back-story. Conversely, Hana's history needs little filling-in, since we see life in the villa mainly through her eyes and feel through her skin. Her relationship with Kip is one of the loveliest things about this rich book, and the Sikh's character is developed in considerable depth, especially as he finds a purpose to his life during his training in England. His work as a bomb-disposal expert is described in always fascinating and sometimes breath-stopping detail.<br /><br />But the most space is devoted to Alm&aacute;sy's time in the desert, his years of patient exploration of the Great Sand Sea and the Gilf Kebir in the 1930s, his passionate but intermittent affair with the wife of a colleague, and his activities during the war itself. These things are dug up gradually, as shards of memory, some relatively objectively, some under the influence of morphia, some that might even be hallucinations. The events of the thirties emerge most clearly, but more recent happenings must sometimes be pieced together from the briefest of references. I am not sure that a fully coherent scenario would ever emerge from reading the book alone, or that it was intended to.<br /><br />Here, of course, I have to mention the 1997 [[ASIN:B0001WTWCO movie]]. Anthony Minghella, the director, has in fact written such a scenario, connecting the fragments into one persuasive interpretation of the novel. Largely focusing on Alm&aacute;sy's story, he has tidied the narrative and greatly compressed the time-frame to create a combination of war story and grand romance with the epic sweep of Tolstoy or Pasternak. The movie is filled with such unforgettable imagery and such strongly-acted characters that his version cannot easily be put aside. But the fact that Ondaatje approved this adaptation does not make it the only possible one, and it is now much harder to enjoy the open-ended quality of his story-telling in its own terms.<br /><br />For those who have seen the movie, the greatest pleasure in the book may come from the elements that Minghella played down: the stories of Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio, and Ondaatje's quiet portrayal of life in the ruined villa. Consider his description of a bonfire of weeds that Hana would gather and burn \\"...during the late afternoon's pivot into dusk. The damp fires steam and burn, and the plant-odoured smoke sidles into the bushes, up into the trees, then withers on the terrace in front of the house. It reaches the window of the English patient, who can hear the drift of voices, now and then a laugh from the smoky garden. He translates the smell, evolving it backward to what had been burned. Rosemary, he thinks, milkweed, wormwood...\\". It is simple writing, but a passage that excites the imagination, involving all the senses, creating its own images in the mind. The whole book will do the same, if you are lucky enough to be able to come to it without preconception.f Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio, and Ondaatje's quiet portrayal of life in the ruined villa.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|Overall, taken as a whole, this is a great cd. The little interludes in between songs are a nice change. I had to listen to it in its entirety to fully appreciate the work put into it. I fully recommend listening to it all at once a few times, then go back and pick out your favorite tunes. There are some really good stand alone songs on here, and I'll put those on my Ipod, but I don't think anyone should judge this in separate pieces. It's meant to be appreciated as a whole. And let's face it: Halford is a metal god.
B00078XGRO|4.0|That's the key question one should ask himself when viewing \\"Star Trek:  First Contact.\\"  In this first solo outing for the TNG crew, Picard and the gang find themselves facing off against the highly popular villains called the Borg.  Having been defeated every time they've battled the Enterprise, the Borg devise a plan to travel back in time to stop a key event in Earth's history and then (big shocker) assimilate everybody.  In a heated and action-packed space battle, the Borg jump through time with the Enterprise E hot on their tale.  The Borg cube is destroyed almost immediately, but this is only the beginning of a fast-paced and highly enjoyable action/dramatic yarn that goes so far as to question a particular crewmember's sanity.<br /><br />While he isn't at the helm of the Enterprise in this film, Jonathan Frakes does call the shots behind the camera.  He takes the screenplay crafted by Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore and blends just enough action into the script to keep the story moving at a good clip.  As much as I enjoy TNG, I do have to say that the series was often weighed down by long and drawn out moments of dialogue.  Frakes puts the brakes on these sequences at just the right time.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart delivers a solid performance as Picard.  Matching him scene-for-scene is Alfre Woodard in an excellent performance as a fish-out-of-water aboard the Enterprise.  James Cromwell proves once again that he deserves bigger roles than the ones he usually gets.  Brent Spiner is sufficient as always as Data and the rest of the crew do an excellent job as well.<br /><br />The music and special effects are also very good.  As stated before, the space battle sequence is amazing.  There's also some zero-gravity action as well.<br /><br />This two-disc set is an excellent addition to any Trek fan's collection (or, in this case, collective).  The special features are a nice treat, and I personally enjoyed the audio commentary from Frakes.  I highly recommend this action-packed space yarn to Trek fans as well as fans of excellent science fiction.o Trek fans as well as fans of excellent science fiction.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Someone left Earth and forgot to turn off the last robot.  Wall-E, who was designed as a trash compactor, seems to be the only moving thing on a dead Earth besides a cockroach.  Wall-E labors each day, gathering trash and crushing into blocks which he's used to build towers as high as some of the remaining skyscrapers.      Along comes Eve, a sleek egg-shaped robotess who's been sent out to find life.  Being a romantic at heart after quietly absorbing old movies for centuries, Wall-E falls immediately in love.     When Eve discovers plant life, everything changes.  She sends a signal to the Mother Ship, which picks her up and is about to destroy her for contaminants.  Then, the Captain and some of the humans are awakened and get into the act.     If you love Charades or Guesstures, you're going to have a lot of fun with this movie.  Dialogue's been replaced by subtle and sometimes heart-rending gestures between the mostly robotic cast.      For the most part, the children in the audience seemed captivated.  \\"Wall-E\\" moved at a smart enough pace to keep the whining and wiggling down to a minimum.  The characters were interesting; however, I felt like Wall-E was pretty derivative of Johnny 5 from \\"Short Circuit\\" (who I enjoyed more) and Eve reminded me a lot of the well-rounded fem-bot from \\"The Jetsons\\" albeit neither had as good a lines as their predecessors. (3.5 stars)     The soundtrack was good. A particular favorite is Peter Gabriel's contribution, \\"Down to Earth.\\" Other highlights were Michael Crawford's \\"It Only Takes a Moment\\" and Louis Armstrong's \\"La Vie En Rose.\\"    Of course, with Pixar you don't just get a movie.  The animated cartoon beforehand, \\"Presto\\" is the tale of a magician and the rabbit who's supposed to come out of his hat. This performing duo had me screaming with laughter and wanting \\"Wall-E's\\" DVD when it comes out just for the cartoon. (5 stars)

B000YAA68W|4.0|\\"Persepolis\\" has the distinction of being one of the four or five books I've read and raved about BEFORE they were turned into acclaimed films.  Just in case anyone's wondering.<br /><br />This film is certainly above average, but I don't think it can touch the two graphic novels.<br /><br />I'm not sure why that is, though.  The same tone and style is used in both, and certainly Marjane Satrapi's creative control infuses both.<br /><br />But the graphic novel was more episodic:  the film bleeds everything together, creating the illusion that it's telling a coherent story.  But the viewer becomes vaguely uncomfortable when he realizes the film isn't telling a coherent story, more of a pastiche.  The graphic novel could get away with this, but the movie can't.<br /><br />Also, the book allowed you to pause, think, and digest.  Movies, by their nature, do not.<br /><br />And the inability to let things sink in before you moved forward definitely blunted the effect of some scenes.<br /><br />There's something I found infuriating, though:<br /><br />That the publishers of this terrific DVD didn't include Farsi subtitles on the disk.  Or any Farsi audio.<br /><br />Oh, it's popular and well-known in Iran.<br /><br />Although the authorities won't let you bring it in to the country, everybody just downloads it illegally.  But they can't get much out of it because Sony Pictures did not deign to include Farsi subtitles, meaning that much of its power is lost back home.  What a shame.  Not everybody speaks English!
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Coldplay has made one of the worst albums I have ever purchased. The previous two albums had me sold that they were one of the greatest bands of all time and they are still owed praises for the incredible work they did. I will remain a major fan of theirs because of those albums. Unfortunately, they have tried to evolve into something very different and pathetic for this album. They were known for loud guitar and piano playing from the lead singer that had soul and a message. They have one song #4 that still echos what made them great, but now all you hear is orchestra and electronic sounds that block out the lead singers voice. They only REALLY have 8 tracks on the album (#1 and #10 don't count because all they are is noise and no singing). They really struggled to put an album together and must of rushed this atrocity to salivating consumers. I will continue to be a Coldplay fan and hope they have a worth buying album next time, but strongly regret buying this album.
B00125WAWS|2.0|Although Denzel Washington directed this capably, with a good feel for pace and timing, the script is predictable and formulaic:  it's really nothing more than another flick about a teacher making a difference in the lives of disadvantaged students, something we've seen a few too many times.<br /><br />The only divagation from the formula is that the students in this film actually want to learn.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|My wife has become incurably hooked on this show and the eclectic cast of characters. It is entertaining to watch as a result of clever writing and convincingly portrayed characters.  The plots are extremely varied even though they all boil down to the same crime scene investigation theme. There are both ongoing story lines as well as satisfactory resolution of crimes in each episode. The person who dreamed up the character of Abbey deserves a gold star and the role is convincingly as well as entertainingly played.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I have tried several dvd's and I have found this to give me the best workout.  It is a bit challenging but I don't know about anyone else but unless I feel like I am challenged at first I will definitely get bored down the road.  The partner workout is a bit of a waste if you ask me.  My husband is rarely home when I workout and if he was I am thinking this is not something he would like to do on a regular basis.  So in the 40 minute workout the warm-up is a bit fast paced.  Don't worry I made it no problem.  When I first did the workout I was worried that if this was the warm-up I wasn't going to make it through the rest.  The other constuctive criticism I would have is to maybe add some better music.  I tend to get in the mood if there is some good music but maybe that is not recommended because it might date the dvd.  Anyways, I highly recommend this dvd to anyone that would like to tone up there muscles and work up a good sweat- not too much but just the right amount of sweat if you know what I am saying.

B000E1ZBH2|5.0|So funny that most the BBC afiocionados not to mention the Jane Austen Society are up in arms over the P&P 2005 version.  The reviews are as condescending as \\"Lady Catherine\\"-- as if the BBC version is above reproach.      So if this version is just SOOOO bad and SOOO not Austen, why did it get universal rave critics reviews (critics as we know can be very nasty), got nominations with BAFTA, got Keira Knightley an Oscar nom and Golden Globe nom and is in a quite a few of top 10 films of 2005? Because its a splendid adaptation in cinema form.      This is what I don't get with all the gripes against it which I have read.  Movies are a different art on its own, so is TV and so are books.    Be thankful that its been well done on the acting level (yes, Keira had moments of being a little too \\"modern\\" but overall was outstanding), cinematography is just gorgeous, score was very classy and the camera work was unbelievable.  The \\"realistic\\" approach was refreshing as well. When I was watching the movie, I felt exactly like how I felt with the Lord of the Rings trilogy-- I was transported to another world, in this case back in time.       Quite a number of the review reeks of condescencion of the highest order.  Get off your high horse.  Appreciate it for the artform that it was adapted in.  Hollywood spews out so much trash that I could not believe that this wonderful romantic film did not have graphic sex and swearing.  We actually need more of these kind of clean wholesome movies.      The BBC was good as a literal interpretation/adaptation of the book.  However, it felt like a play (not a hair out of place on any of the characters) and not the form of media that its supposed to be.  In addition, I found Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth's acting wooden, their lines sprung out of the book verbatim.      In closing, I love, love, love the 2005 version. Yes, it may be condensed and is not perfect by any means.  But as a form of cinema, its one of those rare movies I will enjoy many, many years from now and will be a classic in its own right
B0014KD46W|5.0|It seems as though we forget too easily just how vital Steve Winwood is. His release rate is sporadic, and as the saying goes, `out of sight, out of mind.' Nevertheless, he's been providing us with great music since the British Invasion (yeah, it's been that long) as a member of the Spencer Davis Group, then with Traffic, then Blind Faith, then the revised Traffic, and finally, as a solo artist. His music has always been relaxed and reflective, but with a strong rhythmic drive and a timeless quality that keeps his music relevant through all sorts of stylistic changes. He may not make a lot of records, but he always makes good ones, so it shouldn't surprise me to learn that \\"Nine Lives\\" is as good as it is. The surprise is that it's even better than I had any right to expect.<br /> \\"Nine Lives\\" sounds a lot like second-generation Traffic, with less noodling and more focus. The songs build on blues riffs, jazz, and folk-rock, all coupled with African and Latin influences. There is precision and elegance to virtually every track on this album, without a single extraneous note. It all makes perfect sense, from the nailed down rhythmic grooves to the song lengths, which linger only long enough to make you want more. \\"Nine Lives\\" hearkens back to an era when good music defined our culture, but it doesn't sound the least bit dated or forced. In the best sense, this album could have been released in 1972. With nine tracks passing by in approximately fifty minutes, it's even the right length for a classic vinyl album.<br /> From a topical perspective, Winwood is still relying on the imagery that has served him well in the past. There are lots of metaphors here - flying, drowning (or more specifically, not drowning), raging seas and struggling to find higher ground. He's not a lyrical genius, but the songs are so strong that his words take on a sense of import, and most importantly, he sounds like he really is trying to convey something honestly. Apparently, he still feels as though he's struggling to hang on to something (Relevance? Sanity in a world without pity?), yet the music is never less than relaxed and confident. Is \\"Nine Lives\\" as good as his previous solo albums? Definitely. It is certainly his best record since \\"Arc of a Diver,\\" maybe even since \\"Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys.\\" There is no filler here, just 100% vintage Steve Winwood, and that is better than good enough for me.

B0000549B2|4.0|Bleek Gilliam (Denzel Washington) plays trumpet and leads his own jazz band. Giant (Spike Lee), his manager, doesn't do such a great job, and he has a gambling problem, but they have been friends since childhood. Shadow Henderson (Wesley Snipes) plays soprano and tenor saxophone. He has also known Bleek since childhood, but they are more like rivals then friends--rivals over women and music. Bleek is the bandleader, but Shadow is shadowing him, scheming to start his own band with one of Bleek's women. Left Hand Lacey (Giancarlo Esposito) plays piano, but nobody can stand his French girlfriend. She makes him constantly late and breaks the band rule about no girlfriends in the dressing room. Mainly, they don't like her because she's white, especially Giant, but he refuses to acknowledge his racism.<br /><br />Bottom Hammer (Bill Nunn) hammers down the bottom with his bass. Rhythm Jones (Jeff 'Tain' Watts) is the rim shot tempo man. He is also a drummer in real life, and plays with the Branford Marsalis group that at the time was The Tonight Show with Jay Leno's house band. He quit that gig because he was serious about music. Branford is the one who plays the actual saxophone heard on the soundtrack, and Terrance Blanchard provides the trumpet. They both sound excellent, and the scenes on the bandstand are some of the movie's finest moments. Other scenes have excellent music as well, chosen from the archives of Miles Davis (All Blues, to name one) and John Coltrane. Indeed, they wanted to call the movie 'A Love Supreme' but they couldn't get permission from Alice Coltrane and the Coltrane estate. Hmm. Wonder if Branford ever kicks himself for quitting the Tonight Show gig? Easy money.<br /><br />Washington & Snipes do a good job of acting like they are playing, and acting in between musical interludes. They were coached in how to play their instruments, and though they couldn't really get much out, in the way of sound, they were able to act the part convincingly enough. Denzel even gets in some singing--though it is more like rapping, poetry, or perhaps spoken word with music? He has a good voice, and carries it off splendidly. Washington & Snipes are a great combination of characters, with Wesley like a kind of bleak shadow, an anti-matter doppelganger of Denzel's darker instincts. But Snipes isn't really the bad guy here, he just wants to take one of Bleek's girlfriends, Clarke Bentancourt (Cynda Williams), because Bleek won't even give her a chance to sing, and Shadow wants to feature her in his own group.<br /><br />If there is one sin that Shadow commits, it is that he wants to sell out, to play smooth jazz if it will make more money.<br /><br />Clarke isn't really a jazz singer, but Cynda Williams was signed to record an album for Sony. But the project was shelved. She might have made it as a singer, but because of the movie, Mo' Better Blues, that was supposed to launch her career, she was pushed into a jazz bag. She isn't a jazz singer, and I'm not saying she is a bad singer, she is a very talented singer and the part where she finally sings is very enjoyable. But she is not a jazz singer.<br /><br />Therefore, the fact that Shadow's band which features Clarke flourishes while Bleek's dies a dismal death makes for a very unsatisfactory ending. Smooth jazz? Is there no justice in the world?<br /><br />By the way, his father, Bill Lee, a jazz bass player, also composed music for the film. Sadly, this was the last movie for his son he was able to do that. The film is a heartfelt tribute to jazz, the music of Spike's father. Kind of like his own riff on Song for My Father by Horace Silver?<br /><br />One other thing--Bleek's other girlfriend, Indigo Downes is played by Joie Lee, Spike's sister.<br /><br />John and Nicholas Turturro play Moe and Josh Flatbush, the club owners. John Turturro is really making a name for himself as a character actor, notably in movies by the Cohen brothers. I assume Nicholas is his brother. Theylike numbers, and have some amusing routines. Some critics found these characters a little unsettling and anti semetic, even.<br /><br />Robin Harris, a chitlin' circuit comedian, plays chitlin' circuit comedian Butterbean Jones. Mr. Harris passed away soon after the filming wrapped, and the movie is dedicated to him. Though he provided comic relief, he didn't really fit in with the jazz club as run by Moe and Josh Flatbush. He was an anachronism, like when an extra in a crowd scene in The Greatest Story Ever Told is spotted wearing a wristwatch. Samuel L. Jackson plays a sadistic bill collector for Giant's bookie. Samuel enjoys his work too much.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie though, is when the director (Spike Lee) steps in front of the camera. He is just not a compelling character, but he makes it all about himself. I am struck by the fact that in so many ways he is like Woody Allen. They both like jazz, comedy, and sports, and they both insert themselves into movies they direct. Sometimes to the movies detriment. But I digress...<br /><br />I loved the movie up to about three quarters of the way, but then began the downward spiral. Bleek was not that bad a guy. The punishment didn't fit the crime. Miles Davis, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, did much worse and were bigger jerks than Bleek could even dream of being. As a morality tale, it doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Take Chet Baker. He was hit in the mouth by drug dealers, and lost all his teeth. It took him a few years to get his sound back, but he figured out a way to get a beautiful sound, even though he was old, tore up from the floor up, and lacked teeth. Bleek is super dedicated and lives for his music. But we are supposed to just believe that after one beat down, he could never really play again. Sorry if I spoiled the ending, but the ending spoils the movie. Set your watch to three quarters of the way, stop the tape, and rewind it. Repeat as necessary.<br /><br />The parts where Spike celebrates jazz, the trumpet, the beauty of women, and baseball, are superb. The parts where he takes on issues--race relations, gambling addictions, male/female relations, are half baked. Not that he should never take on issues, but in this movie there were so many issues and so little solutions or insights. He as a director lost control of the material. Do the right thing, Spike. He got in his own way, so to speak. But I am still giving the movie 4 stars, just for the beautiful music in the beginning parts.

0975991477|5.0|Often, personal stories of discovery in books on physics/healing/cosmology, etc, tend to be tedious and self-indulgent. Not so with Bruce Lipton's work, \\"The Biology of Belief\\". Not only are his descriptions and analogies for his discoveries and insights into cell biology and consciusness clear and concise, but one finds oneself swept along through the book by Lipton's own great enthusiasm for his subject.<br /><br />This is a ground-breaking book based on ground-breaking, risk-taking science. I congratulate Lipton on a wonderful work that is intellectually stimulating, enjoyable, and thought-provoking. Lipton is bringing biology into the new spiritual era of quantum theory, and placing the power for our own healing of life and body squarely onto ourselves. A must-read!

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Earth is a wasteland, overrun by human garbage.  For 700 years the only thing left inhabiting the planet is a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class also known as Wall-E.  The trash compacting robot has one small problem, he's developed a personality.  He is curious and lonely.  That all changes one day when the spaceship Axiom leaves another robot on Earth; an Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator also known as EVE.  Wall-E has love and companionship on his circuit boards, but EVE has a more important directive, to find life on Earth.  EVE is picked up by a pod ship of Axiom and the love stricken Wall-E goes along for the ride.    Pixar took a risk in not having much dialogue, in fact there was none until a half hour into the film when we get our first glimpse of humans.  Not having dialogue still made for a funny movie using some inventive humor, but that's not the only funny aspect of this film.  Back to humans, they are pictured as lazy, morbidly obese people who can barely walk.  Not too mention they drift around the Axiom on futuristic looking Laz E Boys.  They have no knowledge of anything that has to do with Earth, even what Pizza is.  Could this be our future relatives?  Let's hope not.      \\"Wall-E\\" is a fun, entertaining movie to enjoy with the family.  Head to your local theater, get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Stylistic, violent, innovative, startling, unexpected and outrageous, Timur Bekmambetov's Wanted has his name written all over it. From its recognizable editing flair to its over-the-top, farfetched action sequences, his film is designed to show audiences exactly what they want to see. And whether or not they anticipate these crowd-pleasing moments, they most certainly don't disappoint. Some may call it nonsense, but Wanted demonstrates just about every awe-inspiring technique that can be utilized to satiate the ever-hungry action-adventure fan.<br /><br />1000 years ago, a secret organization of elite warriors banded together, after recognizing an unparalleled skill. Being able to control abnormally high amounts of adrenaline, these gifted humans can move faster, think quicker, and bend the limitations of physics - and so they became assassins. Dubbing themselves The Fraternity, the small organization let fate decide who their targets shall be, and set out to rid the world of the worst it has to offer.<br /><br />It is the present, and Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is an apathetic jellyfish - a wimp who uncaringly allows others to trample on his life; his boss obnoxiously reprimands him; his best friend is cheating with his girlfriend. Analyzing his pointless existence, he sinks deeper into depression and prescription drugs, simply hoping to drudge through each day as an extant human being. During a routine trip to the pharmacy, Wesley suddenly finds himself the target of a covert assassin, and in the protection of a mysterious tattooed woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />Wesley discovers that his father was one of the most powerful members of The Fraternity, and that he possesses the same skills as the other superior assassins. Finally realizing his purpose in life, Wesley trains with Fox, Gunsmith, Butcher, Repairman, and the leader of The Fraternity, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), in order to fulfill his destiny by killing Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who murdered his father.<br /><br />Wanted brilliantly weaves its story with highly stylized editing (a trademark of revolutionary director Timur Bekmambetov) that involves gratuitous amounts of slow-motion, sped-up shots, scenes in reverse, bullet-cams, and plenty of CG angles, as the camera zips around the unfriendly locales. The visual effects are all spectacular, featuring impressive stunts, car chases, leaping from rooftops, train wrecks and futuristic weaponry. The action sequences are often undeniably extravagant, but Timur is careful to make each one as thrilling and unpredictable as possible. From flipping cars over one another on a highway, or arcing the path of bullets, there is a certain believability, or at least acceptance, of impossible actions within the superhuman world crafted from the graphic novel source material.<br /><br />Jolie takes on a similar role to Schwarzenegger's protective T-800 from Terminator 2, and incites mass destruction with casual ease. Gunsmith (Common) teaches Wesley about anything that fires bullets, The Butcher shows him how to wield a knife, and The Repairman beats him to a bloody pulp. The training sequences yield an impressive sorting of memorable specialists which makes for stunning battle sequences and sanguinary spectacles. It is the violence that really stands out in Wanted, and the fevered visionary tactics by Bekmambetov showcase the most hilariously egregious moments of bloodshed. Portions of the film are incredibly bizarre, and others are white-knuckle thrilling. But with a complex and twisting plot that transcends typical brainless actioners, Wanted delivers nonstop surprises and ceaseless revelations - all involving genuine intensity, strong violence, harsh language, and every other key ingredient necessary for a nearly indefectible action film.<br /><br />- The Massie TwinsWanted brilliantly weaves its story with highly stylized editing (a trademark of revolutionary director Timur Bekmambetov) that involves gratuitous amounts of slow-motion, sped-up shots, scenes in reverse, bullet-cams, and plenty of CG angles, as the camera zips around the unfriendly locales.

0316143472|5.0|Great new book from David Sedaris, very entertaining.  A good time laughing out loud!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Gorgeous visuals, perfected animation, and wondrously epic environments mask a relatively simple story of love, reminiscent of the best of Chaplin and Keaton. Little dialogue is necessary to convey this universal theme, and one of the most memorable characters to grace the screen in recent years comes to life in jaw-dropping realism - WALL-E.<br /><br />The last functioning trash-compacting robot on Earth, WALL-E (voiced by the inimitable Ben Burtt), leads a repetitive, solitary life in a world covered in massive amounts of garbage - the result of which forced mankind to leave its home planet several hundred years prior. WALL-E's lonely life drastically changes when technologically advanced scout droid EVE (Elissa Knight) lands on Earth to search for signs of life. When her objective is inadvertently achieved and she is taken back into space, WALL-E embarks on the adventure of a lifetime in an attempt to rescue the robot he has fallen in love with.<br /><br />With each film Pixar releases, the quality and realism of the animation appears to increase exponentially. Most notable here is the replacement of the animation staple of squash-and-stretch with genuine mechanical motions, and WALL-E's movements rival any found in the robotic effects of live-action blockbusters. It's a true testament to the power of animation when a heartwarming love story can be told without the use of standard dialogue or even a full set of facial features. Both WALL-E and EVE express love, fear, loneliness, surprise, anger, contempt, happiness, and a host of other emotions - and neither one has a mouth, nose, or eyebrows.<br /><br />The infinitely appealing character designs in Pixar's latest are easily the film's crowning achievement, and WALL-E himself is a marvel in both mechanics and innovative visuals. While the characters range from brilliant to truly inspired, the blend of realism with the fantastical produces an odd alternation in presentation. The intricate mechanical creations do provide a considerable contrast with the humans, but the engaging robots possess such a high level of realism that the blobby people don't seem fit to coexist. Add to this the actual scenes of human actors and it feels like three different worlds have collided in the future.<br /><br />With such monumental visuals and astounding animation in a superbly paced epic love story, it's easy to overlook the minor faults scattered throughout the film. The lack of an impressionable villain and memorable supporting characters might have hindered a lesser movie, but both WALL-E and EVE are so perfectly realized one won't likely notice the absence of other engaging creations. Pixar's track record has been virtually flawless since its first feature, and with their remarkable attention to detail and extreme focus on story, it's easy to see why. WALL-E succeeds in setting an even higher bar in animation and CG design and magnificently proves that it doesn't require copious amounts of dialogue to tell a great story.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinscontrast with the humans, but the engaging robots possess such a high level of realism that the blobby people don't seem fit to coexist.

Pixar's track record has been virtually flawless since its first feature, and with their remarkable attention to detail and extreme focus on story, it's easy to see why. WALL-E succeeds in setting an even higher bar in animation and CG design and magnificently proves that it doesn't require copious amounts of dialogue to tell a great story.    - The Massie Twins

B00177Y9ZC|4.0|Science fiction films have always been fan favorites but the pariah of critics round the world. Unless it was some artistic endeavor that happened to step into the world of sci fi, it was scoffed at. That's okay though. While critics dismiss these films of fancy, fans follow them non stop. Such may be the case with this week's release, JUMPER.<br /><br />Hayden Christensen stars as David Rice, a young man who comes from a dysfunctional home where mom took off when he was 5 and dad has clung more to the bottle than David. As he hits teen years, David discovers accidentally that he has a strange ability. David can transport himself from one location to another with the speed of thought.<br /><br />Leaving home, David does what any normal male teen would do. He sets himself up in a cheap hotel and transports himself into a bank vault where he takes money that no one notices until months later. No security breach, no alarms, just missing money. The film progresses from there to David grown into a young man, still transporting from locale to locale, have lunch on the head of the Sphinx, appearing immediately in Paris or stepping out to shop in New York only to hit the stores in London. With the speed of thought, David appears.<br /><br />All seems fine until someone appears in David's apartment. That someone is Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who has shown up to take David down and has the ability (with the help of an electronically charged weapon). With a bit of luck and ingenuity, David escapes and returns to his boyhood home.<br /><br />Once there, David decides to look up the love of his life, the girl who was there when this power first manifested and who hasn't seen him since believing he died, drowned when he was young. Millie (Rachel Bilson) has grown, works in a local bar and still captures David's heart. Taking a chance, he convinces Millie to leave with him to see Rome, a location she's always dreamed of seeing.<br /><br />It is in Rome that David encounters Griffin (Jamie Bell), another \\"jumper\\" who enlightens David. It seems that Roland is the head of an organization called Paladins that have tracked down and killed \\"jumpers\\" from the beginning of time. Their goal is simple to exterminate.<br /><br />Realizing he has put Millie in danger, David tries to escape Roland and his cohorts. But the chances of Millie and David making it out safely are slim to none, even with the reluctant aid of Griffin.<br /><br />A final showdown, the appearance of David's mother and more highlight this action packed sci fi tale that offers hot locals, fantastic effects, great looking shots and a plausible story that features good guys and bad on the move. The film is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA but then it never sets out to be that.<br /><br />Lost in the release schedules of blockbuster films, JUMPER is a solid film that most renters will enjoy. So jump into your local video store and give this one a chance. You'll be glad you did.enlightens David.

B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil's Comalies and Unleased Memories are master pieces. Every last song is perfect. I've listened to both CDs all the way through over a dozen times and loved every song. That has never happened for any other CD for me and both are by the same band.
B0000027I6|4.0|This is Waters best solo album and although it has some flaws is probably the closest he has come to the glory days of Pink Floyd.  Guitar god Jeff Beck guests on this one and helps to bridge the guitar gap missing on Waters albums ever since he split with David Gilmour.  The album is another concept piece mainly revolving around war, politics, and more war.  The themes of the album are as relevant today as when they were written in 92.  Waters tends to be a bit wordy at times and has a tendency to drive his points home probably more than needed, but for the most part this is a solid effective disc.  As with his other solo efforts the album failed to generate a lot of interest at the cash registers.  15 years later he has yet to do another solo album.  It's a pity because I think with each solo release Waters was producing better material.

0792846443|4.0|Originally released in 1990 the Rob Reiner film \\"Misery\\" was based on the bestselling 1987 Stephen King novel. The novel was adapted by the great scriptwriter William Goldman (The Stepford Wives, Marathon Man, All the Presidents Men). The film is apparently a tale about pathological stalking and star worship. However, underlying those obvious horror and suspense vehicles there are some metaphors, surprisingly enough, about colonialism. Producer/Director Rob Reiner and co-producer Andrew Scheinman made some significant script changes in the pivotal scene of this movie that subdues many of the powerful symbols contained in the novel. The central character in Stephen King's novel says some very intriguing things that were omitted from the film adaptation. For those viewers that have seen the central horror scene in this movie the following interpretation asks you to experience it in a new way.  If you're not familiar with it I hope to help you see it twice the first time.<br /><br /> The title \\"Misery\\" is taken from the best selling novel series authored by the fictional central character in Stephen King's novel.  In King's novel and the subsequent movie this central character is named Paul Sheldon, a best selling author who has grown tired of being artistically pigeon holed into writing the \\"Misery\\" series. When the movie opens Sheldon is in a remote lodge in a small town in Colorado completing a new novel that he hopes will free him from writing in the same genre as the Misery series. After completing the novel he starts down a winding road, gets caught in a blizzard and crashes off of the road. A local resident and apparent savior, Annie Wilkes, pulls him from the car that is half buried in snow and begins to nurse him back to health in her remotely located house. At first Paul Sheldon is quite grateful for Annie's efforts to save him. But, after several conversations he begins to realize that she is obsessed with the novel series that he is famous for and in fact had been stalking him right up until the moment he had completed the last novel.<br /><br /> Eventually, we realize that Annie Wilkes is a psychotic stalker and not at all a savior. As the narrative develops Annie becomes more demanding and eventually forces Paul to labor, against his will, over a new \\"Misery\\" novel. Paul is a bedridden captive to a psychotic former nurse who keeps him sedated. She is a frighteningly contradictory persona who simultaneously inflicts sadistic pain and agony, yet assures her \\"patient\\" that she loves him. This type of pathology is most vividly represented in one of the most famous horror scenes in recent cinema. This scene is the pivot point of the entire movie, not just because it is such a cruel act, but also because the dialogue raises several interesting questions that are compelling to answer.<br /><br /> After Annie discovers that Paul has been trying to escape from the bedroom she sedates him and straps him to the bed. When he regains consciousness Annie is standing beside the bed. In one of the documentaries in the new DVD version the Director of Photography, Barry Sonnenfeld indicates that he made a decision to use a 21mm close-up lens on Kathy Bates to emphasize the horror of being close to Annie Wilkes. As she makes her way to the foot of the bed she begins to ask the questions, \\" Paul do you know about the early days of the Kimberley diamond mines?\\" and \\"Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds?\\" she asks. One would assume that if these two were located in Colorado that Annie would be referring to Native Americans. However, there are no additional clues in the film that give us the location of the mines or which \\"natives\\" Annie is referring to. She proceeds to explain the operation of \\"hobbling\\" the native workers that were caught stealing. \\"If they caught them they had to make sure that they could go on working, but they also had to make sure they could never run away. The operation was called `hobbling'.\\" Annie places a four by four block of wood between Paul's ankles and raises a sledgehammer up while Paul pleads with her not to go through with \\"the operation\\". Annie swings the sledgehammer against Paul's foot breaking his leg at the ankle. Amid Paul's agonized screams she moves to the other side of the bed and completes the \\"hobbling\\" operation by breaking his other ankle.<br /><br /> This scene leads us to ask, which native workers is Annie referring to and why is she referring to diamond mines? Why is she referring to a specific diamond mine? The Kimberley diamond mines are located in South Africa. The British under the leadership of 19th century diamond mine owner Cecil Rhodes, did have a practice called \\"hobbling\\" that was used on indigenous African people. Why is there this abrupt geographic disconnect in a film ostensibly set in Colorado? The intriguing questions that this scene raises changes the nature of some of the visual symbols in the film. In addition, along with the added information that the original novel provides the two main characters become more significant than stalker and stalked, torturer and tortured. They become metaphors for the colonizer and the colonized.<br /><br />Annie Wilkes is holding the writer Paul Sheldon captive not just because she is obsessed with him but also because she is forcing him to write another \\"Misery\\" novel. She is extracting forced labor from him and to insure that he continues to provide that forced labor without the possibility of escape she hobbles him. She does this for the same reason that black men were hobbled in South Africa. Annie Wilkes is the portrait of a typically condescending racist colonialist who has a sexual fixation with the colonized while simultaneously viewing them as infantile and needing protection. In an early scene she refers to him being \\"...like a baby...\\" and later in the film she screams at him, \\"...I feed you, I clean you, I dress you...\\" all the while oblivious to the fact that she is holding him as a captive. Particularly striking is the scene in which Annie descends a staircase towards Paul, who is laying on the floor of the house basement, while carrying a pistol in one hand and a hypodermic needle in the other. The shining crucifix that she always wears completes the colonial triumvirate of symbols. Annie Wilkes becomes a startlingly vivid image of the colonial missionary savior with questionable \\"vaccine\\" in one hand and Western power in the other. Both of these given the moral efficacy of the European Judeo-Christian \\"civilizing\\" god.<br /><br />We view Paul Sheldon as a black man in this movie not because we are engaging in an exercise of Jose Munoz style \\"Disidentification\\". We are not projecting Black identity onto a white character. We are reading very deliberate symbols that were placed in the narrative by Steven King and subsequently subdued or muted by the filmmakers. In King's novel Paul Sheldon is particularly fixated on Africa and not just as a distant place but as his savior in some way. This is made particularly vivid in a scene in the novel where he may potentially be rescued by a cop. He has been terrorized for so long that he cannot bring himself to scream. But when he finally does he screams \\"Africa! Africa! Help me! Help me! Africa!\\" Rob Reiner, Andrew Scheinman and William Goldman have omitted many of the more explicit references to Africa and colonialism that were found in King's novel. However, the pivotal \\"hobbling\\" scene in the movie left enough of those references intact to warrant further investigation. The music of Miles Davis has taught me to listen for the use of creative silences. The analytical strategy of discerning profound absence is being applied here to understand the willful omission of key references found in King's novel. These absences beg other questions about the motivations of the filmmakers in a silent way.a four by four block of wood between Paul's ankles and raises a sledgehammer up while Paul pleads with her not to go through with \\"the operation\\".

B0013J30XG|5.0|Speed Racer's opening scenes set the tone for the movie, expertly weaving current and past events into an action packed opening race that, with the stirring score written by Michael Giacchino, just may leave your heart racing.<br /><br />What follows is an entertaining tale that focuses as much on the family as it does on the racing. With a unique and stylistic look, the bright vivid colors, and the beautiful dynamic of the Racer family, the added bonus of the incredible racing sequences makes it a film that promises to entertain girls and boys of all ages.<br /><br />John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Emile Hirsch and Christina Ricci head an excellent and amusing cast, and Matthew Fox turns in an awesome performance as Racer X. As the story moves along, it produces genuine laughs and true thrills. From the sharp turns at Thunderhead to the dangerous passes of the Casa Cristo, each racing sequence \\"gave me goosebumps!\\" Better yet, it culminates in the most exciting and heart stopping racing sequence in the film: The Grand Ol' Prix.<br /><br />With Speed flyin' as he guns the car around the track, how could you not love it?

B0018S6YOE|1.0|I just can't take it anymore.  First of all, Rihanna cannot sing... at all.  I was at a concert, up front, where she was the opening act, and \\"SOS\\" was her hit at the time. Yes, \\"Tainted Love\\" is a great song, and that's what \\"SOS\\" was... a different title of a great song.  Without the aid of a vocoder and the brilliant production team, she would be less appealing than eating chalk.<br /><br />At that concert, she murdered that stupid ballad \\"Unfaithful\\".  Why on earth she would record a ballad knowing that she could never sing it live, is beyond me.  Of course, she did the mike to the audience trick for us to sing her lyrics... because she couldn't!  The mike was pointed at us more than her mouth. I don't know what the sound was, but I was sure kittens were being tortured.  So, I got up covering my ears (right in front of her) and left until she was off the stage.  Sadly, I never found the kittens.<br /><br />ANYONE can be a successful singer today... all you need is one or more of the following ...  ruthless publicity, the right look, extra large appendages, an exposed scandal, be jail bait, have rehab experience, a sex tape, or just flash your cooch to paparazzi when coming out of a car... this means, anyone could have recorded \\"SOS\\", \\"Umbrella\\" etc. and it would have been a hit with the same production team.<br /><br />This is stuff you download.  Not invest money for a CD taking space in your library.  Does this album deserve a new version?  No, but it was done because it was full of a whole bunch of nothing before, and still is.  Except for the abuse of a great Maroon 5 song which is just fine without her, thank you very much.<br /><br />People that buy this CD are programmed.  They are literally told what to like.  If they hear it enough, they will think they like it.  Kind of like Republicans.  If it's on mainstream radio these days, it's all about marketing, not talent.<br /><br />There is major label talent out there that are actually talented, but people and albums like this mess are just a stab in the back of real artists.<br /><br />So, Rihanna, enjoy your money while you have it, but save it.

This is one of those films the critics love to slam but I saw it in the theater and loved it then and still do.<br />Costner is a retiring Navy fighter pilot who has a friend in Mexico (Anthony Quinn) who is a drug lord. Their friendship is outside the drug world, they like to play tennis and hunt. Quinn's wife turns out to be a real babe, who Costner falls for. Thats when his trouble begins. There's a lot of violence so take the rating serious, but by today's standard it's middle of the road.<br />One of the things I really loved about this film is the look of the film.

0312305060|4.0|After finishing \\"The Hours,\\" I perused the critics' reviews on the back cover.  I was sincerely disappointed that all the critics got out of the book was that Cunningham proves the relevance of literature in ordinary life.  Cunningham's in-depth exploration of a day in the lives of three women examines much more profound themes, such as disappointment and satisfaction in daily life, the meaning of happiness, the need to \\"play a role\\" in order to continue regular social interaction, and the feeling of entrapment by one's life.  All of these themes are sincerely considered, and while Cunningham uses Virginia Woolf as one of the means to achieve his ends, \\"The Hours\\" is a work that stands on its own.

The author tells us what this loss implies: \\"My left hemisphere had been trained to perceive myself as a solid, separate from others. Now, released from that restrictive circuity, my right hemisphere relished in its attachments to the eternal flow. I was no longer isolated and alone. My soul was as big as the universe and frolicked with glee in a boundless sea.\\"<br /><br />If you are a dualist, this story will make perfect sense to you. If you are not, you might find yourself asking, \\"Who is telling this story?\\" For example, \\"The now off-line intellectual mind of my left hemisphere no longer inhibited my innate awareness that I was the miraculous power of life.\\" This is a story that must have been invented by the author's now-recovered left hemisphere, since it was \\"off-line\\" at the time. The story is told by a neuroanatomist but don't be misled; it has little to do with neuroscience.  The story is as much an invention as it is a report. How much of the story is confabulation? Is there any way for us, or even for the storyteller, to know? If you are looking for a pleasant fantasy, you won't be disappointed. Look for your neuroscience somewhere else.

0385340567|5.0|I've read and thoroughly enjoyed every Lee Child Jack Reacher novel. In \\"Nothing To Lose\\", Child departs from his well-established form and injects his poltical opinions into the story. This has angered many people who hold different views. My views are opposed to Child's, but Child is entitled to his thoughts as long as he doesn't ruin the Jack Reacher character as, for example, Barry Eisler did with John Rain.<br /><br />  So, figuratively speaking, I just held my nose and enjoyed yet another outing with Jack Reacher.<br /><br />  Reacher is both hero and anti-hero. Child has created in Jack Reacher someone whom I think is one of the most interesting figures in contemporary fiction. Instead of making Reacher independently wealthy in order to pursue his adventures, as so many thriller authors do with their characters, Child gives Jack Reacher a military pension. Since possessions or even a place to call home would tie Reacher down to a specific millieu, Child makes Reacher a wanderer. Instead of making Reacher a superman, Child instead makes Reacher 6'5\\" tall and powerfully built.<br /><br />  Finally, Child has imbued Reacher with intelligence. Reacher thinks - but is still given to violence.<br /><br />  And there is violence aplenty in \\"Nothing To Lose\\".<br /><br />  We find Reacher in Hope, Colorado, somewhere in the eastern plains of Colorado. He is heading west toward San Diego. There is no reason for his journey: just that Reacher got tired of Maine and wanted to go to San Diego. Since Reacher is not one to turn back or retrace his steps, he disregards warnings, and heads toward the next town west, which is name Despair.<br /><br />  Within minutes of walking into town and stopping for a cup of coffee, Reacher is in his violent mode. Reacher will never be a poster boy for the non-violence movement.<br /><br />  The story moves on from there. Despair is quite literally a company town. Its primary industry is a metal recycling plant owned by Thurman who is also the mayor, pastor, landlord and everything else in town. Despair doesn't like strangers and Reacher finds himself quickly (and literally) driven from the town.<br /><br />  Telling Jack Reacher he is not welcome is a sure invitation for Reacher to come back - and leave a trail of mayhem in his wake. Neither Child nor Reacher fail us.<br /><br />  I don't like spoiling the reading pleasure of others, so I generally don't describe plots in any detail and I will not do so here.<br /><br />  This plot is more complex than the norm for Child. There are several subplots which clutter the story and add unnecessary pages to it. Child, I think, would have been well-advised to omit the subplots.<br /><br />  There are a couple of sections where Child introduces his political views, which are very much of the left-wing persuasion and will undoubtedly offend those who don't share those views. But it's Child's story and he can do whatever he wants with it. Personally, because Child is such a strong writer and the Reacher character so compelling, I am willing to forgive Child the error of his ways, hold my nose and read on.<br /><br />  Overall, this is not the most satisfying of the Reacher novels. It is, by no means, bad or unenjoyable. Rather there are too many stories, each essentially independent of the other and resolved only by intuitive flashes of brilliant deduction by Reacher, something that is not unusual for Reacher, but this time it is carried to an extreme. Again, the subplots make this necessary - and the story would simply have been better without them and perhaps a hundred or so pages shorter.<br /><br />  I'm not sure a reader totally new to Jack Reacher would fully appreciate the character without reading some of the earlier books. That's a problem for an author when they have developed a character as strong as Jack Reacher. Do you write for the new reader? Or your fans who already know all about Jack Reacher? I think Child wrote this one for the fans.<br /><br />  Jack Reacher has grown into one of the most interesting characters in modern fiction and despite Child's introduction of his political views into \\"Nothing To Lose\\", this is still a good story and a compelling read.<br /><br />Jerrys introduction of his political views into \\"Nothing To Lose\\", this is still a good story and a compelling read.

B0016MJ6HY|3.0|For years, Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai has resisted the lure of the United States, content to make his films in his native country (with the exception of [[ASIN:B0002X7GZ2 Happy Together]] which was shot in South America) without any Hollywood movie stars. This has changed with My Blueberry Nights which Wong made in America with recognizable names like Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and in her feature film debut, singer Norah Jones. However, Wong hasn't exactly sold out - he made the film independently and it was then distributed by the Weinstein Company. Wong's film debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival to a less than favourable reaction and was quietly given a limited theatrical release and is now out on DVD.<br /><br />Sadly, there is no real chemistry between Norah Jones and Jude Law. It feels like Jones is just saying the lines and not living them. There is no emotional depth to her performance as she tries too hard to act and it shows. In addition, Law is simply not believable as a working class cafe owner. Rachel Weisz also seems miscast, like she's trying out for a boozy, foul-mouthed role in a production of [[ASIN:B000I2JDEY Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and ends up vamping it up way too self-consciously. Wong's weakness is his absolute need to cast beautifully looking people in his films and in this case it was the film's fatal flaw. Natalie Portman is well cast a smooth talking con artist and the only one (aside from David Strathairn) who looks comfortable in her role. With her curly, light brown hair and brash demeanor, she reminds one of Karen Mok in Wong's [[ASIN:B0002X7GY8 Fallen Angels]].<br /><br />\\"The Making of My Blueberry Nights\\" is your standard promotional featurette. Wong says that the film is based on a short film he made years ago and when he met Norah Jones in New York City, he decided to expand it into a film. Wong talks about casting the other roles in the film and the actors speak about their characters.<br /><br />\\"Q&A with Director Wong Kar Wai\\" was recorded at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City on April 3, 2008. He talks about working with singers, his impressions of New York and how the film evolved while he was making it. Wong speaks eloquently about some of the themes of his films and his working methods in this excellent, albeit too-brief, featurette.<br /><br />Also included is a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Finally, there are \\"Still Galleries\\" with evocative location scout snapshots and publicity photographs.\\"Q&A with Director Wong Kar Wai\\" was recorded at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City on April 3, 2008.

The making of - comprised of behind the scenes footage from the film shoot, make up tests, interviews with cast and crew, plus the history of how the film came to fruition - was great. I'm so glad there was an opportunity to conduct interviews with Sydney Pollack before passed away; what an amazing director and all around great guy. The interviews with Dustin Hoffman are also hilarious and insightful.

I've always wanted this book, so was thrilled when I opened it up and saw what it was :)  In my opinion, the matte finish of the pages suit the artwork well. The only painting that might have benefited from a gloss finish is probably the large ladybug one where the body of the ladybug is one shade of red while the background is another shade...if you have this book and know what I'm talking about.

B0014XCMVM|5.0|This album is nothing short of beautiful!  Ananis' songwriting has only gotten better over the years.  Every track is unique, philisophical, and makes you think.  I especially love 'Not as We', 'Straight Jacket', 'Torch' (amazing and actually very sad), and 'Incomplete'.  Again, this release was worth waiting for...can't seem to stop listening to it.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|As a fan since they played dives in Athens, GA, I'll argue there are three distinct rems. The first incarnation put out three hauntingly good albums (chronic town, murmur and reckoning) that reshaped alternative music. The next incarnation discovered the power of the studio and put out well crafted pop albums with a social conscience. Then, the third incarnation put out intelligent experiments in sound that, oddly, lacked any soul and lacked a lot of listeners as well. This latest album moves back into the realm of relevance by moving back in time to rem's second incarnation - mid to up tempo rock tunes with Peter Buck's confident guitar leading the way.     It's good stuff. Not great stuff, but good stuff that's worth a listen. It might help them convert a new legion of fans. As for me, I'll still crave those rough around the edges albums where the lyrics were buried beneath a jangly guitar played as fast as possible. Sure, this is good, but can anything here touch the exuberance of wolves, lower or the beauty of camera. Not in my book.
0805086846|5.0|There's already been much ink shed reviewing this seminal work by Dee Brown on the \\"loser's\\" of the 'Indian Wars' that consumed much of American history in the latter half of the 19th Century.  If you don't feel great rage at the unceasing, genocidal campaign by European Americans upon the lands, animals and people of Native America, then you would have felt right at home among the ranks of Long-Hair Custer's men.  Were I born a native American, there would always be burning deep inside me this rage, but then again to fight is in our blood, to take from other people is wired into our genetic code.<br /><br />There are many elements of this book that recommend a reader new to the subject matter.  First, that there are actually records of the comments and feelings of the native Americans who suffered through the Indian Wars, in the archives of the U.S. Department of the Interior - what a boon to be able to go back and see the other side's perspective.  Raised on a black and white narrative of good guys - the cowboys, or we brave white settlers - against the bad guys - the savage, heathen, idle Indians, most Americans are cheated out of a knowledge of how much despicable savagery was done unto our neighbors in order to take what they had, and strip away their lifestyle and impose our own upon them.  Our history leaves us inside a glass house when we begin to throw rocks at others who commit genocide.  It's not that two wrongs make a right or that we have no right to point out other's atrocities.  But we should all be conscious of the sins and tragedies our forebears visited upon the first nations to occupy the land we love. Perhaps this knowledge is what inspires us to speak out so readily when we are faced with modern genocide.  Not that we always back up our outrage with action, of course.<br /><br />Second, I was shocked that some of the truly admirable military leaders of the American Civil War - Grant, Sherman, Sheridan - were the very leaders of the campaign to exterminate the native Americans.  Precisely those skills, ability and tenacity that made them such effective military campaigners in the War between the States were used to devastating effect against the native population in the decades that followed the conclusion of the brotherly conflict.  War criminals, though, they would be, were they have to undertaken this effort today.  Phil Sheridan stands out in particularly stark relief - to him is lightly attributed the horrifically bestial remark that 'the only good indian he ever saw was a dead one.' If the God that these mean manifestly believed blessed their just causes does exist, then they must be roasting on an eternally rotating spit in the dungeons of hell for the crimes they unleashed on a people who refused to live the life we wanted them to.<br /><br />Third, knowing as many friends as I do in the contemporary native American community, one can only admire the general lack of enmity absent in their hearts.  Life goes on.  For those who survived, there are the every day concerns that all Americans, regardless of skin tone, pursue.  But no one who considers the American people to be a peace-loving, kind, generous and charitable folk should live their lives without knowing the full breath and depth of the depravity that we have been and remain capable of.<br /><br />Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee makes you weep and wish you could go back in time and fight on the side of a people who truly lived the grand American mythic ethic of living lightly on and in harmony with the land, relying on the kind of rugged individualism that we claim as an inherent American trait.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|Compared to the two previous albums by this Jacksonville group, \\"The Sound of Madness\\" provides a much darker and evolved sound that really keeps the Shinedown faithful on their toes! I know that when I first heard this CD, not all the tracks caught my attention right away but the ones that did (The Crow and The Butterfly, Devour, Breaking Inside) really gave a different sound then what I expected! If you're the kind of person that thrives on consistency between albums than you are probably going to be disappointed but the new smell of this album, with Brent's high pitched vocals, and his undeniable energy as a singer, which really engages your listening ears! I have had this CD in the CD player of my car ever since I purchased it Tuesday and have no thoughts of removing it.     There are slower songs like Call Me, Second Chance, and What A Shame, that are more powerful in lyrics and melody than anything else Shinedown has produced, which reflects the total makeup of this album, as it is a little slower in pace compared to previous albums.     For anyone that refuses to acknowledge the quality of this album because of commercial appeal, well then you need to take a second look at why music is made...to entertain and appease! Just because some good rock music is popular is not necessarily a bad thing, especially for the popularity of the band.    On a final note, I highly recommend that you go out and pick this one up because there is a certain \\"Sound of Madness\\" that rings through this disc and you should thoroughly enjoy it, especially loyal Shinedown fans!

IT IS A WELL MADE MOVIE WITH SUSPENSE AND A GOOD PLOT. OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A LOT OF BLOODY VIOLENCE. SOMETIMES I WATCH THE BLOODY, VIOLENT MOVIES LIKE PREDATOR, ALIEN, 13TH WARRIOR, TERMINATOR, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, ALIENS VS PREDATOR ETC. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE. IT IS VERY GOOD. IT IS GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS.

How come stuff like this is not done today? Are the good days truly behind us? Stand out tracks which make this a MUST BUY alone are 'Burn, Lay down stay down, What's going on here, and 'Sail Away'. Sail Away is unlike anything I've ever heard. A truly great song, and a beat so........wicked and menacing in your face.I am already looking at buying Stormbringer, DP's follow up to this album.'Stormbringer', 'Soldier Of Fortune'(Which is I think IS a better song than Stairway to heaven) and 'Holy Man'.........Need I say more?

0783227272|5.0|The film brings to the screen the 1839 Amistad incident when a slave ship experiencing a rebellion was seized by the U.S. Navy and towed into an American port. Subsequently, a trial will commence with the Cuban slavers, the Spanish government, and U.S. naval officers all vying for custody of the slaves while pitted at the same time against those supporting their release and safe return to Africa. The film provides for a very good description of the pre-Civil War era along with people and events slowly tearing at American society and by extension the country as whole.    In contrast to Amazon.com's narrow minded reviewer, Dave McCoy and his failed, off-the-target review, the movie actually does an excellent job of transporting the viewer to 19th Century United States and presenting important people like J.C. Calhoun, Martin Van Buren, and John Quincy Adams, groups like the abolitionists, institutions like slavery outside the USA as well the more \\"humane\\" American version of slavery, notions like Sectionalism, international law/treaties, international relations, the American judicial system, the American political system and much more.  Anthony Hopkins, Morgan Freeman, Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Hounsou, and the rest of the cast, have carried out their performances very well  Steven Spielberg's Amistad is very well written and very well presented allowing for a thought-provoking movie that will provide food for thought well after it is over as it offers valuable insight into a very important period of American History.

B0012GN47C|5.0|On AMIGOS, guitarist Carlos Santana and his band, thanks to the aid of producer David Rubinson, replaced the Afro-Latin polyrhythms with R&B and Mexican folk music influences, the result being a funkier Santana album and a return to the Top Ten for the band. This CD features Santana's personal blues, \\"Europa\\", which has been called his equivalent of \\"Layla\\", the place where the blues truly became his own. Carlos Santana's opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes AMIGOS an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dearly Damaged Dexter....This series takes the idea of the anti-hero to a whole new level. Dexter is humble, self-efacing, darky sarcastic, and quite deadly. He also holds to a high moral code, Harry's Code. Yes, he manages to be a hero & a serial killer. What's more, he is a reflection in the glass of our darker self, the side we may not wish to acknowledge. Like Jonathan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\", this is a dark satirical look at human nature, taken to extremes to bring that darkness into the sun light.<br />Michael C. Hall's performance in this role really bring's Dexter to life, His low key, very human approach to playing a monster with a code is almost enthralling.<br />I am a late comer to the Dexter fan club, but I am eagerly awaiting the next DVD set. I can't wait to see what my favorite monster has in store for us viewers.

I think we enjoy it as much as the first book -- and the fact that we get a change of pace but with familiar characters is an added bonus.  There's much to enjoy in the detailed illustrations as well.  Both books are great!

Though not without its minor flaws, \\"The Searchers\\" (1956) is propelled by John Wayne's ambiguous, complex performance as the embittered Ethan Edwards - his best work for the legendary director.

I couldn't put it down, I needed to know what would happen next.  On my last day I sat at the dinner table and finished cause I couldn't wait any longer, as a approached the end I couldn't hold back the tears any longer. I was literally bawling.  It was such a great book, you learned about each of the characters, you felt their pain and emotions, I almost wanted to reach out and help them.   I hear the movie is coming out and I can't wait. Two of the characters is being played by Cameron Diaz & Abigeal Breslin need I say more...

B0012Q732O|3.0|Coming off some rather poor reviews, I expected failure from this movie, and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that, it drastically improved, and while it didn't succeed as an epic, it was very lively and highly imaginative.<br /><br />Starting with the bad, most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple, being this is 10,000 BC, but the kids (D'leh and Evolet) had these really painfully Arab-esque accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition, but thankfully his dialogue is limited.<br /><br />The minor characters, such as the English-speaking African chief, are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue, and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.<br /><br />Also a major detractment is the narrator, who is mostly completely un-needed save to further some events. Other times, we really don't need to hear him, such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.<br /><br />In the beginning, the special effects are rather poor, as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment, as if they were filmed in front of a green screen, and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.<br /><br />Also, it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English, as they are the only English-speaking tribe in the movie, and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language, with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.<br /><br />The action sequences, costumes, cinematography, and sets were spectacular, and managed to tell the greater story (oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant) in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum, the movie succeeds in macro-storytelling, but fails in micro-storytelling.<br /><br />As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.<br /><br />For one, the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone (since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone), and though the first pyramids were built some 7,000 years after this movie takes place, the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.<br /><br />What? The pyramids are barely half-way completed in the movie, and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler (a tall, godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen; his personal slaves are all blind), leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years, before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids, covering them up completely, or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10,000 BC: only that they were begun, and presumably not completed by the original builders.<br /><br />In all, it's a beautifully done movie, which suffers from poor micro-storytelling. If the total story were in the forefront, and the love story reduced to a subplot, I think it would have been a far better movie.dual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|This is a very interesting CD indeed and one that will likely cause commotion from both sides of the fence.  I think this may an album that takes many listens to get used to it.  It still sounds Coldplayish but there are differences (mainly from the production standpoint).  I am not sure if Eno got the best out of Coldplay that he could have as I think the CD could have been better.  I echo another reviewer that there are not enough songs on this CD, since the first song is mostly instrumental.  I wished they had split up tracks Lovers in Japan and Reign of Love in two tracks as well as Yes and Chinese Sleep Track, since both of these groupings don't seem to go together, but they still stand well alone.  Viva La Vida is among Coldplay's best, but I think what is getting everybody stirred up is that the new songs don't have that catchy, sing-a-long style that we have all loved about Coldplay these past three CD's.  I think over time, though, many will grow to appreciate this album more and more.  And let's face it - it's still better than 99% of other music nowadays.  I hope that in the meantime before the next Coldplay CD comes out (probably in 2010 or 2011), Coldplay will give us a B-side/rarity CD to enjoy.  All in all, I give this 4.5 stars, which one day will probably become a 5 for me.
B0018TLRTU|5.0|This is a must have collection for any true Billy Idol fan. The cd is awesome...love the new songs, but what I really loved are the VIDEOS. The quality of the videos is excellent. Oftentimes these video collections have inferior quality videos...not these. The videos are crisp and have great audio quality. The only downside is I'd love to have ALL the videos! Maybe that will be remedied.

B0014XCMVM|4.0|Review of Alanis Morrisette - Flavors of Entanglement CD      I found this CD a little hard to listen to at first, but it does grow on you the more times you play it.  Alanis has grown-up musically in her new album entitled Flavors of Entanglement.  The transformation of the artist is self-evident in this new album of hers. Some people think of her as the rocker-chick but this album shows her diversity, depth and growth as an artist.  There are certainly a myriad of layers and \\"entanglement of flavors\\" which nourish one's cultural musical soul.  I had to skip a couple of the tracks, but those I listen to are truly great and representative of Alanis's growth as a contemporary artist. Give her a chance.
B0018C7Q5Q|4.0|Can someone please explain how there are reviews for a product that has not even come out yet?  Shouldn't these reviews be for the product offered.

I only rated the movie (which I enjoyed) to get this review uploaded.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar has come of age my friends.<br /><br />Pixar has never made a bad movie, in fact I'd consider almost all of them to be a masterpiece, but none of them, before now, have tried to be anything more then emotional family affairs, not that there is anything wrong with that, but they weren't necessarily deep, meaningful beyond personal issues, or revealed anything about our society. Now, I say again, there isn't anything wrong with that, but Wall-E goes beyond<br />simple family entertainment and becomes Pixar's statement to the world. But Pixar doesn't go Hollywood by bashing its viewers over the head with its ecological message, instead it tells the tale of a species that has lost its way; a people who have allowed themselves to fall into the deception and complacency of a consumer society gone mad. It explores a world where humans can hardly live up to the name, and where man made machines show more emotion, love, and tenderness then do their creators.<br /><br />Eight hundred years in the future Earth is a deserted wasteland. In the year 2110 the planet has undergone a transformation and the once proud civilization which dotted the landscape has literally been reduced to a pile of heaping garbage. Poisonous fumes covered the globe, the plant life died, and all forms of animal life except, of course, roaches perished. But we don't get to see all that, all we see are the devastating effects of the disaster. The bleakness of the landscape will most likely be lost on smaller viewers who will be more then happy to focus on the quirky characters, who I will talk about in a moment, but for adult viewers seeing sky scrapers built entirely of garbage piercing the skyline will send chills down the spine. There really is nothing left of our planet, except of course for Wall-E.<br /><br />Back in 2110 the human race, unwilling to deal with the huge problem that faced them, decided instead to flee the planet and ignore the mess they'd created, leaving behind an army of robots known as Wall-E's to clean up the mess and make the planet habitable again. Unfortunately the task was far too great for the robot army, and as time went by these robots broke down until there is only one left who continues in a hopeless attempt to clean the planet; this last robot we know only as Wall-E, the last of his kind. Human beings have not returned, and yet this little robot continues to clean up our mess.<br /><br />During the day Wall-E spends his time collecting garbage and turning it into small garbage cubes, which he then stacks on top of one another, eventually building tall skyscrapers out of these blocks. When his shift ends however he spends his time collecting trinkets left behind, VHS tapes, jewelry, light bulbs, and things of that nature. He also cares for a pet roach that follows him around everywhere he goes. His routine is broken however when, one day, a spaceship lands carrying on it another robot, EVE, who's mission it is to seek out life on earth. Make a long story short; they fall in love, eventfully leading to Wall-E and EVE returning to the human mother ship, where the human race has been surviving for the last 700 years.<br /><br />It is here that the film makes yet another statement on our society as it exists today. At first there is no sign of human life aboard, the halls are filled with robot activity, but the humans are pretty hard to miss. Gliding around on hover seats, drooling away at heads up computer screens, humanity has become little more then one large lazy mass of blubber, thoughtlessly sipping from super sized drinks and buying products from the ships shopping malls. With machines taking care of every human desire, the need to get up and walk has been taken care of years ago, and so people are content to live their lives slaves to their robot masters, as long as they are kept happy and content. It is a miserable existence, and yet it is all they've ever known.<br /><br />Apart from the strong, but not overly so, messages contained in this film, this is still Pixar, and with that comes a strong emotional story that will make children laugh and adults wipe their eyes. The relationship Wall-E and EVE share evolves and develops as the film goes on, moving from distrust, to mutual friendship, to something of an older sister younger brother relationship, to a romance, all done without any words spoken between the two apart from their names. Wall-E is probably Pixar's most feel good and touching story since Finding Nemo, and for all those Nemo fans out there you that's saying a lot. The characters do nothing but beep at one anther, much like R2-D2 from Star Wars, and yet their story is told more fully then most films. When a film can make you care deeply for characters who don't say a word you know its a good one.<br /><br />Like always the art in this film is amazing. Pixar only gets better and better as time goes by, while other computer animated studios slip farther and farther away.  Its simply breathtaking, but what else to you expect from the masters of computer animation?<br /><br />Wall-E takes Pixar out of the world of simply family entertainment and puts this studio in the same league as famed Japanese studio, Studio Ghibli, who's films ([[ASIN:B0001XAPZ6 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]], [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]]) carry ecological themes as well as being great fun. Wall-E is art of a high level, and transcends the computer animated genera. Its simply a great film.<br /><br />Replay Value; VERY high.<br /><br />SPOILER.<br />Watch at the end of the film when Wall-E is put back together by EVE and doesn't seem to remember her. Many philosophers in the past have wondered are we merely the sum of our parts, or are we something more then that? If our body parts were to be replaced and our hard drive, our memories if you will, were wiped clean, would we still be the same person? It's great for a studio like Pixar to explore these questions and at least bring them to their audience's minds. Again, this will be lost on children, but Pixar films are for adults too you know.and with that comes a strong emotional story that will make children laugh and adults wipe their eyes.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|It is such a shame that this show has not yet been released. After all of the petitions and support behind the release of Daria on DVD it is just awful that it has not yet become a reality. I'm 17 years old and I fell in love with the show in 2005 when it was airing on the N and I have many friends my age who love the show just as much as I do. With the attention Daria has recieved from my age group coupled with the older fans of the show it is guaranteed sell quickly. I really hope that executives at MTV really get themselves together and figure out a way to get Daria on DVD. Although there are a lot of issues regarding the rights to all of the music they use in the show, I still have faith that this show will one day get released with the help of its loyal fans. I LOOOOOOVE DARIA!!!!!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|A funny, touching, inspiring, feel-good movie.  I bought a copy for myself after having seen a friend's copy.  I've watched it probably a dozen times with various friends.  Everyone I've watched it with has loved it.  Some have also bought copies to share with their friends.  \\"Change your mind about someone.\\"  (If you watch the movie, you'll understand.)
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Although the first single \\"4 Minutes\\" soured my opinion on the album at first, I actually gave it a listen and I really like it (NOTE: Not love). I feel like the best of Madonna is behind us but this album has a lot more variety than \\"Confessions\\" and it's a true dance album. Although \\"Heartbeat\\" is bound to be a big hit, \\"Incredible\\" is the real gem on this album. \\"Miles Away\\" is also a great track as well. I have to say that I think Pharell saved this album and I'm glad to say that sometimes when I am listening to it, I feel like it's 1982 all over again :)

B00004HYLF|5.0|Romantic Warrior is the best jazz fusion album out there.  My father got me into Return To Forever, and a last week, he took me to a concert of theirs as a birthday present.  They are doing a reunion tour (Corea, White, Di Meola, and Clarke, as the lineup).  I actually got a backstage pass, and finally met the band (exept Chick Corea, who was having problems with the keyboards, and actually did have a little trouble during the show).  They are so cool.  Al Di Meola is so laid back.  Lenny White is very cool, and friendly.  He had a cold, so we bumped elbows, instead of shaking hands.  Stanley Clarke is also pretty cool.  He's really funny.  We got to see them tune their instruments, and rehearse.  We got to see the reheasal, and during the reheasal the band played, got into a jam, and Clarke, playing his double bass, finally took out a bow, and deliberately ran it hard against the strings, making a screeching sound.  Everybody in the group couldn't stop laughing. The concert was the best one I've ever seen. They played numerous songs from Romantic Warrior, Where have I known You before, and No Mystery, lasting over 3 hours. Clarke did a 20 minute bass solo, and White did a 15 minute drum solo.  Di Meola was lightning fast on the guitar throughout the show.  So the next day I bought Romantic Warrior.  It is probably the best jazz album I've ever listened to.  I would recommend it to anyone.

0061122416|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is a delightfully inspiring journey as it transports you into a boy's journey to discover himself, to learn his own narrative. Each one of us is on a journey toward finding our own \\"Personal Myth\\" and in today's world where self-reflection has often taken a back-seat to being out-there, the search is even more imperative.    This book can be read at many levels from a superficial read to in-depth uncovering of the dreams, symbols and signs present in the novel. The main message of the novel is that we need to follow our dream and through following it we will arrive at our true destiny, our unique part in the fabric of creation.    The novel is the story of Santiago, a boy who courageously follows his dream. He travels the world looking for a hidden treasure and in the end discovers that the real treasure is in his heart. The author explains his ideas in a simple language.    Those who follow their dream or \\"personal myth\\" find happiness, fulfilment and achievement in the life. While those who lack the courage to follow their dream, live a life of sadness, emptiness and dissatisfaction.     \\"The Alchemist\\" is a wonderful read! Best read together with another story about following your dream, \\"[[ASIN:0978107004 Nexus: A Neo Novel]].\\"    \\"Nexus\\" by Morrison & Singh follows the journey of a unique mix of people drawn to a spiritual retreat where they learn important spiritual lessons. It's an inspiring read about people looking to overcome pain in their life.    I definitely recommend \\"The Alchemist\\" and \\"Nexus: A Neo Novel.\\" Happy readings!

Most importantly the VITALITY is back. After years of straying from that core energy playing \\"eloqeuntly\\" arranged studio works this album ROCKS out like yesteryear tracks of FOTR or LRP... I saw them at UC Berkeley's Greek theater last month and that was the best show i've ever seen. Way better than when I saw them at Anaheim >10yrs ago... as they write on the album-- \\"you cannot resist, you cannot resist\\"

B000YAA68W|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\", based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel, is one of those kind of films that acts not only as a well-constructed and thought-provoking film yet at the same time a reminder that animated films are not simply just for kids and parents looking to kill time or adults who are fascinated by robots and bizarre imagery like that from Japan. Its format is rather unique and indeed the method of telling a very adult and politic-centered story using an attractive visual style might seem a bit off-putting but that also makes the story stand out more and it becomes emotional without manipulative and comedic without being untasteful. In essence, it's a story about life...using pencils.    Based on novel creator and director Satrapi's life, the film follows Marjane as a young girl living in Iran. Dealing with the oppression and government control of the Shah and hoping for better days. That day comes when the Shah falls and a revolution happens but much to their dismay, the new government is just as worse with fierce laws concerning dress, speaking out about politics, music and social class of women. Marjane is sent away to Vienna but like any traumatic event, moving elsewhere doesn't mean you've entirely escaped your past and the influence of the war is just as powerful as it is anywhere.    Awhile ago, I had the pleasure/misfortune of watching another French animated film called \\"Renaissance\\", another visually-appealing film which wasn't geared towards children. Only problem was the story was incredibly dull and you remember the art style more than you remember the movie. \\"Persepolis\\" on the other hand not only has a unique style with black-and-white and more exaggerated movements and shots with occasional color sequences but the story is also intriguing. There's not much of a story so to speak and we focus on the progression and maturing of Marjane but the film never feels slow and sluggish and the story helps bring the characters to life, so to speak.    But a film concerning a war and revolution doesn't have to be depressing and indeed, there's plenty of humor to be found. Whether it's a pair of eyes poking out of a puff of exhaust Looney Tunes-style or just genuinely funny moments such as a scene concerning flushing alcohol from officers to Marjane herself as a character, the film works on many levels though I doubt kids would be into this. Only thing that didn't sit well with me is that the last 20 minutes or so don't really drag but you can tell the film's starting to slow down a bit, like a runner in a race pushing himself to the end. A weird sequence involving \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" is strangely funny but in retrospect, it's also a bit too unlike the rest of the film that it sticks out sore thumb-like.    I'd recommend watching the French dub with subtitles over the English dub since I don't mind the dub but it's rare for the English track to be better than the original track and I prefer the voices in the French one. We get some looks into the making of the film (but sadly, no feature-length commentary) but I'd recommend watching the film since it's so unlike what I normally watch in animation outside of Japan.

0385512058|3.0|Ferrazzi has some good ideas in this book regarding networking, meeting people and using relationships as a way to achieve success and contentment in this life. While a few examples from the lives of great networkers appear throughout the book, he mainly focuses on himself - which is both good and bad. The good is that he has tried many methods of trying to meet people and staying in touch with them once you do. The result is insightful advice and suggestions. The bad is that you get a sense that this guy likes to talk about himself and his accomplishments, which gets annoying over the course of the book. Not all of his ideas are practical for most people either, like hosting dinner parties once a month and having them catered. But all in all, this is a worthwhile book and goes further in creativity than most networking books. Like the author, I too believe that much of life comes down to who you know and the give and take in relationships and was glad to gleam some wisdom from someone who has literally tried it all within the world of real networking.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|All right, I know that some people aren't going to like this movie, but as of me: I LOVE SUSPIRIA!!!!! Just wanted to make that clear, heh.  -Now, I will admit that in between the murders, the pace can slow down a bit. But if you're a horror lover or a gorehound, you NEED to see this movie, if only for the kills! Watch in the first where the girl that runs away from the ballet school gets absolutely SAVAGED! It's no wonder Entertainment Weekly referred to it as \\"the most vicious murder in a horror movie\\".  -The supernatural feel, surreal images and tone, amazing color and unfamiliar setting are absolutely beautiful. This has got to be the most beautiful and mesmerizing display of shocking horror cinematography ever. The foreign setting definitely helps, and captivates the viewer, especially if they're looking for a movie that's just as atmospheric and supernatural as it is bone-chillingly terrifying. So surreal and astounding...LOVE IT!  -I found the two-disc version at a very reasonable price, and this is, of course, after I saw it four times before owning it!    SUMMARY:  THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE. IT ISN'T THE MOST FAST-PACED MOVIE EVER AND IT MAY SEEM TO RUN A LITTLE LONG. BUT IF YOU HAVE PATIENCE, WANT SOMETHNG HORRIFYING, VICIOUS, BEAUTIFUL, SURREAL, GENIUS AND GROUNDBREAKING, SUSPIRIA MAY BE AS GREAT A MOVIE TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME.  So as you can tell I think this movie rocks! Just watch it with an open mind, be patient, and expect the hardcore horror mastery via Italian director Dario Argento. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I came into this both having not read the book or known that much about our second president. I was stunned and captivated and a week after watching this excellent HBO offering, spent a fair amount of time reflecting on this vital piece of American history. We tend to think of the Founding Fathers as a dull bunch who had the whole issue of creating the United States figured out from the get-go. No so. What makes John Adams so important as president is that he followed the beloved and charismatic George Washington at a time when there was serious dissention as to where the American Experiment would lead. Adams, acerbic, bald and portly, and quite unpleasant at times, could have soured the citizenry on the idea of presidents altogether and had to play a balancing act between the still dangerous Great Britain and the aggressively revolutionary France (which we almost went to war with during his tenure). Nor was the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution assured to succeed. In one of the most brilliant scenes ever filmed of our history, the colonies vote unanimously (after much backroom wheeling-dealing and arm-twisting) for independence thus breaking irrevocably from Great Britain. One would expect soaring music, cheers, hats thrown in the air and the waving of flags. Instead, the denouement is staged in complete silence....each delegate rendered silent and stunned, as if they had just signed a suicide pact (which, indeed, it could have been).<br /><br />That said, &#34;John Adams&#34; is a marvel mainly for its extraordinary casting in which it appears that the producers took a time machine back to the 18th century and kidnapped the principals for this miniseries. In particular, David Morse portrays Washington with a regal gravitas that dominates every scene he is in and Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin equally steals the show. Stephan Dillane is fascinating as Thomas Jefferson, Adam's friend and adversary who died on the same day he did. None of them, however, take away from the superb acting of Paul Giamatti as the lead and Laura Linney as the vital Abigail Adams, his &#34;ballast&#34; as he calls her, a woman so ahead of her time, I'm amazed she didn't explode from frustration.<br /><br />The sets, costuming and general rendering of the time period are equally stunning and one should take time to view the bonus features which include a lively interview with author David McCullough and a fascinating &#34;Making of&#34; doc.<br /><br />Although unrated, this is NOT a film for children as it features some gruesome (and accurate) depictions of period medical practices which will make viewers go down on their knees and thank God for our present system, imperfect as it is.ke away from the superb acting of Paul Giamatti as the lead and Laura Linney as the vital Abigail Adams, his &#34;ballast&#34; as he calls her, a woman so ahead of her time, I'm amazed she didn't explode from frustration.

Just make sure you dont get an illiterate seller, selling PAL here in the NTSC like i did. Good luck with your purchase.
038073186X|2.0|I listened to this novel set in Massachusetts read by Tom Stechshulte and he was absolutely the wrong person to read this book. He turned every African-American character into some trash-talking ignoramus from the South.<br /><br />The novel itself has suspense and if I had read it instead of listening, might feel more positive toward it. The ending was so farfetched that I just had to laugh.<br /><br />I need another story like MYSTIC RIVER to make me believe in Dennis LeHane again.
1593082010|5.0|I can imagine that Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy) is Jane Austen herself, couldn't you?<br /><br />Jane Austen is a wonderful writer. She deserves much praise. With extraordinary insight into feelings and actions of characters. She does a good job of making each character distinct and well defined. The Bantam Classic edition of all of the classics is much better then the Barnes and Noble version.<br /><br />You must read this book even if it's but only for once (even thought there may be a possibility of you may not liking it) to give credit to what I consider a historic acknowledgement to a female writer. Men can also learn much about the fact that not all women are the same.

B00004BZ16|5.0|TURN THIS UP REAL LOUD, GET HIGH, LISTEN, TUNE IN...<br /><br />To those who say this is not a great album, and that you need to create your own cd from the 36 tracks:  Go listen to the radio, this is not for you, this is for people who actually like the adventure and excitement of albums.<br /><br />I have never been a huge fan of the clash, more of a very casual part-time listener, never really hearing more than London Calling and bits and pieces of other albums.  My girlfriend has been a fan of them for many years so she played me a few other albums, and while I enjoyed their music and thought of them as much more than just a punk band, I never really knew how great they were until I finally listened to this work of mastery.  I can't believe how good this is.<br /><br />I think you really have to pay attention to this album to get it.  You can't just put this on in the background and look for good singles or hardcore punk/rock blasts, this is a full album that needs to really be absorbed in full.<br /><br />This was not a f_ck you to the record label.<br />This was not a treat for hardcore fans.<br />This was not them scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to make this so long.<br /><br />This is one of the best albums ever made in the history of music, spanning almost every genre of music, bridging the past with what was going to come in the future, very big sound, amazing instrumental moments with great surprises and subtle changes that are mind-blowing.  The thickness of this album will totally shock anybody who hasn't listened to it and likes bands like My Morning jacket, Flaming Lips, Radiohead, Olivia Tremor control or any other psychedelicesque music that has many, many layers of sound.  The thing that really struck me the most was the layering of sound on Sandinista!  I totally have to rethink of my perception of the Clash after this experience.<br /><br />I just hope more people listen to this properly.<br />If you have ever listened to this and wished you liked it more, or if you have never even liked the Clash at all, get really stoned and put this in your stereo...enjoy.the Clash at all, get really stoned and put this in your stereo...enjoy.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Now this is how to make a summer movie.  \\"Iron Man\\" explodes off the screen with a combustible mix of superstar charisma, heavy metal thunder and the one thing other film's of it ilk willfully forget: soul.  Robert Downey, Jr., a gifted actor long haunted by demons manifested as substance abuse, powers this new-fangled classic as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, infusing the splashy playboy with bone-dry wit, magnetic charm and, ultimately, huge amounts of heart.  At first, Stark is a willing and content cog in the military industrial complex, reaping huge profits from the sale of self-designed weapons while staying half a world away from the harsh consequences of their use.  And why should he care in the first place?  He's far too busy showing off his high-powered toys of mass destruction; that and bedding every beautiful woman he sees, much to the consternation of his best friend and military liaison Colonel Rhodes (Terrance Howard, every bit as stellar here as Downey, Jr.) and his loyal secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Paltrow is doing some the best work of her career as Stark's romantic equal.  The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is palpable, sexy and resonant; kudos to director Jon Favreau and his large team of screenwriters, which includes the scribes for Children of Men, for knowing it's the little things like depth of character that really count.      But Stark gets jolted to reality when his military convoy is attacked on a rural Afghani road by warlords who seek to use Stark's technical acumen for their own arsenals.  To add insult to injury, the convoy is attacked with Stark's own weapons, which the extremists have procured through black market sales and illegal arms deals.  Struck in a dank, suffocating cave, Stark first realizes the true gravity of making cavalier billions off of weapons of war.  Conscience awakened, he works to design a new prototype under the nose of those who hold him captive.  With it, he will flee and use it todestroy all the loose arms that are linked to him.  Favreau stages the escape with high impact pow, showing that this film might be battle cry of one of the next great directors.    Back in America, Stark keeps himself in seclusion, perfecting a new battlesuit that will allow him to undo the wrong he has inadvertently committed, but not before trying to get his company, inherited from his gung-ho father, to discontinue weapons development.  However, his second in command, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, a blazing villain), will have none of it.  To him, there's too much green in selling high caliber goods; peace politics are for those too weak to take power and wealth.  So its Stark and his reformed sense of responsibility versus high-rolling capitalism run amok, and their final battle, with two iron-suits rampaging across Southern California, is a doozy.  But the true joy of Iron Man is not its action or seamless special effects.  It's how it seamlessly integrates those elements into a resonant popcorn yarn that stands with the best of the best.  Folks, this is how it's supposed to be done.

0452289963|5.0|This is a wonderful book that truly changed my life. As I started reading this book, I felt that shift Mr. Tolle talks about. I recognized myself in many lines of this book...living in future, past, stress,anxiety, deep depression, and total unhappiness with my life. I had asked myself this question \\"What is the purpose of me living?\\"<br />My questions were answered. I feel happiness in every second of my life.<br />This book is not for everyone, what I mean by this is - one have to be ready for a change.<br />If you ready, if you want to be truly happy with your life, and remember, you only have one life, this is the book for you.<br />Thank you and God Bless.
B000S553TK|5.0|Turn On the Bright Lights is one of my all-time favorite albums, period!   It's awesome! Catchy as hell.   Light and dark, happy and sad, brilliant, fun and textured.   A perfect blend of everything. Obstacle 1 is one of the best songs EVER, in my opinion. How could I not love this album?
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|O Mi God I love this CD.  It is poppish. But very fun. Weird lyrics. Addicting beats. The Best Songs- I Kissed A Girl 9/10-Great 1st Single  Waking Up in Vegas 8.5/10-Deffinitly true song.  Ur So Gay 8.5/10-Dumb lyrics. Catchy Midtempo Song.  And (2 me) the best song-Hot N' Cold 10/10  Indescribeable.  Overall the CD is average. You skip some. Listen to some. I have a feeling she will be around for awhile. If she makes more CD's like this. She should be.
B000002L99|5.0|This Van Halen cd is amazing. it's very 80's with the oberheim keyboard classic sound. The guitar riffs are great and it feels like a party. The guys sound like they're having fun. Includes classics like \\"Dreams\\", and \\"Summer Nights\\" from the Sammy Hagar era. For Van halen fan's and people who loves good good rock'nroll stuff is absolutely recommended.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I knew very little about Beatrix Potter.  I loved the movie.  The acting was great as well as the photography of the Lake District.  I highly recommend this film.

B00005JPKE|1.0|Balefully unoriginal in concept [see: 'tora tora tora'] and dead guys letter reading scene [see: All quiet otwf]is constantly fragmented by tawdry and heartsinkingly americocentric overlays..[eg]... Yes folks..... all a dodgy oriental zealot requires to develop worldly sophistication, nobility and sense of common justice [see:recent heroic moral leadership ref; guantanamo bay] is a purlew in the old US of A.     We'll go easy on the rabidly racist militaristic imperialism of both sides..[not PC]     Basically, three kinds of Japanese soldiers are depicted here...(1) US influenced good guys [must do our duty old boy..see 'la grand illusion'] (2) non-us exposed officers concentrating all their energies on either insubordinating direct orders from their superiors or hilariously slaughtering their own troops for doing the very same thing..and (3} sympathetic [just like you or me] slaughterees.     All the more amazing that this bunch of cowboys [sic] managed to inflict 20,000 casualties on an enemy with naval and air support whilst trapped in a tunnel.     The film then, was yet another hopelessly muddled, distorted and implausable evocation of life beyond the empathic wit of a pop-culture superpower....No amount of sub-titles and sepia can disguise the parochial nature of American mainstream film. When it attempts to capture an alien frame of reference it merely exposes its own terminal egocentricity.

B000V1Y43W|5.0|The only think I would have liked to see on the Blu ray was the Ghost Light movie that is on the non HD disc.
159102594X|5.0|This book started a bit slow and I have to admit I put it down a few times. Each time though was harder, as it moves toward the end the story and character development rolls into full swing. It reached a point where I looked up and was surprised to find that I'd been reading for 3 hours.    It is a book that just took a while to get moving, but once it did it is one heck of a great read.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|Yes I think it was worth seeing this in the Blu-ray conversion.  Apparently it was shot using slow film, and this renders the most impressive of transfers to HD.  The original film still holding much more detail than we get on HD.  The colour and light was a revelation - compared to those dark and dull DVDs.  The Final Cut, has some interesting additions, \\"I want more life, f..ker\\" is now changed to \\"I want more life, father\\".  And the dove shot at the end, is now in keeping with the dark city background.  Some of the gore is unnecessarily lengthened imho.  It's surprising what just a few more frames does, and here I think it cheapens the overall effect of the film.
B000YABYLA|5.0|I actually hadn't heard of the movie at all until it came out on video, but I really liked it and have watched it twice since.  I recommend it.  Ellen Page is awesome.
B00144VBBS|2.0|If you are a Toby Keith fan, you probably have already purchased the majority of his past CD's that these greatest hits come from.  While it is nice to have all of these songs on one compilation and not have to search through Toby's vast C.D. library for your favorite song, having only one (and definitely not so great) new song, \\"She's a Hottie\\" makes this greatest hits collection not all that great.  I would recommend this greatest hits package only to new Toby Keith fans who have never purchased any of his past C.D.'s. For all other Toby fans, dust off your old Toby C.D.'s and save yourself 15.00.
0393327655|5.0|I don't normally write book reviews, even for books I enjoy. However, after having read \\"The End of Faith\\", as well as many of the reviews of it, I just HAD to recommend it. Apart from being an excellent writer, Mr. Harris' logic is so sharp and compelling, so utterly brilliant that I read most of it in absolute awe.       None of the more negative reviews that have questioned his arguments have been in the least bit convincing, in fact, most seem to miss the point entirely. One reviewer mentioned all the good that is done by religious organizations and all the evil committed by atheists as though Mr. Harris doesn't even address these issues (which he does).       The End of Faith is not just an argument against religion. It is an argument against FAITH. Blind, unverifiable, faith, in anything. This is why he mentions The Holocaust and other atrocities committed by \\"atheists\\". These people may not have believed in religion, but they're evil acts were committed as a result of unverifiable, illogical beliefs, that have a firm background in religious premises none-the-less. Furthermore, while many religious organizations do help others, public service and helping others would still occur even without faith, and for better reasons.      In the end, this book makes so much sense that it's scary. This is probably why so many people of faith have found it so threatening. If you have even the slightest interest in the future of our species, please do yourself of a favor and read this book.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|It had the appearance of a movie but was more waste than movie. A movie needs a plot and sympathetic characters for the audience to relate to. Seeing a group of 20 something party rats try to act through a shaky camera is just bad movie making. Sorry, I called this a movie, my mistake. There is usually a progression of intensity containing intelligent dialog and character interaction, building to a motivating event that drives the rest of the movie. I found the action, from the beginning, to be too intense for build up. It's like being drunk before you drink.<br />The characters were thoroughly unlikable and immature. Is sleeping together enough of a motivation for a monster movie?<br />And speaking of the monster, what was that? If this was inspired by Godzilla, then the inspired person should realize that the iconic image of Godzilla is rooted in the culture from which it came. This bowlegged creature has no relevance in American culture and lacks the archetypal  quality to be an effective threat. It was just another grandiose CGI effect as was most of the movie.<br />Just because the possibility of making a superior CGI movie exists, shouldn't be the basis of a movie over good characters or a plot.<br />Good cover art on the DVD but horrible content.
B000001E18|5.0|As a serious U2 fan, this review is bound to be a little bit biased.  That aside, \\"Zooropa\\" is a criminally underrated album.  Released amid their early to mid-1990's experimentation with techno/dance/rock, it isn't as accessible as their more iconic work, but what is offered on this release is nothing short of brilliant.  'Numb' is an easy and obvious single, and may be a good place to start if you want to get a feel for what this album is like, although it may have been a better fit on their next album, \\"Pop.\\"  'Stay (Faraway, So Close!)' is one of the better-known tracks from the album, and is certainly a great song, but 'Babyface' is oft-overlooked, and - although very pop-y - is a gorgeous song.  'Lemon' has an absolutely beautiful refrain, and 'The First Time' is eerily reminiscent of 'All I Want is You' in its haunting simplicity: a two-chord guitar part supported by strong lyrics.  And 'The Wanderer,' U2's collaboration with Johnny Cash, is, arguably, the best song on the album.    If you haven't heard this album, definitely give it a listen.
0670020745|5.0|I was interested in this book when I saw Dr. Taylor on the Oprah show. My mother had a massive stroke and lived on a feeding tube in a nursing home for two years before she died. This was a traumatic experience for me  and I wanted to understand it. Dr. Taylor's explanations are clear and concise. The list of what she wanted people to know about being in the initial stage of a stroke in valuable for us all.I wish I had had this book then.
B0013J30W2|4.0|\\"Wanted,\\" director Timur Bekmambetov's (\\"Night Watch,\\" \\"Day Watch\\") comic book adaptation, is a solid summer action flick.  Over-the-top and deliberately cartoon-ish, the creative action sequences and general visual flair help the film distinguish itself from other CGI-filled action extravaganzas, as does the generous helping of graphic violence and profanity, which many other summer blockbusters tend to shy away from.  Add to that generally good performances (in not so serious roles) from James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, and Morgan Freeman, and you get what pretty much amounts to an awesome video game in movie form...  Somewhat forgettable, far from life-changing, but an absolute blast from start to finish.  Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is a boring, unnoticed cubicle worker with a stress disorder, who discovers that his father (who left when Wesley was a mere seven days old) was an assassin for a secretive group known as 'The Fraternity,' and was recently murdered.  The Fraternity, working under the front of a textile mill, is a group of assassins - among them Fox (Jolie) and the head of the group, Sloan (Freeman) - that has existed for thousands of years and who dispatch people that 'fate' has instructed them to kill.  When Wesley discovers the truth about his father, Sloan and Fox take him under their wing, and train him to avenge his father's death, by assassinating Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who murdered him.  My problem with Bekmambetov's earlier film, \\"Night Watch\\" was that it felt so over-stylized that it wound up lacking a distinct style of its own.  The first act of \\"Wanted\\" suffers this same problem: too much emphasis on flashy editing, bizarre camera angles and sound distortion.  But once Wesley decides to join \\"The Fraternity\\" the film seems to settle into a style all its own, and becomes, actually, a treat to watch  for the most part.  The cinematography on the whole is really spectacular; there are a few really clever uses of shallow focus, and the camera is always moving.  While I am getting increasingly tired with the over-use of CGI in action films, the effects in this film are generally really strong, and the film is clearly very aware of itself (it ends with a character blatantly breaking the fourth wall), so the effects often feel very tongue-in-cheek, which usually works in the film's favor.    The action sequences are also generally really good, and very creative. Watching one particular scene towards the end really reminded me of the way I felt viewing similar scenes from \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Equilibrium\\" for the first time.  Overall, a really solid, but very over-the-top action film.  The film doesn't take itself seriously, and if you don't either, you'll have a blast.
0743289692|5.0|An incredible story by a gifted writer. One of the best books I have read in many years.
B0018TLRTU|5.0|The first CD in this set is a great compilation of his most well-known songs, which that sense for a Greatest Hits album. If you're a rabid billy fan, the first cd will seem a little short to you, but if you want a single disc with all your favorite songs, just burn one.       This is a great introductory CD to a new fan... it has a diversity of songs that makes the compilation very honest, showing the listener all the different things Billy is in to when he makes music.       The DVD housing all of Idol's music videos is a first, and is amazing, making this greatest hits much more worth buying than the previous one, though, incidentally I have both, and I can't complain with either. The two new songs have his *new* sound, which began to develop commercially somewhere between the end of Cyberpunk and the making of Speed. They're good songs, but it's Billy's perfect, over-confident delivery that makes them what they are.    I'm very pleased with this; It's re-sparked my enthusiasm about this next phase of his career.    -BM
B000002KGT|5.0|I haven't listen to this album in its entirety in almost 20 years. I did today. This album still rocks! A classic.
B000002H97|1.0|It's a myth that this is a great album.    Metallica's 2 towering masterpieces are \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"And Justice for All.\\"    At the time that \\"the Black Album\\" came out, Metallica was so massively huge that everyone rushed out and bought this piece of junk.  That's why it sold so well.  And it did have that Metallica sound, yet to those who knew Metallica best, the \\"the Black Album\\" lacked any sincere fire in the soul.  It was empty.  It was bland.  It was Metallica only going through the motions.  And creatively, it was the end of the real Metallica.    If you want to buy a Metallica album, buy \\"Master of Puppets\\" for it's muscle and purity.  Or, buy \\"And Justice for All,\\" which is complex and takes a while to get use to, but if you're patient, you'll come to understand that \\"And Justice for All\\" is one of the greatest albums in rock history.    If you have a brain the size of a pea, please don't buy \\"And Justice for All,\\" because you will hate it.
B00127R7JM|5.0|A great mix of metal styles - if you like black or melodic death metal, you should try this.  I predict this album makes many top 10 lists for the year. Highly recommended.
B0009X75RO|5.0|One of the best purchases I've ever made! The movie itself is outstanding, but if you're at all interested in the additional material, you'll love it. Worth every penny!
006135323X|5.0|This book is recommended reading for anyone that is in sales (and aren't we all in some manner).  This reviewer sells enterprise SaaS applications/outsourcing to large companies and this book is instantly applicable in my career.<br /><br />Chapter 1 is worth the price of the book itself!  Relativity is key...how many of us non-academics that have to present business cases or influence people for a living have seen the \\"analysis paralysis\\" invade our propspective decision making committees? How many times have you assumed your audience will take the information you are presenting and act on it rationally...this book has helped this reviewer to see that it is simply not the case.  Futhermore, the author helps with framing decision scenarios...think of it as a blueprint to work from.<br /><br />It's also refreshing to read a non-academic book with ideas on human behavior that are:<br />- written by someone with very high credibility<br />- based on evidence<br />- not found in the \\"sales help\\" section of my local bookstore (thank you Amazon recommendations) where the premise of decision making is flawed from the outset.<br /><br />I don't get some of the criticism about left leaning ideas in this book...it's certainly not a theme of his to promote bigger government.  Rather, to the author's credit, the one comment I do recall on health care pricing is a hypothesis that he can support with some evidence...even if you don't agree with him it's an interesting thought experiment.<br /><br />There's so much more to take away from this book that can be applicable to one's life...that's not an exaggeration as Chapter 8 (Keeping Doors Open) was profound...I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.<br /><br />One last comment...the chapters on dishonesty are fascinating!
B00000DC10|5.0|If you're a heavy metal fan, you have every right to feel ashamed for not owning this record.  Refused f-ing rock!  This is such a slamming, grooving, neck-snapping record, it's hard to properly describe it.  I can't heap enough praise on it, it's brilliant!  I truly wish this WAS the shape of punk to come!  I'd guess that if you like old NYC hardcore, post-punk stuff like Minor Threat and At The Drive In, then you have every reason to LOVE this LP.  You'll spin this thousands of times before ever getting tired of it.
0930289528|5.0|The V for Vendetta Graphic Novel is an astounding book.  It is the depiction of the movie (if you watched it first like I did) and it is a more in-depth look at Codename V.  I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of: V for Vendetta the motion picture, graphic novels, or even comic books. (since it so closely relates to one)
B000HGA5PM|4.0|Given the fact that there are no official The Wall Live videos, this is a must have for any Pink Floyd fan, although video & quality are poor.  I'd rather have this DVD than no DVD at all.  If you really like Floyd's live performances, buy it, but in keep in mind that you won't find the video & audio you'd expect to find on a DVD.
B00006F7S4|4.0|In his ongoing effort to prove his eclecticism, Beck dove headfirst into heartbroken drone for \\"Sea Change.\\" Gone are the gimmickry productions (well, maybe the breakdown at the end of \\"Sunday Sun\\" counts) and the overly wry sarcasm of previous efforts. This has been well noted as a \\"break-up album,\\" yet if you'd never heard [[ASIN:B000003TBP Odelay]] or [[ASIN:B000003TB2 Mellow Gold]] before this, you'd swear you'd just stumbled across a devotee of Nick Drake or The Blue Nile's [[ASIN:B00000I3JO Hats]]. \\"Sea Change\\" is straight out of that intimate heartbroken school of lush, atmospheric depression.<br /><br />Granted, someone expecting the hipster anthems like \\"Loser\\" are going to be seriously disappointed. But if you have followed Beck long enough to pick up on the undercurrents of personality in his best work, or thought that Johnny Cash covering Beck's \\"Rowboat\\" on [[ASIN:B000WS4OZC Unchained]] was a natural fit, then the mainly acoustic and downbeat nature of \\"Sea Change\\" will seem like just another one of Beck's many changing moods. There are two great songs here, the lushly orchestrated \\"Paper Tiger\\" and the evocative \\"Lost Cause.\\"<br /><br />In fact, \\"Lost Cause\\" is just one of many titles that should clue you in to Beck's mindset when creating \\"Sea Change.\\" Dig on these: \\"Lonesome Tears,\\" \\"End of The Day\\" and \\"Already Dead.\\" That last one rates with the darkest songs Beck's ever recorded, and I'd include [[ASIN:B0007SL1LW Guero's]] \\"Farewell Ride\\" in that subset. Thing is, all his other albums were jumbles of styles, collisions often occurring inside one song. Not so on \\"Sea Change.\\" Beck forces his focus here, and indirectly makes you do so along with him. It's a bleak ride indeed, but if you take \\"Sea Change\\" as a whole. it's every bit the equal of his best albums.
B000ANVQ0K|2.0|I finally got the DVD in the mail today and I was less than impressed. Here are my problems with the DVD. The movie itself is split into 2. I thought the creation of the DVD was to have the whole movie on one disc. The VHS of Titanic was two tapes. It's the 21's century. Now people are going to argue this point with the \\"The alternate ending is on the second disc!!\\". Then what is the 3rd disc for? All of the special features should have been on one disc. The other featuretts really didn't astound me. They were short and rather boring. If the special edition wasn't so cheap I would have just gotten the regular DVD and probably would have been much better. On the other side of the spectrum, the movie itself is fantastic! Minus the having to get up mid way to change the disc. Titanic is my favorite movie and features my favorite actor and actress. I reccomend the movie, but not this edition of the movie. Not worth it.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|I couldn't live without the Shamanic Energy of the Beloved Carlos!  It's Great to have old and new favorites on one CD.  If Into the Night doesn't make every Firey Goddess get up and dance nothing will.  Hearing the Game of Love with the mature throatyness of Tina is a nice change.
B000063V8U|4.0|Show is of course excellent, some DVDs have a small part or two that won't play properly on any device. So that's a bit of a set back, but otherwise I am very happy with my purchase.
0670020745|5.0|This is a wonderful story of survival and positive attitude that initiated healing. It should be a must read for anyone who has had a traumatic set back or even someone who just needs to be encouraged that not even adversity should stop you from making lemonade out of lemons.
006117758X|5.0|At times in his life, Charles Bukowski may have lived like the dissolute  Hank Chinaski, his alcoholic protagonist in [[ASIN:0061177571 post office: A Novel]], [[ASIN:0876852630 Factotum]], [[ASIN:0061177598 Women: A Novel]], and HAM ON RYE. But in reading HoR, the quality that communicated most clearly to this reader was Buk's immense discipline. There's no self-indulgence, anywhere, in this book. There's no material, anywhere, that doesn't immediately contribute to the development of Hank's character. This discipline means that HoR has absolutely zero bloat. There's not a word that's wasted.<br /><br />HoR has 58 chapters, few longer than five pages. It begins with Hank's first memory and then gradually moves from his childhood, through his adolescence, and to his young manhood, with each chapter developing some new aspect of Hank's personality and life. The amazing thing is that the perceptions never get ahead of Hank's age, with the boyish Hank seeing boyish issues, the adolescent Hank showing how his upbringing and experiences affected his teenage outlook, and so on.<br /><br />This discipline makes HoR a remarkable reading experience. In one chapter, you can see Bukowski, say, add a little depth to the adolescent mentality of Hank. In the next, he adds a little breadth. In fact, Buk's control in each chapter is so tight that the chapters lend themselves perfectly to capsule summations. In my marginalia, for example, I find: Hank wins a medal but declines to pursue success (chapter 41); head games during and after baseball confirm the funny Hank's sense of failure (42); bold Hank humbled by his failed seduction of his only friend's mother (43). What am I saying? In every chapter, Buk shows something new about Hank. This is character that is always developing.<br /><br />Furthermore, Buk always stays within voice--not an easy task for an author taking a character through his formative years. Here's that voice at the start of Chapter 44, with Hank, a high school senior, considering his future.<br /><br />\\"I could see the road ahead of me. I was poor and I was going to stay poor. But I didn't particularly want money. I didn't know what I wanted. Yes, I did. I wanted someplace to hide out, someplace where one didn't have to do anything. The thought of being something didn't only appall me, it sickened me. ...To get married, to have children, to get trapped in the family structure. To go someplace to work every day and to return. It was impossible.  ...was a man borne just to endure those things and then die?

B000002USN|2.0|Nearly a decade after the Frank Sinatra-Quincy Jones collaboration, L.A. Is My Lady, comes this syrupy, Phil Ramone-produced tribute to the iconic American entertainer.<br /><br />With 13 selections and the same number of guests - including Bono, Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett and Natalie Cole - it is a concept which showcases the incredible musical impact of Sinatra over seven decades. Unfortunately, his health was in decline by this time and the duets were performed to Sinatra's pre-recorded vocal parts over a telecommunications link.<br /><br />There remained great demand for material by \\"The Chairman of the Board;\\" it reached to number two on the Billboard albums chart and number five in the UK, while selling more than three million copies in the United States.<br /><br />The cover art is a specially-commissioned painting of Sinatra by LeRoy Neiman and is a wonderful depiction of the star when he was at the top of his game. But this CD is a painful reminder that time and age could not make these sessions live up to the advanced billing of, \\"The Recording Event of The Decade.\\"
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this band since I first heard \\"Fly From the Inside\\" on the radio, and still hope that \\"Us and Them\\" goes platinum one day like \\"Leave a Whisper\\" did. I have been highly anticipating this album since I heard Devour for the first time on the radio. The whole time I was listening to it, the thought \\"This band seems familiar\\" kept running through my head. I googled the lyrics and thought, \\"Yeah, that makes sense...it was a great song.\\"     This album is phenomenal. I don't know why I was surprised, Shinedown has never disappointed. True, \\"Us and Them\\" has some songs I tend to skip over (What were they thinking with \\"Atmosphere\\"?), but all in all it's an awesome album that I've listened to hundreds of times through.     Once again, they have changed their sound. While their first album was calculated with meticulous attention to detail, chord progressions, lyrical content, and a passionate singing style, and heavy overall, and their second album was much more radio friendly while still maintaining a truth and vitality that is lacking in much of today's music, with several ballads that blow you away whenever you hear them, this album breaks through new boundaries.    It is true that much of the album is radio friendly, but in this case that's a positive thing. They aren't going anywhere for a while, which is good. However, they've brought back much of the musical aptitude that was missing on their second album and combined it with some interesting choices as far as melody are concerned. Let's break down the songs, one by one.    1 - Devour (9/10): This song kicks off the album with intensity. It is unlike anything they've ever done, and while it's similar to the style of other modern bands out there, it still seems to have some signature Shinedown flare to it. That may be Brent's singing, or the intricate guitar work. Either way, it's a great song.  2 - Sound of Madness (10/10): One of my favorites on the album, the chorus is like a lesson in lyrical creativity, and the guitar riff is, how shall I say...\\"rollicking\\", to say the least. It's hard not to bob your head to this song when it's on, and I love singing along.  3 - Second Chance (8/10): While it's lyrically interesting, it sounds to me like a throwback to \\"Us and Them\\", which had several songs with similar chord progressions and verse-chorus formulas. That either makes it signature Shinedown, or a disappointment, and on an album of this caliber I tend to lean toward the latter. That's not to say I don't love it, which I do (8 out of 10 is a great score from me), but it's sounds like \\"been there, done that.\\"  4 - Cry For Help (8/10): When I first heard this song, I thought back to Oleander's \\"Joyride\\", which this is reminiscent of. Another rocker, that is great on this album, but not the best one on here. Still, I'm very glad to see Shinedown embrace this type of music. They've never really done anything like this. All the songs on their first album that were \\"rockers\\" were hard rockers, more like Nu-Metal, not like this. This is true rock, which is awesome.  5 - The Crow and the Butterfly (9/10): I love this song. Another song that sounds like it's from \\"Us and Them\\", but it's just so good I don't care. The lyrics are good, too, and I can almost visualize the girl slowly moving away from Brent's outstretched hands when he's singing. It's just a powerful song with some really cool chords thrown in.  6 - If You Only Knew (9/10): This is another song that's pretty much awesome. However, I do like the verses better than the chorus, which gets kind of generic as far as lost love songs go. The beginning is my favorite part, though, along with the part at the end of the chorus that goes, \\"The only thing that I still believe in is you.\\" It's another lyric that is sung with meaning behind it, and it makes the song for me.  7 - Sin With a Grin (10/10): Another favorite on the album, another rocker that I love to sing along to as it blasts in my car. I also love the message of just getting pissed off. The bridge is also an interesting musical turn for the band, trying something new with new and interesting ways of singing and playing their instruments. This is an example of the thing I find everywhere on this album, musical experimentation which is new to them, but not necessarily new in general.  8 - What a Shame (9/10): Another great signature Shinedown ballad. The chorus just grabs you, both lyrically and musically, and again Brent's voice makes me weep when he start belting out his true feelings. Just a great overall song.  9 - Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide (8/10): Another rocker. I feel that a lot of bands write songs with \\"suicide\\" in the title for no real reason, so I have a hard time liking them. This one is pretty good, as they go, but at the end of the album it seems to lose the steam gathered by the other rockers.   10 - Breaking Inside (8/10): The first few times I listened to this song, I really thought it was pretty generic. However, just like their first album, the more I listen to it the more I like it. It's got a very cool sounding melody behind the verses, and the chorus, though generic, is catchy as hell, and once again Brent's voice makes it stand out as amazing. Man I love this band.  11 - Call Me (9/10): I absolutely love this song. It's so simple, and yet the violin, the piano, and Brent's voice just take you away, and you really feel what he is feeling the whole time. There are no words to describe the song, except to say that it's pretty, very pretty. Remember the first time you heard \\".45\\"? That's what this song feels like.    Overall, it's a fantastic album with no filler tracks. I can definitely start at the beginning and listen all the way through without skipping any tracks, which is a rarity these days. The only album to rival it so far this year would be Disturbed's \\"Indestructible\\", which is also awesome (see my review).

B0012QE4Q2|5.0|This movie never lost my attention. Very entertaining, but probably not very historically accurate. It still makes for very story. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannson gave tremendous performances, although Eric Bana did not resemble my idea of who Henry the 8th was.  Anyway, I'd recommend this movie. The costumes and set were top notch!

B00140PK6O|5.0|Dame Judi Dench and Michael Gambon at their best! This version of Elizabeth Gaskell's excellent story is funny, heartfelt, and bittersweet, and leaves you with a great feeling, while wanting more!  Immediately after I finished watching it on TV, I ordered a copy for myself and also one for my boss's birthday.
B001AGHC1I|5.0|In the Heima video (spelled Heim by iTunes but not by Sigur R&oacute;s--for whatever reason?) Sigur R&oacute;s spoke of a pervasive yearning and desire to return home--'home' being spoken of in a far deeper sense than simply returning to Iceland. Sure, they were coming off a busy touring schedule and obviously missed the beautifully bleak, dreamscape countryside, along with its lovely people--all which played vital roles in shaping the band's musical identity. I certainly have no difficulty in understanding this sentiment. The music and video footage alone were enough to inspire me to begin planning an eventual trip to that oft forgotten land of mystery and romance. Sigur R&oacute;s are obviously quite tied to this place they know so well & who can blame them? Imagine what might have come of their music had they originated from elsewhere? Likely nothing. Therefore, I venture to say that Iceland itself is far more of an influence on their musical identity than anything happening in the chart-obsessed world of pop music. And thank God for that! On the present album, 'Med sud I eyrum vid spilum endalaust,' I hear a refreshing reassessment and even a kind of reestablishment of the band's intrinsic identity with their cultural and musical heritage--something they began to express on the 'Hvarf-Heim' project. I would say the present album is the culmination of that return 'home.' The result is, quite naturally, a sound that's somewhat alien to what we're used to, but it's a sound that remains clearly rooted in the artistic identity of Sigur R&oacute;s. The primary changes, I would argue, are merely found in the album's sonic texture--most likely the result of the band having fresh production perspective. Certainly, no 'selling out' occurred. If anything, we're seeing the diametric opposite. But still, some will likely complain about the warmer, more acoustic-focused--dare I say?--'rootsier' sound. However, we must remember that people will nearly always complain when faced with change. Even when that change can so often be a very good thing. Change is a sign of life and of health. Stagnation is a sign of death and dying. When dealing with art that is authentic, pure inner-expression, at some point change becomes a 'necessary evil.' It is an inherent law of art's nature when there is spiritual evolution occurring within the artist. And I don't use the term evil in any traditional sense but more as a description of how the audience can sometimes feel when they're expecting one thing and suddenly experience another. Revulsion can be a natural, if unnecessary, reaction. But give it time. Because these are often the very works that turn out to be the purest and most bountiful step along the creative path. Personally, I think the change of sound is far less than overwhelming. In fact I welcome it with open arms and a fistful of stars. Five honestly doesn't seem quite enough.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I am an avid Josh Groban fan. I think he is the best male singer of this time.I've seen  him  in concert and have all his DVD's & CD's.So of course I purchased the DVD excited to see him again. Of course his performance was great. His singing is better than ever and he interacts with the audiance.  Now for my second rating. I gave 2 stars for the camera people. They ruined the concert. You saw more of the audience than of josh. There were more shots from the back of the stadium than of Josh. YOu couldn't even see him. Thats pretty sad because it could have been an top notch concert. Of course it's still worth buying the dvd/cd just to see him and hear him sing.
0375842209|5.0|It is a rare thing for me to be compulsive about a book; a book that, when you are not actively reading it, occupys your mind, where you can't wait for a free moment to return to the story.  _The Book Thief_ did this to me.  The characters were compelling, the writing was beautiful, the story had me mesmerized, and the narrator, well, the narrator had my complete and rapt attention.<br /><br />_The Book Theif_ is about the four years of young Lisel Meminger's life between childhood and adulthood.  It is also about her growing up in Nazi Germany, witnessing the evil perpetrated during that time and learning about right and wrong.  Narrated by Death, (an interesting choice, I thought, although certainly a neutral observer), the broader philosophical issues of morality and guilt are addressed:  is it moral to steal books?  food?  Jews?  Should one feel guilty for these acts?  For becoming (or not becoming) apart of the Nazi machine?  Should one feel guilty for surviving these horrible times?  Deep questions, to be sure; Zusak, however, is a brilliant enough writer to ask these questions subtly.<br /><br />On the topic of the brilliance of the writing - Zusak's writing is powerful and beautiful.  Its been a long, long time since I outright bawled reading a novel.  I did so with _The Book Thief_.  I was literally emotionally wrung out at the completion of the story.  This book without doubt warrants five stars.  Suitable for young adults?  As with so many things, it depends on the young adult; still, an exceptional read with my highest recommendation.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is a terrific series. It had a great 7 year run, it's very unfortunate that it ended when it did. The seventh season, in my opinion, isn't up to par with the rest, but it was also the first season not written by creator Amy Sherman Palladino - which in my opinion, was a huge loss for the show. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are two terrific actresses, and combined in this series, you can't help but fall in love with them. While I wish we could have seen a little more closure in the series finale, I think it did wrap up better than other shows have. I definitely recommend this product!

B0012Q732O|4.0|What people have forgotten or do not understand is that this movie is entertainment.  This is not a documentary about the year 10,000 BC.  Wikipedia discusses that In the 10th millennium BC, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers replaced a grain-grinding culture in Egypt.  So this part of the movie is very believable.  It may or may not be on the mark about Mammoths, Saber Tooth, and Man-eating birds, but this was twelve millenniums ago.  Can anyone watching this movie state with any first hand experience what our ancient ancestors did or did not see or do?    This is about entertainment, not historical fact.  The story line is appealing, the acting is far better than what most of the anti-BC crowd states and the cinematography is very good.  So what is the big fuss? I have seen the Hulk and Iron Man recently and there are horrible flaws in riddling both films, yet where is all the criticism of these films? I enjoyed this film much more than either Hulk or Ironman.    If you want to see an exciting entertaining film, then forgo any reasonable acceptance of history, and enjoy the film.    Peace!
B00164DWEA|5.0|I really love this comic book adaptation. Unlike Ang Lee's movie: That was not a Hulk movie whatsoever and even the asian director recently admited it.<br />This one has it all: drama, romance, sci-fi, good vs evil... all the things that makes the comic book genre survive during this century.<br />This version of Hulk captures the beauty of the character and the reason is loved by fans. The history of a decent man that lost it all due to a horrible experiment that let loose his inner demons. Bruce tries to be normal again, he tries to control the beast within, every transformation is a tragedy for him because of what it left on his mind, because what he might had done, because he might had killed, because of where he might ends up next time: he is the prisoner of himself and he hates that. That is the theme we all can relate to. What will happen if our demons would take over? What if our chilhood traumas turned us into the monsters that hurted us when where were hopeless?<br />Edward Norton captures all that in a beautiful way worthy of his proved thespian skills, he also is a fan of the genre and worked really hard (script, editing, acting) for this movie to capture all that. That is what makes it shine and makes it one of the best comic book adaptation till date the people that did it love and get the genre.<br />He shares a great chemistry with Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and you can feel the love they had that was interrupted by Banner's tragedy and you can also feel that this time she won't let it go alone on his tragedy she will go with him till the ends of the planet against the whole world if is needed, that makes this romance work.<br />The villain is refreshing since is not the usual \\"take over the world\\" or \\"I love the same woman than you\\" is just someone who has so much fire inside that it consumes him, Roth makes a great performance of that. And of course the general (Hurt) also plays a central role on the film. The little cameos and easter eggs are highly enjoyable and make the movie twice as fun.<br />I didn't gave them 5 stars because is perfect, is far from that the CGI is not perfect and it could had used a longer running time, more last fight with more HULK SMASH! and more of Banner's strugles and Betty's relationship. But it earns the 5 stars out of how good everything works out togheter on the movie and how much it let's you craving for more.<br />Worth it of watching on the movie theater, more than once like in my case, and worth it of owning it.<br />I can't wait to see what is called the Norton's cut to see a longer deeper movie as this talented filmaker would had wanted to.<br />But meanwhile I think I will watch the Incredible Hulk at the movie theater again!the movie twice as fun.  I didn't gave them 5 stars because is perfect, is far from that the CGI is not perfect and it could had used a longer running time, more last fight with more HULK SMASH! and more of Banner's strugles and Betty's relationship.

But meanwhile I think I will watch the Incredible Hulk at the movie theater again!
B0013FSL3E|3.0|Pros: The animation is outstanding even by Pixar standards. The love story between the two main characters is cute and even though they are robots you end up almost believing it could happen. The secondary characters are shallow but add good comedy relief. Wall-E is an extremely lovable character which was pulled off very well especially considering Pixar gave him nothing to say but his own name.<br /><br />Cons: One of my concerns of having Disney own Pixar is that Disney will end up ruining them. And it looks like Disney's agenda has crossed the line, that's why this gets 3 stars. The movie is one long sermon on man destroying this planet. If you adhere to Al Gores \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" you'll probably love this movie but if you don't the preaching may get a bit old. While in the end there is hope (man made) it's not enough to pull this movie from the left wing propaganda.<br /><br />Pixar needs to return to a good storyline that's entertaining, without the social commentary.  Don't we get enough of that already? Let children be children and stop feeding them lies to scare them into submission. Even the obvious effects of obesity and lethargy, although true in many cases, doesn't have to be touted in a family picture.<br /><br />The Pixar Short \\"Presto\\" which was shown before the feature gets 5 big stars. Very very funny and clever.
0395645662|5.0|If the ultimate goal of book club is to develop deep comprehension and critical thinking skills, then this book is the perfect tool.  There is so much for students to pour over in search for meaning.  It is unsettling at several different levels, and I would expect a fairly mature book club to find their way into conversation without much prodding from the teacher.<br /><br />I would not start book club rookies out on this for their first book.  I think the group would need to be fairly comfortable with each other and have a high level of trust and acceptance - students (and even teachers!) would need to feel confident to try out ideas without judgement and be able to sort out their thoughts in an open, caring atmosphere.<br /><br />In my experience, many book club books often have very superficial themes that students grasp and extract connections from.  I don't think such books propel them to higher levels of thought and understanding.  I often hear something like, \\"This book is about a brother and sister fighting, and I sometimes fight with my sister too.\\"  There just isn't anything for them to take their ideas a step futher.  When the book clearly presents thought-provoking themes that students grab onto and want to discuss, it is a wonderful thing.  Book clubs are for books that MUST be discussed and CANNOT be read and understood (quite as fully) by yourself.  This is exactly the type of book that is made for book club.
B001AU8ZLK|1.0|This album sucks! I was a dedicated fan up until now. This is a perfect example of a band rushing to get another album out too soon. Why? I kept hoping that if I listened to it two or three times that I  might grow to like it--well, it hasn't happened.
1593080255|5.0|Other reviewers have already covered the plot of Dorian Gray as well as the numerous reasons why you should read the book. I've contented myself with providing you a list of epigrams contained in the book I found especially wisdom-filled or humorous:<br /><br />\\"The moments were lost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away.\\"<br /><br />\\"...to be highly organised is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence.\\"<br /><br />\\"'To be good is to be in harmony with one's self.

B000087F6M|4.0|I have always liked this film and I was so glad when it was finally released on DVD--especially the newer version w/a few extras (blue background on the cover). Redford & Winger are a charming, combative romantic duo with real spark & heart. Some of the antics are a bit overplayed--especially in relation to Darryl Hannah's femme fatale character, Chelsea. But, it's a winning film nonetheless, thanks to Redford & Winger and the smash soundtrack \\"Love Touch\\".
0812550757|5.0|I had been warned that even though Speaker for the Dead continues the story of Ender's life, and is set in the same universe, that it's not that much of a sequel--that is, it's not the same kind of book. Which was a relief to me, to tell you the truth. [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]] was a complete story, and I'd been dreading the kind of sequel that would be Ender vs. a different kind of alien, which would just spoil the whole thing.    Instead, it's set 3000 years later, but due to a whole lot of light-speed travel, Ender's only in his 30s (I think--I'm not positive, and I'm not going to search for it. It's not that important. At any rate, he's an adult, in his prime.). He's become a Speaker for the Dead, the original Speaker for the Dead, but nobody realizes that. His purpose is to learn all about someone's life--not just the good things, like in a eulogy, but everything--their hopes, dreams, fears, and failings--and then Speak for them. It's what he did for the Buggers after destroying them, then published the book, earning for himself instead of the accolades he'd received, the title of \\"Ender the Xenocide,\\" and his name is now reviled.    Humanity has learned a lesson, and now contact with alien races is strictly limited. On the planet Lusitania is the only other sentient race humanity has discovered: nicknamed the Piggies. The humans are required to stay within their fences and observe only, not give any information to the Piggies. But the Piggies learn anyway, from the questions they're asked, and then the anthropologist studying them is brutally slaughtered, and nobody knows why.    Ender is summoned to speak a death on the planet, and ends up bringing pain and healing. And, well, here's the whole point of the book:  [[ASIN:B000MK6BWY to know him is to love him]] that truly knowing a person, or an alien race, understanding them completely, is to love or at least care for them. The message got a little heavy-handed for me by the end, hence the half-star reduction.    Otherwise, the story was interesting, the characters compelling, the mystery intriguing. I'll be reading more. I've already got [[ASIN:0312861877 Xenocide (Ender, Book 3) (Ender Quartet)]] in my TBR pile.

B00006YXOX|5.0|Bruckner is amongst my favorite composers of the 19th century's second half.  That is, he is a favorite when he is properly presented.  I've heard Jochum several times in person playing these works and own most if not all his other versions on CD as well.  This set is better played than the EMI/Dresden version, although that one has more \\"guts\\" because the orchestra is going all out at every moment.  While the brass go sharp a lot in Dresden, the whole point is to wring every last ounce of energy out of the orchestra, no matter how good or bad.      I think this is the best complete set as a starter.  The recording, made in the stereo era when multi tracking was not used to \\"remix\\" the orchestra after the fact, shows off Jochum's balances, not those of a producer or engineer.  I find them far superior to later DGG versions where the product tends to sound the same from conductor to conductor after about 1975!  Von Karajan's are so heavily played with that real life and his recordings never quite come together.      A few spots:  The magical ending of the Fifth Symphony.  It is powerful, rich and glowing, and yet compliments the softest passages while still making the difference between them sound as correct in balance as possible.  Jochum was, after all, an organist!  He understood Bruckner AS an organist, and that's why he is so special in his interpretations of the composer.  The 42 Furtwangler would be my other choice, but it does not have the upper registration sheen that the modern recording does (that doesn't matter to me, but it will to some.  WF also takes wildly varying tempi and Jochum is more centered, still they are both at the very top.)    The slow movement of the 7th.  The penultimate cadential measure before  the slow build of the great final climax; the second violins play the last two beats - four 8th notes: A, two F##s, (the open G string) and then, all while slowing, the final 8th G#.  These are done without vibrato on the A and G# to match the open G string on the F##s.  This moment sets up the rising firsts as well as the main them in the seconds and violas as C# minor is reestablished all the way to the gigantic climax in, of all keys, C major.  It is a small point, but one I always listen for.  If it is rushed the whole climax can be ruined. If it is covered up it doesn't make the cadence sound right.  With every Jochum recording of the piece it ever so quietly stands out, not just this DGG version.  The cadence to, as well as the flow of the C# minor theme is prepared for perfectly here.  I admit it is a small thing.  Still, if you can turn off the phone and TV and just listen to the flow of the work, you'll hear this moment as something very special.    Finally the 9th.  While I will always take Giulini's version with Vienna as the last word in this piece, Jochum gives it the master's touch.  How rare it is to hear the introduction played with such economy while maintaining its utter sense of the mysterious.  Recent recordings have been so badly balanced that it makes me wonder if the conductor listened to the playbacks!  And then as we build to that first big octave drop from the whole orchestra we get a \\"luftpause\\" just before it.  Jochum is consistent with this approach throughout his career.  Most conductors don't use one at that point, but it is a special touch, one that represents the changing of manuals on the organ as well keeping the listener slightly off guard.    I could write thousands of words about these performances, but I'd rather just say, I think they're the best overall modern set, and for the used price of $23 that I just saw, its a steal.  I paid full price for mine when they first came out on both LP and CD. If only I'd known Amazon was on the way....well, I wouldn't have waited.  These are too good to wait for :)
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|One of the best DVD's I've ever purchased.  Best film of all time, actually worthy of its 11 Oscars (unlike Lord of the Rings- come on, their song was just bad; it should have won 10).  Hauntingly beautiful music. Devastatingly sad ending (if it weren't for Leonardo, the annoying man). Oscar-winning performance by Kate (well, deserving). Brilliant special FX, stages, basically everything. Simply a jaw-dropping, super-long-but-worth-it movie.  It's considered one of the best movies of all time by some, considered the best of all time by many (myself included) and boasts incredible popularity which in 1998 was the only thing talked about at the water-cooler. Now, sadly, people seem to mock it and diss it for whatever reasons (apparently it's not emo enough to be cool any more). But people who didn't grow up with this just don't get it. They never will, either. Which is their loss. The memories this movie brings to so many across the world is... monumental, to say the least.  Probably one of the last truly original movies made to this date.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I am a little lost on this one ? I have absolutely no idea what they where thinking or doing ?  I have been a fan of this band since 1994's masterpiece \\"Dummy\\" and even liked \\"Portishead's (2nd). For years I couldn't understand for the life of me why they never returned? Well, it is pretty self explanatory they had nothing left in them to give. When I heard that this was finally the year the actual release was coming.. I was excited. For years there had been many groups that duplicated their sound or right out claimed to be Portishead. I listened to this album three times and never went back which isn't a good sign. This sounds not to far off from the Beth Gibbons and Rustin Man project ! So what was the need in having the group you can barely tell their present !       There were so many fake albums on the net and so many groups that copied or remixed old songs. Well, you would think that Geoff would sit back and say ..we have to make a impact? Well we were all wrong horribly wrong in fact it had the opposite effect ! This album sounds very spare and it lacks alot of production quality. The songs are spare and they sound unfinished and only replications of previous work. Nothing new nothing fresh nothing innovative. \\"Nylon Smile\\" is possibly the only track on here that really stands out. If you want a good album that was inspired by this band. And sounds like this one should have sounded and has amazing vocals ? Go and pick up a group named \\"Sissy\\" the album is entitled \\"All Under\\". Even pick up a friend of mine named \\"Costanza\\" Sonic Diary. You will not be disappointed this is what Trip Hop is all about (creativeness). Portishead I think paved the way for a fine genre but if this is the most they can give. They will soon be nothing more than a novelty act or completely irrelevant. Someone couldn't have said it better: If this wasn't Portishead this album would have been overlooked.      Arish
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I don't often say something is perfect, but that's what this movie is. I don't know why I like Return to Oz so much. I like the MGM movie, I guess, and I've never really found the books captivating. Or even the anime series in the '80s.  This movie gets me for so many reasons. For one, it's so diverse in its intentions, and packs a load of hidden gems.  For one, it's a kids film... for adults. It's hard to explain. On its initial release nobody saw it because back then, kids saw mind-numbing kids movies, and adults saw mature films. It never mixed, so nobody really gave this a chance. But now, in the age of discovery and acceptance, it's a cult hit. Who would have guessed? Well, me. I saw this when it aired twice on television in the early '90s, and never forgot it. I went out and rented the badly damaged VHS tape in the late '90s and have loved it ever since.  But this DVD is... brilliant. It looks like it could have been made yesterday. Perhaps this is because the original version was not touched very often. The picture is breath-takingly sharp, and the 5.1 surround sound is perhaps some of the greatest I've ever witnessed, and I'm a bit of a picky perfectionist. The surround in the climax builds and builds. It's simply grand.  For a movie that has been shunned by Disney (their sort of illegitimate daughter), it sure is given the good treatment here, and rightfully so. It is in my opinion one of the finest movies ever made. It's dark, twisted just like the books, has a wonderful cast, BEAUTIFUL music, and an eerie \\"make up your own mind\\" twisted logic where reality is concerned. Is Dorothy dreaming it all up, or is it real? Sort of a Pan's Labyrinth situation, really. I'm a bit of a downer, I think that it's all in Dorothy's head, and this makes me sad because I think of what she would have gone through in her later life suffering from these mental problems. Clearly she has no real friends besides from Toto.  The hidden gems as I mentioned above, aren't all that hard to find, if you're perceptive. For instance, in the asylum, there is a shot of HEAD Nurse Wilson standing next to a door with the number '31' printed on it. Nurse Wilson's neck is covered by her dress, so all you see is her HEAD. Later in the movie, the Oz-counterpart of Wilson, being Mombi, keeps her original HEAD in cabinet 31.  Another instance, Doctor Worley continues to dapple with electricity and wishes to become a sort of electrical 'marvel'. In Oz, his counterpart is the Nome King, who is a marvel himself, a magician of sorts... who longs to be 'human'. The exact opposite of his Kansas counterpart. Which brings us to Ozma... Some say she is Dorothy's counterpart, which is why they only meet at the beginning and end of her journey. This could be why Ozma is only seen through mirrors. Perhaps this is how the two wind up in Oz, by disappearing in the reflective waters of the river. I don't know. This is just theory. Anyway, all of the characters in Oz, minus Billina the hen, have their own sort of counterparts in Kansas. You've just got to keep your eye out for them in the 20 minutes leading up to the dramatic escape from the asylum.  So yes, Return to Oz. Quite a brilliant film from a psychological stand-point. Quite a terrifying film on most other points. Eerie is the word, actually. Either way, it far surpasses the original movie, and anybody who disagrees is not a fan of the books, or the original plot, and quite frankly is just a grump.
B000BBOUCW|5.0|Great movie if you're a fan of FFVII saga.  I picked this up to supplement my Crisis Core experience.  Loved em both.  Good service too.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|THIS 1969 RECORDING FROM MILES DAVIS WAS THE FIRST \\"TRUE\\" ALL FUSION MUSIC ALBUM EVERMADE, FEATURING A WHO'S WHO OF THE ARTISTS THAT WENT ON TO DEFINE AND INVENT THAT GENRE; JOE ZAWINUL, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, CHICK COREA, HERBIE HANCOCK, TONY WILLIAMS, AND OTHER  LUMINARIES.  THIS IS A BREAKTHROUGH RECORDING, MADE A YEAR EARLIER THAN THE MUCH MORE HERALDED BITCHES' BREW REOCRDINGS.  DEFINING MOMENT IN JAZZ MUSIC, WHEN IT CORSSED THE BRIDGE TO INCORPORATE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF JAZZ, ROCK, POLYRHYTHMS, AND WORLD MUSIC.  TWO TRACKS, EACH ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES LONG, THIRTY EIGHT MINUTES ALTOGETHER OF BRILLIANCE.
076792603X|5.0|I really enjoyed this NOVEL and I think most \\"normal\\" believers would absolutely love it as well.  Well worth the read!  Don't dis it before you read it all the way through like some morons around here.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Alanis' new CD Flavors of Entanglement has been long awaited, at least by me. It follows the spiritual/philosophical progression of her recent albums. In this album Alanis' songs are much less angry (although there are still a good handful of dark songs on there) than her earlier material, and more about achieving some sense of internal peace. I   personally prefer her more upbeat sound so my two favorites are \\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\" and \\"Incomplete\\". Another song that intrigued me was \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\". I think it's interesting to listen to the evolution in feministic attitude toward men since her first album. From the familiarly angry \\"You Oughta Know\\", to \\"A Man\\" on Under Rug Swept that shows the male side of the story, \\"In Praise\\" shows a more supportive, enlightened feministic slant. Her literally poetic lyrics are   still present in all the songs as well as her movement toward inner enlightenment and a wordly consciousness. What I love about Alanis' albums is that you can connect and learn from the messages in her songs.   While I had more trouble connecting to her need for a buddhist-like awareness, I can appreciate what can be gained from listening. There's a good mix of dark, light, and slow songs on this album. So if you're a   fan of her last two, I would recommend purchasing this one as well.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm not really over weight, but I am out of shape. I'm 4'11\\" and 96 pounds, but my tummy is loose and I really need to tone up. I got this video thinking, whatever, another video that will probably be lame, NOT THE CASE!  This video is friggin hard!  Its fast paced, and its non stop!  By the end I am begging Jillian to let up!  I have done it three times, everyday the past 3 days and I swear to you, I am SO SORE!  My legs are killing me, my butt, thighs and  calves are all sore.  The only thing that I will start working out more on my own are my abs.  Or maybe I will pair this with my abs of steel video(old school but still effective).<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel the BURN!<br /><br />I will report back when I see progress.  I think I will see great things by the end of this 30 Day Shred!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Just an all-around great collection from Alanis.  Had to listen to it twice, all the way through, before coming to that conclusion...her music takes more to absorb for me....but that's why she's great!  The complex music that is behind her deep (although at times simply stated) thoughts....what a great mixture!  I LOVE the extra songs that come with the deluxe edition....makes me wonder why they aren't on the main edition, they're so engaging.  I gotta say, this is what Alanis is about...raw, deep, emotional music with a great beat.  It is a great way for her to return to the music scene and reclaim the glory of her first and third CD.
B000PE8DXM|5.0|This is probably my son's favorite toy.  He spends hours running his cars up and down the ramps and lining his cars up in various fashions.  He doesn't use the elevator much even though I think this is a cool part of this toy.  It could be because the elevator takes some work and dexterity that he doesn't quite have at 3.  This toy is very sturdy.  Two minor issues with this toy.  The ramps come off easy as another reviewer said and also there are holes into the elevator shaft.  I have had to take part of the garage apart on two occasions when my son found things to put in the holes.  Overall a great toy.
0312427999|1.0|Klein displays a stunning breadth of economic and historical ignorance.    She literally doesn't know what she's writing about.    Her accusations against Friedman are completely without merit.  She completeley mischaracterizes and/or misunderstands the quotes and events she includes.    If you love to indulge in fantasy conspiracies without regard to the truth, then by all means jump into this.    Otherwise, save yourself time and money and read something else.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|It is the best Judas Album since the Painkiller and sounds like a soundtrack album of an epic movie.
0316143472|2.0|I puchased the audio book narrated by the author, himself.<br /><br />I had never read or even heard of Mr. Sedaris before.<br /><br />If I had to capsulize this book in a sentence, I would call it \\"Rambling musings of an aging, self-loathing 'queen'.\\" (And I don't mean the last word to be pejorative or homophobic in the least.) Some of the shorter vignettes are quite droll and mildly diverting.  In the main, though, I found the autobiographical tales to be dull and a bit depressing.  The longest of the essays, called \\"Smoking Section\\" is practically a daily log.  It goes on far too long and failed utterly to hold this listener's interest.  Even the two or three essays recorded before live audiences, where they evoked audible laughter, did not make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />I think I'll go to the library and try to find one of Mr. Sedaris's older books -- the ones the some other reviewers promise to be actully funny.  Maybe his writing was more interesting when he was drunk and/or stoned.<br /><br />I may be being a bit over-critical.  Any work that piques my interest enough to look for something by the same author can't be entirely unsuccessful.
0812974611|3.0|Summary:  Pompeii by Robert Harris is a historical fiction novel told from the point of view of an aquaduct civil engineer (interesting premise).  He is used to bind the various elements of Life in and around Pompeii leading up to and including the eruption of Mt. Vesuveus.  The political corruption, engineering mastery and social decedance of life in the late stages of the Roman Empire are hinted at but not much detail.  The characters are ok not very developed but effective; the prose is tight and efficient; and the pacing is done well.    Characters: The novel is fairly short so the character development seems to have been left out to a large degree.  The architypal Romans are worked into the story but mostly a plot devices vs. true characters.  The main character, Attilius, seems a bit too modern for the time period.  He is strong anti-Gods which is not appropriate for the times -- he comes across as a agnostic modern civil engineer.  Pliny the Elder is probably the most developed of the characters in the story -- nicely done.    Plot: The plot is pretty simple; Attilius is made the new engineer in charge of the aquaduct when the old engineer dissappeared two weeks earlier.  Attilius gets involved when sulphur is detected in the water.  The story goes from there using the aquaduct as a way to move characters around the Bay of Naples and interconnect the political players of Pompeii with the action.  The plot does not have many twists but shows how easy government can get corrupted and why big government is not good.    Prose: The prose is tight and efficient -- like the engineer.  The flowery prose of Pliny is a nice addition to the somewhat stark writing style.  It is a quick and fun read.  The information on aquaducts was very interesting to me...especially the fact the water kept running after the eruption.  You have to admire the Romans as civil engineers; unparalled in the world.    Action: The action is interesting; the stages of the volcano eruption are interesting to find out about and how they would manifest in Roman society plus a bit of the reaction to the effects.  You should be expecting a huge amount of action but it obviously picks up as the eruptions gets really going.      Overall: 3 stars - 3.5 stars  Characters: 2.5 stars - 3 stars  Plot: 3 stars  Prose: 3.5 stars  Action: 2 stars
B000002MNR|1.0|got given this today, and whilst being a fan of mark knofler and dire straits, i can't stand this. full of drippy, sniveling, rubbish.  none of the soulful bluesy or even fun-filled stuff that i know and love.  my girl got it as a present for me, and i hate it that much that i couldn't even be civil enough to lie about it.      i thoroughly recommend that you audition this before purchasing it...    and it is sorely lacking the maestro on his guitar, reminding us that, \\"man that guy can play...\\"
0385340567|1.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher novels and couldn't wait for this.  But, how disappointing it was!! Lee Child has gone to the liberal left.  He had Reacher taking multiple snide remarks about our military in Iraq. The evil in this book was a midwest preacher, who 'owned' a town of religious zealots intent on detonating a bomb to bring on the Rapture. If the theme wasn't bad enough, Child filled the pages with extensive unrelated and boring minutiae suck as every cup of coffe and shower taken.  Jack Reacher must be ashamed to be in this book.  Save your money on this loser.  Madeline
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I loved the book, hated the movie.  When I first read the book I thought this would be a great movie.  Finally they made the movie, I saw it opening night and all I could think was, God did they blow it!  My date had not read the book so I loaned it to him afterwards and he to said it was a great opportunity lost.        The movie plot was almost non-existant, what there was made no sense.  The book went deeper into the lonliness of being the only jumper, had more suspense and background. It had Davy actually using his power for a good reason. I could go on but lets just say READ THE BOOK! forget the movie.       Spoiler alert(movie only)       Question:       How did Davys mom go from being a lower middle class housewife to a paladin living in a million dollar mansion?
B000ZK4466|5.0|This album takes you on a unbelievable trip through the minds of Cedric and Omar. The progression and transition of all of the songs are spectacular. Listening to the album from front to back is needed in order to appreciate the album's beauty. This album shows the growth of Omar's talent not by just guitar solos, but by the complex set up of the songs. The drummer that appears on this album is unbelivable, and adds a lot of power and soul to the music. With the completion of this album, it proves that The Mars Volta is definitly the most talented group of musicians out there right now. Buy this album if you are a fan of any other Mars Volta albums.

B00164DWEA|4.0|I watched the First Hulk movie (the one with  Jennifer Connelly) and I actually don't remember it anymore -_- What i do remember was that it was too melodramatic/somber/drama. Now this movie has everything, action and drama! The pacing was good - I didn't think it was too slow or fast. The cast acted very well and I really have no complaints overall. I didn't expect to like it because initially I thought the CG of Hulk looked fake. But as I started watching it, I forgot all about that. Anyway, love it and got shivers when I saw the cameo of Robert Downey Jr. COOL BEANS!!! I hope they make that sequel with the Avengers but with all those big names, can they make that budget?!!
1591841992|5.0|I have always been fascinated by visual thinking & visual problem solving.<br /><br />I attribute this captivation of mine partly to my engineering training - seeing the problem first before getting to the solution.<br /><br />In the earlier years of my professional career, my field guide to visual thinking & visual problem solving happened to be Henning Nelms' 'Thinking with a Pencil'. I could relate to it very quickly because of my engineering work.<br /><br />In subsequent years, I had picked up the mind-mapping techniques from Tony Buzan, which led me to explore other visual tools, partly fueled by my curiosity.<br /><br />One of them was the mind-scaping techniques from Nancy Margulies. Another was the rapid visualisation techniques from Kurt Hanks, especially his wonderful book, 'Rapid Viz', which gave me a more fun & spontaneous approach.<br /><br />As I moved into the upper echelons of marketing & management, in conjunction with my career progression, I came across Terry Richey's 'Marketer's Visual Toolkit: Using Charts, Graphs, & Models for Strategic Planning & Problem Solving'.<br /><br />Prior to it, I didn't realise a simple box matrix could do so much wonders to understanding problems. As a matter of fact, today the Nine Block Matrix is one of my most favourite business analytical tools.<br /><br />This was followed by Larry Raymond's 'Reinventing Communication: A Guide for Using Visual Language for Planning, Problem Solving & Re engineering'.<br /><br />The journey metaphor was a real eye opener for me, especially in terms of thinking strategically.<br /><br />Both of them certainly gave me many broad perspectives about using more effective visual approaches to get into the heart of business issues.<br /><br />In the early nineties, I went to the United States to learn advanced visual tools from the legendary Jim Channon. It was an awesome learning experience for me.<br /><br />His brilliant work then led me to discover David Sibbet of Grove Consultants, & Jerry McNellis (storyboarding), from both of whom I had learned to develop my own professional expertise in helping small businesses to expedite their problem solving as well as fine-tune their strategic planning techniques.<br /><br />As part of my strategy consulting & training development work in the ensuing years, with entrepreneurs, professionals, managers as well as students, I also started to explore graphic organisers & other visual organisers as power tools to manage information overload.<br /><br />In the last couple of years, a handful of experts have further expanded my personal understanding about making systems sense of challenging business situations. They are:<br /><br />- Alex Lowry & Phil Hood, 'The Power of the 2x2 Matrix: Using 2x2 Thinking to Solve Business Problems & Make Better Decisions';<br /><br />- John Bryson, 'Visible Thinking: Unlocking Causal Mapping for Practical Business Results';<br /><br />I have even indulged in what I call 'deliberate doodling', with some great help from the work of Joy Sikorski.<br /><br />As you can see, I have come a long way as far as exploring & practising visual thinking & visual problem solving are concerned. In many respects, my learning journey has been greatly influenced by the teachings of all the above mentioned experts.<br /><br />Against this backdrop, I am very glad to meet Dan Roam, through his wonderful book, 'The Back of the Napkin'. I have come across the book at first while browsing through some body's blog. Fortunately, to my great delight, I have managed to get a copy from Kinokuniya Bookstore quickly.<br /><br />I am still reading the book, & have yet to finish it - it's somewhat heavy going for a visual thinking book - but I have already started with real-world prototyping for use in my strategy consulting work.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the book has four critical sections, from my point of view, with two supporting technical appendices & an extended case study:<br /><br />- Part I: Looking at the problem;<br />- Part II: Seeing & Discovering Ideas;<br />- Part III: Imagining & Developing Ideas;<br />- Part IV: Showing & Selling Ideas;<br /><br />My initial adverse response while reading this book is that I have to get used to the hand-drawn stick figures [which I don't like] in the book, & also the need to do flip-flopping between images & text, but after a while, I just get used to them & finally, reading becomes a breeze, even though it's textually very dense.<br /><br />Tactically, it is a do-it-yourself book. So you have to work with it systematically to get what you need.<br /><br />Actually for me, & in application terms, the book is an expanded intellectual extension of Kurt Hank's rapid visualisation techniques, which are more spontaneous & artful, but Dan Roam has put in a more systems perspective - almost structured & yet still free-form, in a limited sense - to view issues or problems.<br /><br />What I like about the book from the beginning is the author's \\"Guide Rope to Visual Thinking\\", which outlines his comprehensive 4-step process, 3 built-in tools & 6 ways of seeing. They are basically the foundational tools, while the latter forms the six fundamental questions that guide how we see the world.<br /><br />I am glad that the \\"6 ways of seeing\\" has sparked off an interesting idea at my end - I can now synergise - in fact, I like to use the term 'synconvergise' from Michael Gelb - what I had picked up from an earlier book, 'So What? The Definitive Guide to the Only Business Questions that Matter', by Kevin Duncan, which I had reviewed earlier.<br /><br />All I can say so far is that all the techniques as introduced by the author certainly build on, or rather amplify, my current repertoire of abilities & skills to view, simplify & summarise complicated concepts with simple pictures.<br /><br />To end this post, let me paraphrase the author: \\"Welcome to a whole new way of looking at business . . . The heart of business is the art of problem solving . . . Visual thinking means taking advantage of our innate ability to see . . .\\"ponse while reading this book is that I have to get used to the hand-drawn stick figures [which I don't like] in the book, & also the need to do flip-flopping between images & text, but after a while, I just get used to them & finally, reading becomes a breeze, even though it's textually very dense.

B0013FXWX8|5.0|The tagline from the movie preview was certainly enticing: PREPARE FOR AWESOMENESS!<br /><br />So, on Thursday afternoon, my gym buddy & I decided to go & watch the latest movie from Dreamworks Animation, 'Kung Fu Panda', at Jurong Point.<br /><br />It was a hilarious & yet heart-warming movie as the whole movie theatre was roaring with laughter from start to finish.<br /><br />In fact, we were surrounded by many kids & their parents, as part of their June school holiday outings.<br /><br />In a nut shell, the movie was all about the adventures (or misadventures?) of a young goofy Panda named Po (voiced by Jack Black) with big dreams of becoming a kung fu fighter in the village, known as the Valley of Peace.<br /><br />By day, he was a lowly cook/waiter in the noodle restaurant of his father, Mr Ping, a goose (James Hong; this incomprehensible relationship wasn't explained in the movie) & by night he often fantasised as a side-kick to the formidable fighting quintet, known as the Furious Five, comprising Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) & Monkey (Jackie Chan). They happened to be his fondest idols.<br /><br />One day, by a stroke of serendipity, & with accidental fireworks of course, he gate-crashed a village tournament organised by Master Shifu, a small mustachioed red panda (Dustin Hoffman) under the watchful eye of a aging but wise turtle named Oogway. The latter was apparently the Grand Master, who seemed to have a fondness for fortune-cookie aphorisms.<br /><br />Their principal objective was to elect the Dragon Warrior to deal with impending havoc from a vengeful & treacherous snow leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />The latter was locked up - in fact, he was the only prisoner - in a maximum security monolithic prison, built like a fortress with imposing defence mechanisms & guarded by a large bunch of armoured rhinoes. Somehow, the Grand Master had this premonition that this menacing rascal would soon break out of prison.<br /><br />Against the wishes of Master Shifu, as well as to the chagrin of the Furious Five, especially Tigress, who was the one most eligible for the title, & of course to his own bewilderment, Po was inadvertently elected by the Grand Master as the Dragon Warrior.<br /><br />In the next part of the movie, Master Shifu & the Furious Five tried to make life extremely miserable for Po, hoping that he would quit.<br /><br />They eventually had to make a reluctant turnaround to train him as the Dragon Warrior, after seeing that this big fat, easily distracted but perpetually hungry, young apprentice had some endearing value in him, especially for his genuine love just to be like the Furious Five.<br /><br />To his great delight, Po was put through a rigorous crash course under the tutelage of Master Shifu, who found that dumplings was a powerful motivator for his new apprentice to get going.<br /><br />It was real fun to watch the clumsy Po going through all the training manoeuvres with - as well as all the whacking by - Master Shifu.<br /><br />The lightning-fast chopstick routines with the last dumpling in a bowl was a memorable classic.<br /><br />I like the part when he finally grasped the last dumpling with his chopsticks, & instead of eating it, he threw it back to his master, & said \\"I'm not hungry\\". Wow! I could see the grin on Master Shifu's face, subtly acknowledging that the young disciple had finally made the grade.<br /><br />In the remaining half of the movie, we saw the spectacular breakout from prison by Tai Lung, his ferocious battle with the Furious Five at the rope bridge, & his ruthless assault on Master Shifu, during which all the good guys were badly defeated.<br /><br />In the last climatic scene, Po appeared suddenly & after some fancy footwork & playful routines, he eventually beat the hell out of the rogue fighter, who once had also the dream to become the Dragon Warrior.<br /><br />According to the story, Tai Lung wasbrought up from a young puppy by Master Shifu with the hope of becoming the ultimate warrior. Unfortunately, because of his ulterior motives (lost to the dark side, so to speak), he was defeated & banished by the Grand Master to the mountain prison for twenty years. This explained why he was really sore about the whole affair.<br /><br />To be frank, both my gym buddy & I were mesmerised by the well-choreographed, visually-stunning action sequences, against the backdrop of photo-realistically textured computer-generated imagery - vast, moody, misty landscapes, pastel sunsets, hazy mountain vistas, dewy flowering trees, fanciful interiors, & traditional Chinese colors (dominated by red & gold) - throughout the entire movie of almost ninety minutes' length.<br /><br />I must say Kung Fu Panda is the best animation movie I have watched so far. Talent-wise, both Jack Black & Dustin Hoffman had brought life to the entire show with their characters' voices.<br /><br />The most poignant scene was the part when the Grand Master handed the final baton, so to speak, to Master Shifu, & after that, he just evaporated gradually into the thin mountain air, amidst a delicate swirl of pink petals. Wow!<br /><br />The last scene, just before the credit titles, was amusing & wonderful too, while both Master Shifu & Po were lying, in peace so to speak, with their backs on the temple steps, & Po suddenly asked: \\"Shall we go & get something to eat?\\"<br /><br />More importantly, at least for me, there are many valuable lessons to be learned from the movie for young people, as follows, especially drawing from the witty dialogue:<br /><br />1) \\"There are no accidents.\\"<br /><br />- Everything happens for a reason. We just have to learn to find the true meaning of the events in our lives. No matter what happens to us, not only does something valuable come out of it, but it may be just what we need.<br /><br />2) \\"A real warrior never quits.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.\\"<br /><br />- This certainly resonates very well with what William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925), well-known US Congressman, once said: \\"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for; it is a thing to be achieved.\\"<br /><br />Many of our trials & heartaches are not designed to make us bitter but better in life. The fact is, troubles do not always last, but tough people do.<br /><br />The only people I know with no trials, troubles & challenges are those in the graveyard.<br /><br />4) \\"To make something special, you just have to believe that it is.\\"<br /><br />- If you believe in yourself, you can do anything, including creating miracles;<br /><br />5) \\"You are too concerned with 'what was' & 'what will'. Yesterday was history; tomorrow is a mystery, & today is a gift; that's why it's called a present.\\"<br /><br />- Don't waste time. Seize the day!<br /><br />6) \\"The mark of a true hero is humility.\\"<br /><br />- Definitely, well said.<br /><br />7) \\"You have to let go off your illusion of control.\\"<br /><br />- This was the vital message from the Grand Master to Master Shifu, as the latter struggled incessantly to understand the ultimate decision to train Po as the chosen one;<br /><br />Likewise, sometimes in life, we tend to want to control everything that goes around us, which often cause us to lose touch with the greater picture or larger reality of our life;<br /><br />8) \\"There are no good news or bad news; just news.\\"<br /><br />- It's not what had happened to us, it's what we choose to think & do with what had happened;<br /><br />9) \\"There isn't any secret ingredient.\\"<br /><br />- It's already in each & every one of us. This was reflected in the movie, when Po found out that there wasn't anything written - it was actually blank, with a reflective surface - in the Dragon Scroll, which was believed to grant limitless power.<br /><br />Likewise, when he found out, to his dismay, fromhis father that there wasn't anything special in the noodles, either.<br /><br />10) \\"The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weaknesses & make him suffer for it.\\"<br /><br />- In the movie, Master Shifu grudgingly realised that Po had this natural propensity to hunt for food & would go to great length, with physical prowess, to attain it. So Master Shifu exploited it as powerful motivator for Po to pay attention to his training.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, Po also unwittingly realised that his greatest weaknesses - cheeky playfulness, roly poly belly & bouncing butt of fat & fuzz - turned out to be his greatest strengths, when fighting Tai Lung, who was terribly cynical of his opponent. Naturally, his physical prowess following the exhaustive training under Master Shifu helped, too.<br /><br />11) It's OK to say 'I don't know'.<br /><br />- In the movie, both the Grand Master & Master Shifu demonstrated that.<br /><br />When Master Shifu confronted the Grand Master: \\"But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power to become the Dragon Warrior?\\", the latter responded: \\"I don't know.\\"<br /><br />In the same vein, when Po challenged Master Shifu: \\"How are you gonna change me into the Dragon Warrior? How?\\", the latter retorted: \\"I don't know\\".<br /><br />In the real world, we often don't like to admit this, for fear of being ridiculed or of looking stupid among our peers.<br /><br />12) A master can only show the path or the way.

0743298039|5.0|\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" centers on the life of Vida Winter, a renowned writer who has fed journalists with fabrications of her roots.  Nearing the end of her life, she commissions Margaret Lea, a bookish amateur biographer, to write her story, and vows to tell the truth this time.  This story, we learn early on, is the thirteenth tale Vida has withheld from her book \\"Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation.\\"  The story Vida relates is one of extreme dysfunction within the Angelfield family that spans three generations.  Prominent in her tale are the twins Emmeline and Adeline March, and the bizarre events that visited their lives and the lives of those around them.<br /><br />A novel about a book lover's search for truths, this strange story is awash in gothic elements and abundant references to 19th-century gothic masters, most notably the two Brontes and Collins, as well as the more contemporary du Maurier.  Any stranger and it would have had to reference Stoker.  For someone like me who eschews romance, gothic or otherwise, and prefers the extremely dark fiction that deals with the more sensational subject of mental aberrations, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" faithfully delivers on its promises.<br /><br />Having decided to stamp her first novel as gothic fiction, Ms. Setterfield goes at it with gusto, employing all the tried-and-true tropes of its genre.  It has no pretensions to being grand literature.  Rather, it's a genuine effort at old-fashioned storytelling, complete with \\"ghosts,\\" a decrepit manor, certifiable lunatics and things that go bump in the night.  It is archaic, anachronistic, archetypal, and downright entertaining.  It didn't promise to be anymore than that.  The writing is artistic, the plot is implausibly weird but oddly fascinating, and the characters are intriguing in their wretchedness.  It lures with its beginning, mystifies with its middle, and satisfies with its end.
0151013837|5.0|Very nice edition of a great book.  The illustrations are nicely done.  Highly recommended.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This was my original review when I had the Swivel Sweeper for about a week: \\"I love the Swivel Sweeper!  I have a 4000 square foot house and I can't keep up the cleaning with vaccuum cleaners.  It's too overwhelming to lug around a vaccuum and plug in the unit in every room.  I have developed a weekly regimen where I use a swiffer for the floors and the Swivel Sweeper for the rugs - very easy!!!!!  I use the vacuums for company and deep cleaning, but the Swivel is great for that in-between cleaning!\\"    Now, just a couple of weeks later, the charge only lasts for about a minute and that's only for bare floors.  It can't handle anything.  It's the same issue detailed in other reviews.    DON'T CHANCE IT!  Buy a Dirt Devil cordless vac for only about $59 which we did today.
0743243153|5.0|excellent self help book.  a must read for everyone. You will be happy and successful in life if you follow the principles of this book.
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|As with most all uber-hyped pop albums, this one doesn't go deep and raw enough to be fantastic (if it did, it would make too many enemies).
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I have seen the concert in person and the DVD version. It was great to pick up the detail I couldn't see live.
0553573403|3.0|I'm don't really understand what all the hubbub is about.  I hadn't really read a fantasy book since I was a kid, and wanted to see if there was anything left for me in the genre now that I'm older.  This book caught my eye because it was billed as \\"fantasy for intelligent people,\\" but I'm not sure it wholly lived up to that promise.<br /><br />The characters lacked depth; many can be summed up in a few words.  There is an honorable lord, a bastard with a good heart but a chip on his shoulder, and a tomboyish girl who would rather be a warrior than a lady.  Some of the characters are a little more complicated, but not by much.  The plot had a few twists and turns, but wasn't nearly as interesting as plots of other mass market fiction books (like, say, the Bourne books).  And the writing had very little literary flair.  Martin will never be mistaken for Tolkein.<br /><br />I do admit that I read through the book with some interest, but at the end I left wishing that I would have done something else with the many hours that it took me to get through this thing.  As a 12 year old, I probably would have loved this book.  As a 26 year old, not so much.

B00164SY52|2.0|I compared this pressing to my Megaforce 33rpm pressing that I bought new in the 80s that is perfect condition. I played both on a high-end turntable (Basis/TriPlanar/Lyra) set-up through a tube preamp/solid state power amp and Sound Lab speakers with a Velodyne sub. Even during the mellow introduction I could tell that the Megaforce was much better. To my ears, the \\"original\\" (in quotes because it was first issued on a private label) issue's bass was tighter and went deeper, and the highs were more distinct and extended. The double kick on \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" was much easier to make out, and with the volume high enough the drums and bass guitar shook my gut. The volume didn't need to be turned up nearly as loud to reach a banging your head experience. The re-issue could not perform these feats.<br />  I know they claim that they used the original master tapes to make this new 45rpm re-issue, but perhaps the tapes have aged to a point where they are just plain old worn out. I can't see how this could be, really, because I have many re-issues of other titles and genres that have supposedly been pressed from the original masters that are nearly 40 years old, and they sound fantastic.<br />  I was disappointed with this pressing, to say the least. As a big Metallica fan I was hoping that this would be the \\"ultimate\\" pressing, but no way.<br />  I have to hand it to them, though. The thick cardboard gatefold cover is great. The thick vinyl is perfectly flat, and the vinyl surfaces are silent underneath the music and between tracks (when there is an actual space between the tracks).<br />  I'm going to play my old version again. What a great record!
B000UR9QIK|4.0|Any true Romero Zombie fan who has entered the HD age MUST have this so reviews will mean little in their buying decision. Thankfully the transfer is very nice and sharp, obviously they pulled a fresh print so the source for it is solid. This is not a movie that is terribly demanding on your sound system so nothing much to say with regards to the audio. If this review seems kind of \\"eh\\" I guess it's just because there is nothing astounding here either pro and con. It fully met expectations and did not dissapoint.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Hollywood is concerned about the environment.  That's the message I'm getting with most of the films I see these days.  I bought a few DVD's and CD's the other day and they were inside \\"biodegradable packaging\\" (which, far as I can tell, is a fancy term for cardboard).  \\"Even Almighty\\" was made not only as a message about the environment, but it also used environment friendly techniques such as double sided scripts and green screens.  Green screens are so friendly to the environment (as well as have the bonus of being cheap) that almost half the movies filmed this year are being filmed with them.  And if THAT message isn't getting across to the adults, then Pixar's new film \\"Wall*E\\" will make sure the message gets across to the kids at least.<br /><br />I must give Disney credit: They covered up what this film was really about VERY good!  The movie starts off on the planet Earth, which pans over a city with big skyscrapers and then...oh wait, those aren't real skyscrapers.  No, they are blocks of trash used to create life-size replicas of buildings.  The real buildings are in the back, worn down and unlivable in.  The maker of these fake buildings is Wall*E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), who is a trash cleaner on Earth, but has since then developed a personality and spends his time collecting odd treasures.  When he finds a ring box with a ring inside he throws away the ring and keeps the box, because he likes how it opens and shuts.  His only friend is a cockroach, who should give adults who don't want to see this movie a similar excuse to not see it as the \\"I don't want to see `Ratatouille' because I don't like rats\\" excuse I heard way too much.<br /><br />Wall*E's biggest treasure is a worn-out VHS tape of \\"Hello Dolly,\\" one that gives him great ideas about love.  Then one day, a robot called Eve drops on Earth, and after a few misunderstandings the two begin a great friendship.  Now most of this you'll have seen on the trailers.  Disney billed this as a first rate romantic tale to the masses.  And it is, for the most part, but the movies true purpose comes into play once Wall*E and Eve leave Earth.  That's when the movie takes place on the Axiom, a ship that was built by a Wal-Mart like corporation to house humans until Earth could get cleaned up.  And as if to point fingers at Wal-Mart even more, all the humans are fat, sit on hover chairs all day, speaking to other people on monitors and clapping their hands whenever they need a refill on their super sized sodas.<br /><br />I don't go to Wal-Mart very much, but the few times I do I can't help but notice a good portion of overweight people who drive around in electronic shopping carts, acting as if walking has become a chore to them.  This movie takes that idea to the next step and asks us what will happen if that gets to a point where we don't even push the buttons anymore, and just let machines take us through our day.  Not too comforting is it?  During this scene I noticed a rather overweight woman sitting in front of me, who stopped eating what was left of her jumbo sized popcorn and jumbo sized drink (though she had already finished her two hot dogs and mini-pizza by then).  Though these scenes may be uncomfortable for many people to watch, as I observed, it's probably a good thing in the long run.<br /><br />Goodness me, it appears this review has gone in some very political directions.  Sorry, but what can I say?  \\"Wall*E\\" itself goes in some very political directions.  Earth has so much smoke in the air the sun is red.  I'm sorry to say that in my city, when I woke up this morning, so was my sky.  This movie is very concerned about our health and how we treat our Earth, and I predict recycling and bike riding is going to go up in popularity in our schools after kids see this.  Though that leads me to another dilemma: I don't know how the primary target audience (AKA: Families and kids) are going to react to this movie.  The movie is wonderfully animated, extremely daring, unbearingly cute, and it has classic written all over it.<br /><br />In fact, with the exception of a few scenes with the Axiom's captain, the movie is mostly dialog free, save for some boops and beeps.  This makes the film almost universal, and people are sure to have laughed and cried by the end of it.  But what to make of the films message?  The message that true love is there for everyone will likely be embraced.  The message that we are not doing a very good job at taking care of ourselves is likely to be met with resistance (as well as a potentially less then happy box office performance).  But you got to give it to Pixar, they must know that the movies going to depress someone.  How else can you explain the inclusion of one of their funniest shorts, involving a bunny and magician having a disagreement over a carrot, before the movie?  In a strange way, this Tex Avery style slapstick short may come off more fun then \\"Wall*E\\" itself, and this is a cartoon where the two try to KILL each other!  Oh well, what's can I say?  \\"Wall*E\\" is still one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Rating: **** and a half starsy cute, and it has classic written all over it.

0743277465|3.0|Josh Waitzkin is an eight time National Chess Champion by the age of 20 - who then moved on to become a martial arts champion - holding several world championship titles.  This book is worthy of reading simply to gain an insight into what it takes to be a world class competitor (and winner) - the focus, the incredible concentration, the physical and mental discipline, the grit and determination - and the access to the best coaches and opponents.  However, there was little translation from the \\"What\\" he accomplished to the \\"HOW\\" - as the learning techniques were were not spelled out.  If you expect to pick up this book to learn how to get to the top as a world champion, you'll be sorely disappointed.    This passage on page 88 captured the essence of his message to me:     \\"To my mind, the fields of learning and performance are an exploration of greyness - of the in-between.  There is the careful balance of pushing yourself relentlessly, but no so hard that you melt down.  Muscles and mind need to stretch to grow, but if stretched too thin, they will snap.  A competitor needs to be process-oriented, always looking for strong opponents to spur growth, but it is also important to keep on winning enough to maintain confidence.  We have to release our current ideas to soak in new material, but not so much that we lose touch with our unique nature talents.  Vibrant, creative idealism needs to be tempered by a practical, technical awareness.\\"
B000R8YC18|1.0|Bad acting, lame story and very poor execution. It could have been good if carried out right but it moves too slowly. The dialogue doesn't make much sense and it's like Martin was just killing film time by having the actors talk slowly so they had less to write. Nothing brilliant about this film, 1/5
B000000WJK|4.0|I remember when i first time I saw them on second stage of Loll. back in the day. I stumble upon them, the music they were playing was great. The following day the bought the tape. Now that dating me. anyway I had to add this cd to my collection finally. Good times.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|I've been a huge Shinedown fan since the beginning. I love seeing bands evolve, and this album is definitly something different, a very good different. I can't stand reading reviews from people who say \\"ohhhh they changed their sound, they're going to hell, they kick puppies.\\" Good bands are creative bands, and creative bands don't produce the same old stuff over and over and over again for mindless freaks whose favorite band is Menudo.
B0017U7PT6|1.0|This movie was just awful, I mean really bad! Over done plot, the whole movie revolves around a love story, pretty much like Troy except weaker. Hardly any action scenes, really bad acting and not as visually stunning as one would imagine. Seriously, do yourself the favor and skip out on this flick. I believe the average review is 2 stars or something like that. Its really lame!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Many of the younger fans forget that originally Judas Priest started as a progressive band. And over the years they have shown us so many faces, each  of their albums different from the other. And they have done these transformations with ease and, apart from Turbo (their one and only disaster), all of their albums are great in a different way. Nostradamus is a summary of all their transformations and musically is their bravest and one of their most successful efforts. It's the ultimate proof of their songwriting  genius, one of the most diverse and heartfelt performances from Rob Halford, pure delight. Not many groups are capable of doing this after a 40-year career (Judas Priest started in 1968!)  being brilliant  without repeating themselves. Highest moments- Prophecy, Pestilence and Plague, War (stunning epic), Death (Black Sabbath meets Judas Priest), Nostradamus (reminds the Painkiller album). Deep Purple's Don Airey is doing a great job on keyboards. Enjoy!
B001ACY8D2|5.0|i love sigur ros.  to hear them sound so alive and fresh, it's pretty much awesome.  this album evokes emotion just as well as the past albums, only it's a much different emotion, one of a content for life.  for me the sounds of Ágætis Byrjun were the sounds of falling in love, as i was.  ( ) was there with me for some of my worst years, not to sound predictable, but for me it was true.  this music doesn't need critiquing.  just enjoy it.  to read some of you write about sigur ros selling out is hilarious.  do you really expect to hear Gobbledigook on the radio?

B000003493|5.0|Nuggets: A Classic Collection From the Psychedelic Sixties has quite a few killer classics on it and if you like psychedelic music from the awesome `60s this CD is made just for you! The sound is excellent and the artwork is very nicely done. There is a good diversity of artists on this disc, too.<br /><br />The CD starts with The Standells doing their awesome hit entitled \\"Dirty water.\\" \\"Dirty Water\\" has a catchy melody and you won't forget this tune anytime soon if you haven't heard it already! \\"Dirty Water\\" just doesn't start the album; it's also a highlight of this CD. Great! The guitar work is excellent as The Standells sing and play this one up right! The Count Five also do their \\"Psychotic Reaction;\\" this classic golden nugget shines bright with some great percussion and guitar work--how about that musical interlude jam session? Even if it is comparatively brief, the interlude is still excellent rock music. The Easybeats also do a fantastic hit, \\"Friday On My Mind.\\" \\"Friday On My Mind\\" has great harmonizing and it's always been one of my favorite hits from back in the day.<br /><br />The Five Americans do \\"I See The Light\\" with lots of positive energy; and the electric guitar is perfect for this tune! Listen also for The Syndicate Of Sound doing their hit \\"Little Girl.\\" \\"Little Girl\\" is instantly recognizable for us people who like their `60s rock. It has a fine psychedelic rock flavor to it and The Syndicate Of Sound never misses a beat, either! \\"Little Girl\\" is another major highlight of this album. The Monkees follow with \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday;\\" this tune sounds really fine and it fits in well with the other tracks on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Laugh, Laugh\\" by The Beau Brummels has a great melody that I always enjoyed; and when I hear this song I cannot help but smile.

0307346617|2.0|This book was not at all what I expected.  It is not about a War, as the title indicates.  It \\"jumps\\" from one scenario to another every few pages.  It is very hard to follow the story line..  The Earth is supposedly being overrun by the Un-dead, yet, people appear to be living normal lives and paying little attention to the possible end of life as they know it.  It is just a lot of words.
0618918248|1.0|Before I read the god delusion I was hoping to find something fresh; perhaps, a true objective scientific quest into theology and the world of religion. Instead all I found was a subjectively constructed intolerant stickman paradigm created by Dawkins himself.<br /><br />His so called `God hypothesis' for example was not scientific, it's not even good theology, his theological hypothesis is fashioned in his hatred for religion that it is anything but rational and objective. Though (as stated during the beginning of his book) Dawkins intended his book to be a \\"conscious raiser\\" with the goal that when theists read it they would become atheists: I came away feeling disillusioned by the god delusion. I certainly didn't want to embrace the atheism that Dawkins was presenting.<br /><br />To be clear: Dawkins use of cherry picking style hermeneutics, poor historical scholarship in the humanities, and apparent intolerance for religion is what threw me off. It is after all a pity. This is because I think Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and yet the god delusion isn't all that brilliant, the book doesn't live up to the talents and gifts that Dawkins has demonstrated previously.<br /><br />My conconlusion here is that it's bad enough religions historically haven't been tolerant systems and it certainly doesn't help matters none when more intolerance is generated-even from the likes of Dawkins' atheism.
B0018AK9RK|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Priest fan. So, I had to run out and grab this disc first thing this morning. Ripped it open and put disc 1 in my car's system. Uhhhh...was there a mistake at the Epic plant? If it were not for Halford's distinct voice, I would have sworn that there was a mistake. Where are the blistering riffs? Is Dave Holland back on drums? Sure sounds like it- or perhaps Scott forgot to bring his double foot pedal into the studio. WAY TO MELLOW! I understand the whole \\"concept album\\" thing, but you can pull it off without wussing out. With 23 tracks on 2 discs, only 3 or 4 tracks caught my attention. Has age caught up with The Priest?
B0000251VW|1.0|\\"The Number Of The Beast\\" is an absolute classic, a landmark album in music/rock/metal history. And this reissue is an absolute disaster, with the classic cover printed in wrong colors, and the audio victimized by the infamous \\"loudness war\\" (Google the expression if you don't know what it means), with the music having been turned into one big mass of distorted noise. I did a full audio analysis of the whole album and just can't understand how the band's label could have let this precious material fall into the hands of inept audio engineers capable of producing something this amateurish.<br /><br />Add to that the inclusion of track \\"Total Eclipse\\" - which was not part of the original vinyl or even the first CD releases - between tracks \\"Gangland\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", something that completely breaks the perfect continuity of the album. That track only started to appear in the 1995 reissues and in a separate bonus disc.<br /><br />I wonder if the band had any say in these \\"enhanced\\" releases. Avoid this thing and buy an older, non-enhanced and non-remastered CD edition of the album if you want to hear how this masterpiece is really supposed to sound. Shame on EMI for releasing this insult to the band and their fans.
084317420X|5.0|I read this when I was a young man living in the U.K. Some friends had me read it to their child.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Impossible can do anything... he can... That's Impossible! You try it!\\" I must have said those words a million times since I read it (whenever some engineer would want me to defy the laws of physics because that was what the project should make happen).<br /><br />For some reason I thought of it this week and was telling my daughters about it. I am happily suprised that I am able to get it now in the USA.

B0017I1FNK|4.0|I have never been much of a country music fan, but Emmylou's sound has always resonated with me.  Having just seen her at an outdoor concert outside Chicago, I can tell you that Emmylou is all heart and soul.  She transcends genres (I guess that's why they call her \\"alternative\\" country?) and makes you feel like you are sitting on the front porch with her as she tells stories and plays the guitar.  While I love her voice and message, the songs on this album sound a little too much alike.  I would have liked more variety as the ballads sounded very similar.  But they were all gorgeous, especially the one with Dolly.  Buy this one for when you have a bad day and you need someone to understand--Emmylou will!

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|There's a lot to cover here. Madonna has changed her vocal performance for this album. The vocal effects are all there, although some rawness has been allowed to slip through to add to the R'n'B flavour. Production, courtesy of the chosen, best few in the business is unpredictable as beats, synths, guitars and vocals mix to create a fantasy/reality, as Madonna does for each album. The single release choices will probably end up being as unpredictable as the production itself. Everything about this album, at first, screams where do i put this? The artwork looks out of place to me but judgement and taste must be left at the door for every piece of work, for each of us. And artwork it is. Madonna has never claimed to be the best singer, dancer or performer. That's arguable. That aside, some could say the album feels rushed, as the contract with the record company runs out. In fact, the continuity of that responsibility may have probably allowed some freedom to create something different under a safe umbrella. Hard Candy has elements of 70's, 80's, 90's, 00's and beyond. The creative process is timeless. The stand out tracks on this album for me are: Heartbeat, Miles Away, She's Not Me, Beat Goes On, Dance 2nite and Devil... Accept this album as a stand alone piece of work with the artist in mind. It's danceable, mixable, funky, fun, emotional and definitely unique at times but ultimately fulfilling.

0066620996|5.0|\\"Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't\\"  by Jim Collins was a real eye opener for me.    In this book, Jim Collins, observes 28 companies over the span of 5 years. Over this period of time 11 of the companies make the leap from \\"Good to Great\\". The findings in this book were truly eye opening and inspirational. I loved the chapter on Level 5 leadership.  Collins starts the chapter using a quote by Harry S. Truman \\"You can accomplish anything in life, provided that you do not mind who gets the credit\\". This is the essence of the book.    I also loved that in this book he speaks about how the executives that ignited the transformation for companies that went from good to great, did not figure out how to drive the bus, but how to get the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off) and then they figured out where to drive it.    Another book I really enjoyed reading about transformation is [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]. Any person who is looking to grow their business would greatly benefit from reading both these books.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|If you manage to stay awake for the car chase at the end of this snooze-fest, you'll be disappointed to have missed some valuable Nap time. The car chase itself is OK (as far as these things go) but it surely will not be a reason to want to see this headache of a film TWICE. Most disappointing is the Acting,not just by the Kiwi stunt-woman(and who can blame her?)but by the whole crew. The painfuly awful cameos by Tarantino and Eli Roth only  remind you that,with the exception of Kurt Russell,the acting of everybody else in this disaster is NO better. Even the Music, the hallmark of Tarantino's films, is sadly missing in action;it's as forgettable as this sorry feeble mess.                  Yes, we understand that this film is intended as an 'homage' to B-Movies,but instead of Cheesy Fun,we are subjected to Unrelenting Dullness.This movie(not that it moves)is as much Fun as going to the Dentist to have your teeth scraped....It might cost less but it takes a LOT longer(assuming I didn't nod off, the running time seemed like four-and-a-half hours).If you are curious to see this cinematic stinker,keep in mind that there are plenty of used(and not-so-used) copies available on this site.All sales are COD and nonrefundable.
0786948523|5.0|The haters of the new edition may have some reason to have reservations or complain but the new Monster Manual shouldn't be it.      Each item found in the table of contents has a standard layout.  Turn to the appropriate page and you will find the name of the creature or creature type, followed by (usually) short descriptive text.  This limited amount of fluff has been derided by some but personally I prefer quality over quantity and I find the text exactly as descriptive as it needs to be; capturing the essence of the creature without forcing the reader into accepting a single interpretation.      After a brief description of the average specimen, the name of a specific variant of the creature or type appears followed by a short explanation which builds upon facts established in the previous section.  Next the creature's stat block appears.  The layout is simple and easy to understand.  Statistics are presented in such a way as to be intuitively accessible to the reader.  Each creature has one or more basic attacks and a handful of powers which can be used either at-will, once per encounter, or when triggered by some event such as when bloodied.      The average creature seems to have about 2-3 powers while complex monsters like dragons have as many as 6.  As others have pointed out, this tends to average less abilities for high-level monsters than in previous editions.  The design goal here seems to be listing the powers the creature is most likely to call upon during a desperate confrontation with heroic characters, thereby giving the GM less to think about during play.  To me this is the right choice on the part of the designers.  In previous editions a high-level dragon would have some low-level spells and abilities that it would never waste an action using when fighting skilled opponents, therefore making the inclusion of such a spell in the creature's write-up of limited use.    Many creatures also have a Lore section; detailing what information about a given creature the player characters may have access to through skill use.     Most stat-blocks are accompanied by an image of the creature or sometimes a group of different variants of the same type.  All images are labeled which was not the case in previous editions.  The art captures the feel of each creature and combined with even the briefest write-ups, should allow every GM to understand and correctly play each creature with minimal prep-time.    The only complaint I can find to make is that some creatures may be difficult to find without an index.  For example, Bugbears are not listed separately in the table of contents.  They are found among the entries for goblins.  This complaint is not anywhere near significant enough to affect this review however.  There is also a monsters by level section which lists every creature in the book grouped according to it's encounter level.  This is arguably more useful to a GM than a traditional index.    In conclusion, this version of the Monster Manual is in many ways an improvement over other books of it's kind including previous edition D&D Monster books.  The layout is simple and easily navigated, and the information is exactly what a GM needs, no more and no less.  GMs on a budget should appreciate this fact as not a single page or paragraph is wasted.  Those who give this book anything less than a 3 star rating are haters, pure and simple and any wise gamer will ignore their spiteful ignorance out of hand.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,    If you are reading this review then you are probably searching for the greatest television series on DVD that never was.  Alas, it is true... those imbeciles over at MTV probably do not realize the millions of dollars they are losing by not making this show available to all the fans of our reluctant heroine.  If Daria were real she would scorn MTV (for having to listen to all this griping about a show from the nineties.)  So, just do it already so she doesn't have to suffer any longer.      This has been an act of desperation.  Thank you.
B0012Q732O|5.0|Let me first address all the reviews that compare this film to Apocalypto...there is ONE major difference, this movie is actually GOOD.  Pure fun from start to finish.  Is it totally fast paced...NO, but the film is trying to tell a historical/fiction STORY.  That is where Gibson's dull flop missed the boat.  Now, the special effects are nothing to write home about, but the pure beauty of the costumes and landscape more than makes up for it.  BC packs twice as much STORY into its 90 minutes than most of the 2+ hour schlock that comes out of Hollywood these days.  An interesting perspective on historical possibilities makes the film even more interesting.  Acurate in every detail, probably not, but possible/plausible all the same, sure.  Give it a chance, once it gets rolling, this is pure popcorn-munching madness.  Personally, I can't wait for 9999 BC.  Recommended for pure summer/storm DVD fun!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This might be one the best set of tracks I've listened to this year. The performance and production are as polished and clean as you could hope for, and the delivery so genuine and soulful you can almost smell the smoke and martinis. This makes a great gift for anyone who appreciates jazz or blues.
0743290119|4.0|I'm a bit puzzled by the obnoxious 1 star reviews of this book.  It's not Pulitzer Prize material, but did you really expect that when you read the premise of the plot?  Does it surprise you that characters who are \\"chasing expensive diamonds\\" (and men) are a bit shallow and neurotic?    I thought it was certainly worth reading.  There are some very entertaining parts and funny observations that resonate with an almost-thirty-something who is looking to settle down.    I agree that the writing was mildly disjointed (jumping from scene-to-scene with no smooth transitions).  Also, I thought the plot's concept was solid, but Weisberger didn't flesh it out as well as she could have.  The ending is lame (especially if you are a reader who likes closure).  It seemed as if Weisberger just got sick of writing it, so she tied up HALF of the loose ends and just let the rest fizzle out.    My overall impression of the book was that Weisberger was in a rush to get it finished.  It had a lot more potential than it delivered on.  And that is disappointing.  Even so, compared to most chick-lit out there, a 75% effort by Weisberger still holds its own.     It's a fun beach read with a few hilarious stand-out scenes interspersed between several ho-hum ones.  Nothing more, nothing less.

6305736650|5.0|. . . This film simply gets better and better. How can it miss with such a cast? Not only Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilse, but also the ensemble group of minor characters. Who can forget oily-voiced Peter Lorre smuggling the letters of transit? Or rotund Sidney Greenstreet swatting flies at the Blue Parrot? My very favorite, however, is Claude Raines as Louis, the (lovably) corrupt Prefect of Police, whose heart is his \\"least vulnerable spot,\\" and whose lines, which include \\"Round up the usual suspects!\\" are among the best and the most humorous in the movie. His shock, as he stuffs his pockets with his winnings, that gambling is going on at Rick's place, has to be one of the classic moments in cinema.<br /><br />And, of course, one of the most brilliant scenes--my very favorite \\"three-handkerchief-blubbering\\" moment, in fact--is when Nazi Colonel Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and his officers are standing around the piano, belting out \\"Watch on the Rhine,\\" and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) orders the band to play the \\"Marseilleise\\"; although the two pieces of music blend perfectly at first, the \\"Marseilleise\\" triumphs in the end. Vive la France!!!<br /><br />I think that one of the secrets of this movie's greatness is that in addition to the outstanding actors, the writers and the director have combined the right mixture of romance, adventure, and patriotism with a huge dollop of humor. A time-tested recipe that seems to have been forgotten in so many films made today.

0316168815|5.0|THE LOVELY BONES will haunt you. This book tells the story of the most horrific thing a family could ever endure, the murder of a loved one, a child.<br /><br />The child is 14-year-old Susie Salmon. We see the murder through her eyes, after she is killed. Susie narrates her story from heaven, a place like I'd not before imagined. Her heaven begins as her school playground. Slowly it grows to become more. Susie merely longs for something she misses from earth, and it appears, except, of course, the living. Although she can watch her loved ones, know what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, she cannot be with them, or they with her.<br /><br />The book begins with the emotional, frightening, and vividly shown homicide. Through Susie's eyes, we understand how he tricked her. We feel her terror as we realize, with her, what's about to happen. Then the scene moves to another, equally heartbreaking moment, three days later when a neighbor's dog finds a body part.<br /><br />You would think, at this point, that you wouldn't be able to read further, that you'd close the book and never reopen it. But you won't be able to. Like Susie, we want to know her family will be okay. We want to know the killer won't get away with it. The author, Alice Sebold, artfully forces you to read on.<br /><br />Susie watches her friends whisper about her at school. She watches as her younger sister, Lindsey, hardens to stone. Her four-year-old brother, Buckley, is passed from neighbor to neighbor, having sleepovers, told his sister has just gone away for a bit. She listens to the detective, Len, tell her parents the inevitable, that they are now investigating her disappearance as a murder. Her family slowly begins to crumble and Susie can do nothing to help.<br /><br />This sounds like a suffocating, depressing book, but as you read you'll feel encouraged as Susie's family begins to move on, never to forget, but to begin to live life without her. Buckley struggles to understand the meaning of forever. Susie's dad becomes obsessed with proving he's not crazy, that he's certain who killed his daughter. Susie's mom handles the stress by hiding from it. And Lindsey, known as the girl whose sister was murdered, strives to find herself again. She searches for love. And she takes a huge risk to help her dad flush out the killer.<br /><br />The ending is incredibly sweet. Amazing as it may seem, you will feel Susie's joy as she lets go of those she's left behind. For me, the ending wasn't perfect, it left me wanting, but I imagine that was deliberate. Life itself is not perfect. But life has hope. And that's the feeling that will stay with you as you turn the last page. It's a memorable read, not for the faint of heart. Expect to feel. To fear, to cry, and, yes, to laugh. THE LOVELY BONES will touch the very core of your being. Alice Sebold has written beautifully of the ugliest scenario possible. Wow.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Cana Rensbergered with proving he's not crazy, that he's certain who killed his daughter. Susie's mom handles the stress by hiding from it.

0141442034|5.0|Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry.  Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.<br /><br />At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted.  He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about.  But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.<br /><br />Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.  And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.<br />What will become of Dorian?<br />What will become of Dorian's painting?<br />What would you do if you were Dorian?<br /><br />Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma.  And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.  In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL.E SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />WALL.E, the latest from Pixar is another amazing film. How they manage to churn out great film after great film is anyone's guess. When every other studio manages to just recycle old pond scuzz, they consistently produce gems, time after time.<br /><br />WALL.E is a science fiction film that has an eco message imbedded within. The film does not attempt to sway your view or convert you to agree. It simply tells a tale, a very good tale, and then the film ends. If you do not care to see the message the film does not care. Nor do I imagine do the filmmakers for that matter.<br /><br />The story, as is usual for PIXAR, is a multi-faceted one. If you are a simple child there are simple laughs. There is also a simple very easy to understand story of friendship, companionship, love, or what ever you care to call it, between the two main characters, WALL.E and EVE. The more complex side story is: what happened to all the humans? For a while one can imagine some great garbage catastrophe. We quickly learn humanities fate. We left all the garbage behind and are off in space aboard some cosmic cruise ship. I have heard that cruises are notorious for all the food that is provided. Once we find humanity we see what has become of them. FAT.E is all that comes to mind. This is not hard to imagine. Drinking a burger through a straw. I bet some genius is already hard at work on that one as I write.<br /><br />I love all the references in the film for those who are old enough to get them. Kubricks 2001 is riding shotgun in this film and when this comes out on DVD it will have no better home on my shelf than beside 2001. real science fiction is not about space cowboys, it's about small, or grand, intelligent scientific ideas that propel the story forward. The idea in this film is what will become of us. I'm sure the film has the broad strokes right. Just like the Kubrick/Spielberg film AI, this film imagines a future where robots are everywhere.

B001BKTEZA|1.0|Don't bother getting the sample of this book...all you're going to get is a long-winded intro and you don't even get all of that.<br /><br />In my opinion, if your introduction needs CHAPTERS, it's too long!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Not being an consumer of HBO, I was very suprised to find this series at a local video store.  If you are into historical drama, this is a MUST for you!  I am a middle school teacher, and I think portions of this film would be excellent for dialogue and education in the home or at school.  Paul Giamatti was outstanding and Laura Linney was impressive as well.  I could not wait to get to the next episode.<br /><br />A few highlights I was not aware of were the relationships between Adams to Jefferson were so personal, Ben Franklin's diplomacy in France, Adams' passion and fervor in speech, and the faithfulness of his wife through many life struggles.  This was a beautiful series to watch, and made me proud to be an American once again.  Our union was never without flaws, but doesn't the beauty of democracy come from that struggle?

0930289234|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about \\"Watchmen\\"? I first read this graphic novel when it first was published. I was newbie at collecting comic books and a good friend said \\"Hey man, you've got to check this out.\\" And I did and was floored, never had we (comic book readers) seen anything of this depth and caliber. I mean, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" was ground breaking, but \\"Watchmen\\" was something totally different. It was a novel, a incredibly detailed journey to an alternate superhero reality and it worked. I absolutely love this book and I am looking forward to Zack Snyder's interpretation. If you haven't read this book and you love comic books, then what are you waiting for?

B00133KDM8|4.0|Tarja's solo effort is a very good one indeed.  Though it is not as heavy as any Nightwish, it is excellent just the same.  Her hypnotic voice pulls you right into each and every song.  However, I would love to see her get back together with Nightwish.  The chemistry they had together, when performing, is the only thing that is lacking with her new band. In my opinion, this cd was definately worth purchasing.

This well documented DVD will show you some of the most amazing interviews with people before and after the showing and their reaction to the movie.  It is inspiring to see  individual lives touched by the Passion movie and the impact the movie made around the world.

B00000K3UU|4.0|Big Daddy starring Adam Sandler and Joey Lauren Adams is a sweet romantic comedy. I enjoy this film although some of the scenes are bit gross. Steve Buscemi's physical comedy holds this film together. Sandler isn't too annoying in this flick which is nice. I recommend checking this unexpected and cute film out, enjoy!

Heather Locklear, Laura Leighton, Doug Savant, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Andrew Shue, Daphene Zuniga, and hunky Grant Show continue to deliver the goods. I think Marcia Cross returns this season and boy she is some nut! I loved this show and now I can watch these yummy episodes anytime I want. I highly recommend purchasing this sinfully addicting show, enjoy!
0425032264|5.0|Read this novel and you cannot help but notice how many truly feeble Heyer imitators are out there. Welcome to the original gold standard.   This charming Regency romance concerns beautiful spinster Venetia Lanyon and dissolute rake, Lord Jasper Damerel.   Venetia lives on her older brother's country estate with her crippled, younger brother, Aubrey. Lord Dameral is the absentee owner of the neglected bordering estate. They meet and immediately recognize and enjoy each other as kindred souls.    Unfortunately, Dameral is not respectable - due to having eloped with a married lady - and believes he is unworthy of Venetia.   Resourceful Venetia refuses to accept his sacrifice of their happiness and sets about overcoming his scruples.   There are complicated plot threads involving Venetia's father's reclusive lifestyle, brother Conway's long anticipated homecoming, and the reason for Venetia's lack of a London Season.   Marvelous dialogue, excellent characterizations and wonderful Regency settings.  Recommended.

However, when I opened this CD and put it in my car player...i continually got an error message of \\"invalid disc\\". I tried putting it in other slots and in our home player and same thing. This thing is completely worthless and now i can't return it because I've already opened it up! Total waste of money.
B000P2A24W|3.0|The album is not bad.  I was expecting the same music that was on his cable concert and that is not what was on the album.  So including the diapointment that the main song I wanted was not on it I have to say that the album was just \\"OK\\".

B000ICLRJ8|4.0|I first saw this movie on DVD the first time several years ago and then when I saw that it had come to Blu-Ray, I knew that I had to buy it. I was kind of disappointed with the picture quality, but then again I was only using 1080i due to a problem with my monitor. If I can manage to find an HDMI-DVI cable that works in 1080p I might post another comment in here so stay tuned. A few scenes were awesome in high definition especially the ones where the F-18 is being pursued by a couple of SAMS (surface to air missiles.) The audio quality on the other hand was outstanding! During the scene with the gunshots where the main pilot gets executed by the Serbian army, the shot was so LOUD I felt like I was standing right there in the field. My friend Mark was watching this movie with me (my first day playing Blu-Ray discs) and he said WHOAA with a capital W.! He said that he couldn't follow the story very well, and I was like, \\"Dude how could you not?\\" Basic search and rescue plot with a good story to boot. I believe this movie was based on a true story that happened in the late 90's if I'm not mistaken...
B000000XB9|5.0|I saw Creedence Clearwater Revisited last year.  That band takes a lot of heat for having a capable Fogerty sound-alike stand in for Fogerty.  I understand some fans' complaints about the heart and soul of the music being compromised, but my argument was, and still is, that these songs are timeless gems and are worth hearing no matter who's singing them.    So, on to my review ... this is a very admirable greatest hits CD of one of the best bands of the late sixties.  All of my favorite Creedence songs are here, including \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" \\"Lodi,\\" \\"Run Through The Jungle\\" and \\"Travelin' Band.\\"  To me Creedence Clearwater Revival is the perfect example of how to be a rock band.  Fogerty, the band's principal songwriter, can be serious when he needs to be but also knows how to have fun.  For example, at the time of the Vietnam War, he wrote songs with such depth and emotion as \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\" and \\"Fortunate Son.\\"  On the other hand, he wrote songs like \\"Travelin' Band\\" and \\"Down on the Corner\\" -- harmless and fun classics.  I also like that this CD includes \\"Someday Never Comes.\\"  That song is very underrated, if you ask me.    This CD has gotten some complaints that \\"Born on the Bayou\\" is missing.  It is on Chronicle Volume 2 but some fans don't want to pay all that extra money for one song.  I have a suggestion on how to remedy that:  buy this CD, then download \\"Born on the Bayou\\" from iTunes as a single.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|This CD should be called \\"NOSTRILDAMUS\\" because it stinks to high Heaven!  What ever happened to the Priest I knew is a case Perry Mason can't even solve.If this is the only thing they can come up with 3 years after \\"Angel OF SUCKRIBUTION\\" The Priest is dead. I even bought the limited edition CD booklet version and got a free ticket to the Metal Masters Tour which I will enjoy Testament, Motorhead, & Heaven & Hell but I will leave when the Priest comes on. It's time to pass the torch to some other real metal band, there are far to many to list that are way better than this total waste of (you fill in the blank) What a insult of metal heads intelligence!

B000UJCALI|5.0|The Shining ranks with the Exorcist as being one of the best horror films of all time.<br />Perhaps Duval and Nicholson make for an unlikely couple in the beginning, but this<br />anomoly is easily rectified during the last two thirds of the film. The casting of Scatman,<br />to my mind, was, along with the casting of Nicholson, sheer genius. From the spine<br />chilling music playing during the first frames of the movie as the car winds up to the<br />hotel to the very last frame as the 20s themed music plays and the camera zeros in on<br />Nicholson's figure at the center of the black and white photograph, the movie delivers.<br />Stephen King purists can argue all they want over how true the film stayed to the book.<br />I'm a King fan through and through, and I believe Kubrick's version is outstanding. This<br />movie is an absolute must for the serious horror collector.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I would not study history of England based on 'The other Boleyn girl (2008) but I enjoyed it and found it quite entertaining. Boleyn girls, two sisters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson,) were gorgeous and Henry VIII (Eric Bana) long before he looked like on his famous portraits by Hans Holbein, Jr, the object of both sisters' desires was very appealing.  Kristin Scott Thomas played Lady Boleyn, Anne's and Mary Boleyn's mother. Scott Thomas has so much class and dignity about her, and I like her in every movie I've seen her.<br /><br />I actually did not know that Mary Boleyn, the older Anne's sister (in the movie she was younger), had been Henry VIII's mistress and might have (or not) had a son with him. According to the movie and the novel by Philippa Gregory it was based on, Mary had a son with Henry who then fell in love with sharp-witted, alluring, and unavailable Anne who firmly refused to become the king's mistress. So great was his desire for her, it led to Henry's annulment of the 20+ years marriage with the queen Katharine of Aragon and split with Catholic Church thus starting the Church of England. Katharine of Aragon comes as a decent and intelligent woman  played by Ana Torrent. Now, that's the most pleasant surprise of the movie. Eight-year-old Ana Torrent gave an unforgettable performance as \\"Ana\\" in the film El esp&iacute;ritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) by V&iacute;ctor Erice. She was memorable in the relatively small role in Justin Chadwick's historical drama comparing to Portman or Johansson.<br /><br />Anne Boleyn was a remarkable and bright woman, (bitch as she was, quick-tempered and spirited) and it is  clear that her daughter Elizabeth, the future greatest Monarch in the England's history, Good Queen Beth inherited strength, iron will, brilliance,  and brain from her mother. The fact that Elizabeth did not want to get married only speaks in her behalf - she was smart enough not to let any man to tell her what to do and to dominate her. Her mother Anne was not that lucky. The second part of the movie, the fall of Anne Boleyn, \\"Anne of Thousand Days\\" was rushed, sensational, and much weaker than the promising beginning. Since those historic figures had been dead for almost 500 years, it is easy to come up with any shocking accusation toward them - they won't defend themselves. Anyway, the costumes and the sets were the feast for eyes, I was not bored and after the movie was over, I spent some time researching on the web the key players of the real life drama that was set in the beginning of 1500s, changed the future of Europe, and included love, lust, ambitions that would destroy the family ties, rise to power, and deadly fall from it.<br /><br />3.5/5her.

B0013A1T8I|3.0|I found the animated animal spirit companions to the human characters extremely enchanting. I thought the computer animated renderings of the animals were very beautiful and believable. But I agree with some of the<br />other reviewers in their assessment of the plot. Unless having read the book first (and I haven't), it's difficult to determine exactly what \\"dust\\" is, what threat it holds, and the purpose of the Coulter character and her vendetta against children. I also found the fights between the bears and the other animals to be quite violent, as was the scene where Coulter slapped her daemon so hard he flew across the room. I realize children are exposed to far more violence than this in films today, but I think it warrants comment. The acting was decent, but not a stretch for any of the performers involved. The ending, not surprisingly, left the heroine on a continuation of her journey to reunite with her uncle, which undoubtedly calls for a sequel. Perhaps the second installment will do a better job of clarifying many of the shadows cast in this first film.
B00008BXJF|5.0|It seems that this album has created quite a following for itself. Around 130 people have reviewed this album (by the time I'm typing this), while it had reached only 150 on the billboard 200.     Meanwhile, King Crimson's debut (and probably most successful) album holds only around 72 reviews (by the time I'm typing this).     It goes to show that this album is good enough to have made a fuss about itself. This album is certainly an album in every sense of the word. The songs flow together, they are all connected, it is complete from beginning to end.     The music is constant in its creativity, thus not repetitive in any way imaginable. At times the atmosphere of the record can be quite industrial and gritty, while at other times it can be very serene and reposed. The result is quite beautiful, and the album never goes over the top without the musicians' superb musicianship bringing it back home.     As the title of this review suggests: Quite an album.

But<br />that's just me. I'm not an \\"A-list\\" actress churning out<br />movie after movie to support a slavishly extravagant<br />lifestyle. The story held much potential, but the film<br />did not deliver. If you have an addiction to all things<br />Kidman, enjoy horror, and are not quite sick of<br />seeing her in almost every film that comes along, I<br />recommend The Others, which provides plenty of<br />shivers, an interesting plot, and decent acting.
B0018AK9RK|3.0|Anyone having difficulty getting into JP's latest lengthy & rather weighty opus should give the following a go. Instead of trawling through the 100 mins plus, double album - just select the following track listing on to a CDR or ipod playlist etc, and hear a much leaner, faster & more familiar metallic 80 min (single disc) version.    1.

B001ACY8D2|4.0|If Agaetis Byrjun were Summer, then () was Winter, Takk was autumn and \\"...við spilum endalaust\\" would have to be Spring. (Sorry, but Von doesn't really rate - to be honest, it was just artsy fartsy experimental jams with a couple of gems that still needed a lot of polishing packed in).<br />Sigur Ros do the Four Seasons, now there's a take. Whenever you get near to Sigur Ros words such as ethereal, aery, celestial, heavenly, glacial, epic and so on and forth tend to jump up around them like little happy, smiling offspring. Not that these adjectives are bad at describing their music, in fact they do so more than well but after eight years or more of it, well they had to go somewhere else really, it was more than inevitable.<br />What's been totally magical about Sigur Ros is that they've managed to create these unbelievably majestic pieces that just totally blow you away, but ever so gently, like drifting off on a wispy breeze (you know what I mean) out of well, just about nothing really. They have mostly been all about shimmering surfaces, echoes, delays & reverb; about weaving pure magic out of the musical equivalent of fairy floss, and they have done so in expert fashion, reducing many a hard soul to tears in the process. Take their signature tune for example, Svefn-g-englar. When you come right down to it, it's just 4 chords, 4 notes almost, stretched out over 10 minutes. Yet these 4 chords are arranged, instrumented and produced in such spectacular fashion that half the world held its breath it seemed as it drifted and spread around the globe back in 2000/2001.<br />The feeling here is though that you can only do ethereal, soaring and epic for so long before even that gets tiring, even if not for us the fans, then in any case for Sigur Ros themselves who have probably played Svefn-g-englar a thousand times by now and are probably sick to death of it.<br />So, having gently floated down to earth, \\"We Play Endlessly\\" is much more grounded, present, it's right in front of you and it bubbles and froths and is full of joy and happy things. For the first half. On the second half we do get two epics as the pop feel is toned down in a major way. Ara Batur (Row Boat)works brilliantly. It's everything that makes Sigur Ros one of the best bands in the whole world. Festival, I'm not so sure about. In my mind, for the first 5 minutes it meanders almost aimlessly and interminably, unsure of where to go. But then it suddenly explodes into something gorgeous and totally new for Sigur Ros. After Ara Batur the album seems to drift away into the quiet and stillness of the after Midnight Sun of endless Arctic late Spring and Summer days...I guess we're seeing evolution of direction here, not total re-incarnation, but it's almost like the guys said to themselves after Ara Batur, \\"Well that's it for us, let's get this over and done with, get back home and have a few beers.\\"front of you and it bubbles and froths and is full of joy and happy things.

B000A2H9BQ|5.0|Of all of John Martyn's work for Island Records, this is surely one of the (if not THE) best of them.  Between the title cut and \\"Glistening Glyndebourne,\\" you need know little more...but all of the tracks are excellent, even his breezy little cover of \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" which takes the original album out on a happy note.  \\"Head and Heart\\" is one of the best love songs I have ever heard.  The bonus tracks are all pretty good, too, on this expanded edition, although to be honest, I prefer JM's acoustic version of \\"May You Never,\\" the officially released version included on Solid Air, to the band version here; that said, this version is not bad.  (Another is included as a bonus track on the Deluxe Edition of Paul Kossoff's Back Street Crawler; JM and PK put this song together originally.)  Highly recommended.
B00164KYS2|3.0|Without a doubt Sex and the City is one of the most influential TV show in history. So like any other successful TV show, it is trying to translate its fabulousness onto the big screen. However, does it work?<br /><br />One of the major differences between a weekly TV show and a movie is that on TV you allow your characters to grow gradually while exploring different things in their lives. However, in a movie, you don't have that kind of privilege. You only have around 3 hrs to tell everything. So to deal with this issue, Sex and the City put the fabulous four into a whole year of adventure in 2.5 hours. Does it work? Well it keeps the funny stuff and sometimes candid stuff on the show but on the whole you feel like watching a montage of events for the characters without actually being able to think that they are unfolding in a meaningful manner. Those are life changing events, but when they are being broken down into numerous pieces that weave a plot together in 2.5 hours, it lacks the tension it allows on the TV show. This, without doubt, taxed the performance of the leads - SJP, Kim Catrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon. When you watch them, you feel like they are busily putting things together to make their characters work once again. They are all familiar characters but the development was so fast tracked that you wonder how the thought process became so fast food like as compared to a meaningful growth in the TV show.?<br /><br />Fashion is the big thing in the TV show, so we have lots of fashion in the movie, including the iconic dress we saw in the opening credits for every show during the 6 years run of the show. However, the attempt of jam packing so many wardrobe changes in the show failed to let the fashion to speak for themselves. It is just a consortium of beautiful fashion popping up in display windows as you stroll down the 5th Avenue. In the TV show, the fashion forms part of the story telling with the characters e.g. the change of wardrobe from high power neutral sex suits for Miranda to motherly and feminine clothes later during the six year run.

Is it just because of the loneliness in NY that they shared a quick patch on New Year's Eve?  It just became so vague.

B001041JLE|5.0|This De Luxe Edition is very nice ,The booklet is pretty and the sounds of Cd are perfect.  The Dvd has wonderful videos.  Thanks from Lima Perú  Manuel
0060730552|5.0|If you liked \\"Into Thin Air,\\" then you will love this book, which is just as brilliant and perhaps even more incredible. If you've been to Peru, even better. Great writing, great story, and an unforgettable tale. Again, a rare book that once begun, is almost impossible to put down. Simpson has written some others, but none as good as his first. Read it. And try his \\"This Game of Ghosts\\" if you want more.
B000ANVPPQ|2.0|This movie goes off in several directions and never gets back together.  For a while it is about a group of settlers who have come to the unnamed territory to farm, but that is soon dropped.  For a while it is about the plight of Indians, but that is never resolved.  Sometimes it is about various romances, and they dribble away.  There is a great deal of chasing and fighting and humiliation of women.  The only thread through it all is the relationship between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, and that is resolved by the Duke giving her a hard spanking with a coal scuttle in the middle of town on the 4th of July with all the townspeople looking on and applauding.    The moral seems to be that problems can be solved only by violence and humiliation.  The characters are strictly one dimensional.  And that's too bad, because this movie has a competent cast of actors.  There are two long scenes, one of a fight at a mine in which all the characters go down a mud slide into a pool of slop.  The other long scene is John Wayne chasing Maureen O'Hara through the streets and byways of town, while she loses articles of clothing, falls in a horse trough, and generally demeans herself.    I love westerns.  And John Wayne has made some good ones.  But this isn't among his best.  I first saw it in a little theater in Ft. Scott, Kansas, in 1964, and the only line I remembered was Wayne's famous line, \\"The hell I'm not\\" at the beginning of the mud slide scene.  Seeing it again was perhaps not a good idea.  I've matured.
B0015XHP3Q|3.0|Whatever credibility Rambo once had in First Blood is totally gone in this film which is more like Cold War propaganda than anything else, which is probably why they chopped First Blood off the title and we're simply left with the Rambo bit. As a character he's a bit more talkative but still has the...(read more) same sadness in his eyes. And Stallone is absolutely HUGE. Yes, he's always been big but his figure in Rambo III is probably the biggest I've seen him. He could probably rip Arnie's head off.<br /><br />Since walking off into the sunset in Part II, Rambo is now living in a monastery in Thailand and has found inner peace. But he still takes time out to batter people with sticks in cage fights to raise money for the Buddists. But the no-good Red Ruskie Soviets are causing havoc in Afghanistan and one particular Colonel is taking great pleasure in massacring whole villages.<br /><br />Colonel Trautman and Robert Griggs (the ever-brilliant Kurtwood Smith) try to convince Rambo to come help them sort the Ruskies out. But Rambo is having done of it. He's done killing! He wants to raise a family.<br /><br />So Trautman is left to go it alone and is captured. Griggs delivers this bad news to Rambo who makes up his mind to go on another killing spree. Which is entirely okay as long as he only kills the Ruskies right?<br /><br />Once in Afghanistan, Rambo teams up the Muhujideen, learns of their many woes and agrees to fight the Ruskies with all his might. Even though he was going to do that anyway, but it's nice to have friends.<br /><br />The rest of the film is no more than a succession of comic-book action scenes and shoot-em-up set pieces. It's brilliantly shot, seriously, it's some of the best cinematography I've seen in an action film. I never expected Rambo III to look so good! It's a shame that Peter MacDonald (who was actually the second unit director shunted into 1st place after Russell Mulcahy left) doesn't stage the action with any sense of fluency. Yes, it all looks big and bold, but it's kinda clumsy and cumbersome. At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever made (even at a mere $65 million) and while it may be grand, it sure ain't graceful.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's score is once again brilliant. But quite a lot of his original material was left out and old tracks from Part II spliced in. So as long as your prepared for sudden jump cuts in the music, you should really get a kick out of it.<br /><br />When it originally came out, Rambo III was kinda disregarded as a totally unnecessary sequel but in recent years the film has gained a political subtext and can actually be viewed in quite a few subversive ways. While I understand that the makers wanted to give the film a serious point of view regarding the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, I feel that integrity that the film has in modern politics should be disregarded. This is a RAMBO movie for Christ sake. The logic is shoot now, ask questions never. America did do the right thing by helping the Afghans fight off the Ruskies. But they did they wrong thing leaving the country to crumble afterwards (just like Rambo does). The rest is history. But I don't think a review of Rambo III is the best place to discuss this.<br /><br />It's a flawed sequel, but I like it better than Part II. There are some seriously misjudged moments but it's still a fun ride. Once the victim of the most amount of cuts forced by the tyrannical BBFC the violence in Rambo III pales in comparison to the shocking carnage of the fourth film.<br /><br />Filmed in JDC-Scope, the Blu Ray features a fine 2.4:1 1080p transfer and good DTS HD sound. Extras are limited to a trivia track and an interesting documentary on the history of Afghanistan.da clumsy and cumbersome.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This work out is intense at first.  I love the three different levels of intensity.  Once you get better at one, you move on to the next.  It's great the way you have a simple movement mixed with another to maximize your time.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|The music and dancing just blew me away. Way cool! The story itself is quite nice, but just watch the way all the actors can move! I was strapped in my seat because I watched this movie in the airplane, but if I was at home, nothing could have stopped me from dancing along (or kind of). I love Andie, the heroine. She had skill in acting, dancing, and always had a cool outfit (not to mention).<br /><br />This movie is kind of different from the first, but not any worse. Go ahead and buy this movie, or rent it at Blockbuster. But first make sure that when you watch it, you have the speakers on loud and have plenty of space to dance!

Are you looking for a better way to make right decisions, enjoy peace of mind, and live in harmony with others. This may be the book for you.<br /><br />\\"Strengths Finder 2.0\\" is an extension of \\"strengths\\" research begun more than forty years ago by the late `Father of Strengths Psychology,\\" Dr. Donald Clifton of the Gallup Organization. For over 40 years, Clifton researched the natural patterns of thought, feeling, and action of two million people in more than 25 countries. The goal was to begin a conversation about what's right with people. The result is the Clifton \\"StrengthsFinder,\\" a tool that reveals a person's top five themes of talent - one's \\"Signature Themes.\\"<br /><br />A \\"Strength\\" is the ability to provide consistent, near-perfect performance in a given activity. This ability is a powerful, productive combination of talent, skill, and knowledge. Talents are naturally recurring patterns of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied. Unlike skills and knowledge, talents exist within you and cannot be acquired. We must first need to identify, affirm, and apply our unique mix of talents then apply them.<br /><br />Clifton's research highlights folly of the widely used \\"weakness prevention\\" model - to be successful, we must \\"fix\\" our weaknesses. This thinking is wrong. Building a life around one's greatest natural abilities rather than trying to repair weaknesses is the path to success.<br /><br />The book is organized around the use of the StrengthsFinder (provided with the purchase of the book) to identify, assess and affirm our Signature Themes (talents), and how to apply them for growth and life success. There are thirty four identified talents ranging from achiever, maximizer, ideation, individualization, and significance to woo. The StrengthsFinder assessment tool has been translated into more than 20 languages and is used by businesses, schools, and communities in more than 100 nations around the world to create strength-based families, communities, and workplaces.<br /><br />The Signature Themes are unique to the individual. According to Gallup, the chance of finding someone with your Signature Themes, in the same order, is 1 in 33 million and the chance of finding someone with your top ten themes of talent is 1 in 3 trillion. Finding one's themes and understanding their uniqueness should help one to gain a better appreciation of how special they are and how special the people around them are - deeper self-respect, deeper mutual respect. Studies indicate that people who do have an opportunity to focus on their strengths are three times more likely to have an excellent quality of life in general.<br /><br />\\"StrengthsFinder 2.0\\" has been written to provide the reader with the latest discoveries and strategies for application, providing a much more in-depth analysis of one's strengths.

0061564893|1.0|From time to time, this reviewer comes across a publication so crackpot that I hardly know where to start in reviewing it here. I'm happy to see that Gavin Menzies' thesis in 1421: The Year China Discovered America, that a Chinese fleet launched in 1421, embarked on a tour around the world, discovering all major points before Europeans and leaving artifacts, has already been generally debunked by numerous sources. Perhaps the most substantial is Robert Finlay's review \\"How Not to (Re)Write World History: Gavin Menzies and the Chinese Discovery of America\\" in the Journal of World History, June 2004, where Finlay shows that there are no \\"lost years\\" in Ming dynasty sailing, and so Menzies' book is completely without foundation. My fellow reviewers here have also offered some important critiques. I would like to offer a perspective from my own individual profession, linguistics. Menzies writes, for example:<br /><br />\\"Linguistics provide further evidence. The people of the Eten and Monsefu villages in the Lambayeque province of Peru can understand Chinese but not each otherâ(tm)s patois, despite living only three miles apart. Stephen Powers, a nineteenth-century inspector employed by the government of California to survey the native population, found linguistic evidence of a Chinese-speaking colony in the state.\\"<br /><br />The first assertion, on the Peruvian village, is not sourced at all and is either the personal fancy of the author or some minor crank idea. The second, however, is cited to an 19th-century bit of scholarship evidentally done without appropriate field methods. He goes on to claim that Chinese sailors shipwrecked on the East Coast of the United States would have been able to communicate with locals, as these would have included Chinese who had walked over the Bering Strait. Chinese walk across to Alaska and across all North America, but end up speaking Middle Chinese, and yet leave no trace of this dialect on neighbouring Native American languages? Risible fantasy. There's even an assertion that Navajo elders understand Chinese conversation, and an assertion that the Peruvian village name Chanchan must be Chinese because it sounds (at least to him) like \\"Canton\\". Perhaps the silliest Peruvian connection is between Chinese \\"qipu\\" and Quechua \\"quipu\\"; Menzies seemingly doesn't understand that \\"q\\" represents a completely different sound in each language. So, I hope that the reader with some training in linguistics can see what kind of arguments are used in the book, and beware accordingly.<br /><br />If I may be permitted one final indulgence, I should like to protest Menzies' weird view of Chinese culture. He blasts European explorers for committing genocide, claiming that continued Chinese expansion would have led instead to a world of peace and Confucian harmony. This is the naive romantic view of the Orient held by a child flipping through National Geographic. A man of Menzies' age and experience should have realized that all civilizations have it within them to commit do in indigenous peoples--the marginalization of Tibetan and Uighur language and culture and the disappearance already of a distinct Manchu people stand as proof that the Chinese are no exception..

B000WMFZNS|4.0|This lovely classic at last available in a DVD with decent picture and sound, along with mind blowing extras. This limited collector's edition comes with 2 additional booklets and few art cards. Even though I purchased the Limited Edition, I feel like the goodies not worth the additional money I paid. Also the box will eat up more space in your DVD rack. So buying the [[ASIN:B000WMFZMY El Cid (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)]] will be a good deal. I highly recommend this along with [[ASIN:B00125WAXM The Fall Of The Roman Empire (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)]]

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I enjoy reading the negative reviews for Moore films.  They will attack Moore himself and his politics and then wave the magic anti-liberal wand like it automatically absolves them from making any further logical argument.  Is it because they don't have rational argument for the actual content of the film and the questions being asked in it?<br /><br />One of the oft-heard arguments is the grandstanding that Moore does in his films.  Is taking a bunch of sick people to Cuba a showboat tactic?  Yes it is, but this is also a film and supposed to be entertaining.  If Moore stuck to the staid, classroom-lecture style of documentary making that conservatives seem to love, these films would not get publicity, people would not see them, people would not discuss them, and questions (ah yes, the questions), questions that desperately need to be pondered and answered, would not be pondered and answered.<br /><br />For me personally, I have seen both sides of the healthcare systems presented in the movie.  I have paid premiums and been treated in both the US and Canada.  The waiting room scenario from Ontario isn't as rosy as presented in the film, I did have to wait several hours, but I was checked up on constantly until the equipment to do proper tests were available.  However, I did not have to fill in a single payment form and no money was required, no bill arrived later.  My premiums then were 90 dollars a month.<br /><br />In the US, letters were required, permission was required, a co-payment was required, a waiting time of several weeks occurred because of the permission required.  Because of the concern for my symptoms, I ended up going back to Canada and getting the tests done by walking into the doctor of my choosing within the week.  No permission, no money.  I had paid 450 dollars in premiums for my US HMO fees and ended up feeling concerned enough by the bureaucracy and red tape that I looked elsewhere for attention before something serious happened.<br /><br />Why I present this information is to say that Moore's film is not hyperbole, it is not made up, it is really happening.  People with healthcare are getting screwed by a system of greed (not surprising to see the Nixon government getting the ball rolling...what do you expect from a criminal?).  The mentality of a nation that continues to rail against having to pay a little extra to help out those that need it really makes me question whether people understand what being a citizen is. Are they citizens of their country or citizens of themselves?  Until people realize that socialized medicine is not communism but rather helping someone in need, this country will continue with a grotesque, morally bankrupt, selfish style of 'healthcare' that cares little for the individual, and, perversely, entirely about the investor's bottom line.<br /><br />Moore's film (and films in general) are important and relevant as they are mirrors held up for your consideration.  What you come away with after watching them may affect you, but more importantly, your response to others regarding the film will speak volumes about your humanity.<br /><br />I give the film 4 stars because there was little argument on the FOR side for HMOs. I am not behind their concept, but I would have appreciated hearing from some of their apologists and what their rationale is.  I'm sure there are decent, cogent arguments that could be applied to create a better health care system all around.ion is to say that Moore's film is not hyperbole, it is not made up, it is really happening.

0060558121|4.0|In \\"American Gods\\" Neil Gaimen did something I have been thinking about doing, but of course can't get past the first page, for a long time. He explored the ideas about what happened to the ancient pagan gods once people stopped believing in them. The story starts with Shadow, a parolee who discovers his wife and best friend were killed in a tragic accident just days before he was to get out of prison. Shadow, whose world has just fallen apart, is hired by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday as a body guard, errand, boy, etc. What ensues is a road trip through an American you will recognize from your vacations, that is jam packed with ancient gods living lives in the most ordinary places doing the most unusual things right under our very noses. Mr. Wednesday sees war coming, and Shadow has a special part to play.<br /><br />Once again Neil Gaimen proves himself a consummate story-teller with a story that is compelling, witty, and amazingly original even as it borrows from the oldest literature known to man. Shadow and Wednesday were remarkably well drawn characters and the story was definitely not predictable. Those of you who know mythology will spot a lot of things before they happen, but, as with all good thrillers you will not see the crucial things coming.<br /><br />The only draw backs are three scenes that would make this rated X, or at least NC-17, if this book was a movie. They did not move the story forward one bit and I found myself wondering why that tripe was not cut from the book. There is a bit of violence, and, b/c the book has some pretty seedy characters, a smattering of bad language that does not necessarily move the story forward, but seemed appropriate for inmates and criminal types to use.<br /><br />All in all I recommend this to those who love a good epic saga, mixed with modern dark fantasy, with a dash of good mythology thrown in for good measure. Just beware the graphic scenes.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|I fell in love with this film when I saw it in the theatre. The DVD has made me fall in love all over again. While there are a couple of over-the-top performances, it makes for a great film that examines what happens to old school friends. There are a couple of scenes that jump out at me; when Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton are arguing on the bed; and when they all gather around the piano to sing.<br /><br />Many of my favourite actors are in this film and they don't disappoint. While a couple of performances are over-the-top, most are very good.<br /><br />The screenplay has some great moments and the choice of music is perfect. It brings me back to the time when I graduated from College; those songs were the soundtrack of my life.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|One of the best horror movies I ever watched. The background score is amazing and very original. The 2-disc special edition rocks. It comes in a regular keep case. Disc one has the movie in widescreen format with DTS ES 6.1 audio, trailers, Music video etc. Disc two has cast & crew interviews. This is one worthy purchase for any horror movie fan.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar can do so many things, and do them so well. They can take children's toys and bring them to magical life. They can take a fish with a gimpy fin and make him a superhero. They can take a souped up automobile and make him take the easy road. And they can take a mouse and make him the top chef. How they ever managed to take two machines, one which is a glorified garbageman, and make them fall in love is simply beyond me. They are the true magic makers of our time, and paired with Disney, they are in the business of making a series of movies that, 50 years from now, will be considered classics.<br /><br />Wall-E spins the tale of a plucky, musical loving robot whose only job in this world, literally, is to rake up garbage and make them into little square boxes. Spending his days doing that, Wall-E works until sunset when he gets to go home, remove his treads, and watch a little Hello, Dolly. That is, until he meets another robot, a svelte white examination robot named Eve. She's there on a mission, which unfolds very delicately, allowing time for the scared and timid Wall-E to approach her and try to woo her with his life.<br /><br />What follows absolutely blew my mind, both in it's complexity of messages and its shear entertainment value. Wall-E takes us into a future that may seem ridiculous on the screen, but you question, after only watching for a few minutes, how close we are to seeing that future here on Earth. I won't write any spoilers here, but as you laugh at some of the funny sights you see halfway through this remarkable film, you also are half-wondering at what point will this be us ... and is it already?<br /><br />The brilliance of the animation is a sight to behold. Pixar grows with every picture it makes, and Wall-E is a technical achievement of the highest order. The attention to detail is phenomenal, and literally awe-inspiring.  As Wall-E shovels piles of trash around, the dirt and dust and filth look real. In fact, that is the beautiful irony of this film. In a movie about robots, we find some essence of what it is to be human, what makes us tick, and what makes our planet more real than we know.  We should be better people to heed the message of Wall-E, and learn from it.<br /><br />I highly recommend taking everyone in your family to see this film. It's the cinematic event of the summer.vie about robots, we find some essence of what it is to be human, what makes us tick, and what makes our planet more real than we know.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|This is an amazing debut album.  She has that new British sound.  It is great to have music that both my kids and I enjoy.  Her music is clean and you can enjoy listening to it while your kids are in the car.  My young kids ask to listen to her music everytime we get in the car.    Great album!

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I just got back from seeing Walle, and I was blown away on how good it was. I can say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not since E.T. has a movie taken me on such an emotional (close to tears) roller coaster ride and I'm a grown adult. It amazes me how a movie with such little dialogue can just take you on this emotional journey and bring out that kid in all of us. I will not go in to what this move is about because I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but I will say Walle is sure to become the next E.T. for this new generation. If you want to see a family film at its best check out (this sure to become a classic)  Wall-e.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|I'd rather not condemn Offspring for changing up their musical style. Ever since Ixnay On The Hombre, Offspring have been incorporating non-punk elements into thier music throughout the years and I always thought that it set them apart from other punk bands. I think this is a fine album from the band and better than Splinter. I mean, how can you expect this band to continue to play the same ol' style after 20+ years? I'm glad to hear something different from them. Nothingtown, You're Gonna Go Far Kid, The O.C. Life cover. Great stuff. Am I the only one who thinks that A Lot Like Me sounds like a Linkin Park song? I dont like Linkin Park, so I have to say that Offspring does LP better than they do. The only song I dont care for is Kristi Are You Doing Ok because it sounds too Emo. Bottom Line, if you have stuck with Offspring through the years, then give this album a chance because it is the best one since Americana in my opinion...minus the EMo song that is! Heh.
B000HT3P7E|2.0|Pretty disappointed when I popped the first DVD in and saw the black bars on the screen.  Got Season 2 at the same time and it's Widescreen.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|One of my favorite movies thanks cats, got it in less then a week. Nice works, Pepsi is my drink of choice, nothing like it. Amazon ain't to shabby either. Rock On!!
B0013URJTG|5.0|This is hands down one of the best albums i have heard in my life. To me, it is unfathomable that anyone wouldnt like this one. It has everything you could possibly ask for in an album, and everything is drilled down to perfection. I waited a long time for this re release and it is nothing short of spectacular. If you like alt rock or psychedelic rock or just music in general, and hate the stuff they play on the radio, then this one is for you. Highlights include Russia On Ice and Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled. Check it out. It has been unavailable for a long time and now its back, so pick up a copy while you can.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|It took me a long time to purchase this movie. I read reviews on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes and Christian Spotlight on Entertainment. The critics really seemed to be slamming this movie.    My curiosity finally won out, and I bought the Blu-ray dvd.    I was blown away. This movie was great. I don't know what all the fuss is about.    Sure it wasn't perfect and you can nitpick here and there. But when it comes down to it, this movie is quite enjoyable, with plenty of keep you on the edge of your seat tension. The acting was very convincing and I felt a connection and sympathy with most of the characters. The actors came across as real people, even though they were all very good looking - but that's a bit of a plus I think. I was thoroughly entertained and think back on this movie fondly. It was over all too soon, I was left wanting more!    I have a 40\\" 1080p TV, so the nausea that people complained about never was an issue, as it might have been watching this on a huge theater screen. The shaking wasn't excessive nor distracting to me, I quickly got used to it. What I usually hate in modern day movies are the MTV type quick edits, which doesn't happen here. You get long duration shots, not quick flashing every 2 seconds from scene to scene.    The monster, a rather odd conception, nonetheless did it's job and was a terrifying creature indeed.    As a Blu-ray feature, I found the picture quality and sound to be first rate. This movie occurs mostly at night, and the contrast levels, color and sharpness met my expectations.    All in all, Cloverfield was well worth the money spent.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|This is a great addition to any Romero fan's collection. This is Dawn of the Dead in full HD! What more could you ask for? The quality is excellent, and the 5.1 surround sound is stunning.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Killer Album, lets me go back to when music was music. Got it in less then a week. Good works Amazon and Pepsi. You Cats Rock! Yeah!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay is good.  They're better than most.  Most rap, most country, most rock and DEFINITELY most pop.  But Viva la Vida is extremely overexposed, and Coldplay have long been riding a tidal wave of mediocrity over the heads of the consumers.  Regarding their most recent release, the lyrics are interesting, the melodies pretty, the songs epic in scope, but rather pedestrian when all the synthesizers are stripped away.  Chris Martin has a nice voice, but not an inspiring one.  But, then again, the same might be said about U2, and look what they've accomplished.  At least Coldplay aren't a ripoff (well, yes, they do bear more than a passing nod to U2, but I mean ripoff in the \\"you've been robbed\\" kind of way)...at worst you might feel like you spent too much on the CD - you won't be wondering why you bought it in the first place.    I probably wouldn't be so critical had I not been expecting considerably more from their new CD.  The song \\"Viva la Vida\\" was stuck in my head by about the fifth time I saw the stupid iTunes commercial.  It's arranged in a way to make it a depaparture from typical pop/rock drivel, and I like its bass pulse:  solid without being bombastic.  Nice layering of sounds, but it sounds canned overall.  There are a couple of tunes that sound like they borrowed a page from Sgt. Pepper (but who HASN'T borrowed a page from Sgt. Pepper?), and a few that suggest to me a hasty trip from concept to final mix.    HOWEVER, if you think I'm being overly critical, you should hear my rants about 99.9999999% of the rest of the music that I have been subjected to and tortured with over the years.  Overall, I'm pleased by Coldplay's latest.  I give it 7 points for every single track being worthy of repeated listens, 1 point for the single \\"Viva la Vida\\" having the incredible capacity to get stuck in your head, minus 2 points for the CD as a whole not living up to the hype, but I'm giving those 2 points back as extra credit for still being better than most of what else the recording industry attempts to shove down our throats.      80%.  That's a solid B.  Good effort.
1416524800|5.0|I have to admit I did not care for the Da Vinci Code very much - I enjoy Brown's writing style, just not all the secret society stuff. But this book has all the elements of a good thriller - suspense, actions, political drama, discoveries in the Arctic Circle, plot twists... what more can you ask for?<br /><br />This is not an earth-shattering piece of literature. But it's an easy read, it kept me captivated, and in fact I enjoyed reading this much more than I enjoyed seeing the new Indiana Jones. So I give it 5-stars.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|omg, where to begin?... the first song will grab you. it is the best album produced in a long time...
B000002LHT|2.0|I have been a Ramones fan ever since I could remember and I thought they could never do anything wrong, album wise. Was I wrong!<br />\\"Brain Drain\\" is probably the worst album the Ramones have put out. Only five of the tracks out of the twelve, are worth listening to.<br />(\\" I Believe in Miracles\\", \\"Punishment Fits The Crime\\", \\"Palisades Park\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\" and \\"Merry Christmas (I don't wanna fight tonight)\\"  )<br />DO NOT get this as a introduction to the Ramones music. You will be severely  disappointed.
B0012Q732O|2.0|Sadly, while I found Dragon Wars entertaining in a very stupid way, I found 10,000 BC quite boring.<br />  I wanted to like it, I tried to like it! Really! I love movies like BeastMaster and DragonSlayer and even 2000's Dungeons and Dragons. I love campy shows like Xena: Warrior Princess, Sheena, Baywatch, classic cartoon Masters of the Universe, and Cleopatra 2525. I love movies and TV shows for their mere absurdity, but I still didn't like 10,000 BC. It wasn't serious enough, and it wasn't goofy enough. Like the Eragon movie, I wish it was a little better or a little worse instead of being stuck in the limbo of mediocrity.<br />  It all comes down to this movie's main problem: not enough sabertooth tigers! Thanks to digital technology, Frank Frazetta's dream cats are moving, awesome, and semi-realistic... but they only have about 2 minutes of screentime. Y'know... they're all over the commercials and posters and stuff, but ya get no payoff. If you like wooly mammoths, though, this could be your movie.<br />  Somebody call Christopher Walken! He needs to tell the guys in charge that they need More Sabertooth!
B0018AK9RA|2.0|I have been a priest fan since the beginning and have to say this album is a very disappointment to me. I dont know why judas thinks that they have to go the queensryche direction with this poor attempt at a concept CD. The last album was much better then this lame attempt of a album. Plus to add 23 tracks to this was just torture. This direction isnt priest and I dont know why they did this but maybe they are just getting too old to go full out balls to the wall anymore. I still love ya priest but this album isnt that great at all. :( And for all you that give this album 5 stars I really dont think you are priest fans!
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Very worth the purchase. Duffy and band deliver songs and style reminisent of a 60's female vocalist and sound but edge-ier...I hate to compare her to Dusty Springfield but there is a tad of that in her sound amongst others.  The songs stay with you and I really enjoyed most of them over and over again...she's not Amy Winehouse but Duffy draws you in with her voice with nothing but a soft hauntingly sweet sound....no cuss words....good for anytime listening.
0761129235|5.0|I was fortunate enough to hear Dr. Maurer speak.  He is an excellent speaker and I knew I needed to buy the book.  It reenforced what he said and was easy to follow.  I recommend it to anyone who is trying to make a change in their lives.
B0013J30W2|1.0|I watched this movie first day it came out, I expected much more!!!  It end up to be pretty BAD! When I saw \\"Night Watch\\", the movie that made Timur Bekmambetov famous, I fall a sleep it was that boring. I was very afraid that this movie will not benefit from his involvement, and it didn't. Timur managed to kill another movie lately, by making second part to Russian classic film \\"The Irony of Fate\\".  I do not see anything brilliant about this director at all, I think he is just a guy who has a lot of rich sponsors. There are much better and more talented directors in Russia, so why him?   This film is all about special effects and nothing else! Bad and unrealistic story (one bullet does not kill 5 people and doesn't fly in circle:), poor acting, to much coping from movies like \\"The Matrix\\" and annoying camera movements, nothing new, nothing original!   If it wasn't for Angelina Jolie, super big American budget and people that made a really good trailer I don't think that many people would even show up to see it! And of course not necessary violence, it was too much!!! Like we don't have enough in real life. Hollywood should wake up and stop promoting violence to our kids! There was too many of them with their parents in the theater!
B0018OAPAW|1.0|I have been listening to The Offspring since about 1994.  This album is nothing compared to what they used to be.  I listened to clips (Thank God) before I purchased the cd.  A few songs are good, but there are songs that just scream SELL OUT.  They need to get it back together and quit trying to make mainstream corporate music happy, and work on the old shcool fans.
B00006I53S|4.0|This lens stays on my camera most of this time, that is how well I like it. In most cases it covers the focal lengths that I need at the time. I really like the image stabilization that is built into this lens. This lens auto focuses faster than most of the other lenses that I have.     I would have given it five stars except I think that it would have been a better walk around lens if it went town to 17 or 18mm instead of 28mm. But all and all, I am very satisfied with this lens in the way that it preforms and for the price that I paid for it.
1435101162|5.0|This is a beautiful compilation of Jane Austen's work. The pages are eggshell colored and the font very pleasing, but small (10 pt or so). I think this is a great buy! I've sense gotten rid of the other, individual novels I had collected since this has them all.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|The most awesome CD I have.  \\"Hard Sun\\" is a classic as well as \\"The Wolf\\" which has no lyrics but needs none.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|This movie made me want to invent a time machine, travel back in time, and prevent myself from seeing this movie.
B000001FRX|5.0|No need to go into detail about \\"Boy.\\" \\"Into The Heart,\\" \\"An Cat Dubah,\\" \\"Stories For Boys,\\" \\"I Will Follow,\\" \\"The Electric Co.,\\"  \\"Out Of Control...\\" are all timeless classics and propelled U2 into their universal acceptance and popularity.      You never see it mentioned in Rolling Stone or Billboard these days, or talked about as an influence by popular or indie musicians, which is too bad.  Before U2 finally laid an \\"Atomic Bomb,\\" next to the Stones, they have the longest running legacy in rock music, and this album is where it all started.
B00133KHCO|5.0|Such a great movie!  Exactly as advertised, arrived quickly, and in perfect condition.  Would absolutely use this seller again!
B0014NDXGA|3.0|Received my Bushnell Tour V2 w/ Pinseeker yesterday, but 3 of the 7 LCD segments in the \\"ones\\" digit did not display.  I could not distinguish between 3 and 8, for example.  We'll write back when the replacement arrives.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best recorded concert out there. If  you can find a SACD or LP copy if this, it is worth buying a record player or SACD player JUST FOR THIS. I'm not even kidding. However, the CD is still awesome. Just make sure if you upload it to your computer, do it lossless. This was recorded using the best mics out there with the audience recored also. Because of this, you hear some crowd noise with an absolutely \\"you are there\\" feeling. It's hard to explain, but there is a lot of air in this recording. It's like they recorded the whole atmosphere of the concert hall. I can't recommend this enough.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I love the actors, but since I'm not familiar with the book (I read half of it years ago and thought it was pretty boring compared to Alison Weir or Jean Plaidy), I don't know if the historical content is skewed because of the book or the movie. I went along with the inaccuracies for most of the movie because I adore the actors. However the whole \\"Anne slept with her brother George\\" was the plot point that had me putting the DVD back in the Netflix envelope. Having read a number of books on this subject, most authors and scholars see that charge against Anne Boleyn as false, only a means for Henry to execute her and make way for the next wife.
B0018DUPTE|2.0|Emerick and co-author Massey can't seem to get out of their own way in delivering the story of Emerick's days recording the Beatles. Their awkward, uneven account reads like a 300-page high school writing assignment.    This book desperately needs a talented co-author. Even more, it cries for an editor to give the book strong direction, eliminating diversion and self congratulation while focusing on the kind of detail and anecdote that could truly shed new light on the greatest musical story of a generation.    The story might have been compelling, except for the ego, cliche, pettiness, and sycophancy leaking through nearly every page. I will say that this book does reveal a few insights, but must also caution that the effort required to find them will require a thorough cleaning of shoes afterward.    The book is destined for the Dollar Bin here, there, and everywhere.
0312360266|5.0|I LOVE BOOKS LIKE THIS ONE AND WOULD RECOMMEND  IT TO ALL.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Brilliant work here.  I was fortunate enough to see the show last December and this is almost as good as being there.    Stunning use of film - John & the gang never sounded better.    Buy it, you won't be disappointed, and like a reviewer recently said, \\"He plays like his life depends on it\\".
B000E5KJGQ|3.0|After seeing what the new technology can do to the visual quality of another Vietnam film 30+ years old (The Deer Hunter), I was disappointed in how this presentation of FMJ looked in hi-def.  It almost looks like the SD (standard def) disc was \\"dubbed\\" and simply relabeled \\"HD\\"; much of the first half of the film looks over-exposed & washed out, esp. scenes in the barracks.  In addition there is NOTHING extra included in the HD disc vs. the disc!  No commentaries, no deleted scenes, nothing! As large & diverse as this ensemble cast was, surely Warner Brothers could have found at least ONE of the actors to provide some much-needed insight on how this film was made & the feelings of the cast on-set.    I hope the \\"deluxe\\" HD-DVD package brings more to the table than this one...it wouldn't be difficult at all.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Is the silent film era back? There is very little talking (especially in the first 45 minutes), but I was never bored. This tiny box of metal conveys so much with his little beeps and body movements it is just amazing to watch. Then Eve comes along, and these two have some great chemistry for robots who can really only say each other's names. Okay, so it can be slow at times and not what the kiddies might expect from a Pixar film, but I feel this one falls in with Ratatouille in terms of quality filmmaking. This isn't just for the children. It is done in a way to make sure it is a timeless story for all to enjoy.<br /><br />I almost forgot. The little bunny short film before the movie is really good, and dare I say I enjoyed it more than the main feature. Or maybe Wall-E was just a little too much of a good thing.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|wow. they should be proud.   very well thought out, excellent production, great execution.     a beautiful album that flows well and delivers where and when its needed.    in time of overkill, not overdone at all... this may be it's strongest point.    double cd  is like a good long book - rich and varied, develops and builds.  big headphones recommended...
B0013J30W2|4.0|I had really been looking forward to this flick and while it didn't blow my mind, the action scenes are some of the most inventive since a little film called The Matrix came a knocking back in 1999. Make no mistake about it, this doesn't shy away from the gore at all. You will get bucket loads. The story and dialogue are pretty good, but the actors are the ones that sell what could have been an eye rolling buffet. Angelina Jolie underplays the part and it works, while Morgan Freeman gets to show a little of his darker side as an actor. Good stuff from both of them. James McAvoy as the nerd turned action hero grew on me as the film progressed and by the end I found myself rooting for him.<br /><br />When I think of Wanted, I think of Shoot 'Em Up with a better story, characters and more inventive action stunts. Quite simply, if your a guy you will get your money's worth.
B0015519VS|5.0|Just like a previous reader stated, if you are expecting \\"Confessions\\" or \\"8701\\" on this CD, you are in for disappointment. He's probably lost many fans due to his marriage to Tomeka, but this fan will stick around. Usher come back on a different level on \\"Here I Stand\\", professing his love he has for his wife . We admits to being tempted every once in a while on \\"Appetite\\".  For those out there that are expecting cheating, creeping, etc, don't listen. On \\"Best Thing\\" Jay Z professes \\"Even grass grow...boys turn into men...let's lead the way.\\"     My favorites:  Trading Places  Something Special  Appetite  Before I Met You  His Mistakes  Best Thing  Here I stand    Usher has shown his maturity on this CD. I look forward to hearing more great music.
B000267JQK|5.0|If you like Seether and don't own this album then what are you waiting on? This is an awesome album, I listen to it over and over again.  Not only do you get 20 great songs, but you get a pretty neat dvd to.  The dvd features music videos for \\"Broken\\" \\"Gasoline\\" \\"Fine Again\\" and \\"Driven Under\\" plus a Making of video for \\"Broken\\" not only does it feature those videos, it also features a full lenth concert.
1582701709|5.0|I found this book to be extremely inspirational, it actually changed my very negative life incredibly fast, to one of peace of mind. I highly recommend this book. If you are ready for it, it too can change yours.  I have proven that the concept outlined in this book definitely works. It came as a blessing just at the right time of my life. Try it, I challenge you.
B000EAT246|4.0|This is a great movie, especially if you are a sci-fi fan, and a helicopter fan. It has quite a bit of action, and high drama.
B0015XASFS|4.0|I enjoyed this very much.  In fact, I bought another one as a gift. I do have to say that the very first DVD and CD was the absolute best, but Josh, himself, has grown and vastly improved his concert skills.  Still---well, it is a toss-up, but I still give #1 the edge.  This is definitely better than the others though. Keep going Josh!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I think August Rush was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.  It has a valuable lesson on using your intuition to guide you.  Excellent movie.
B0018TLRTU|4.0|It is well worth the extra cash to get the CD/DVD version of this release. Billy Idol was just such an amazing visual artist along with musician that having the songs without the videos is just getting half of it. Plus it contains \\"Cradle Of Love\\" aka: The Greatest Music Video Of All Time! Every guy out there of a certain age, knows what I mean. I deducted one star only because They decided to omit the video for \\"Shock to The System\\" which I remember being really great. It featured Billy morphing into a cyborg. The song is included, but not the video. So many Idol fans like myself loved the Cyberpunk album and it's too bad it seems Billy would rather forget it. Great collection anyhow.
0142000663|5.0|I read Grapes of Wrath in my late teens, and just didn't get what all of the fanfare was about.  I liked the characters, but I didn't fully appreciate what Steinbeck was trying to do.<br /><br />Flash forward a few decades -- I picked it up again a couple of weeks ago, and read it in two sittings.  I was completely captivated.  Not only did the Joads come to life, but their circumstances, their defeats and their successes, resonated with realism.  Rather than being relegated to the dusty \\"classics\\" shelf, this book is more relevant today.  One can easily replace the Joads with immigrant farm workers in our current society, and  get a glimpse of exactly how things don't change.  Steinbeck nailed human frailty and bigotry, as well as the largess of the human spirit.<br /><br />Read this book.  Even if you walk away thinking, \\"What a bunch of lefty crud!\\" it will be worth your while. The story is heart-warming (and sometimes heartrending), and very real.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Truly one of the best movies I have ever seen! It was breathtakingly beautiful. Not only the looks (which were by far the best Pixar has dished out) but also emotionally. I'll start with the star: WALL*E. He was THE most adorable thing I have seen. From the way he moved to the way he \\"talked\\". He oozed cuteness. WAAAALLEE! And then there was the relationship between WALL*E and EVE. I have seldom seen a more true relationship, even in humans. I think I speak for most when I say that I was a little teary at some parts, whether it be story related or from it's visual beauty. However, the movie is not just sun shine and rainbows. It has a very strong message, present throughout most of the movie that really unnerved me. This future is very possible. However, only Pixar could suceed in not turning it into the preachy film it so easily could have been. The perfect movie! Way to go Pixar! 10 out of 10
B000067CPX|2.0|Man, what happened to the Chili peppers? I love the vocal harmonies, but the passion and intensity are nowhere to be found on this CD. It bored the hell out of me.
B000063V8S|5.0|I ended up purchasing the entire series after sampling with season 4. Apparently the 4th was about the time when you got to see the actors doing a lot of the directing.This one has Jordi as a lizzard;Picard in France just freed from the Borg;Data plays his dad,himself, and brother;Whorf has a wife and a son; Wesley survives the dessert/saves Picard and runs off to the Academy;.. a good season.I was sad when it was all familiar again.
1844138518|5.0|As an author who has just entered the world of Print on Demand (see [[ASIN:0955763703 Virtually Maria (Virtual Trilogy)]]and [[ASIN:0955763711 A Matter of Time]]) I found Chris Anderson's excellent book a great guide to the theory and practice of the rapidly expanding virtual marketplace.<br /><br />In particular, I found his theories on the growth of niche markets and specialist sales on the internet very useful when planning my own online campaigns and creating a \\"web presence\\". His style is extremely readable and the book is well laid out and (thankfully for a former computer Luddite like myself) virtually jargon free.<br /><br />If you want to know the theories behind what is happening at the cutting edge of the worldwide markets in cyberspace today - be it to sell your own wares or to impress your colleagues over coffee, I would strongly recommend this book.
0446691437|5.0|If you are in a certain part of your life right now, you'll find the book profound.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This series set is absolutely one of the most fabulous gifts I have ever given myself.  I love, love, love it!!      If you or a friend is a Sex and the City fan; I recommend this set if you  want to purchase a gift for someone or yourself 100%. You will not be disappointed!  Enjoy!!
B0015UWODA|4.0|I've heard David Sedaris on NPR, reading his own stories aloud. This is my first purchase of one of his books, and my reaction was mixed. The first story about being an elf in a department store was hilarious, especially when read aloud. The other stories, so far (I'm almost through it) have been less successful but still well-written. I'm happy enough with it to purchase other of his books (I see three of them are on one of the top ten fiction lists now) and see if his writing style is one that I truly enjoy.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL-E hit theaters today and packed the seats a noon at my local movie house.  I've enjoyed every Pixar movie that's come out, and this one is no exception.  However, I have to admit that after the deluge of trailers that have haunted the television set later I was expecting to be blown away.<br /><br />I wasn't blown away, but don't misunderstand.  The movie was a good romp that kept all the tykes in the audience on the edge of their seats throughout, and there were quite a few giggles for the adults too, but the movie just hit all the expected twists and turns without becoming anything more than an adventurous love story mixed with ecological and physical health issues.<br /><br />The movie takes place about eight hundred years in the future.  Message #1 comes about when all the viewer can see is endless mounds of compacted refuse stand as towering high-rises.  Wall-E, our everyman hero, toils alone in the garbage heap that used to be our planet.  Well, there's no denying that axe because everyone in the film grinds that one home.  When there was nowhere left to stack refuse, humanity abandoned the world and went out into space.<br /><br />That's a sour but realistic take on the world's current population, but I have to wonder if a spaceship would actually launch into space with no destination.  According to the story, the people aboard the Axiom have been in space for 700 years.  How was population growth maintained?  How about food sources?  If the ship was capable of regenerating food and water every day, why wasn't that done on earth?  But I digress.  In my defense, Pixar writers and developers generally do a much cleaner job of world-building.<br /><br />Wall-E is an adorable character.  The thought and care that went into his construction is immediately evident.  In a way, he reminded me of Johnny Five from the movie SHORT CIRCUIT, but that was good because Johnny Five was a kid-friendly character and movie as well.<br /><br />I loved Wall-E's mannerisms and the motions he was capable of as he went about his daily job of crushing trash.  His home was a delight and many of the kids, including mine, laughed and enjoyed everything.  Pixar is so good at details in these movies that I'm constantly surprised at the depth to which they think about everything.  Having Wall-E visit the graveyard of his fellow robots was a great touch.  It introduced the pathos of his loneliness, pointed out his eventual future, and explained how he kept working away after wearing out parts.  The bit with him hanging his treads up as he entered his home was terrific.<br /><br />Eve is a robot of a different sort.  She's sleeker and more powerful, and definitely quicker on the trigger.  I didn't quite warm up to her as much as Wall-E, though she is our heroine and female romantic lead, but the expressions they were able to create with her eyes alone were fantastic.<br /><br />Wall-E continues showing up for work every day even though the rest of the world has bailed on him or become totally dysfunctional.  That was incredibly touching, though no explanation is given for why he developed a personality.  Eve's arrival to search for plant life (though we don't know that for a long time, and there's not really any reason given for why the AXIOM couldn't simply have gone on to another planet) changes Wall-E's existence forever.<br /><br />The fact that he was able to fall in love with her was great and served the story, but Eve is portrayed as having no personality.  I had to let that go because part of me wanted to be an adult and learn how the AIs had progressed that far.  See?  I struggled with technology versus fantasy throughout the film, but that may have just been men.<br /><br />When I looked at the movie through a child's eyes, I was kept happy.

B0013K6WLM|3.0|listening to this latest Black Keys album.  I know it's very popular to love this album and the collaboration between Danger Mouse and the Keys, but it just ain't got the simple beauty of their earlier stuff.  While I agree with others that innovation and change are good things for bands to explore, I do not think that is what happened here.  It feels to me like they just dressed up some old concepts and dulled the edge that makes the early stuff so great.  I also agree that Magic Potion was not very inspired, but I do miss being amazed by the incredible depth of the early, simple, raw, recordings.  It's possible to innovate without losing the soul.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|Strap yourself in for this rollercoaster ride!  Right from the start Antithesis fires on all cylinders.  There is relentless intensity and razor sharp precision throughout this album.  There is definitely the \\"wall of sound\\" thing happening here.  To the uninitiated, this may just sound like noise, but to those familiar with technical death metal, this is satisfying ear candy.  If you like this, also check out Arsis - A Celebration Of Guilt.  Both albums are super heavy and ultra complex.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|The Mist is director Frank Darabont's shot at doing an actual horror film that's similar to those made during the 1950s.  Just think of Them, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, It Came From Beneath the Sea, and you'll have of what he was trying to do with Stephen King's most famous novella.  It should also be noted that the movie is in both color and black and white on the Two-Disc Collector's Edition.  Simply take your pick of which version you want to watch.  Let it be known up front that if you decide to watch this movie hoping to see a Frank Darabont film (The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption), you're likely to be disappointed with the product.  While The Mist is an entertaining, well-made movie for its genre, it's not going to be nominated for any Academy Awards.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't read the novella or seen the movie, the story deals with a large group of people who find themselves trapped inside a local grocery store when a heavy mist drifts in from the surrounding woodlands, enveloping the entire Maine town and bringing with it an array of dangerous and hungry creatures in search of some subsistence.  It's not important how the mist came to be, though the film points to a military experiment gone wrong with the creatures entering our world from another dimension.  What's really unusual about this story isn't so much the danger that awaiting patiently outside the grocery store, but rather the danger that's inside the place.  As the tale progresses and the fear for their lives intensifies, the trapped people quickly split into two distinct camps with one being led by a religious zealot and the other by a sensible everyday man who simply wants to get himself and his young son back to safety.  The underlying current here is how swiftly the thin veneer of civilization can slip away when human beings are trapped and filled with an increasing fear for their lives with nowhere to turn.  The rest of the story deals with what happens inside the store, especially when some the jaw-smacking creatures breach the defenses that have been placed to keep them out.  The good citizens of the store prove to be infinitely more frightening than the strange things outside in the mist.<br /><br />I have to be honest and say that I was disappointed in the film when I first saw it in the theater.  I certainly didn't like the ending and the lack of hope it represented to me.  When the DVD set came out, I purchased it for my film library and decided to watch the movie a second time.  This proved to be a good thing because I found myself enjoying the film a lot more the second time around and could see how well made it actually was.  I still had problems with the finale because it was like everyone you cared about gave up at the end, not wanting to be food for the creatures hidden within the mist.  The ending to Stephen King's novella was completely different, but he's publicly stated that if he'd come up with Darabont's ending when originally writing the story, he'd gone with it.  Certainly the ending has provoked a great deal of controversy with the fans.  I think it's also strange that I liked the more realistic ending of the Director's Cut of 1408, but didn't enjoy it here.  Still, the movie's very entertaining with a number of scenes that will have you jumping in your seat.  It's fast pace with extremely good acting by Thomas Jane, Academy Award Winner Marcia Gay Harden, Toby Jones (who played Truman Capote the year before), Laurie Holden, the always fabulous Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, and Hollywoodland), and Andre Braugher (who was in the remake of Salem's Lot for television).<br /><br />As I wrote earlier, the Two-Disc Collector's Edition has the movie in both color and black and white formats.  There's a commentary by Frank Darabont, which is always fun to listen to, and a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie and the creation of many of its special effects.  This is definitely a movie that all horror buffs should have in their film library.  I'm certainly glad that I bought the DVD set and gave the movie another chance.horror buffs should have in their film library.

B0018TLRT0|5.0|This release is an celebration of the 30th year since \\"Parallel Lines' was released. Without a doubt, the definitive New Wave-Punk album of all time. The album spent 2 years both on the British and American charts, and sold to date over 20 million copies, making this album one of the top 50 biggest selling albums all time. Pure perfection is the best way to describe Parallel Lines, chalk full of rocks finest 3 minute songs. The mega #1 smash Heart of Glass was a major crossover hit, incorporating rock-new wave with disco, the driving beat of One Way or Another is another rock classic. Other notable songs or hits are \\"Picture this, Pretty Baby, Hanging on the Telephone and Sunday Girl\\". Sunday Girl was a british #1 in August 1979 and was the 5th biggest hit of the year in the Uk.    Rolling Stone Magazine rates this album the #140th of the all time Top 500 albums EVER RELEASED.....    The album is perfect, however a few people have complained about the re-release, like I mentioned before this was a celebration release, where as the 2001 release was a digital re-release with bonus live material, where as this current release has 4 videos and some remix material, and unlike a previous review, I have way too much admiration  and respect for the artist to simply download material from the net for free as they put it. I support my favourite artists and there hard earned work to rip them off, we're called fans.    Although I wasn't pleased with the remix choices, this album is current with the latest technology and sounds awesome, so ignore the bad reviews, Parallel Lines could never be a bad purchase!!!

6301971272|5.0|On the heels of a \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" and \\"A Few Dollars More\\", this film is the greatest of the Italian trilogy as Wallach and Van Cleef add perfect balance to Eastwood in this western thriller set in the Civil War, in the midst of Confederate General Sibley's failed attempt to wrest New Mexico from the Union. What is superior in this film, compared to the two earlier films with Van Cleef and Eastwood, is the addition of the excellent actor Wallach who plays the unprincipled, unflinching, killer Tucco who adds a constant, light and subtle comical touch to the film that invokes timely humor, literally tongue in cheek, into the many tense action scenes. Eastwood, as Blondie, is still the man with no name, speaking only a few words but speaking poignantly, as the dominant, cool good guy with Van Cleef as the methodical, steely eyed nemesis, a perfect foil for Eastwood. Wallach (Tucco) serves as a bridge between the two characters, making allegiances with who ever serves him the best. In other words, none can completely trust the other. This full version has several previously uncut scenes that add several minutes to the movie, some of which are helpful and a few may seem a little long such as the dessert scene where Tucco seeks revenge over Blondie. However, the film never loses its original punch and the sound track is unforgettable and it is used delightfully to kick up an action scene. Long after the movie is over, the music will continuously echo into your brain as the music never seems dated and the mere sound of the music heard anywhere brings you back to the film.  Sergio Leone, who directed and wrote the script, pulls together one of the largest casts and production sets as he utilizes sets featuring whole towns and large scale battlefields. Some of the scenes of the Civil War are confusing such as the mix of what appears to be butternut uniformed Confederates mixed with the Union army at a bridge head. They may be \\"galvanized Yankees\\", confederates that traded sides after capture or they could be western volunteers. Leone pulls out the stops to create realistic battlefields, uniforms and gear although the battlefield bridge scene looks a bit over the top as each side fights enmasse over a bridge, remindingme of a flamboyant portrait of masses of infantry colliding on a span. In this large scene, he displays virtually every kind of cannon fro rifled Napoleons, smooth bores, large mortars and siege guns. The latter two less likely then the two former for the west due to limited transportation in the west particularly the siege guns. The additional 20 minutes history lesson on the additional disc gives a good over view of what was happening in this western Civil War campaign that the three characters stumble into. The film, with wide screen, is exciting, frequently funny, never too serious and unforgettable. A tremendous side story is the tremendous loss of life experienced during the Civil War displayed by large casualties, overwhelmed hospitals, prison camps, disabled veterans and, in the pivotal scene, a cemetery so large it seems without end. Although the characters are all hardened and can readily shoot a man, Leone shows, through the back drop of America's most costly war in human loss, the sheer violence and loss of life that reminds us that war is far less romantic. The writing is first rate, there are numerous memorable lines spoken by the main characters such as:<br /><br />\\"You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig.\\"ed sides after capture or they could be western volunteers.

B0013J30W2|4.0|WOW! Where Night Watch was a solid idea but boring, the director came to Hollywood and actually became a premiere action/adventure filmaker.    If you like Quentin Tarantion films, then ultra cool and uber-violent WANTEd will fill your bill. Awesome action sequences with a nude Angelina Jolie spells winner in our book.     Along with a solid cast, with twists and turns and funny lines throughout, WANTED is definately a great summer movie that will be sure to make you spill your popcorn.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Heck yeah! Finally, a mainstream horror movie that's not afraid to be gritty. No campy, PG-13 family-friendly crap. No teenagers running around  having sex and then getting hacked by a lumbering serial killer. Just 2 men locked in a dirty bathroom, cryptic clues left by a deranged killer, and a puppet.<br /><br /> The beauty of this movie is in its simplicity. The entire film was shot in one building with an extremely low budget. The two main characters, a photographer named Adam and a surgeon named Lawrence, wake up one day to find themselves locked in a grimy bathroom, chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room. In between them, there is a dead body with a gun in one hand, a tape recorder in the other, and his brains blown out and pooling on the floor. From then on, the two men must work together to solve the puzzle the killer, Jigsaw, has left them, and get out of their situation alive.<br /><br />  Jigsaw is a serial killer who uses \\"traps\\" to test his victims. His basic M.O. is that he puts them in situations, often with medieval-like torture devices, that will either kill them horribly, or leave them alive with permanent psychological and/or physical damage. Most of the time, these traps relate in some way to the person's lifestyle. Jigsaw's goal is to teach people to be grateful to be alive.<br /><br /> There are many misconceptions people have about this movie. First of all, it's not THAT gory. Yes, there is blood aplenty, and the traps Jigsaw sets for his victims(including a web of barbed wire a man must plow through, and a device hooked into a woman's jaw that could potentially permanently rip her mouth open) are just sick. But most of the horror comes with the THOUGHT of how painful the traps are, and not necessarily what is shown on screen. The majority of the gorehounds I know say that this movie is pretty tame.<br />  Second of all, \\"Saw\\" is NOT torture porn. \\"Hostel\\" is torture porn. \\"Touristas\\" is torture porn. \\"Saw\\", however, is not. You know why? The fact of the matter is...THERE IS NO PORN IN THIS MOVIE. Not even a boob or a buttcrack. THERE IS NO NUDITY. And heck, there isn't really any \\"torture\\" either...not really.<br /><br />  However, I'm not gonna lie and say this movie is flawless. This has a lot to do with the director's lack of money, but that doesn't account for everything. In fact, I can see why some people really don't like this movie.<br />  There are a ton of plot holes and unanswered questions. There are quite a few hammy one-liners(\\"This is the most fun I've had without lubricant!\\"), and the acting in some places is hilariously abysmal(Like when Adam pretends to die). I understand how these could get in the way of enjoying the movie, but for me, they weren't that big of a deal.<br /><br /> All in all, this is one creepy and fascinating movie. The most enjoyable aspect of it is discovering more and more facts about the two main characters as the movie progresses, and discovering the connection they have while watching them learn to cope and work with each other. While not perfect, it's certainly entertaining and worthwhile.
B00164DWEA|5.0|*WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW IN RECAP*    RECAP:  The best of the Marvel movies this summer was released yesterday. I do not read superhero comic books, but I do see almost every superhero movie. This film is at the top of my list. The beginning opens up with action right away. After Ang Lee's 2003 release, Hulk (which I personally loved), Ed Norton didn't waste anytime with an origin story. The opening credits, lasting about 1 1/2 minutes to 2 minutes, recap Bruce Banner's experiment with gamma radiation, which turns him into the Hulk. The next thing we see is Bruce 5 months later hiding out in Brazil from Gen. Ross, since he is now a fugitive. He is learning Portuguese, working in a bottle factory, and trying to control his breathing to stop what is referred as the incident. Gen. Ross finds him eventually, the cause including a cameo from Stan Lee (possibly his best). Now Bruce is on his way home in order to find Mr. Blue (Dr. Samuel Sterns played by Tim Blake Nelson) in order to find a cure. He first runs into Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), his love, and she helps him hide from her father, Gen. Ross. Gen. Ross has a Russian soldier on his team, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who witnesses Banner's transformation and is more than glad to go through a similar exposure of gamma radiation to achieve that strength and power. This leads to the villain Abomination. Finally, at the end Bruce must turn and fight Abomination in order to save New York City in a nicely done concluding battle.    OPINION:  As I stated above, this is my favorite Marvel film of the summer, considering there are only two out. I personally hated Iron Man. I will get that out of the way first. I thought the beginning was excellent and should have continued on that way. But once the film goes back 36 hours to recap Tony Stark's history and how he got in that particular situation of being held captive, the momentum is totally thrown out of balance. I do not like it when films spoon feed you either, I wanted a film that slowly and progressively told you the history of Tony Stark. Dr. Yinsen should have slowly and gradually learned about Tony Stark through stories from Tony and how he got there, instead of in a boring and linear fashion. I think Jon Favreau made the terrorists out to look very stupid, which they aren't. First, Tony Stark is not building their missile and they know that, but they let him continue building his soon to be iron man suit (the first product). The acting was ok, with funny one liners thrown at you from all directions, but it was very simplistic and there was nothing to the story. Tony Stark spends so much time testing out his new and final iron man suit, more time than him actually fighting in it. Also, the very end when Obadiah jumps into his version of iron man, he knows how to fly it and work it and everything, whereas Tony Stark had to spend forever testing his suit out. I also didn't like how the villain was basically iron man himself, just an older version. Overall I thought the movie was too boring, too simplistic, with too many one liners and not enough depth.    The Incredible Hulk on the other hand begins with a bang. I think Ed Norton was the perfect choice to play Bruce Banner and kudos to him for making the film work with his modified version of the screenplay (unfortunately he does not get any credit for it). This is my favorite superhero movie of the year and my second overall movie of the year behind Speed Racer and Wall-e is a follow-up to this film.  As I mentioned up top, I do love Ang Lee's version, Hulk, because of the phsycological look on Bruce Banner and his past and the trauma he went through as a child. For me this film continues right where Ang Lee's left off. At the end of Hulk Bruce Banner is in the Brazilian forest, where Ed Norton's Banner is seen at the start of this film. In Hulk Banner brings up, at one point, to his father (Nick Nolte) that he will find a cure and get rid of this thing inside of him. Before he can do that he must go through the phsycological stuff first. Once the film ends he has been through it and now must deal with finding a cure. That is where The Incredible Hulk begins. I didn't mind the CGI in Ang Lee's version, but after seeing this years, it is quite obvious that this CGI is much better. So Ed Norton did a great job playing Bruce, better than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler was really good as Betty Ross (although I love Jennifer Connely), William Hurt did a wonderful job as Gen. Ross, and Tim Roth was great as the crazy (although not nearly as crazy as Nick Nolte) Emil Blonsky. The fighting sequences were very fun and well done, Norton and Tyler had great chemistry, Tim Blake Nelson was great, Roth was very convincing, and overall I loved this film and see it as a great SEQUEL to the original Hulk movie, even though Norton refers to it as a reboot (and a lot do, since that is what it truly is) and there are a few things that may not necessarily fall in line with the original story line. The film has great cameos.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar has done it yet again. Just when I thought Ratatouille was the best Pixar film, they release Wall-e.    *SPOILERS BELOW*  Wall-e is a story of what earth will be like in the future. All the humans have up and left. The only \\"living\\", more like functioning, thing left is a robot named Wall-e. But in the end Wall-e is very alive for everyone. He is a lovable character that will sway almost any heart. This is Pixar's first film to experiment this much. For Pixar to include live-action humans and to make this a silent film was very risky. But who better to do it than Pixar. And they do it perfectly. The film is very adult themed, but with enough to talk to children and present them with the future they will have to take on. Some reviewers have claimed this is a liberal themed movie, but I couldn't disagree more. Yes, the Ceo of 'Buy 'N Large' does say 'We must stay the course.' But I think Pixar is showing one corrupt mind and how he handles the most difficult situations and many politicians are that way and many are not (both liberal and conservative), and many people in charge of a huge company are that way and others aren't, and average people you meet on the street are like that and others aren't. They claim it to be like Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. And so what if it is, even though it isn't. This was not a documentary, it had science fiction, comedy, and romance, which correct me if I am wrong, An Inconvenient Truth didn't. Yes, both movies have a similar theme, but so what. It isn't a bad theme. I know for a fact Al Gore said his film was neither liberal or conservative, it was for humanity. That is exactly what Wall-e is. A film for humanity. Yes, the movie does portray humanity in a negative way, but a negative way where as a race they have lost track and need to come back to reality. The film portrays humanity as a community that can come together and overcome what seem like impossible situations. When times are tough or some have lost their way, weget through it and help one another. This is Pixar's first film that is so heavily adult themed and has the best message for the oldest people and the youngest people. This is one of three PERFECT films of 2008 so far (behind my personal favorites Speed Racer and The Incredible Hulk).    And yes I did mention above how this is my favorite Pixar film. Every year Pixar does this to me. After I saw Monster's Inc. it was better than either Toy Story movie. Then Finding Nemo came out and that was wonderful. Of course the following year The Incredibles came out (which could be my favorite Pixar movie at my heart of hearts because I am such a superhero movie nerd). Then Ratatouille came out two years later and there was no way it could ever beat The Incredibles. Well it did! And now Wall-e has done it, beating Ratatouille. And here is my reasoning. Every Pixar movie is great and Brad Bird could be my favorite director for them (although Andrew Stanton could be equal and possibly better). But this movie had one of the best messages ever in film and they succeeded and surpassed the expectations and the risks. To be able to keep children, teens, and adults enthralled in a silent, sci-fi, romatic, comedic film with live-action is incredible and without a doubt perfect!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Love this cd. Got it in less than a week and it was more than worth what I paid. Thanks
B00000DC7L|5.0|I think - like almost all Queen fans- Brian is a very underrated guitarist. Yes, there are geniuses like Vai and Satriani, let alone Petrucci and Malmsteen, but Brian is definitely one of the best. His guitar can get every feeling you can think of and he can make his own the other people's techniques; just listen to Cyborg... that tapping just takes you into space!   I first heard of this album late in 1998 after a review on the web and could only get it by downloading it. I spent almost 9 years trying to find this CD until I could finally find it in a recordstore last year(damn, how difficult this stuff is to find! but it just makes it more appreciable).   The album begins with \\"Space\\", a lullaby which acts like an intro for the album and then \\"Business\\" begins slowly but hard, a good song used for a T.V. show in Britain, I heard. Good lyrics and guitar work and hey, it's Cozy on the drums! Next track is \\"China Belle\\", which begins with a chinese-like guitar melody in the best May stile. A funny song for banging your head and jumping around your stereo set. \\"Why don't We Try Again\\", a very emotional ballad comes next, ideal if you are sad and want to blow your brains out. The next song, \\"On My Way Up\\" is for me the weak point of the album; a happy song not unheardable at all that some can find enjoyable. After this two rather soft songs comes \\"Cyborg\\", a song with a style I can not define, but still rocker, very rocker. Taylor Hawkins from Foo Fighters does a great job on the drums in this song. Check out the tapping. Jeff Becks appears in the next track, \\"The Guv'nor\\", a song May intentionally wrote to be played by Becks. Not too great though, given the size of the two guitarists, but still good. \\"Wilderness\\" is a strange ballad with a great guitar solo. You can hear sadness and emotion in it. Very good song. Here comes the cover section in which Brain pays tribute to very old classics. The first is \\"Slow Down\\" a Rock N' Roller by Larry Williams that I first heardin The Beatles version. Excellent version that, as few, can be said to be better than the original one; Brian's guitar is superb and hard in this one. Next is \\"One Rainy Wish\\" a Hendrix's song with a supernatural vibe at the beginning, as only a song by Hendrix could be, but after that, the hardness comes in a great work by Brian and Cozy, giving it a different point of view. \\"All the Way from Memphis\\" is kind of a \\"thank you\\" to Mott The Hoople, the first band Queen toured with in a decent tour in Europe and The USA. A funny and enjoyable song. The last track gives the name to the album. A sweet love ballad with a great vocal performance by Brian - sustained during the whole album - and an acoustical guitar solo, not of Brian's best, a very emotional ending to a great album, followed by a piano solo after one minute you think the song finished that I must confess, as I'm writing this, is the first time I hear it.  All in all, very recommendable for rock fans and of course, Queen fans.
0141439475|5.0|I first read Frankenstein my freshman year of high school. When asked about it, long after I stopped carrying about the novel with too many complexities for even a bright 14 year old to understand, I would simply say \\"I know that Mary Shelley is [radical feminist] Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter, but you would never know it from Frankenstein.\\"<br />I reread the novel for my Goth Lit class freshman year of college when I was better able to understand the intricacies of the text. For the first time, I did see saw Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter. Numerous reviewers before me have expounded upon the \\"Man trying to usurp God with Reckless Science\\" themes of the novel, concentrating on the Reckless Science (so like what we see paralleled today) while ignoring the phallo-centric characteristics of the science that Victor Frankenstein practices.<br />The man's science relentlessly pursues and forcibly unveils a decidedly feminine and reluctant Nature, and manages to bypass the feminine entirely with the creation of monster that came simply from the work of a man. Frankenstein houses a genuine fear of female sexuality (just looks at the dream he has following his monster's creation, in which his beloved, while in his embrace, becomes the corpse of his dead mother).<br />I know my argument might seem shoddy here, but Hindle (the editor) puts together a wonderful introduction that, among other things, connects Frankenstein's science to his maleness.<br />The are many editions of Frankenstein. I feel that this one stands out because of its fine scholarship.

Dan Roam covers that subject in the book The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures.  This opened my eyes to many different concepts that I somewhat took for granted, as well as giving me a framework for getting better at the whiteboard...<br /><br />Contents:<br />Part 1 - Introductions - Anytime, Anyone, Anywhere - Solving Problems with Pictures: A Whole New Way of Looking at Business; Which Problems, Which Pictures, and Who is \\"We\\"?; A Gamble We Can't Lose - The Four Steps of Visual Speaking<br />Part 2 - Discovering Ideas - Looking Better, Seeing Sharper, Imagining Further - Tools and Rules for Good Visual Thinking: No Thanks, Just Looking; The Six Ways of Seeing; The SQVID - A Practical Lesson in Applied Imagination; Frameworks for Showing<br />Part 3 - Developing Ideas - The Visual Thinking MBA - Putting Visual Thinking to Work: Showing and The Visual Thinking MBA; Who Are Our Customers? - Pictures That Solve a Who/What Problem; How Many Are Buying? - Pictures That Solve a How Much Problem; Where Is Our Business? - Pictures That Solve a Where Problem; When Can We Fix Things? - Pictures That Solve a When Problem; How Can We Improve Our Business? - Pictures That Solve a How Problem; Why Should We Even Bother? - Pictures That Solve a Why Problem<br />Part 4 - Selling Ideas - It's Showtime; Everything I Know About Business I Learned In Show-And-Tell; Drawing Conclusions<br />Acknowledgments; Appendix A - The Science of Visual Thinking; Appendix B - Resources for Visual Thinkers<br /><br />Probably the most famous example of this type of learning is the Southwest Airlines story.  Herb Kelleher and Rollin King were discussing a failed airline of King's.  King took a napkin, drew a triangle on it, and labeled each corner Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston.  This flight plan for a small regional airline broke a number of \\"rules\\", and the result of this simple drawing became Southwest Airlines four years later.  It would have been \\"normal\\" to present an idea like this with PowerPoint slides, full color documents, and endless spreadsheets showing the numbers.  But the most effective way of illustrating the concept was a simple napkin and pen.  Roam has studied the science behind this deceptively simple idea and shows how nearly any idea can not only be communicated in this fashion, but most often can be communicated more succinctly than any other method.  The act of drawing and simplifying concepts draws people in and puts life behind your message in a way that sterile professional graphics can't do.<br /><br />Rather than just say \\"draw more\\", Roam creates a framework that allows you to figure out what type of picture applies.  The problem is one of the following: who/what (portrait), how much (chart), where (map), when (timeline), how (flowchart), and why (plot).  Within each of those frameworks, you have five options of what to show (the SQVID method): S (simple > elaborate), Q (quality > quantity), V (vision > execution), I (individual > comparison), and D (change > as-is).  Once you understand these different conditions, the type of picture becomes clear, and then it's a matter of drawing the information.  Keep in mind we're not talking about elaborate illustrations...  stick figures and simple shapes will do.  And that's a good thing, as \\"art\\" is not my forte...  :)<br /><br />This is another one of those books that will forever change the way you think about sharing information with others in a business or professional setting.  This doesn't replace high-end, quality proposals or presentations...  Instead, it simplifies and clarifies the message you have, and allows you to share it in a fraction of the time you might need for a formal, text/picture/word-laden meeting.  This ranks right up with Presentation Zen in terms of books that change the way I work, and did so immediately.hange the way I work, and did so immediately.
B000001DV2|5.0|I reluctantly bought this CD because I am a huge Steve Clark fan and it was done after his death.  I figured it couldn't have been any good if Steve wasn't involved.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  First of all, the Leps dedicated the CD to Steve, along with the song White Lightning, and (best of all!), most of the tunes were co-written by Steve.  The music is pure Hysteria Leppard with a couple of notable exceptions that sound as if they could have been done in their Pyromania days (\\"Tear It Down,\\" especially). There are also a couple of stinkers, too (\\"Let's Get Rocked,\\" anyone? But then again Steve didn't co-write that one!) Phil did a phenomenal job interpreting Steve's guitar parts...not necessarily the same, but still impressive.  There will never be another Steve, and in my opinion, Steve's spirit lives on happily in this CD.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|It's a silly adventure movie. Of course it throws history out the window. So what? It's just a fun movie. Take it for what it's worth. I thought it was well done. The story was interesting, the characters were interesting, it was well acted, great action, great locations. If you're into fun movies, this is for you. If you're a snooty film critic, stay away.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. It is one of my favorite albums ever. I give it 5 stars because I like everyone song, and can listen to it over and over and over again. I just love her voice and her versatility. Mariah fans trust me you will NOT be disappointed. She did her thing on this one.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|I hate to say it this album is horrible , The music and the vocal are way below what you expect to hear from Judas Priest.<br /><br />I hope they didn't jump the shark but this is way bad. Halford sounds out of tune on the slower songs , The guitars are weak .<br /><br />Avoid it , you will be disappointed especially if your a Priest fan from old.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|First of all, Finally! I've been waiting for this album for a while now.  Rise and fall Rage and Grace is a good solid album that has a more serious tone to it.  You don't hear about pranksters or wannabe's in this album, and though I loved those old Offspring songs, it's refreshing.  It shows that they have matured with age and have done the same with their sound.  It's not Smash or Ixnay, but it's pretty close, which is why I give it a 4 1/2.
141694740X|1.0|This book makes women see problems were there are none.  I was accused of so many selfish things and there was no truth to it.  This is written by a lousy television show writer.  What does that tell you?  I don't need George Lucas writing me books about hyperspace or religion.  I don't need Sex and the City to tell me about relationships.  Women and men need to think instead of going to television for answers.
0312330537|5.0|What a good book. Written honestly and straightforwardly and without the literary pretensions that contemporary fill the pages up with. It's so rare to find a book that has all the elements of great book -- something meaningufl to say, a narrative that is compelling and finally well written. There is fabulous philosophy in here, things to remember and keep in mind. However, to enjoy the book, one thing is required, and that is that you check your intellectual pretensions as to what life should be or really is at the door. This book needs to be read straight, for what it is, a wonderful crafted story of a life that excels in illustrating the duality of human nature and in particular that often one does the right thing for the wrong reasons and the wrong thing for the right reasons.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|I've got a nice collection of DVDs. I wanted this one, too, but it's only available in a cheesy cardboard folder, instead of a nice plastic case. I don't want to stick that crappy looking thing on my shelf with the nice ones. I'm not against going green on THROWAWAY packaging, but not for something that's going into a permanent collection!    Studios: you will lose business if you continue this penny-foolish trend. I will not buy DVDs in cheap cardboard wrappers. Fortunately, I found a nice used copy of the movie at Blockbuster that was in a proper plastic DVD case.    I gave a one-star rating because the packaging was a turn-off. The movie, itself, is worth four or five stars. Rent it and send a message to the studio packagers. Maybe they'll get the message if sales are weak on the first few cardboard entries in the market.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Emmylou Harris does not rest on her laurels. Since the release of 'Wrecking Ball' in 1995, she has been redefining what we expect of her, both as a composer and singer. All I Intended To Be, continues that process, subtly and beautifully.  At first blush, it feels like a return to her more traditional earlier style, but on closer listening it incorporates, albeit less overtly, many of the elements that Daniel Lanois introduced into Harris' sound with Wrecking Ball, and which she continued with Red Dirt Girl and Stumble into Grace.    The album includes songs penned by Harris, Merle Haggard, Patty Griffin, Tracy Chapman, and collaborative efforts with Harris and Kate & Anna McGarrigle. The song choice and sequencing is perfect.  Sailing Round the Room is a standout: cowritten (and performed) with the McGarrigles, it is song about dying that manages to be wistful without being mawkish, life affirming but without any of the cheesiness that such a description can conjure. Patty Griffin's Moon Song showcases everything that is great about Harris' singing - beautiful phrasing, great strength with that fragile break that she always deploys in service of the story and never for cheap effect. Really, there's not a weak track on the album.    Brian Ahern produces here, to very good effect. He clearly understands the changes she has made since their earlier collaborations; he works with these changes rather than dragging her back to an earlier sound.    Emmylou Harris made a wise choice back in 1995 when she took herself off in a new direction musically.  Instead of trying to please a label that had stopped supporting her, she found one - Nonesuch - that has clearly given her the freedom to create her own sound.  All I Intended To Be is the work of a mature artist creating her own kind of contemporary American music - with country elements and folk elements, but with something else hard to define which makes both of those labels seem inadequate.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Disney/Pixar's \\"WALL-E\\" is an absolute winner, not merely as an animated film, but as a film, period. It's not a collection of cute, shallow images and dime-a-dozen messages about self-esteem and friendship--this movie actually has something to say, and you can hear it loud and clear. It's funny I should say this, seeing as the story relies more on action and less on the spoken word. Yes, characters speak, but only when it's absolutely necessary; the rest of the time, our eyes do most of the interpreting. But that's perfectly all right because you don't need words to understand what's happening in this movie. Essentially, there are only two things you need to bring with you: (1) your understanding of basic emotional needs, namely love and affection; (2) the knowledge that we as a culture can do so much better if we finally apply ourselves. For all intents and purposes, these issues are addressed without getting preachy or sentimental.    \\"WALL-E\\" asks us to emotionally invest in a robot, which we willingly do, mostly because years of isolation have turned him into a big softy. It takes place 700 years in the future, at which point Earth is devoid of human life and buried under mountains of trash. Out of an army of service robots assigned to clean the planet, only one remains operational: a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class robot, or WALL-E for short (voiced by Ben Burtt). Designed to compact trash into manageable cubes and pile them into skyscrapers, WALL-E is small and meek and just plain loveable, from his sorrowful scope-like eyes to his cute clamp-like hands. He would like nothing more than to hold someone else's hand, to spend his time and share his collected trinkets with that special someone. So far, his only companions are a pet cockroach and a VHS copy of \\"Hello, Dolly!\\"    But things take an exciting new turn when a spaceship arrives and dispatches a scout robot to search for signs of plant life. She's what's known as the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). She glides through the air gracefully, and her slender, pod-like structure can separate to reveal a head, a body, and arms. WALL-E is immediately smitten with her, although it will be a while before she warms up to him; their first encounter ended in laser blasts, courtesy of the weapon in her right arm. But after a while, she regards him with curiosity and actually takes an interest in the many items he's been collecting. This is especially true of a tiny plant he found growing inside a trashed refrigerator--the instant she sees it, she places it within her own storage unit and immediately goes into stasis. It isn't long before the spaceship returns for her. WALL-E, desperate to reunite with his new companion, clings to the side of the ship as it leaves Earth and travels across the galaxy.    WALL-E eventually finds himself onboard a massive space-liner called the \\"Axiom,\\" which is where the human race has been living since Earth's evacuation 700 years earlier. The \\"Axiom,\\" as it turns out, is far, far too luxurious: every possible need is met with the help of a robot or mechanical device. Every person is incredibly fat, and that's because specially designed hover-chairs have eliminated the need for walking. All meals have been liquefied so the food doesn't have to be chewed. When they're not slurping down their lunches, they communicate with their friends and family via screen projections floating in front of their faces. Because of these screens, no one knows that the ship has a pool or a gym, and they certainly miss out on the majesty of an outer space view. Robots take care of simple tasks like tooth brushing and makeup application. How the people go to the bathroom, I have no idea, but I have a sickening feeling there's a robot for that too.    Trapped within this lazy environment are WALL-E and EVE, who now have proof that life is once again sustainable on Earth. When made aware of the baby plant, the ship's captain (voiced by Jeff Garlin) researches the planet so extensively that he's compelled to return with the rest of humanity. The question is: Does everyone want to go back? Have they, in fact, become so spoiled and sedentary that going home seems like too much of a chore? While these questions are never directly asked, it does make you wonder what we would do if we were in that position. In a way, we are: meals are often reduced to take-out lunches and prepackaged dinners; Segway vehicles can take us from one place to another without getting our feet involved; we would rather text message our friends than speak to them face to face. Yes, I'm blowing off some steam, but don't focus on that; focus on the fact that this movie has the power to evoke these feelings.    It also has the power to evoke feelings of tenderness and longing. This is no small task because \\"WALL-E\\" is mainly a love story between robots, and robots are emotionless by definition. For reasons I won't reveal, WALL-E and EVE find themselves in danger on the \\"Axiom\\"; as they try to escape, their feelings for each other deepen so greatly that you actually get choked up during a couple of key scenes. I'm not saying that Disney and Pixar have made a sappy cry-fest--they've made an animated film with a strong emotional core, and they spread the emotions evenly throughout the story. It's funny, yet it doesn't drown in a flood of gags. It's touching, yet it doesn't lose itself to melodrama. It's thought provoking and the imagery is beautiful, yet it doesn't condescend, nor does it collapse under the weight of its effects. Not only is \\"WALL-E\\" the greatest Disney/Pixar film since \\"Finding Nemo,\\" it's also one of year's best films.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This movie needs no ioms, pictures, it wouldn't do it justice. Perfume is about a a boy who desires to make the ultimate perfume. How he does it, buy the movie. don't rent, you'll hate yourself. It's really that good. My jaw was dropped many times during this movie, supense to the end. And I thought it was going to be a waste of time. My son. who looked at the cover rolled his eyes, started to watch it and actually stayed glued to the film. Said it was the best movie he'd ever seen. But what happens during the movie I will not express. I'm telling you, it's a one in a million thriller movie. I promise you, it will nauseate you,compell you to close you eyes, while your saying \\"he's doing what?!\\". Really , giving the movie plot away will lessen your reaction. See it, buy it, add it to your collection, ENJOY it.!
B0013J30W2|4.0|If you enjoy movies that are in your face and action packed and don't require you to think much about anything, \\"Wanted\\" is the one for you. I came to this conclusion less than ten minutes into the film; it was a scene in which actor David O'Hara jumps through an office-building window and flies 500 feet, crashing through the window of a neighboring building completely unharmed. He then stands on the roof and gets his brains blown out from a bullet fired miles away from him. I knew right then and there that I was allowed to put my brain on autopilot, that I should just sit back, shut up, and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is. Based on the comic book series created by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, \\"Wanted\\" is so pumped with adrenaline that it races at 200 miles an hour. You can try to make sense of the preposterous story, but why bother? Just watch the movie and don't ask any questions.    \\"Wanted\\" tells the story of Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), an apathetic accountant manager who hates his job, his boss, his coworkers, his girlfriend, and his life in general. As his voiceover narration tells us, the only thing he cares about is the fact that he doesn't care about anything. He suffers debilitating panic attacks, the kind that slow time to a crawl and magnify images and reduce noises. All he can really do is apologize for everything. But things take an unexpected turn at the pharmacy of a local supermarket: Wesley meets a woman known only as Fox (Angelina Jolie), and she tells him that she knew his father. He tells her that his father abandoned him the week he was born. She claims that his father was one of the world's best assassins, and that the man who killed him is there in the store with them. That marks the beginning of an elaborate shootout scene, one that progresses to a high-octane car chase sequence.    Fox takes Wesley to a textile mill that doubles as headquarters for The Fraternity, a centuries-old group of assassins dedicated to stopping the world's most heinous criminals. This is never adequately explained, but never mind. The leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), orders Wesley to shoot the wings off a couple of flies, and to Wesley's astonishment, he's able to do it. How? According to Sloan, Wesley's \\"panic attacks\\" are actually surges of adrenaline that force him to rely purely on instinct, much like an assassin; with a little training, he can control his mind and become a top notch killer. Once Wesley realizes that everything happening to him is real, he quits his job, but not before cussing out his fat boss and clocking his good-for-nothing best friend across the face with a keyboard. For the first time, he feels alive.    But before he can officially join The Fraternity, he must undergo a series of tests ... and by \\"tests,\\" I mean he must constantly be beaten within an inch of his life and be revived in baths of hard wax. He must also learn how to \\"curve\\" a bullet, a fancy term for shooting around an obstacle in order for the bullet to hit its target. It's through these scenes that we meet such colorful characters as: The Repairman (Marc Warren), who's guaranteed to \\"repair\\" you of your bad habits; The Butcher (Dato Bakhtadze), who wields knives as freely as one wields their arms; and The Exterminator (Konstantin Khabensky), who has one of the strangest fascinations with rats a character has ever had (save, maybe, for Willard).    Sloan eventually shows Wesley a special loom that somehow or another weaves secret codes into the fabric. How it gets this information and where it comes from and who sends it, I don't presume to ask--all I do know is that Sloan finds the names of The Fraternity's next targets hidden within the fabric. After a few test assassinations, Wesley is finally told to hunt down and kill Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), the man who killed Wesley's father. But in order to find him, Wesley must first find an elusive figure known only as Pekwarsky (Terrence Stamp).    I didn't know whether or not I'd get anything out of \\"Wanted,\\" especially since I haven't read a single issue of the comic series. I didn't even know the series existed until I read the film's end credits. Luckily, the filmmakers sought to entertain a wide audience, not just fans of the comic book; I watched the implausible scenes pass one by one, and yes, I was satisfied with the whole experience. I will not, however, go so far as to say that \\"Wanted\\" is a masterpiece of stylized action cinema. It's generally fun, but it's also aggressive, silly, and about as mindless as a montage of car explosions. But make no mistake--it's a great visual spectacle, and it moves so quickly through its hour and fifty minutes that the ending comes as somewhat of a shock. That's when the message about living your life to the fullest is made perfectly clear, and why in God's name would I even consider using the word \\"message\\" within the context of this film?    While it's best to not question anything about this movie, I have to admit that Angelina Jolie was a bit of a mystery all throughout. Her character is always cool and collected, and she insists on keeping to The Fraternity's code, although it's not entirely clear why. Even when she reveals her painful past to Wesley, she seems aloof, out of touch, unsympathetic. Analyzing her dialogue won't help much, seeing as she was given no more than twenty lines for the entire film. Be that as it may, I'll recommend \\"Wanted\\" for all the serious action buffs in need of some great thrills. It delivers exactly what it promises, and no more. Now enough talk. Aim your gun and shoot the target, already.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This was a great looking Blu-Ray Movie! I had seen it once in school and decided to wait til it came out on Blu-Ray to buy it! Great decision! Fast shipping from Amazon too!
B000B8QF00|5.0|OK now, let's be honest.  Mention Alanis Morissette and most people think of one thing:  \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".  I was the same way.  Alright, maybe throw in \\"Uninvited\\".  I was never able to get interested in any of her other music.  But, sometimes things sound better years later than they did when they were new.  Maybe we mature, or become more open-minded.  Maybe the music itself acquires a different \\"aura\\" when experienced as a thing of the past.  Whatever the reason, I believe that I respect Alanis more now than I did even at the height of the popularity of \\"Jagged\\".  After re-hearing the \\"Jagged\\" tracks (\\"You Oughta Know\\", \\"Hand In My Pocket\\", \\"Ironic\\", \\"You Learn\\" and \\"Head Over Feet\\", all of which sound excellent thanks to the remastered sound) and studying the ones I hadn't paid attention to before, I've come to regard her as the iconic philosopher of Gen X.  And, if anyone still harbors doubts that her music rocks, let him or her listen to this entire collection, and then we'll talk.<br /><br />Since the \\"Jagged\\" tracks are pretty familiar to all, I will concentrate on those that came later.  \\"Thank You\\" is a song about healing and rationality.  As Alanis herself has admitted, she went through a difficult period of chaos and suffocation during the \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" frenzy.  In this song, she has emerged from that trauma, and she is serenely giving thanks to every person, place and thing that helped her through the dark period back into the light.  In \\"Eight Easy Steps\\", which has a rocking Eastern (\\"Thank you, India\\") vibe, she points out the common but seemingly insoluble problems we all face.  Example:  \\"How to keep smiling when you're thinking about killing yourself?\\"  \\"Everything\\" is pure Alanis lyrically, but musically it could be a U2 ballad.  Her cover of Seal's 1991 hit \\"Crazy\\" follows his pretty closely and rocks the same.  In \\"Simple Together\\", Alanis sings sweetly about the difficulties and disappointments in relationships, backed by piano and beautiful strings;  in a similar vein, she asks for unconditional acceptance in \\"That I Would Be Good\\".  \\"Sister Blister\\" burns up the place like \\"Crazy\\" does, while Alanis sings about women who, while advocating on one hand \\"sisterhood\\", still trample each other down to please men.  \\"Still\\", from the film \\"Dogma\\", reveals more Eastern influence musically while the lyrics seem to indicate that God is providing a self-description, which would make sense because Alanis plays the part of God in the film.  The spiritual feeling continues in \\"Uninvited\\".  This, one of my favorite tracks, is beautiful in its majestic, almost religious solemnity, one of the most successfully serious tracks I have ever heard by any artist.<br /><br />The collection closes with \\"Hand In My Pocket\\", which probably touches me more personally than any other Alanis track.  The video was played constantly on VH1 at the time when my father had an illness from which he didn't recover, so I will always associate that song, as well as Madonna's \\"Take A Bow\\" and the Stones' \\"Out of Tears\\", with that time, when I had a problem that, sadly, I could not fix.beautiful strings;  in a similar vein, she asks for unconditional acceptance in \\"That I Would Be Good\\".  \\"Sister Blister\\" burns up the place like \\"Crazy\\" does, while Alanis sings about women who, while advocating on one hand \\"sisterhood\\", still trample each other down to please men.  \\"Still\\", from the film \\"Dogma\\", reveals more Eastern influence musically while the lyrics seem to indicate that God is providing a self-description, which would make sense because Alanis plays the part of God in the film.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|A touch of country (Dusty Springfield, sure. But what about Shelby Lynne?) added to this latest entry in the \\"retro soul\\" sweepstakes makes Aimee Duffy's \\"Rockferry\\" a standout. The comparisons to Amy Winehouse are slightly unfair. Amy dresses up in the soul tradition; Aimee inhabits it. Amy's talented (and \\"Back to Black\\" is surely a five-star album, too), but she uses soul as a marketing tool. Aimee believes in it. And I believe in her.<br /><br />Best cuts: \\"Rockferry\\" (the most unusual), \\"Warwick Avenue\\" (segue to Nellie McKay's \\"Manhattan Avenue,\\" djs), \\"Mercy\\" (intense!), and \\"Distant Dreamer\\" (Anthemic! Spectoresque!).<br /><br />And, speaking of \\"Dreamer\\" (soon to be covered by wedding singers and \\"American Idol\\" wannabees) what a daring move it was to place that tune in the CD's closing slot. That's normally the place reserved for something quiet.

B0017VG69U|1.0|It's ridiculous enough that Paramount continues to release obsolete versions of this beloved series on standard DVD...at an inflated price (compared to other series).    And its not surprisingly Paramount is going to rip off it's fan....again.      Now in its 4TH incarnation (1st: original 2 DVD per disc, 2nd: plastic cased red, green, blue edition, 3rd: HD-DVD set) Paramount could of done a couple of things that would have been sensible:    a.  Release Season 2 and 3 in the HD/DVD combo format -- at a reasonable reduced cost ---  so that those who  bought season 1 can complete their collection.    b. ....while concurrently releasing them in Blu-Ray dvd the now defacto HD standard.    instead in a very shrewd manner, Paramount has chosen to release them yet again on STANDARD DVD format ONLY....at a above normal price.    Which means that the Blu-ray version won't be released until they get a chance to sell everyone this current THIRD standard DVD version....then afterwhich they will release the 4th version on Blu-ray at a cheaper price, so as to ensure that those who purcahsed the previous version feel ripped-off (again).  This is how they reward loyal fans.    Solution: boycott buying this current incarnation (guaranteed to be obsolete) and wait for a release at a reasonable price of the Blu-ray set.      Let Paramount eat their own garbage.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I use the SB-400 with a D40, and it is great. It works exactly the way I need it to - automatically. In general I prefer natural light photography, but when I do use flash for indoor portraits, this unit suits me perfectly. The front tilts for bounce flashing off the ceiling, which is how I use flash 90% of the time.  The nice thing is that ONLY the front tilts, not the whole unit, so everything stays wonderfully small and compact. Yeah, you can get a bigger, more powerful sb-600 or 800, but those things are huge. Especially when tilted up for bounce flash. If you need more control and extra options and power, then go with the bigger more expensive flashes, but for most D40 users - this flash fits perfectly. And it's pretty reasonably priced as well.<br /><br />One thing, pick up some rechargeable batteries as well. Any flash will eat power quickly. I use Sanyo Eneloops and they are amazing - they last a lot longer in between charges than standard alkalines.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you have a Nikon D40, get this external flash. Your indoor pictures (especially portraits) will be 100% better than if you use the on-camera flash. And once you discover bounce-flash, you'll always avoid having to use standard straight-on flash again.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Wesley Gibson is no one special. When he Googles himself, nothing comes up. He works at a job that he hates and that's so repetitive that he's developed a stress injury from doing a mind-numbing amount of nothing. His girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend, and both of them think he's too stupid to notice. And he has to take pills every day for anxiety attacks that make him feel as though he'll lose control. Basically, he's going nowhere fast.<br /><br />Until one night he's standing in line to fill his prescription and the most beautiful woman he's ever seen (Angelina Jolie, who is truly stunning in this role) comes up beside him. She tells him that his father--who left when Wesley was only a week old--died the day before, and that the man who killed him is right around the corner. And then we have an amazing fight scene. Basically Wes learns from Fox (Jolie) that his father was an assassin, one of the best, and that he was killed by a rogue agent. The only person capable of killing this rogue is Wesley himself, and she and her friends will train him to do it. Wesley jumps at the opportunity to end the drudgery of his life, and begins training to become a member of the Fraternity, an elite group of assassins.<br /><br />That's it in a nutshell, but this movie was so much more than a story about assassins. It was visually stunning, action packed, and didn't take itself too seriously. Wesley gets the crap kicked out of him while he's in training, but like a Timex, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking. These assassins are dangerous, versatile, and creative. They can bend bullets, make shots from impossible angles, and kill based on fate--not any sort of personal vendetta or hatred. But of course things aren't as they seem, and Wesley has to learn that power comes with a price. Wanted is entertaining from start to finish, and I'm generally not one for action films. It's the perfect date movie because while guys can stare at Jolie and enjoy the action, ladies can laugh at the jokes and enjoy the man candy. Everyone wins! If you're in the mood to be entertained with creative fight scenes and witty dialogue, you'll definitely enjoy this film. In fact, I think I'll see it again next week. It was that good.at the jokes and enjoy the man candy. Everyone wins! If you're in the mood to be entertained with creative fight scenes and witty dialogue, you'll definitely enjoy this film.

B00005Y6YB|2.0|I haven't read the book, but I bought this on the strength of other reviewers. And what a disappointment. I'm a big fan of westerns, going back to the Lone Ranger - and that's pretty much what this goes back to. Plotwise, it's episodic and simplistic, full of cornball events and ridiculous coincidences. The direction is boring and basic, the photography and scenery repetitious and forgetable. Everyone keeps running into everyone else on the trail to Montana, with dramatic timing that makes the whole yarn laughable. Apart from Duvall, who's superb, the characters are thin and cliched, no more than flesh and blood cartoons. By halfway through the second episode, I couldn't care less, and after Angelica Houston made her miscast entrance, the whole thing became unbearably sentimental, sluggish and silly. This is not an epic masterpiece by any stretch. The Godfather is an epic masterpiece. Or Star Wars, for that matter. This is a staid western ultra-lite. I shudder to think what the subsequent DVDs are like if, as most reviewers concur, they exhibit diminishing returns.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Hollywood remade the 7 Samurai and called it the Magnificent 7.  This was also a good film but the original is still the best.  One can learn a lot about Japanese culture by watching it.  The villagers also go to the village elder for advice.  The hired Samurai village protectors count the number of bandits and assume that they have to fight every last one.  They know that none of them will run away, even if the face certain defeat.  I guess there is even honor amongst thieves.  The love story only constitutes a few scenes, but the class differences between a farmer girl and a samurai determine the end result.  Another lesson, love doesn't conquer all and in fact such a union will result in tragedy and unhappiness.  Of course the craftsmenship of the film itself is stellar.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|EXPLORERS - was a very good family movie (four stars) that I first saw with my very young boys in the year it was made. As a family movie it was great and my boys were not disappointed with the (weak) ending.  Of course, these kids spoke up in defense of MAGIC FLUTE when I quietly complained to my wife at the breakfast table about having to sit through that one.<br /><br />This film had a good plot with lots of development, decent special effects, fine young actors (including young River Phoenix) and a very effective musical score. My wife also enjoyed this film and it was an overall hit as a family movie with special appeal for me with my interest in sci-fi. I especially enjoyed the stereotypically German family living in a small American town, all portrayed as bright and scientifically minded.<br /><br />Wolfgang was portrayed by River Phoenix. Incidental to the plot, Wolfgang trained a pet mouse to request cheese and offer different comments verbally in the background by pressing buttons on a speech synthesizer.  When Wolf's experiments got out of control this mouse would press the button for squeaking out with his tiny computer generated voice \\"help!\\" at appropriate times.  This is typical of the many fine and subtle comedic details of the movie almost missed during all the excitement.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Anyone else rooting for Kurt Russell (Who is really good in this.) ? Yes the hour plus of boring dialogues and situations is tedious, (although I guess kind of an enjoyable sort of nostalgia for certain types) and yes the pay off chase scene at the end is something and a fitting homage to the 70s and 80s grindhouse  flics.<br /><br />Overall I just had little sympathy for these moronic girls.  Since all their dilemnas seemed to be caused by such incredible stupidity.  First of all, if you don't want somehting horrible to happen to you, you don't take rides from strange men, duh!  Secondly, the next group of girls deserved to die in a horrible car crash after putting themselves in such a moronic situation, especially after leaving one of their friends behind to be raped in deliverance country.  But OK I guess grindhouse films were all about stupid people doing stupid things-but usually paying for it.  Overall this works and you can think of the dialogue and even the retro cars as an enjoyable homage to the exchange between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction.  It got the feel right.
B0001I562I|5.0|FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR was a five star movie that I would endorse for almost any family looking for good general entertainment. My boys enjoyed it very much as did my wife.<br /><br />As a Disney film it used the never worn out Disney theme of a family separated by circumstances beyond their control.  In this case the young hero of the movie is abducted by an alien spacecraft piloted by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) who sounded very familiar.  The abducted boy is missing for a period of years only to be returned to his family not a day older but eight years later.<br /><br />After a series of medical tests conducted at a local hospital to explain the mystery (which has the family as well as the police baffled), NASA steps in and \\"borrows\\" the boy for a few days of further testing trying to understand a recently recovered and very secret UFO.  This is when the movie really takes off and is extremely entertaining.<br /><br />When my family some years later visited Disneyworld we found on their back lot two beautiful full size UFO mockups used for the filming of this movie.  The first had no door and was used to represent the impenetrable UFO and the second was modeled with the door open. It was great fun to see the very stylish and full scale UFO mockup in the \\"flesh\\".
B0013J30W2|3.0|It's been a long time since I have actively hated a movie this much.  I like action movies-I think they've gotten a lot more interesting and attractive since the '90s. I don't necessarily have a problem with violence, and the film's premise interested me.  The movie however is insufferable and abrasive from the start. The violence is pointless, hateful, and needlessly self-righteous.  In the last frames, I actually found myself loathing James Macavoy himself as I left the theatre, esp. after he insults the audience, who's forcibly indulged his teenage BS for over 90 minutes at that point.  I cared absolutely nothing about what happened to any of these characters, especially the protagonist, and found myself cheering for their violent demises within the first fifteen minutes of the film.  I hate PETA and I hate rodents, but when the movie has tiny bombs strapped to the backs of rats and blowing them up, I desperately wanted to see buckets of fake blood poured over everyone involved in this smug production.  (Wow this movie actually made me hate Morgan Freeman, who would've thought anyone could dislike Morgan Freeman!)<br /><br />Wait there is one sympathetic character in all this:  The \\"hero's\\" boss who of all thing's actually wants the narcissistic self-pitying ingrate and whiner James Macavoy character to turn in his work on time, stop falling asleep at his desk and surfing the internet on her time.  The nerve.  For all of this said boss is publicly and personally (and I mean personally) humiliated.  The product of a neurotic with a persecution complex and possible brain damage, this film seems to see nothing in between being pathetic and passive and a murdering tyranic @$$hole.  Keep in mind that after the movie's \\"twist\\" the film actually asks us to care about these characters.  This movie has deeply intensified my contempt of gen x and y.
0385340567|2.0|After reading about 8 of Child's Jack Reacher books, I finally found a dud. It started out thrilling, as expected, but quickly become almost boring. I can not believe I am typing those words.<br /><br />Reacher's repeatedly doing the same thing, over and over (returning to a bad place) was tedious and so unlike our hero's usual behavior. The plot wandered all over the place and the book was too long.<br /><br />I found it impossible to buy into the far-fetched \\"conspiracy theory\\" with its pathetic \\"villains\\" and was surprised at Child's foray into political opinion (putting his opinions into Reacher's mouth -which completely changed Reacher's character). This was totally out of place, I thought, and awkward at best.<br /><br />I just hope that Child has not run out of stories and that he will return Reacher to his previous inventive adventures.<br /><br />I only read the Amazon reviews after finishing the book, and must say I am not surprised that there are 110 reviews and the average is an abyssmal 2.5 stars. Most of his other books have averaged 4 stars.

I removed the SB400 and the camera work fine.  The speedlite was a significant improvement over the on board flash for a large gathering and I was please with the overall performance.
B0015519VS|5.0|I bought this cd about 2 weeks ago. My first time listening to I had a neutral feeling about it but as I listened to it again and again the cd grew on me quickly and now I think its as good as or maybe better than Confessions. Of course there will be people who will not like the cd and those that do but I encourage anyone thinking bout buying this cd to do so and take the time to give it a chance. Play it while u are driving and you will get a different and better experience than to say if u just listening to it on the couch or on the bed.
0385340567|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the Jack Reacher novels. Lee Child always does a great job of creating an aura of evil and mystery behind the outwardly mundane.  Jack Reacher finds himself in the town of Despair, Colorado and is drawn into the mystery surrounding a \\"metal-recycling\\" plant and the townspeople who refuse to reveal its secrets.  The story catches the reader's interest immediately but then unfortunately plods along for the middle third of the book -- Reacher seems to spend endless pages 'in transit' -- travelling back and forth through the desolate country while we wait for something to happen.  I personally had no problem with the political overtones of the book. The parts of the story concerning traumatic brain injury and lack of up-armored Humvees in Iraq are not just fiction, folks. Fans of the Jack Reacher series may be mildly satisfied with this one, but for others who have never read the series -- they will wonder what all the fuss is about.  I'll still await the next one, though!
080701429X|4.0|In short, it's difficult to complain about life when getting a lesson on it from an Auschwitz survivor. It really puts things into perspective for anyone who feels lost or depressed or worthless or small. It gives depth to \\"if you can't change your situation, change your attitude.\\"    Frankl hits on surprisingly modern points about depression years before Prozac Nation and the transferring of therapy and medications to the mainstream--the normalization of not feeling normal. And he manages to provide a power-packed message in a tiny book; I found myself taking notes on logotherapy and Frankl's observations. And now I find myself trying to figure out how to apply his theory to my everyday frustrations. It's a good challenge.     Feeling curious about the world, frustrated by your life, or lost? Take a weekend and read this book.    My only gripes are the translation, which was crap in the version I read (but I'm an editor, so I get cranky about things like that) and that Frankl does paint himself as the all-answering, all-curing type who can walk into a room and fix any poor fool who's been suffering for years within minutes. I appreciate a degree of modesty. But I guess he's earned the right to feel righteous.
B00081U7HC|5.0|My mom loves this movie and had a purchased copy on VHS tape, so I replaced it with the \\"Pretty Woman 15th Anniversary Special Edition\\" DVD.  I've heard no complaints from her, so I guess that this was a good purchase.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This has been WELL worth the wait!<br /><br />It opens with \\"STAMP YOUR FEET\\" a crump type cheerleaderish chant that is catchy and will get you out of your chair within the first beat! This is already the top hit on the charts now, so that should tell you something!<br /><br />\\"MR. MUSIC\\" up to date beats, another crumpy hip hop song, catchy, and positively upbeat! Reminds me a little of \\" Mr. DJ\\" by Madonna. The bridge offers more cheerleader type chanting, as made popular by Gwen Stefani.<br /><br />\\"CRAYONS\\" Fun colorful metaphors in this 'we're all the same' message with reggae great ZIGGY MARLEY adding his irie flavoured vocals. This is by far the \\"happiest' make you smile song on the album. Fast paced and catchy hook. Reminds me of: 'I'm So Excited' by Pointer Sisters.<br /><br />\\"THE QUEEN IS BACK\\", she SURE is! And better than ever! This hard-hitting song-another great crump/hip hop dancers song! An obvious ode to her return with tongue in cheek references to her past hits: \\" So many years ago/ ON THE RADIO...She crept into your soul / AND LOVED TO LOVE YOU all\\" was very clever and reminded us how she has stayed in our hearts for over 3 decades! Another catchy chorus.<br /><br />\\"FAME (THE GAME)\\", a tell it like it is song about being a celebrity and a day-in-the-life of. Fast rapped background vocal (on maybe her vocoded voice) talking about everything from Botox to platinum credits cards. Catchy with a locomotive type driven beat.<br /><br />Slowing it down with \\"SAND ON MY FEET\\" ballad saying that all she needs is the sand and her lover. A sweet romantic break from dancing for 5 songs non-stop! You can almost imagine walking on the sand there with her!<br /><br />\\"DRIVING DOWN BRAZIL\\" offers a Samba/Batucada beat latin flavoured beat that just makes you want to sit on a sidestreet and drink Mojitos, and goes down equally smooth!<br /><br />\\"I'M A FIRE\\" Going a little more back to her DISCO roots on this one, I felt more back in highschool with this one!<br /><br />\\"SLIDE OVER BACKWARDS\\" not sure what happened here, in the last few songs we went from Brazil to Disco to the Bayou! Her voice is raspy and almost a little creepy! Twangy banjos and harmonica dominate this song. It took me a while to get used to this one, still trying to not skip it when I play the CD! Reminds me of Tina Turner's \\"Nutbush City Limits\\".<br /><br />\\"SCIENCE OF LOVE\\" Electronic voices open up the intro on this could be dance song, but I am not quite feeling it. She is having trouble getting away from her ex on this one, and blames it on science!<br /><br />\\"BE MYSELF AGAIN\\" another ballad, very sparse: piano and vocals. An introspective sermon about coming back to being yourself again. Beautiful lyrics and song.<br /><br />\\"BRING DOWN THE REIGN\\" another ballad, opens up with African type chanting. A message and cry out for help for DARFUR, AFRICA. Beautiful and very powerful.

B00005JLEU|5.0|As the new millenum had finally arrived Studio Ghibli graced the world with 'Spirited Away'. This movie took the world of Hayao Miyazaki and threw it right into your face saying 'This is the work of Studio Ghibli. Watch our movies!!!' So we listened and to show America's graditude 'Spirited Away' won the second Oscar for Best Animated Feature.<br /><br />This is a story of Chihiro. A spoiled brat who never has to do anything. Though she gets anything she wants whenever she wants she still feels alone and ignored by the world. On the move to their new house Chihiro's family spots an abandoned amusement park. What they don't know is that it is a resort to the spirits that walk the Earth at night. Now her paretns broke the rules and turned into pigs so it's up to Chihiro to break the curse. On her dangerous yet sometimes humerous quest she learns what it is like to prove to yourself in the world and you can do great things.<br /><br />This is a very different film for Hayao Miyzaki. This is a story that plays upon some of the most bizzare fantasy stories. It is also a movie that can be a bit weird and sometimes disturbing. Yet what you see will blow your mind for it is so origional and so mind bending you will be craving to see what happens next. At this point Studio Ghibli is a world renound phenomenon and Disney is giving it a helping hand to get all the films to the world. 'Spirited Away' is a real milestone for Ghibli because once this movie received it's Oscar it was embraced by a whole new wave of fans. After that they craved more and thus the films like 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Pom Poko' were finally brought over seas and now one can only think about the next wave of films that is on its way to us.<br /><br />(End of Volume 1)

B000MAH5O2|5.0|This is an important book. It has become my new favorite on America.In Audacity of Hope, Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, Barack writes eloquently on our history, the issues we all face now in this time of crisis, his personal beliefs(He is a Christian.), and his love of family and country.  Here is a man with the unique ability to take us beyond the distractions and surface problems of party ideologues. He provides the solution to \\"this campaign culture that has metastisized throughout the body politic\\". There are great insights into the personality of Barack Obama as well. I cannot imagine any voter not voting for Barack after reading the man's own views on this great country.  Barack Obama is not merely an intelligent man- He is brilliant. His depth of knowledge, experience as a politician and constitutional scholar and ability to problem solve exceed that of the sum of his competetitors exponentially.

B000WQWPJQ|3.0|Anytime Robert Zemckis makes a movie I take notice.  He more than even Speilberg is the stereotypical American Director(like Frank Capra).<br /><br />So what about Cast Away.  I think it's a pretty good movie, a little long but then a lot happens.<br /><br />Watching Tom Hanks learn how to survive on the island was educational.  I found myself asking, \\"Do I know how to make fire?\\"  \\"Do I know how to find water?\\"  Crazy questions I guess every should ask.<br /><br />The setting of the island was beautiful yet with an ironic twist.  By that I mean scenicly it is beautiful, but absent are all things that make life worth living, namely companionship(no offense Wilson)<br /><br />The love story at the end was painful and when the two were looking at each other in the rain it was like they wanted to kiss more than breathe.<br /><br />I really liked the movie and the extas are worth the cost of the movie by itself.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I love it when someone finds a new way to tell an old story, and that is exactly what Cloverfield is.  If you seperate how the story is told, the plot is basically a Godzilla destroying Manhattan kind of movie, which has been made dozens of times in the last 80 years, but what makes Cloverfield noteworthy is the way it's told.<br /><br />The story is shown through a camcorder recording the whole thing as it happens by the people experiencing it, like Blair Witch Project, except this time you see the monsters.  The movie is extremely suspenseful and the way it's filmed made me feel like I was a part of the group, like I knew these people and had a vested interest in their survival.<br /><br />The movie is exciting and I didn't want to miss one second of it.  THe movie was very short on explanation, but if I was there in NY when this happened I don't think I would stop and ask \\"How?\\" I would want to get out of there as soon as I could.<br /><br />I have heard that they are going to make a sequel to this about the same night from another persons point of view, which sounds intrigueing so we'll see.<br /><br />The cast is mostly unknowns that do a good job looking scared out of their minds.<br /><br />If you like the staple monster movie or unique retelling check this one out.
0385340567|4.0|Arriving in the small town of Despair, Colorado, Jack Reacher finds himself taking on an entire town as he searches for the truths behind its sinister connection to a brutal war that is killing Americans thousands of miles away. BT.<br />  I was also a little surprised by certain viewpoints--with the obviously left leaning Child--made about the war and desertion but as far as his character Reacher is concerned he's still one bad-arse hombre.<br /> The novel wasn't as good as previous ones, and I hope when Reacher continues his journey to San Diego, we get what we come to expect from Child, and that's a rip roaring good story and great escapist fiction.
B0013J30W2|4.0|\\"Wanted\\" has got style to burn and almost, just almost tips the scale of style over substance but Timur Bekmambetov (\\"Night Watch\\" and \\"Day Watch\\") directing this his first American film, manages to hold firm on the side of substance though he tends to manipulate his characters like live action dolls.<br />\\"Wanted\\" recalls several films: \\"Batman\\" in particular with its training session scenes: scenes of over the top gruesome violence which involve super geek, lithium popping Wesley Gibson (the very effective James McAvoy) whose father was a hired assassin for a super secret society called THE FRATERNTY, now headed by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). To make the last statement even more ludicrous is that this fraternity started in the middle ages as a group of loomers who received messages, via the cloth they loom, to assassinate.<br />Though this all sounds like too much for any one film to bare, \\"Wanted\\" is so full of life and yes artful C.I.G. effects that we soon dismiss any reservations and get down to the core of the film: a story about a Son (McAvoy) who goes on a journey, both physical and cosmic, to find his father. On the down side, Bekmambetov muddles and stains the mise en scene with so much \\"stuff\\" that we really have to dig very deep emotionally in order to see this film for what it really is below the razzle-dazzle.<br />With all that being said, Bekmambetov doesn't give any of us time to think much about the ludicrousness of the story as he directs in a style that moves the action along in breakneck pace: sort of like a cross between a \\"Bourne\\" movie and a 3 Stooges film. And believe it or not, that is a compliment. It's at this point that you either buy into \\"Wanted\\" and sit back and let it flow over and into you or you go out and refill your popcorn and soft drink containers and think about what you need to do to complete your honey-do list.<br />Angelina Jolie, in her best sultry murderess style manages to make a big impact here: her Fox is beautiful, ironic and played with her tongue firmly planted in her cheek. Jolie is just this side of being a movie icon. Her mere presence gives this film weight and substance.<br />\\"Wanted\\" is certainly not a great film but it is definitely a wild ride and it is fun to see James McAvoy continuing his recent string of first rate performances. Though Mekmamtov should have dug deeper into what makes his characters tick, i.e. what makes them do the things they do, I genuinely look forward to his next film: the guy is talented and his film bristles with energy and forward momentum.ith her tongue firmly planted in her cheek.

B0018AK9RA|2.0|Just wanted to simply say that this CD drags on long enough through one disc let alone stretching it out into two discs.The two stars are for Rob showing he still has incredible vocal range.I'd say 4 good songs out of 23 is not good.And of course the first single(Nostradamus)being the heaviest and fastest song.This is to bait you into buying,hoping the rest will be worth it.Sorry,but it's not....    All the keyboards remind me of \\"Turbo\\",but at half speed.Come on guys,I've bought your cd's over many,many years to rock.NOT to hear a \\"rock opera\\".    And just one more thing.Hopefully they don't even consider playing the whole disc in it's entirety live.That would just give fans alot of bathroom and beer time.    Sorry,just real disappointed...

B000002UAU|5.0|Today pop music is an art. It's about being catchy, poignant, concise, poetic, and using production techniques to your advantage. A lot of that began with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but that's not necessarily why you should buy the album. You should buy it because it does it better most any other pop album out there.    It's an album about characters and people. It's about finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, finding the ordinary in the extraordinary; taking simple emotions and amplifying them; taking human behavior and picking out the absurd and grotesque.    One of the first things I noticed upon revisiting this gem is how simple everything is. The songs are easy to listen to and they flow really well. But underneath the simplicity there's always a little something extra: \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", which begins as a mellow psychedelic waltz, bursts into sparkling ebullient choruses suitable for marching band; \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" sounds like a simple lullaby for children, but the chorus and bridges reveal an air of cynicism that's surprisingly moving; on \\"Lovely Rita\\", even an ordinary meter maid becomes the subject of a dreamy albeit a bit sarcastic fantasy; \\"Good Morning\\" is an enthusiastic ode to the daily grind, revealing the hallowness of daily routine while increasing tempo to dizzying speeds.    Except for \\"Within You Without You\\", all the songs are concrete and straightforward studies about people, with individual elements and stereotypes isolated, magnified, and splayed before you for display. \\"Fixing A Hole\\" presents the lonely introspection of a man living by himself and locking himself and his mind from society; on \\"She's Leaving Home\\" we experience the frozen melancholy of two parents who awake to find their daughter gone.    But nothing's quite as it seems on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. As isolated human emotions bubble up in the melodies, it's clear that some characters in the human race aren't completely sincere.There's an underbelly to human beings. Some aren't to be trusted. \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" presents a detached salesman of freaks and outcasts pitching his product in metered rhyme to the tune of exotic swirling carnival music. On another tune, an outcast with a bit of a temper optimistically proclaims that things are \\"Getting Better\\", while on the side revealing fragmented bits of his past, such as breaking rules in school and beating his wife.     However the music is so tightly constructed that you can listen to the entire album without noticing the mystery and neurosis of human nature. The music is that good, it just feels so natural, so right. But listen a little closer and you really will see how nothing is as it seems.    Only at the end of the album does a minute or two of symphonic dissonance jerk your mind from the pleasant superficialities of the melodies, beats and life in general. The last song, \\"A Day in the Life\\", is a meditation about a jaded yet heartfelt man who recounts the morning post's headlines: Some are disturbing (a politician blew his mind), others political (the English won another war), and others just business as usual (there are four thousand potholes in Blackburn, they all had to be counted) - all events are sung with equal emotion and import, as if they really weren't important at all. Daydreams and non-sequiturs in the song hint at feelings of escapism - but the song's world is bleak and apathetic. Concludes the singer - and the whole album - \\"I'd love to turn you on\\", followed by a cacophonous and insurmountable chaos of strings.    That's the message embedded throughout this album - there's people and places as normal, but there's also a veil of truth and mystery behind it all. The Beatles would love turn you onto it.    But it's not even The Beatles who are delivering this message, it's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a make-shift ensemble whose band-members suspiciously resemble those of The Beatles. Once again, nothing's quite as it seems.    So when you buy this album - which I highly recommend - enjoy it for what it is: Great pop music, it's some of the best out there. Tap your fingers, dance a bit, feel your heartstrings pulled, and bob your head back and forth. But remember to look a little deeper: Think about the world. Think about what it means to be human, and what it means to be a person in this hackneyed world of ours. Look inward and think about who you are. Look outward and think about life.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Remember the days when HBO shows kicked arse?  Whether it was AL SWEARENGEN ruling the roost of THE GEM, or TITUS PULLO skewering some poor plebe, or even BEN HAWKINS touching someone back to life.  Well, we all know those days are sadly gone, but thanks to some gutsy, creative thinking on SHOWTIME's part we have DEXTER MORGAN.  Take either one - season one's ICE TRUCK KILLER, or season two's BAY HARBOR BUTCHER, and you have what is (fact, not opinion) one of the best shows ever aired.  Every TV series you've ever seen has had a quandary about the second season equaling the first.  This one don't.  Both seasons are on par Fan-friggin-tastic.  MICHAEL C HALL (pulling a 180 from his superb character of DAVID FISHER from the superb SIX FEET UNDER) plays the best television character possibly ever.  Hey, the guy likes to chop people (albeit, bad people) up into little pieces, but YOU LOVE HIM, that makes for compelling viewing any day of the week.  Best show on the tube right now, HANDS DOWN.  Can't wait for season 3!
0060989157|5.0|This book is far better executed than anyone could have expected. Every major player in the band is given his space to freely say what he felt about the time he spent in this band. Told in chronological order by those involved this is the summation of a very rowdy group of men coming of age, so to speak, in a decadent generation.   I was both amazed an delighted with the general candor the band tells it's story in this book. I have read that their have been efforts made to film this and that Nikki is hell bent to keep Hollywood from messing it up. If he can succeed in that as well as he has succeeded in bringing this book to the public he should surely have more to offer his fans than they should expect.  Film or no film this book is an enjoyable read and is one of the fewer rock'n'roll autobiographies that is a true representation of it's subject.  I read this book in one sitting when a friend gave me a copy for christmas, and I immediately read it again just as one listens to an album by this band repeatedly when it first comes into your possession.  I recommend this book to anyone as a good read even if they aren't fans, simply because there is such a great humor to this book you would think that Sam Kinison was hanging around guiding their very pens as they wrote.
B000M4RG42|3.0|This film had both strengths and weaknesses but a few of the weaknesses kept the film from being a great production. The film is about the nature of heroism. It explores the question of what makes a hero, why do we need heroes, what happens to heroes?  To some degree it also explores the concept of the fatal flaw of the hero, a classic theme in literature.     The story is about the battle for Iwo Jima and the famous photograph taken February 23, 1945 of 5 Marines and 1 Navy medic raising the US flag on Mt. Suribachi. This famous photograph by Joe Rosenthal became iconic and was a symbol for US victory. The narrative is around 3 of the surviving 6 men who are recruited to be heroes for the American public and to focus on sale of war bonds to further finance the war.     The transport of the troops to Iwa Jima and the battle scenes are the strongest part of the film. If the entire film had been about the full battle for Iwa Jima, it would probably have been a winner, based on the excellent portion of this film that focused on actual warfare. The advance of US troops from the beaches into the mountains and the determined struggle of the Japanese soldiers was excellent film-making. The terrible casualties were very realistically filmed and captured the horror of warfare. This third of the total film deserves 5 stars and is the strongest part of the entire film.    The film however explores the fate of 3 of the surviving men as they are pulled away from the war to become celebrity heroes and to sell war bonds. Here the film explores the fickle nature of idolatry and celebrity. Here we see the 3 servicemen treated in much the same way as the photograph. The public is interested in the surface, the image, and not in the nitty gritty details of reality.    Adam Beach, Ryan Phillippe, and Jesse Bradford play the 3 lead characters. Unfortunately the script does not allow them to become fully characterized and realistic to the audience. Adam Beach tries the hardest, as a Native American man who struggles against the lack of authenticity in the hero production business while comparing this falseness to the tragedy and loss that he and his friends experienced during the battle. He also struggles against a barrage of stereotypical racist impressions and encounters while also struggling with emerging alcoholism. He is the most fully articulated character in the film and Beach tries hard. Ryan Phillippe, who plays the Navy medic, plays more of the Everyman role, the average American middle-class male who absorbs everything around him but keeps the trauma internal until late in his life as a senior citizen his post-traumatic stress disorder emerges in nightmares and flashbacks. Jesse Bradford is meant to play an opportunist who gradually grows on the audience as his humanity begins to slowly emerge. His engagement to his home town girlfriend becomes a focus for the press. These three men manage celebrity in very different ways. The Native American has difficulty coping with the hypocrisy and glitz when he is feeling grief and loss. The Navy medic internalizes and copes outwardly, making compromises and rising to the occasion for what he sees as a greater good. We are not fully aware of Jesse Bradford's internal state. He seems to enjoy the celebrity and play the role for the cameras, but his internal response is never really explored.     The greatest weakness of the film however is the constant flashbacks and flash forwards between the war scenes, the scenes where the 3 fellows are made into heroes, the adaptations these men make after the war, and the final recollections of aged soldiers. These four time frames were shuffled together like a deck of cards and totally deconstructed the film for the viewers. A more basic narrative flow would have served the story much better.

B0015519VS|4.0|well it is good music but not the same Usher for me....he has grown and i must respect that but it is not the same love songs/sexy songs he is so known for...he has some music with a great beat and deep thoughts...i think i will grow to love this collection but on two previous Usher cd's i loved the music from beginning to end immediately...
B0015519VS|2.0|Usher thinks he's all that and acts that way but when you hear the results then you hear what's really up.  Artists like Prince and Marvin Gaye didn't have anything to prove because they were REAL innovators.  They didn't have to act cool. They simply were.  This album reaks of 2nd rate material with a man who lost his edge even though that edge was never sharp to begin with.  Do yourself a favor and pick up \\"let's get it on\\" by marvin gaye if you want a real playas album and if ya want the funk with a dash of love then pick up the isley brothers \\"the heat is on\\".  This is music when real musicians not computers were used all the time and when true originals were doing their thang.  Speaking of mr. cool usher, i remember seeing him on the ellen show (Don't like ellen but her guests are sometimes worth watching) and she asked him to dance and he almost tripped on his feet.  Mr. Smooth...NOT  This album is LAME and so is most of this pathetic music industry.

B00102F5WK|4.0|This movie does a good job of giving often aloof citizens of the American empire a taste of the suffering that is being inflicted by their country.  In addition to the violence of our long history of invasions, overthrows, coups and proxy wars; the U.S. (actually, elites based in the West with little allegiance to any country) has waged economic warfare as well [[ASIN:0312427999 The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]].  We're not waging a war on terror, we're waging a war of terror in the interests of Big Business [[ASIN:B0015XHQVC War, Inc.]].    One part of this film that would've been more realistic is to have had Gyllenhaal's character be a little meaner.  I don't think the CIA would usually hire such a sensitive guy.  They like to recruit people who have been indoctrinated by reactionary media agents like Rush Limbaugh (who jokes about how good the conditions at Guantanamo are, despite the fact that dozens of the prisoners have tried to commit suicide).  Although, every once in a while CIA agents have a change of heart and speak out against what they know is evil, including former agents like John Stockwell [[ASIN:0896083950 The Praetorian Guard : The US Role In The New World Order]] and Phil Agee [[ASIN:055322977X Inside the Company CIA Diary]].  Ominously, dirty work once done with some degree of government oversight is now being privatized [[ASIN:0743282248 Spies for Hire: The Secret World of Intelligence Outsourcing]].    We don't like to admit it for fear of being labelled paranoid, but the 'land of the free' is becoming like a police state with a growing complex of agents, money and authority being handed over to the CIA, FBI, DIA, ICE, NSA, DEA and others.  Why don't right-wingers ever complain about this form of big government?  They always complain about public schools and agencies like the EPA and OSHA, but are silent when it comes to the budget of agencies like the CIA (which, is secret but estimated at around $50 billion).  They probably don't mind that form of big government because they have lucrative careers in it.  Hopefully people will continue to resist this sort of tyranny and the harm it has brought to people and democracy worldwide.

B000FGGE7C|4.0|I honestly don't understand why so many of these reviews complain about this movie's plot. The plot was fantastic! However, it should be noted that it's one of those movies where about half of the plot is backstory, and is only revealed one part at a time as those parts become relevant to the here-and-now. I'll admit that it seems to have quite a lot in common with the somewhat superior V for Vendetta, but with the addition of the whole pathogen-induced-monster thing that has become quite the fashion these days (28 days later, Doom, Resident Evil, etc.), though at least this time it's vampires instead of zombies :)<br /><br />But yeah, this is a movie that will continuously tickle your brain as small details from earlier in the movie end up having critical importance later. The bad guy turns out to be more than we are initially led to believe. Enough is revealed about Violet to get the audience to sympathize with her (at least as much as Aliens and Terminator got their audiences to sympathize with Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor). The movie makes VERY good use of fictional technologies, especially dimensional compression or flat space or whatever it's called.<br /><br />Speaking of which, FLAMING SWORDFIGHT IN THE DARK!!! Easily one of the most imaginative scenes in sci-fi history.<br /><br />It is worth noting, however, that according to some sources, the \\"rough cut\\" of this film (which was screened in Feb '05) was a full half-hour longer, and most of that extra time was focused on fuller developments of the plot and/or Violet's character. I would have loved to see this cut, and I hope that it is available on DVD at some point in the future.
0446402389|5.0|I'll keep this short.  This book is set near the time period and conditions that inspired the great '1984', It's historically factual base and regular 'lower-class' cast make it all the more engrossing.  Very insight inducing without being too descriptive or preachy.  Author paints wonderful scenes with such subtlety.
1595141715|5.0|When my school posted the annual summer reading list I never would have imagined that anything on it would be interesting let alone enjoyable.      I was wrong!       From the first page of Thirteen Reasons Why I was captivated. I could not put the book down. I spent 6 hours on my couch reading.      I was surprised by the realistic way Jay Asher wrote Hannah's story.  You feel like you knew her. You can't help but to understand and feel her pain. You can feel Clay and the wave of surprise and terror as Hannah's stories unfold.       Each of Hannah's stories put you on the edge of your seat. Jay's writing allows you to take in every detail of Hannahs life as if you were in Hannah's shoes. Letting you see her life for exactly what it was.         I love this book and I recommend it to everyone. Hands down best book I've ever read.

B0013BNY2Q|1.0|There is certainly a lot of clamor being made over this clamorous wreck of a record.  R.E.M may very well be the best American band thus far but not by the merits of Accelerate.  This album has no texture and no depth.  If, as touted, it is a return to roots it went too far, i.e. back to the formative Athen's basement years too far.  But that does not even seem to be the case because though the earliest albums might have been unintelligible they were not unintelligent.  And this one is as dumb as a bag of hammers.  So all the claims of \\"back to form\\" are nonsense.  Accelerate is simply the new millennium's \\"Monster\\" and simply an obstreperous and cantankerous dud.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|First of all ...all of you who gave this movie 1 star...well, I guess you don't appreciate a movie that shows courage, strength, and power.  I guess a good movie is one where every second word is F.U. guns firing around and cops chasing the bad guys.    This movie had a story, a strength  of a tribe and its commitment to its people.  Beautiful picture, great sound and VERY entertaining.   Definitely a 5*
0316143472|3.0|I knew it was a bad sign that I had made it to almost page 100 without laughing aloud - and barely even cracking a smile.  That has never happened to me with any of Sedaris' other books.  I was crying (in public) when I read 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' from laughing so hard.  Not so much here.<br /><br />Finally, there got to be some moments of that, but not many....and never to the tears in the eye stage.  I refer to him being on a plane with a woman sitting beside him as the highlight of the passages.<br /><br />I found with this and his last book - he writes less and less about his family, which were such perfect fodder for his earlier works.  Maybe living abroad keeps those encounters less frequent - or maybe he or they just don't want them for public use.<br /><br />The Smoking Section was ok - but I wasn't really in the mood to read his day to day diary, let alone on the topic of stopping smoking or travels in Japan.<br /><br />All being said, Sedaris' writing seems a bit more focused and tighter, which isn't a bad thing.  But sometimes it was the perceived ramblings that made things humourous.<br /><br />For those looking to read, I would wait for paperback.  Probably not worth the hardback price.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|I can't believe that there are currently 11 reviews giving one star for this album. All I can say to that is: don't review an album you don't understand.    This is a true masterpiece. It is the best, and most consistent album Iron Maiden has ever released.     It is not like the 80's albums, although you recognize the typical Maiden-sound. Bruce Dickinson's voice is one in a billion, and the band performes at it's best. Don't expect anything like Dance of Death or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, it's very different from them. No disrespect to those albums, as they are also great, but this one is THE Maiden album of the decade.
B00008V6YG|1.0|Nothing much to write about: A wonderful Jennifer Aniston ... a terrible screenplay!  I really don't like to provide one star only for any film because it clearly shows my mistake in picking it up and/or watching it. However, fully unexpected the storyboard as such Aniston was urged to play is that horrible that it justifies this my one star evaluation.  ... the basic idea of the story isn't that bad at all but unfortunately the cinematic achievement is really miserable and only Aniston's splendid performance makes the film bearably; GOOD GIRL!

B00005U11Z|5.0|I have always been a very big Journey fan. However I did not realize there was a Journey before Steve Perry.  To me SP will always be the \\"voice\\" of Journey.  I lost touch of them in later years and didn't even realize that they had had other lead singers since him.  Since rediscovering them lately I have watched many a youtube video checking out the various lead singers.  I must admit, I really really like Steve Augeri and wish he would have been able to stick with them.  I have only had this DVD a few days and have watched it over and over and for a 54 year old woman that is saying something.  I absolutely love it.  Augeri just fits the personna I think for this group.  To bad he is no longer with them.  Buy this and enjoy, enjoy.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Saw the new Disney aquired pixar studios movie called \\"Wall E\\" Great computer generated movie with a message. The background tells of earth consuming to excess fueled by the corporations BnL, Buy n Large. Humanity has grown fat and lathargic and left the earth to be cleaned up by robots. Wall E is one of those robots, the last functioning one. He cleans up the trash by crushing into a block one at a time and has left towers of the stuff among the deserted city, great visuals. Very cute, funny, cool, just so much work goes into these by aritists and the script is well done. I took the critics on yahoo and viewers at their word for giving it an A rating and was not dissapointed.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|Yeah it's Green Day. But no it's not. And while it only takes a quick glance at some reviewers to understand that shades of gray escape them, I gotta ask...why make such a big deal out of what is a one off, for their own fun, and hey some fans might like it too album? The songs are short, fast and fun, much like ice cream on a hot summer day. Take it for what it is.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Sweet and tough voice captured in a really good production.  Good songwriting as well.  You won't reach Winehousian heights but this is a very strong and assured introduction.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|The comparisons to Amy Winehouse are bound to turn up although while they are both retro singers, Amy is obviously the Bad Girl Shangri Las version of neo soul while Amiee Anne Duffy is the Good Girl.<br /><br />Rockferry is one of the strongest debuts, heck album for that matter, I have come across in a long time. Her voice is compelling and her band is wonderful and matches her beautifully. From the somber piano on Rockferry to the lush rhythms in Serious and Syrup & Honey to the Wall Of Sound on Mercy, this is an effort from a lot of very talented people with Duffy leading the way.<br /><br />As to the inevitable Winehouse comparisons I have to be honest and say that, in my opinion, none of these songs can touch You Know I'm No Good, BUT...this album as whole is far more consistent and has a much better flow than Back to Black or Frank and in many ways that makes is better as a whole for me.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I remember trying to catch up with myself while watching this movie. This movie was growing on on me at so many different levels that my consciousness couldn't keep abreast.<br /><br />I remember being swooped in by the ingenuity of the concept while simultaneously being humbled by the ruthless honesty with which the emotional lives of the characters - especially Joel's - have been traced. The plot and the treatment are also relentless, always demanding enormous attention to the unfolding of the story in spite of you being trapped, and further wanting to remain so, in the memories and the emotions.<br /><br />In this sense I thought I, as the audience, found myself in a similar situation as Joel. He witnesses his own memories, relives them and wants to hold on to them (many, if not all). He doesn't want to let `em go. Therefore he has to summon his attention to what is being wiped away and act in order to save those special moments that make life worth living. I - the audience - want to stay with him in those memories that are so honestly portrayed, for I find comfort in reliving them - especially when they are going to be wiped away forever. But even I must summon my utmost concentration to follow the story, lest it vanish in a jiffy leaving me behind.<br /><br />I saw this movie now almost two years back. Ever since, I have been waiting to lay my hands on the screenplay. Recently I had the occasion to read it. Man, Charlie Kaufmann has so masterfully designed it! He has seamlessly managed to simultaneously affect the emotions of the audience and hook them on intellectually.<br /><br />In the words of J. Krishnamurti, admittedly in a different context: \\"There is a vast distinction between intellect and intelligence. Intellect is merely thought functioning independently of emotion... ...In intelligence there is the inherent capacity to feel as well as to reason; in intelligence both capacities are equally present, intensely and harmoniously.\\"<br />I believe Charlie Kaufmann has delivered intelligence here.<br /><br />Amazing performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. These two come across as vastly disticnt but uniquely interesting characters. Poles apart, yet the romantic spark is viscerally palpable and seems inevitable. Notable performances by others as well. Superb job by the director Michel Gondry. Fades out a brilliant film.ce here.    Amazing performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.

0670824399|5.0|I thought this was an entertaining little book, but as some of the negative reviews suggest, it may be a little too dark for younger children.  But then again, most under-10 children (if my nieces are any guide) are going to want books with more pictures and less text anyhow.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is light Hollywood fare... Valor, love, friendship, hope, righteous work; I feel that most of the critics of this film lack these. I know, having Baldwin play a great American hero like Gen. Doolittle is like having Madonna play Mother Theresa, but just relax and enjoy the film!
B00005JPNY|3.0|In some (nearly) parallel universe, things are quite different.  Human beings walk alongside their \\"demons\\", almost tangible avatars of their souls.  The war between church and academia (irrational faith and enlightened reason) has virtually been lost to the \\"Magisterium\\", a workable stand-in for organized religion.  The only hope for freedom is an understanding of \\"dust\\", some quasi-cosmic substance that flows into humans through their demons.  The Magisterium sees Dust as a threat to their rule (if only because it's not found in their scriptures, and nothing that powerful can remain outside their control) and plans both covertly and in the open to cut man off from it.      Lyra Belacqua, a precocious 12 year older living in some otherworldly version of Oxford, finds herself at the crossroads of this conflict.  Her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) mounts an expedition to the North where the Aurora Borealis reveals a cascade of Dust flowing to a man through his demon.  Marissa Coulter (Nicole Kidman in seduction-overdrive), an agent of The Magisterium, takes an extreme interest in Lyra and offers to take her on an expedition North.  Before leaving (and once Coulter's odiousness has clearly emerged from her charming demeanor) the master of her school gives her the last remaining Alethiometer - the Golden Compass - an instrument which she doesn't understand.  The master's commands are simple - keep it secret, keep it safe.  It is only after Coulter virtually imprisons Lyra in her London home (looking like Kensington, with carriages drawn by lightning instead of horses) that Lyra realizes that something is very wrong.  Snooping around, Lyra finds evidence linking Coulter with the systematic kidnapping of children (including at least one of her friends) and escapes with her Alethiometer.  Hooking up with Gyptians (tough but honorable sea-going nomads) in search of their own lost children, Lyra heads North.      In her search for her missing friend, Lyra will encounterIorek Byrnison (I know I couldn't have spelled that right - just think of a polar bear with battle armor and the voice of Ian Mckellen) a witch named Serrafina Pekkala (let's just put spell-check aside, this is a parallel universe) played by Eva Green, an \\"aeronaut\\" from Texas (and therefore played by Sam Elliot) and various other characters.  Her search will bring her to a remote polar research station run by the Magisterium where cruel experiments are conducted on children to separate them from their demons, their personal conduits for Dust.    NOW THAT I'VE WAXED ON THE STORY...  There's a lot of material underlying the \\"Dark Materials\\" trilogy, of which GC is the 1st part.  Unfortunately, none of it actually works its way into the narrative of this movie.  The script excised much of the story's barb against organized religion, reducing the Magisterium to a bunch of generic odious characters in funny clothes plotting something, and ever extending their authority.  It's hard to imagine how well the flick would have done were its script larded down with polemic of any kind (let alone anti-religious), but the movie fails because it fails to become a story about anything.  It would be easy for the fans to blame Hollywood for taking god out of the picture (as ironic a charge that is for the left) but fantasy stories have always been based on characters who were analogs for those of real life (or acknowledged as such in real life), and The Magisterium of the books could have been replaced with one just as potent without condescending to religious viewers.  I mean, this is a parallel universe - it's all about finding different versions of what we already recognize.      Unfortunately, rather than playing shell-games with its symbols, GC decides not to play anything at all.  The Magisterium never becomes more than generic baddies (and because they don't do much at all, its hard to envision them as villains at all); there's a war between polar bears that will see Iorek returned to the throne - even though the bears as a whole never become a factor in the story once that happens; there are witches and an evil army of cossak-looking guys, scientists and ofcourse Mrs. Coulter.  There's plenty of CGI designed to make us think that things are happening, and the story includes a northbound journey to make it seem like the story is going somewhere when it doesn't.  The movie climaxes on a pitched battle between the cossak-looking guys on one side and witches, gyptians and Iorek on the other - it's old stuff to anybody who sat through Narnia and at least 2 of the Rings movies, and since it's shot at night, it's harder to see what's going on.  Though the movie preserves at least some of the book's rich material, the narrative sloppily integrates it into the story - using embarrassingly obvious expository dialog and bombarding Lyra with a number of characters who exist if only to show/tell Lyra what to do next.  Virtually every plot element in the story is told to us rather than discovered by Lyra.  (The Alethiometer is supposed to tell truth, but it to becomes a convenient plot device, a GPS for Lyra to navigate the story's otherwise unnavigable byways.)    There's actually a moment in GC that promises what the rest of the movie fails to deliver.  Lyra, having been chased to the doors of her College-home by a band of Gyptian children, warns them back.  She threatens them with unspeakable horrors should they cross the gates of the school.  The gyptian boy isn't one to suffer threats easily, so he and Lyra engage in duel of wits that ends with the combatants cheerily scheduling a later time to resume their war.  The scene embodies everything that the rest of the movie doesn't: a horrible fate, an unceasing belief (or unceasing refusal to believe) in it, and the unique capacity of children to create a great story, live it and know its limits.

This movie is a very good thank you to Daniel Ruettiger who in real life did that dream come true.    Even now, in 2008 and to come, on 148 countries, how many really are true democracies? Certainly not yet in many East EU countries, a lot of China, a dozen of countries in Africa etc...America still has got the \\"you can do it\\" and \\"dreams can come true attitude\\": not bad wisdom considering that the USA is only 222 years old (since the American constitution) and not about 2500 to 3500 years old as most other countries.

However, Jose Frerre did the entire movie on his knees to appear small in stature the same as Tulouse so I give him kudos for suffering through all that.  Miss Gabor even looked good way back then!
B000089770|5.0|This little gem is one of the unsung classics of the nineties.  Director Wayne Wang and co-director and scenarist Paul Auster have crafted a film that at turns funny, poignant, and tragic in a way that will always stay with you.  Some may be turned off because the film centers on a Brooklyn tobacco shop and for sure there is a lot of casual smoking here but that's just a starting point for a script that follows a variety of interesting characters and many intriguing story twists.  Harvey Keitel as Auggie the owner of the store gave what I thought one of the best performances of his career.  The film is populated by great work(William Hurt, Forrest Whitaker, et. al) but Auggie is the glue that holds the film together.  The extended scene where Auggie relates to the writer played by Hurt a Christmas story is worth the price of admission alone.  Even better is the scene over the end credits where Auggie's story is visualized as Leonard Cohen warbles on the soundtrack.  Also noteworthy is an unforgettable cameo by Ashley Judd as Stockard Channing's drug-addled daughter.  This rank's with Alec Baldwin's work in \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" as an example of an actor making a major impact on a film with minimal screen time.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I read the book so I just had to see the movie.  They only vaguely resemble each other.  The book is written from Mary's point of view, but the movie focused mostly on Anne. The plot of the movie (I use the term loosely) jumped around a lot and wouldn't have made sense to me if I hadn't read the book.  I spent half my time while watching just filling in the gaps for my husband and daughter.  They had not read the book and still felt this movie was a waste of a couple of hours.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|Reviewer Altman comes closest when he asks \\"where does their gravity come from in this 2001-look-alike spaceship?\\" but when 2001: A Space Odyssey was released, at least somebody picked up on the sperm-appearing Discovery swimming in space. Sunshine's imagery is much more explicit, but a search among hundreds of Amazon reviews (and Ebert is clueless) for a hint of recognition fails. Perhaps viewers are too distracted by the numerous logical and fundamental scientific flaws in the plot and script to see the core concept.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Anyone who's ever done time in a Cell in Cubeville can tell you it's close to the lower rungs of the inferno.  Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is no exception.  He's got an abusive boss Janice (Loma Scott) who no one can stand, a best friend who's sneaking around with his girlfriend, and he realizes that googling his name comes up with zero results.     Then one night, Wesley just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The next thing he knows, a crazy guy (Thomas Kretschmann) is shooting at him and a total fox who coincidentally bears that name (Angelina Jolie) is rescuing him.  He goes from bored and self loathing to scared out of his wits and screaming through a car chase that will keep you on the edge of your seat.     Fox takes him to a castle styled mansion on the edge of town where he meets Sloan (Morgan Freeman).  Sloan advises him that Cross, the assassin who tried to kill him, killed his father. Cross is a rogue assassin from the Fraternity, a millennium old group started by weavers. Cross is trying to end the Fraternity one assassin at a time and when he took Wesley's Dad out, he killed their best.     Sloan offers Wesley the chance to join the Fraternity and avenge his father's death. Let's just say the hazing he gets beats anything a college could dish out.  If it weren't for a miracle restorative bath fraternity members get immersed in, they wouldn't have any new members at all.    \\"Wanted\\" has enough twists to keep you guessing until the end and beyond. There are enough car chases and and action scenes in 2 hours for any adrenaline junkie. \\"Wanted\\" was a great escape film for a rainy Sunday afternoon.      Rebecca Kyle, June 2008
0786856297|5.0|The book is great.  If you like greek mythology you'll like this.  It's all about the sons and daughters of the gods and humans.  Percy has his life changed completely.  The ending has a real twist that you wont believe and leaves you hanging.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|Pitch Black is an exciting sci-fi thriller of about space travelers being marooned on a planet faced by an attack of its indigenous nocturnal creatures. It smacks of many movies in the history of cinema, Aliens being the first which comes to mind, but the movie is very unique in several points. One is Vin Diesel's charismatic performance as the anti-hero Riddick. Physically impressive with his baritone voice Diesel's presence controls the film from beginning to end. However, I enjoyed the film as there are some unique portrayals of religion that are rarely seen in movies that deserve to be mentioned.  This is done through the character of Imam played by Keith David, which is contrasted and challenged by Riddick during the movie. I believe the screenwriters wisely chose the image of a Muslim religious leader rather than the traditional Christian clergyman. It was wise in the sense since Hollywood has often portrayed Christian ministers in the past as being hypocritical, indecisive, insipid, close-minded and so gentle to even appear effeminate. Hollywood is yet to commonly portray Muslim leaders in this way and this is what provides credibility for the audience regarding Imam's character. This is not to say there are not strong Christians, but cinema has influenced the culture to an extent that portraying such an image would be difficult to believe by an American audience. It is through the Imam that the issue of faith is brought up.     Spoiler alert  Imam is contrasted with Riddick who brazenly confesses that he does believe in God, but states that He is apathetic at least and sadistic at worst. However, Imam's belief does not waver despite Riddick's mocking of his faith even when a turn of natural events puts the survivors in jeopardy. In the end though it is Riddick's character, which changes due to the sacrifice of the Captain, Carolyn Fry who refuses to abandon anyone on the planet even Riddick. Fry ends up going back for a wounded Riddick and dies in the process. Riddick is shocked that anyone would sacrifice his life for him; especially this woman who knows that Riddick was willing to leave stranded the remaining survivors to save himself. Riddick is floored physically and emotionally with disbelief that anyone would sacrifie their life for anyone especailly him as he sees Fry's body being taken away. Such an act of self-sacrifice is Christ-like in nature and resonates Jesus' Crucifixion. This sacrifice is what produces an inward change in him expressed when after they escape from the planet he states that Riddick died back on the planet.       Altogether this was an interesting film, which raised philosophical and theological issues. Although the issue of God and human suffering are not given a thorough presentation in the movie it is expressed enough to make one think. One thing I have realized about this film is that it was released before the terrorist attack of 9/11, and I wonder how receptive the American audiences would be to having a Muslim being portrayed favorably in the movie, and what would the reaction be if released a year and half later than it actually was. Having watched this film recently,  I appreciated seeing a character who is religious in nature and not being portrayed as fanatical, hypocritical, or banal. The screenwriters created some worthwhile characters, and I await to see further adventures of Riddick after the Chronciles.
