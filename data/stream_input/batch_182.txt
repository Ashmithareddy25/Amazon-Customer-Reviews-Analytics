B00HNKBQSA|1|It burnt out in 3 months. I never heard back from the company.
B000C2194C|5|I love this parfum spray. I was very pleased at the price as well.  This size bottle will last a very long time. This is an older cologne and it is difficult finding it in the store, if not impossible.  Yet I found it with no problem on amazon.com.  They are so reliable. I will definitely order again and again.    Deborah of Tennessee
B000FQAJ9G|5|I love the smell of this lotion, and I've gotten many compliments when I wear it about how good I smell:)
B000N2L32E|3|when I received my shipment I thought I WAS SENT THE WRONG ITEM BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DIFFERENT LOOKING CONTAINER FROM THE ONLINE PICTURE AND THE NAME ON THE CONTAINER ELIMINATED \\"O2 ORIGINALS\\" ALSO ON THE PACKAGE I RECEIVED IT HAS THAT IT IS \\"CONDITIONING SERUM\\" AND NOT \\"SOOTHING POLISH\\" AS IN THE PICTURE. I USED TO USE THIS PRODUCT YEARS AGO WHEN IT STILL CAME IN THE SAME PACKAGE AS THIS PICTURE SHOWS AND I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED. SO WHEN I RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN A DIFFERENT PACKAGE I WAS SURE I HAD BEEN SENT THE WRONG ITEM, HOWEVER I EMAILED THE COMPANY THAT AMAZON ORDERED IT THROUGH AND I WAS ASSURED IT WAS THE CORRECT PRODUCT JUST WITH NEW PACKAGING. OTHER THAN ALL OF THIS CONFUSION I DO LIKE THIS PRODUCT.[ASIN:B000BW76LS Scruples Soothing Polish Conditioning Serum][[ASIN:B000N2L32E Scruples O2 ORIGINALS Soothing Polish 3.4 oz]]]
B0054Y2C94|5|This product definitely met my expectations.  My hair color lasted longer when I used this shampoo a week before coloring my hair.  I wouldn't use it on a regular basis but just before coloring your hair.
B00CC89O3W|2|I used to use the sea buckthorn face wash by Aubrey, and I loved it. This made my face break out with acne and didn't remove makeup. (And I just wear a bit of cover-up.) It was like washing my face with body lotion.
B0011Z646M|1|I ordered a $30 item from this company and they sent me $3 ear plugs, not what I ordered and then told me it was USPS's fault and will not refund my money. DO NOT ORDER from this company. They are awful and have the worst customer service.
B005PPRRHO|2|Could have bought a bottle of vanilla extract,  much chef and smells the same
B00EYSNWXG|4|I've never used an eyelash curler before, so I can't say that it is so much better than any other. This is easy to use, came with 10 extra pads (not just 5) and curls my lashes well.
B00MMHMU48|5|John Frieda's the best
B001ET76CG|5|Works great for sensitive teeth.  Great price.
B00YJJXJ06|3|I'm not a big make user.  I have used mineral based powdered foundation for years.  This gave a better coverage and lasted well but  as soon as my summer tan has faded I think the color will be too dark.  Nice dispenser that should keep the product sanitary.  Glass bottles and foundation haven't been my friend in the past with small children but hopefully mine are old enough and I'll be coordinated enough to not drop it.  Expected to use for a wedding I attended.  Color was way off. I'll try again next summer but not good for my winter pale.
B000C1W6YA|5|Arrived on time and is great will update with longevity this weekend
B001R2IGEC|5|Luv this for giving light color to my &#34;bright white&#34; skin----works great on legs, arms, neck, décolletage, feet.  Especially like this product as it is designed not to spray all owner the room....has a more gentle direct spray pattern that saves floors, walls from also coloring.  It is quite light so if u want a deeper tan, I would try medium.....this is fair, natural when rubbed in, healthy color for those who basically avoid sun but want to look healthier in summer.  It can easily be used year round in the south if desired as it so natural.  Packaged well....took a bit longer to receive but....keep a spare & all is set.
B005ED7O7U|5|Nice, good quality!
B0058RFU5A|3|I hope my daughter will like this.
B00D14HF5A|4|Very useful.
B000GLRREU|5|couldn't do with out it as it flushes out all the food between your teeth
B004OEGRD2|4|Because I like how it makes my skin feeli, it's  soft , smoth  slickey shinned  and feels like I just had a facial
B00ISOYMY0|4|Wonderful.
B001HTCYPC|5|A lot goes a long way.  I never have to put more than one layer of this on throughout the day.  I have used many moisturizers but so far this is the only one that I can use under or even on top of make-up.  You will not find this any cheaper either. Proactiv sells this for 4x the cost.
B002D4KCPY|5|I have been bleaching my hair for years and this stuff is the real deal.  It is super saturated so I mix it with regular shampoo and only leave it on a couple of minutes.  I get compliments and questions about how I keep my hair so white constantly.  I also get the occasional &#34;Khaleesi!&#34; shouted at me!
B0047A6WLA|5|I've been DE shaving for about 4 months now and I decided to step up my game with this 2013 version muhle r41. First time using yesterday I did a 2 pass wtg and xtg passes and nearly BBS everywhere with one tiny weeper on upper lip. I used an angle that placed the handle more toward the floor than the traditional 30degree angle.  This cut well but was a little tuggy.  Adjusted to more of a traditional angle today and much better.  Also I used Astra SP yesterday and Gillette platinum today.  Prefer the Gillette in this razor. No real irritation or raw feeling with either blade. Love it
B0062IWQVU|5|a very high quality product was glad to deal thank you
B00803CEQW|4|I'm very happy with this purchase. I keep it on medium setting for my somewhat wavy hair and it's truly one pass for me.  Quick and easy and so far non-damaging.
B00ADQKOSE|2|I have thick, long, wavy/curly hair.  I live in Texas so it tends to frizz.  I purchased this lit after seeing it on the Today show.  I followed the directions to the tee and yes at first your hair is pin straight.  I used a flat iron with a 375 degree setting.  I waited a few days to wash my hair, as soon as it dried I could notice a very MINIMAL relaxed curl, I would still need to flat iron it.  I also use a hair dryer with ions so that helps with the frizz.  Overall I wouldn't buy this product again.  I'm going to try the more expensive keratin treatment and see how that works.  I wasn't expecting pin straight hair but I did expect it to be straighter than it was.
B000OP3R7O|3|Smells different than the dusk soap.
B002LQ2BE4|5|AS SOON AS I RUB WITH IT I FEEL INSTANT RELIEF!<br />DOESN'T WORK ON TENSE MUSCLES BUT GREAT FOR STRESS!
B0020EJSUM|4|High quality clippers. Very sharp.  Very pricey compared to regular chrome style clippers.  Only time will tell if they are worth the price.
B00396VE7U|5|Love this product
B0085RZLR2|5|Best brush for the best electric toothbrush.
B003PLJP2A|5|I switched to the Say Yes to Tomatoes line of facial care about 5 years ago from Proactiv. I am definitely a convert. My skin is healthier and just as clear as it was using Proactiv. Even my husband has switched over. The one downside (although it doesn't bother me a bit) is that these products can sometimes have a funny smell from the natural ingredients.
B00CP4H3T0|4|Looking for a clean shave that lasts long? This is the product for you (men). My brother uses this everytime he feels a little stubble. He's never looked so groomed lol.
B006ON74II|5|This brush is awesome for children and adults alike.  It really does not pull on your hair at all. l use it in the shower and on dry hair. lt doesn't pull at all! l probably will end up buying another.
B009SCRSHE|2|I've used JWoww lotion in the past and I really liked it.  But definitely not this particular one.<br /><br />I will not recommend this to anyone nor will I buy this ever again.  It may have even turned me off from her tanning products all together.<br /><br />My skin was so dry after the few times I used it.  I also didn't like the smell.
B000FDSN7O|1|First of all the stated weight is incorrect, with the packaging it comes to 26 lbs as marked on the carton;  so the unit itself is not as lightweight as advertised, which could make a difference to someone unable to handle (fold up, put into car/trunk, etc) a heavier walker. Also, it states the brakes lock and we were unable to determine how that is possible (to lock the brakes). I would be interested in knowing if this was a problem for anyone else. Overall the unit was sturdy and the wheels rolled easily, but ultimately my Dad decided it was not for him. The return process was fairly simple.
B001R2S8HM|5|just what i wanted
B003BJQT3O|5|Love everything about it! My favorite product in their line. Smells terrific.
B00J3K9W6G|5|I ordered two of these mirrors.  One for me and one for my Father who is 89 years old and having difficulty inserting eyedrops used in treating his glaucoma.  The product is very well made and beautiful too.  The 7x magnification is wonderful and the mirror was easy to install.  The nickle finished looks great and I like that it folds up out of the way.  Highly recommend this product.
B004HJ1QGC|4|This stuff is great in the shower. Creamy and soft with a great coconut scent. Highly recommend it. You can buy two bottles at once as well.
B00BB8LBLW|5|excellent product!!!
B007AS7NE6|5|Really helps clean up the face and leaves a nice glow to the skin and fresh face feeling
B00MIUYA5G|5|I'm very happy with it
B003U7JCBS|4|This lip balm is slightly greasier in feel than the standard mint Burt's Bees.  But it is delicious nevertheless. Great price as well.
B006448CW4|5|Bought it for my best friend and it was shipped to her. She absolutely loves it! I would buy it again for her.
B003V32UAQ|5|good price
B001U0OQM2|5|I have sometimes problems with redness and it is annoying to go out in public with the redness showing.<br /><br />Therefor I wanted a tinted acne product that could somehow mask the redness and blend into my skin color.<br /><br />This works fine.<br /><br />Sometimes I wet my finger and apply a small amount, just enough to hide the blemish and I am comfortable that I do not look like Red Nose the Reindeer when I am in public ... sounds funny, but I could not locate any tinted acne product in any of the retail stores I looked and I looked in many.<br /><br />Price is great, these will last me at least a year or more.
B002UN9F5G|5|Perfecto
B00CBFBMM2|5|This worked great to get away razor bumps on my legs and groin are. It also worked on razor bumps on my boyfriends face. I also think the smell is nice, definitely has tea tree oil in it
B00KXHI3G8|4|Good quality and fine tip!
B003SSTKHU|5|Loveit
B007EHWDTS|2|Good idea in theory but these stencils only work if your eyebrows aren't that thick.
B0017JTA0Y|5|I have always loved Gold by Donna Karan and I'm so glad I can still get it on Amazon--no stores carry it any more.
B003K75V72|2|The lotion seems good but it is not the same product pictured. Cant give a higher rating since its not the correct product
B00DGRDQC8|1|The mangroomers battery life sucks! At first it.seemed pretty cool product but It takes forever to charge and when it is charged it won't last long. I tried getting in contact with customer service but they won't respond. In conclusion this product was decent and the customer service does not exist with this company. Do yourself a favor and buy the norelco bodygroomer now!
B00021C1NG|5|This product is very good. My face feels really clean after I apply the \\"philosophy purity made simple one-step facial cleanser\\". So far, I see good results.
B00L374QKO|1|Bar extremely short. Bottom ball was glued to the bar which it should not be because you are supposed to be able to unscrew both balls to clean them properly, etc. Poor product.
B001VEK1HQ|5|As good as getting a brand new razor. Closest shave and far less irritation. I will definitely do this once a year or more often.
B004DBXLNU|2|Product is ok, won't buy again
B00JKL7H3I|5|Use daily
B00YQGP8C4|5|I have sensitive skin, and have always had a problem finding the right skin care regime – something that doesn’t overly dry my skin and at the same time doesn’t leave it too oily.  Bebe & Bella achieves this better than any product I’ve ever used.  The beneficial bacteria in the products helps reduce skin sensitivity and creates visibly clearer skin with a reduction of redness and inflammation.  It also increases skin elasticity and so reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and I’m at an age where that matters.
B007UTFO64|5|They are best Purchases I've done! , easy to use and they arrive fast! I bought like 10 different  designs of the brand
B001E01EPU|5|Worked instantly on first use, great product!!! pay attention to directions and follow through, it can end up giving your hair a purplish tint to it if overused
B006YPXACU|4|It is a good product!
B00B5PHCMI|3|I wouldn't buy this shade in the future since a light lip shade. However,  Iredale excellent  products.
B00006IV30|5|I have been using hot rollers for 15 years. This one works well. The felt rollers produce a nice soft curl. It heats up within 2 or 3 minutes. I love that there are only 5 rollers since that is all i need anyways, and it takes up a lot less room on my counter and in my suitcase.
B0006B0W2O|5|Very good brush, thanks. I don't know what else to say. There's only so much you can say about a brush.
B0092MCMM6|5|I bought this and it dries the hair very good perfect .. However it has a loud noise. To me is not disturbing but thought is important to say.
B000KB956E|1|i ordered the 12 oz jar and received 6.5 oz. tube. totally unacceptable, false advertising.  I have used this product for years
B000PHVMC8|5|Love Love Love this brand of hair products!  So glad I found it on amazon and will continue to order!!
B00BGERB92|5|A boyfriend got me this one year back in 2002. I wish we were still together because the best and only real present I have gotten from a husband or boyfriend  ever. The best present ever. The truth.  I bought some for my self now 3 times but the last bottle I haven't opened that I got here from Amazon. Waiting for a good opportunity to use it,I  love so much.
B0020MMFYK|5|excelente perfume ...
B000F1LPOY|4|I have used this product several times in the past and this is the BEST ever!<br />Try it and see!
B004D2C57M|5|The package came promptly and arrived packaged nicely.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but, I am using the same product in the night repair.  I enjoy all the Neutrogena products as they seem to be gentle on the skin.  I have very sensitive skin so their products seem to work for me.  Also, the price is great!
B008BBINFY|5|I have only used this product since going gray, so I have nothing for a comparison, but I love the color of my hair and my hair dresser believes the great silvery tones are directly related to the use of this product.
B005C2O3PO|5|Works great as my highlight!
B004WK3SOY|5|Easy to use, heats up quickly, I have very long hair and did not have trouble. I like the design especially
B001618JY6|5|nice one
B00WDT7YPU|5|Super fun and easy. Very well etched, great for the spring.
B00JTH5TTW|5|Quick shipper.  Exactly as described
B00AAZMINM|5|High Quality & Durable!  All of the brushes you need for basic makeup application.  Best M.A.C. Brush Set for the professional or novice.  Love these!
B006MMOVOQ|5|My hands aren't itching and to me that is a miracle. I have hand eczema and after a particularly long day of lifting and working I put this on and my hands didn't itch in the middle of the night. I woke up in the morning and they were a bit swollen and felt like a break out was coming but it didn't. I had my hands in water a lot tonight and so I'll see if this oil can handle the vengefulness my eczema is capable of or not but all told I'm happy so far.
B000C211KE|5|The item arrived on time and in good order.
B00ESY47I0|1|It came Brocken the gem was loose in the bag and didn't even fit correctly in the spot for it!
B001J7A35A|5|I used to use this perfume for long time, and because i couldn't find it in any store then I ordered here. It is the same original perfume you could find.
B00026FV2Y|5|I love these combs.  I bought one years ago and wanted another one.  I use one in the shower to comb out my hair with conditioner and also for teasing.  Highly recommend!
B008UPHT8I|4|I have tried every single eye cream, gel, roller ball you name it. This is the only product that seems to work for me. Some days it works better then others but I don't use it everyday like I should, so I know if I used it more often I would see even better results. I'm 36 and I have always had puffy eyes even when I was kid and I saw a huge difference after using it the first time in the store. It is definitely pricey that's why I don't use it every single day but I just ordered another one from Lancome at 20% off off so I'm a happy camper! :-)
B00FPMO1VC|2|I was expecting a sheer cherry color and found that on my light ivory coloring the Fresh sugar cherry was overwhelming.  Not for me.  I wore the Honey color for years and it worked very well.
B001KYPZ4G|3|The product did a decent job for my legs, but when it came for my underarms, it reacted and gave me rashes. Ouch!<br />If you want a sensitive skin friendly product, try waxing or sugaring instead.
B00E3AZPHQ|5|This is such a sexy smell on me and it intensify my natural pheromones<br />It works so well
B00GMAWI66|5|Bought this to use in my hair and I love it!  Will definitely order again.
B005UF4YMK|5|I love all the Clean fragrances.  I would recommend this for any age.  The fragrances is not strong but last all day long.
B00CHHK0CW|5|Can hurt if you press too hard, but well moistened wipes.
B000C1VYZW|4|I gave this Sunwater toilette spray a 4-star. I really do love this fragrance perhaps it's the weather.  This fragrance is very light and more for Summer! I would recommend it to someone who likes, light fragrances. The only way that someone else smells it, is that their that close upon you.
B000SOLCQ4|3|It helps you to carry a drink and cell phone, but it is not stiff enough to stay straight.  it falls down and is hard to use.
B00A6VN56E|4|Good stuff
B000QYZSFM|5|I chose this item because I needed help in taking my medications, this has come in handy and I thank you ever so much for having this available.
B0019R0V5M|5|My skin likes this product, I use it as a moisturizing sun screen.
B00FRDPRQ2|5|I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I noticed a difference in my hair immediately and love the smell the product leaves in my hair.  My hair is shiny and this product does not leave an oily residue in my hair.  I love it!
B008SCUJ3U|3|Drys out my lips but the color stays well
B000I5MJ8S|5|Love this blender!!!! The best tool for your Foundation and conceler aplication, gives you perfectly smuth flawless airbrush look. Highly recomended.
B003ILUQPM|4|Some things are shallow and don't stamp correctly but a lot of nice ones in this bundle
B00KJSCZL0|4|Love it.
B00AEY1SQW|3|Delivery was fine but I don't see much difference in my skin.  It's only been 2 weeks.  Maybe I will see a difference in time
B00BWB3YTA|5|so far so good, impressed!
B003Y57G7I|3|It's okay I do not like the fact that it has mineral oil, as one of the ingredients.  I think it is a mediocre conditioner!
B000F35R00|5|Short of a tiny lightsaber, I cannot imagine a more powerful tool for nail cutting. These clippers cut clean with no force, in a cold and eerie way.
B004VTWA1I|5|All my other body washes would dry out my feet and hands during the winter because of the ingredients needed to control my acne. This wash keeps me nice and smooth all over without provoking breakouts.
B001TJJX5O|1|I don't even know if what I thought I purchased is what I actually got. Bottle was not sealed and product was 1/4&#34; from top. No way am I even going to use it.
B00CDODST6|5|This is one of my favorite purchase's becuse not only is it a useful product, it has helped to make me more organized and freed up space. I have it mounted on the wall and it beautifully displays all my bottles of nail polish. The only thing I would disagree with is the fact that they claim it holds 40 bottles of polish. If the bottles are small or skinny then yes it would but not if the bottles are Orly size. There are 4 shelves so that would be 10 bottles per shelf but my bottles are mostly OPI or other brands of bottles that size & I can only get 9 bottles in a row. My top shelf has odd sz smaller bottles so there yes I can get 10 bottles mybe even 11 if I stagger then like forward, back, forward & back. All in all I love this product was just the right size for me and would recommend it. The acrylic is sturdy and came with screws for mounting. i mounted it myself within miniutes.
B0009MGBHU|5|I received the expected item on time and as I had this product before I can tell that it is authentic and original.
B011J25HPK|2|I had such high hopes for this callus remover but it just isn’t that good.  I was hoping it would work better than some of the other callus removers out on the market and the truth is….it doesn’t, much to my dismay.<br /><br />When I got the unit I read the instructions and then put batteries in it.  I was excited to use it because living in the desert my feet get pretty dry and cracked from the dryness and the heat.  I started with the hard skin blade as it directed and after about 10 minutes my foot didn’t look any different.  So I figured I would got to the next step, the smoothing blade.  The smoothing blade does smooth the top layer of skin but that is all it does.  I didn’t even bother using the buffer because I felt it was a waste of time and effort because at this point I had already spent 15 minutes or more on just one heel without much improvement.<br /><br />If you are looking for a product to just smooth out your feet then this will work for you but if you are looking for a product to actually remove calluses as the name state then I wouldn’t suggest this product.<br /><br />I have received this product at a discounted price to provide an honest review.
B001BMIOV8|1|I'm definitely not impressed with this item.
B00158J0EI|5|never been better
B004Z209HS|4|I wanted to get off my acne medication cold turkey and just use coconut oil.  It was so greasy!  I just got this and my skin soaks it right up!  Hoping this will be easier in my pores!
B005T306QG|5|I love Zum bars, they smell heavenly, are good for your skin and you can even wash your hair with them.  After a shower the house smells fresh and clean, too.  I store them in clothing drawers and my clothes smell wonderful.  Zum Bars are worth the price and make great gifts.  You and your house will smell good, and so there you save a bundle by not using perfume, room sprays and drawer sachets.  Shipping was fast and trouble-free.  [[ASIN:B005T306QG Indigo Wild: Zum Bar Goat's Milk Soap, Dragon's Blood 3 oz]]
B00OVG34ZC|5|Amazing! Definitely works. My hair in two months has grown a lot. In addition it looks healthier, even with the whole styling I do!
B002R2AX9W|3|It was a good purchase but I took it on vacation and the shadow started to break up and fall apart quickly.
B00L2SZDVU|5|I used this on my 7, 5 and 5 month old daughter in Florida sun and it worked very well! My 7 year old and baby has very fair Skinand would burn eAsily and we didn't have a problem with this product! They say to stay out of the sun from<br />10-2 because the sun is the worst I think that's why a lot of people get burnt so bad!
B001MKRQBS|1|DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!
B008JWW5K4|4|Love the brushes!
B0082D9VD4|5|Best full coverage foundation. It hides all imperfections and does not dry out skin. Leaves skin looking fresh and lasts all day.
B000BIXP62|5|It left my hair so soft and shinny. It worth the money. Of course you have to take vitamins and collagen to help from the inside.
B0029U0YKA|1|Not at all worth the money.
B00BD4S1D0|5|Love the fact it came in Fast!!!!<br />looks great and the color . Piece looks like it will last for ever. Good quality
B00EW6RVG4|5|BEAUTIFUL COLOR!
B002QY86BI|3|I have shiny nails but the buffer didn't last every long. So yay to shiny nails but boo to my buffer not lasting long enough to see the fruits of its labors.
B0044Y51UW|4|works great
B006T8ITSC|5|I love John Frieda products, I use this to keep my hair even toned between appointments, sometimes I alternate in the summer with the high lightening version, to add extra definition.
B005FYJB92|5|Love it
B0053L2E1O|5|Bigger than I thought it would be.  Just use a knife and cut off a piece at a time.  Great for skin issues.
B008AIXTKC|5|Great product for blond hair
B00CSUSXNG|3|Not great!
B00006ANDK|3|I had bought these before.  They are gentle on the gums.  They work as expected. They are reliable. I trust the brand.
B00QJ4YL10|5|Fits my phone (Droid Turbo) and it holds just enough for what I wanted. Only use when I go on trips so I don't have to carry as much. Works perfectly for me, but I definitely wouldn't use this as a daily wallet due to being so small.
B007Z400PO|3|I actually did an experiment where I used this on one half of my face for a week and saw absolutely no difference in: skin tone, appearance of wrinkles, blemishes, undereye circles, etc.  Maybe it takes a longer; maybe moisturizers make an overall lifetime difference (or not); or maybe it's just ...meh.  My skin is neither dry nor oily, and I didn't notice a difference in my skin's moisture content, nor did it cause breakouts.  I can't tell that it did anything at all.<br /><br />I've been using this semi-regularly as a nightly moisturizer for several months just because I have it now, and it seems to work the same as cheaper (all natural) body moisturizers.<br /><br />As a side note, I did also purchase the Watts Beauty Argan oil, and I do see a difference when using that.  With the argan oil, my face 'glows' and it appears to plump out wrinkles, though the effect is only temporary.
B00J64IX9Q|5|good
B00XKTT8Y2|5|Love this little cute brush, soft and useful, prefect for my mustache care, just as expected, price and product good combination?
B006QO4C5S|5|This lamp delivers! I thought that I would have to skimp on features to save money. NOT SO! I waited a few months before I reviewed just to make sure that the lamp would work. I shellac my nails (and toes) twice a month. I even do others nails. The timer is a plus. I'm so glad I got this one. The fact that its pink just put it over the top for me.
B000GCVWL8|4|I live loreal products. The smell is really good, I also like to share it with my daughters from time to time
B0013TXFFY|5|I purchased this for a family member had has sensitive teeth. According to her, this product worked wonders with her sensitive teeth, so based on that fact alone, I am giving this product 5 stars.<br /><br />Note that this product isn't actually a toothpaste that you're supposed to brush/clean your teeth with. It's somewhat of a topical gel/cream that you brush on and leave on for a short duration. In the end, you spit it out.<br /><br />Also, a minor thing is that the product doesn't come in the package shown above. The box is actually the white box without the green. The product is essentially the same, but I was confused as to what the difference was between the two products.
B00G8OQODY|4|Can I use it as a whitening cream?
B000NLS1MK|2|I love the scent of the cologne and I can't detect it at all in any of the three bars I received.  It smells very faint--inoffensive, like motel courtesy soap.  Nothing at all like Florida water.  Looking at all the positive reviews, I can only hope I got a bad batch.<br /><br />At least it still works as soap, though.  No problems on my skin, just a mild, boring soap..
B00A0MBBW4|5|Great variety in this set. Works quite well.
B000VOJOLQ|5|Great product, easy process and fast delivery.
B00CYA5E1O|5|good~! Excellent~!!
B004GTG1GI|5|Nice facial serum, absorbs quickly & instantly moisturizers the skin .<br />I recommend this item
B00005BY8W|5|The Germ Doctor stays on my counter and I regularly toss in my daughter's belongings to provide an extra cleaning step. When the dog gets a toy or a pacifier rolls under the couch, I feel confident those germs aren't getting into her mouth. She gets enough germs on her own...why add to it? And when she was recently sick I would rotate her toys and pacifiers in the Germ Doctor so she wouldn't be reinfecting herself with the same germs. I haven't found it to get too hot or melt any of the items I have placed in it and it's a lot easier than boiling or running another load of laundry. It is a no-brainer sanitizer that gives me peace of mind.
B008DYOABA|5|Both my daughter and I use this shampoo. My daughter relaxes her hair and I am one year into the relaxer to natural journey. I love this shampoo
B003YMJJSK|5|I feel good
B0045K006K|5|It works exactly as advertised and I really like using it.  My teeth feel really clean after using the Spinbrush.
B008PF3UO0|5|This product does just what it says and I saw a difference overnight. I use this for my brazilian. It does not irritate my skin. It reduces any bumps overnight and after a few days of daily use (once a day) the bumps are completely gone and I have even notices a reduction in ingrown hairs. I would recommend this product to any and everyone that shaves or waxes.
B004GSR4KG|4|One tube really goes a long way, and with Amazon's discounted price this toothpaste is definitely a worthy investment.  I will comment, however, that the flavor is not quite the same kind of cinnamon found in cinnamon candies, nor will your breath smell as though you've been chewing on a cinnamon stick. The aroma itself is perplexing, but I know for a fact it's not cinnamon. I did not find it unpleasant (and in contrast, I find a low-key flavor more compatible with breakfast than something overpoweringly minty).  Flavor aside, the toothpaste on your dry toothbrush somewhat glides onto your teeth with normal application. After a few brush strokes, however, it does foam with your saliva.  It really works as advertised: It did not make my teeth feel sensitive. I can eat and drink cold items without feeling pangs in the same why other bleaching toothpastes have.  As for the whitening, it works to lighten maybe a few shades at the most. I noticed some improvement around 2 weeks after use, but I worry this may have been a placebo effect. By now (one month later), my teeth does look as though it got two shades lighter, and it also seems that this may be the limit to its lightening properties. I have considered that with my complexion (Asian), my teeth will not look as bright as if my skin was maybe more tan to produce a contrast. In addition, golden tones may accentuate yellow hues, even if they were not that noticeable on another person. Regardless, this is definitely a natural improvement to my teeth before using Supersmile.
B00FRI8MLE|5|It doesn't have a nutty smell like a lot of other brands, this means it is very pure and fresh.<br />This is high quality.
B001TNWRQ2|5|A very different smelling perfume.  A lot of smells meld together for me in regards to perfume. If you want to stand out, wear this. Gingerbread smelling, but deeper.
B002BH3L9M|1|It is fine.
B004I79GYM|5|The only natural deodorant I've used that works and I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. The smell isn't awesome but for the lack of aluminum and parabens I'll take it. It lasts a good 16+ hours and I've very happy with it.
B00GMPSQ3U|2|Too expensive for what you get.  Don't notice a difference.
B00M9CS3KQ|5|the price was very reasonable. the seller shipped it by express mail. wow. and i love endless weekend. it has become my favorite scent.
B003EDFK00|5|Thank you
B0006VGZFC|5|easy to use
B009H17ODE|5|Works well.
B00S5HIZZC|5|Cleared my skin somewhat ! Amazing natural product ! Better than soaps with chemicals
B0009OAHVY|2|I have actually returned this perfume because it did not smell like other bottles of Angel I have purchased.  It was sent to me in a timely fashion, and appears to be the product I purchased, but it does not smell the same at all.  The bottle looks the same, but it definitely isn't what I expected.
B0006NXZVW|3|I purchased this mainly because I have large pores and was hoping this would tighten them up.  I honestly don't see a difference between before using this product and after.  As many reviewers have commented, it does tingle when it is on and a little goes a long way with this product.  It smells good but I find the scent overpowering - it makes my eyes water.    I love Burt's Bees products but I don't think I will be buying more of this when my jar is used up.
B001AJD0UM|4|This is my first electric shaver and I have to say, I'm amazed at how good it is. Kind of wished there was a carrying case with it though.
B0047ZUSK6|5|I was really skeptical, but I read all of the reviews and thought I'd risk it.  I have a lot of very dark coarse hair and very fair skin (some would call it fish-belly white).  My skin is also kind of sensitive.  This think WORKS.  I'm so psyched.  I'm not done yet; it's going to take a couple more treatments to finish, but as of now I have a lot less hair and what's left tends to be finer than what was there before.  I wish I'd tried it years ago.
B000YDMM54|5|excellent quality heats fast and will really work just like the ones in the salon
B006QPWXCG|5|This is probably the best foot product I've used.  It smells wonderful and makes your feet very soft.
B000ULRDJU|5|Highly recommend this product. Nice product to put in prior to drying/styling. My hair is somewhat freezy and color damaged.
B00N44CRAU|4|It's ok and meet my expectations.
B0094G3LS4|5|Perfect with my skin tone! Very happy!
B0009ET4PE|5|Smells amazing and makes my hair feel soft and detangled. It's nice to finally find a vegan cruelty free product that doesn't make your hair feel like crap.
B008OPK8EQ|5|I love Toji!  I am on my 6th bottle.  I do have new hair growth.  The company has awesome customer service.  They sent me one free bottle just to keep trying it.  It is also a good all round multiple vitamin for women.  You can't lose. . ..especially your hair!  I now have new one inch hairs around my temples where I was losing and also new hair in my part!  Go for it!  I was using Nioxin and it's no longer available.  I tried this and I am glad I did!
B000U08ZN4|5|This toothbrush is awesome! I went to the dentist recently and they said my teeth have never looked better, it's a fantastic product and well-worth the money.
B000IMNMXM|5|Got this product along with other Korres products for my aunt who is Greek. This is a Greek product. It smells great, is mostly natural and suds well. Definitely a higher end shower gel!
B007SZCG0C|5|I was amazed how clean this product got my hair, it took out all the residue left from my salon shampoos and conditioners. My hair was shiny and looking great. The real test was checking my drain screen and I found no hair in it which means I didn't shed any.
B0088GT7RA|5|Covers the Gray. Easy to use.  My stylist uses the same product.  Will buy more.  Use with at least 30 developer.
B003C1CWWI|4|I like the brush but it broke it half.  For the price it should not break.
B000WJ5XNI|5|Loved this product, have been using it for a couple years now and I dont know what I have done without it.  it manages my fly aways so well and actually maintains my hair longer in between salon visits.  I use it for blowing drying and once a day or once every other day to maintain.  Love it.  a little goes a loooong way
B001B0TJCI|1|Very disappointed with this product. It is so heavy when I suction cupped it to my mirror, I thought my door to my medicine cabinet (where my mirror is located) was going to break off its hinges. Then, it falls off when I try to put my hair dryer in it. My dryer fell in the sink and broke. It also does not fit my Vidal Sassoon flat hair dryer. The arm is very rigid and does not allow for repositioning the dryer. Last, it is very hard to store as it is so big and bulky. Not using it anymore. TOO INCONVENIENT!
B00E0FW1IU|1|I ALWAYS USE COTY AIR SPUN FACE POWER, HONEY BEIGE. When I received this powder I noticed it was lighter than the one  I have now.I don't know if the manufacture is making it lighter or what I should do. It looks like they don't make a lot of shades I use to use. Are they going to quit making this item? Can't find it in any stores where I live.
B00IA78NSQ|5|Love it!
B002WTC370|5|I love this stuff. They got a bad rap awhile back when they had a bad batch (it happened to me too...). I used it one time and all the pressure escaped, but I called and they took full responsibility and admitted the problem. But its a great product and a great price, and I had never had a problem before or since.
B0000ZHOEU|4|I found this company and their products while at Mayo Clinics in Rochester MN. I have very sensitive reactive skin.<br />I have used the lotion for years and like it especially in summer<br />I just bought this cleanser instead of my usual Whole Foods purchases. I find many Health Food Products contain too many herb and flower extracts. I have to avoid citric acid and salicylic acid as I break out in excema with them. I  try to avoid parabens.<br />I use La Roche Posey products for my super sensitive face and this on my body.<br />My only reason for 4 stars: small bottle, large amount of product it takes esp if using a wash cloth and minimal lathering. My well water is currently very soft and this barely lathers. If you like it be sure to look at the 32 oz refill bottles.<br />I will try something else next time.
B0040YRFAK|5|Liked Queen.  Loved queen of Hearts.  it is softer<br />And stays with you much longer.  It is not one of those colognes that go into the room before you and it does not go stale on your body.Try it.  You<br />Will like.If you like a vanilla scent,  try Queen.It's<br />Stronger,but I got many compliments when I wore it.It makes a statement.
B002JPJ2ZS|2|I've only been using this product for a month but I don't see any improvement.  My hair actually seems to be getting thinner not thicker.  I'll stick with it for the three month period that they suggest and hope that I don't go bald first.  But I honestly don't see any difference in my hair
B003UKR67M|5|I am using this brush since 2007 !!! I am impressed !! Its still working , I am just changing a head , that it  ! Best brush ever !!!
B002GENWU8|5|Worked fast and great!
B0029UJUZA|3|I like the smell, and it bubbles nicely, but when I received it the soap had leaked out and the cap doesn't work.
B00457UCUM|5|works very well
B006TH9LXU|3|Little flimsy in its construction.  A wireless, rechargeable version would be ideal.  For the price though, it gets the job done.  Slight learning curve may apply when attaching the pressurized cans of foam, take caution and wear  proper PPE.<br />Thanks
B003UBTYKI|5|The EXACT size of my toothbrush brand and the electric toothbrush does a much better cleaning of my teeth. Thank you.
B000FGDID0|5|Love it
B00A6Z6OU4|3|No good allergy my face
B00I073WLE|5|I use this every day!
B001E76BG0|4|Good Quality, doesn't last any longer then the Mach 3's do though. I do like the razor blade on top, makes shaving under my nose a lot easier.
B005ET4MFQ|5|This is really great concealer.  Easy to apply, blends well, looks natural.  No scent, either, which is important to me.
B00I32AN4K|5|Moisturizing!!!
B004LGX7XG|5|I'm an &#34;enhanced&#34; redhead. My natural color is a strawberry blonde that darkened over the years into a muddy looking brownish red. I prefer my hair to be true red, so I color it. I'm somewhat of a product snob and only use salon quality products on my hair. I was a bit skeptical about this product, having never heard of it, but I am so glad that I tried it. I am nearing 5 weeks since my last color and my red is vibrant and rich, thanks to Tressa Watercolors Shampoo. I purchased both Fluid Fire and Liquid Copper and mixed them together because I felt that would be the best for my particular color (my colorist customizes my color by using a &#34;true red&#34; with a copper). I will continue to use Tressa Watercolors instead of my more expensive Pureology Ravishing Red line products. Pureology has a color depositing conditioner that is way more pricey for only 4 small vials of product. It does a great job as a conditioner but doesn't do a whole lot for enhancing the color. I'm very pleased with this purchase and will tell my colorist about it so that she can share with her other redheads! I'm sure it would be great for natural reds as well.
B00F5TR1I0|5|Loved it! It looks just like it does on the picture. Comes with lots of space and it arrived fast!
B00R3HQD9A|5|Love these brushes
B007ROD2P2|3|The steamer is made very cheap.  The steamer arm doesn't adjust high enough to have the steam at least a foot away from the client's face.  It's the same height as the top of the table which is below the client's face.  Also the arm won't adjust right so the client has to turn their head.  The facial table I use is a standard height as well.  The only reason I'm keeping it is because I used my old steamer stand to put it in, so at least the steam is a foot higher than the client's face.  I bought another one and I just received it today.  I'll know how it is when I have time to put it together later.  I used a site called ShopSalonCity.com.  If I didn't just happen to have a stand it fit into I would of had to send it back as it is not adjustable to a standard height facial bed.  Another review said it only worked for 3 months and then broke.  I sure hope that isn't true!
B009A33V9K|5|Love this fragrance!!  Refreshing and clean.  I've been using Maja for more than 20 years!
B00S2G7D68|5|As with all the other Tree of Life Skincare products that I have tried I am not disappointed at all!  This is a really nice size bottle and since it is such a thick cream a little bit goes a long way so this bottle is going to last me quite a while.  I had emergency gallbladder surgery about 3-4 months ago and it has left me with some pretty nasty scars on my stomach as they were more worried about getting in there and getting my gallbladder out and taking care of some other things the gallbladder had messed up.  I have tried many different scar creams over the last 3 months and I can honestly say that this one is the nicest formula I have found!  I really like how thick it is and how well it coats my scars and leaves them looking more hydrated since we know that the dryer the scars the longer it takes them to fade.  I also really like that this cream doesn't have a strong scent on it at all.  Actually I had to apply a small amount to the back of my hand and put it right under my nose to smell the cream at all which totally pleases me as fragrance tends to dry out your skin and scars even more causing it to take longer to heal!  I am super excited to see the results of using this cream on a longer term basis to see how it lightens my scars.  I will update my review after about a month of using this product to show if there has been any change in the look of my scars!  I did receive this product for free in order to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  All opinions shared in this review are solely my own.  I absolutely love how quickly this cream soaks into my skin and there is absolutely NO greasy feel at all!.  It definitely leaves my skin around my scars and the scars themselves very moisturized after application.  As I have only been using this cream for a short time I can not yet tell if there is any change in the color of my scars but they are definitely not as dry and they I can tell that they aren't as swollen as they were before I started using this product.  I can't wait to see the results in about another month!
B001BODO5C|4|I like this flat iron. The only thing I would say is that it takes a little longer than I'd like to straighten my bangs. I think that's cuz of the bigger size of the 1.5 inch plates. Still like it though. It gets really hot.
B007004PZO|5|It really works clears your complextion up n gets rid of acne marks n scares I love this stuff even bought it a few times then right before I run out I purchase another one. Now I can't live with out it!
B000C1ZDTU|5|Use this perfum since first on market. Light, inviting fragrance, just love it!
B0086LC47M|5|Love the glitter. Wish there were a bigger color variety though . a lot of repeat colors
B000QYEK88|5|Just received this razor today and I have had my first shave with it already and it was good.  Nice weight to the razor heavy in the hand don't need to add any additional pressure to shave my rough bread. So far to early to give a full honest review I will update later once I have a lot more shaves. But first impression was nice.
B001ET72G6|5|I loved almay
B004B8AZH0|1|This was my last purchase of these high priced blades. My recommendation is to buy an old fashioned double edge razor and experiment with double edged blades from various makers until you find one that you like. You'll save a bunch.
B002K5SWA8|4|I like the product.... I am not sure how its working exactly as I have only been using it for about a month. but its doing something because my gums are no longer sensitive and don't bleed too much... It's hard to tell if its the product alone that is working but my gums and receding gum problem is slowly healing.. i wash my teeth with Colgate triple action toothpaste, then use Arm & Hammer baking soda in the palm of my hand and massage it in with my tooth brush, then swish with it then I take a full spoon of coconut oil. Then after i dry my mouth and teeth a little i apply the Gengigel product with a cotton swab... So could be a combination of all these things working but its working... It's all that matters :D
B00B2IFY2S|5|j adore
B002JPJ2ZS|5|I have been doing hair for 7 years now, and I always gave Biotin such high praise for actually thickening the hair after continued usage...along with slightly faster hair growth. Biotin is no wonder pill, but it works pretty well when you're good about taking it everyday. Unfortunately, the hard truth is that with most supplements (even viviscal)...it's going to take extended usage to see results. For women who are past menopause...much longer as your hormones (which control hair growth) are depleted greatly.  ONTO the the GOOD stuff.  Viviscal works a good bit better than Biotin with regular usage. I have been using it for a mere 5 weeks and the growth is...kind of shocking to be honest. I didn't expect it to work so fast. Let me also tell you all that I am 29 yrs old, and do not have thinning hair problems. I started taking it because I cut 5 inches off of my hair that I want back more than anticipated. I can NOT begin to tell you all how much hair is growing. I had a small hole of missing hair in my brow that I over tweezed that is finally growing back after almost a year (gasp!) of not growing. Its kind of weird to be honest.  Also- my leg hairs are growing twice as fast...which is not fun. This is just 5 weeks. Like I said, for older women who are pre or post menopausal, I doubt it will pack as much of a punch. Unfortunately, getting older means less hair growth, and there is no miracle pill to naturally fix that...yet.  My hair DEFINITELY feels thicker at the base after just 5 weeks, and it's not placebo effect. Trust me..it is so much thicker.  Just be vigilant about using the stuff...like any supplement. Also keep in mind that if you are a thin haired individual naturally, that it might take longer to notice.  I have told about a dozen clients about it...that is how much I love the stuff. I say try it for 3 months before you knock it. 3 months equals about 3/4 inches of hair growth for slow growers and 1 1/2 inches for fast growers. if your hair is growingslightly faster than what your average is, then its working. 3 months is a good base to see a difference and measure it.  IT totally works!
B003VDED4M|4|Great shade love this ! ! .
B0000ZHH5G|5|This has been a healing miracle for my daughter! She has eczema and suffers from hives and rashes and this is the only product that we have found that does not burn her skin. It is a fantastic, non-greasy cream that is ultra moisturizing and healing.
B003ATS2QC|5|Straightfoward and simple. No fluff, no stuff. No bells and whistles. No need to let &#34;calibrate&#34; after putting the batteries in. just step on and step off, the display will even leave the number of your weight up for another few seconds. If you don't need to know your bone density or other bull then get this very simple and yet stylish bathroom scale.<br />It has a slim frame and is fairly light. The directions do request that you store it on the ground as if you were to step on it at any time, but it doesnt take up much space anyways.<br />Takes 4 AAA batteries which are provided in the box.
B000RFS118|5|The Andis Professional is an excellent built trimmer. I use it for dry shaving due to my skin. It has a sharp enough blade for shaving.  I also use it for spring up my mustache and goatee.
B004GIMUL4|5|Just what I wanted.
B0049LUI9O|5|Works better than expected.
B004Z40048|3|Waited more than a month , and look nothing like the picture . they look super fake and my package came all crushed like wtf
B000052YOB|5|I burn my self in the stomach area and it look like never happend. It's a great product for you skin and for other scars.
B0009DT39C|4|Does its job
B008EL1YFM|5|No compliants, quick shipping. Product was as it was describe
B006COAVXY|5|I've tried the cloth with the gel insert and they curl up and fray. I used to use the Dr. Scholl's corn pads and they work fine but are not reusable. These work perfectly for me for placing between my little toe and the next. Work like the Dr. Scholl's, but are reusable, washable, and durable.
B000C1Z63I|5|This is my favorite fragrance...  I love it and get compliments on it all the time from women and men alike.
B003UKM9CO|4|My last one was much better. A display showing the time brushed & happy face at the two minute mark.<br />It also had a gum setting, sensitive area setting and polish settings. Missed the frills. It does the job and hesitates every thirty seconds so you can time it.
B006KXA7EU|1|If you used snooki like me just got done w/one so opened this (odd had big piece clear tape over top of it) and NO this is not SNOOKI, I demand refund or reporting this, do NOT order here people serious I Warned you if you did and get what I did.<br />This place should be banned, SCAM. Karma will get them.<br />The Real Snooki is the Best! Order elsewhere.
B001395UHA|5|I am new to this product and i have only used it twice, so I am no expert,  but application was easy it worked.
B0009Q1HR0|3|The research on the ingredients seems strong and shows that the product helps work against under eye puffiness. I am not sure how it is meant to work against dark circles. <br /> <br />I would suggest looking at the PRESCRIBEDsolutions' eye serum instead. Available only from doctors, it has the same anti-puffiness complex but it also uses Vitamin K, Arnica and other ingredients so that the overall benefits of using are broader.
B0093OHLM4|5|I ordered this just to try it out thinking it may be the same as the other &#34;popular, trendy&#34; fat burning supplement.  I take one first thing in the morning and I usually do well until around 10:30 AM.  I may try taking one before dinner since my vacation in around the corner.  This seller shipped my product three days before the tracking said I would receive it also.  Great purchase for me.
B0067F8BBM|5|It was worth getting this its all great:)!i liked it all all the brushes work good nd r very soft.
B003OEXURY|5|Had tried the previous version, and was anxious to replace.<br />This scrub certainly lives up to my expectations.<br />Very pleased.
B00J2AP9F0|5|Alright so I have tried a lot of razors, I typically go for the cheaper brands because I didn't think there was enough difference between a cheap razor and higher priced razor to warrant the extra money, boy was I wrong!  I received my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette as a promotional item to try and review and I've got to say, I love it!<br /><br />I have very coarse facial hair and when I buy razors I use them once, maybe twice if I am feeling daring, and then throw them away.  Not the case with this razor, I am on my 3rd shave and it is just as smooth as can be with no pulling or razor burn on my neck which some razors will do on the first use.  I love how this leaves my skin baby smooth virtually on the first pass and the way the head of the razor moves with the contours of my face is amazing!  I saw the commercials and thought it was just another gimmick, boy was I wrong!
B0081ZIIBO|5|The cleansing foam is really gentle and it smells good. After using my face feel fresh and not oily anymore.
B0095IMNI0|5|I feel like I have just left the dentist's office every morning and night! Love it.
B004BPVF7W|5|Excellent
B004D8MC2E|5|I love this shampoo is so soft and leaves my hair so soft and smooth, and its not oily at all even after the oil treatment its a great price!
B004C7U9GW|3|I ordered this with the Rose Water per the recommendation of all the reviews. I tried mixing the clay with water to use as shampoo and I either spill it all over because there's too much water or there's clumps of clay all over my head because I didn't use enough water. After I rinse, I used Moroccan oil all over my hair because it's a tangly mess and it makes your hair very dry. After I blow dried, my hair was so full of static and heavy that I ended up just putting it in a bun. I showered the next day using regular high-end S&C and my hair still feels like there's some sort of paste all over it and like a horse's mane. Let me note, normally I have long, thin, normal, shiny, weightless, flowy hair.<br /><br />The smell and concept seems great, but apparently I'm doing something wrong.
B003QYFVRY|5|Got this for my daughter and she is very pleased.  She also has a similar gadget, but your's uses sound, which i think is unique.
B0096BGGCK|5|The barrette I received from this company is beautiful and very well made. The photo was a good representation of the product. I will order from this company in the future.
B001DKQ47E|1|This did not work properly in my Conair 2-sided makeup mirror with touch control. It doesn't respond to the touch control to go through the 3 levels of power, and I have to unplug it to turn it off.
B0000DJEJN|1|I have been very disappointed with the Quattro and will switch to a different razor once I use all the cartridges.  Though the shave is good with new cartridges, I have a great deal of trouble cleaning the hairs out from between the blades.  Hot water from my faucet simply isn't enough.  With former razors (Ultrex twin blade), a pass along the edge with a toothpick would do it easily, but the vertical wires on the blades make it impossible to clean these cartridges efficiently, resulting in my having to spend a lot of extra time cleaning them or keep changing cartridges, which really increases the expense.  Maybe someone with a hotter water setting would have better luck.
B003U8ESI4|2|Didn't hold a charge for very long.<br />Not a good trimmer when trying to get close to the edge of your goatee
B0013JHGPO|3|Just ok. My nail polish still peeled & chipped on the 4th day. But im givin it 3 stars because it is 2 days longer than they normally chip but i was hoping for at least a week when i used CND top coat as well.
B0018BTB6Y|5|I love this product because it is unscented. I've used it for years. It doesn't dry my hair out like other hair sprays do.
B0066YIUOW|4|I give Hawleywood's No. 9 Bay Rum 4 stars. The price is pretty high for only 4 oz. It comes in an old school glass bottle if that means anything to you.<br /><br />The scent is similar to Dominica but more artificial. Some people say this has a cloves smell but I'm not sure. There's no glycerin so it isn't tacky like Master. The scent is quite light and doesn't last long. The majority of bay rums don't last long though. There is no serious burn from this aftershave, I'd say mild/medium. I'm glad the bottle has a stopper so not too much comes out/gets wasted. I've found the label to be a little slippery and almost dropped it several times with both wet and dry hands, at the price it is that's a pretty big concern to me.<br /><br />Ingredients are: SD Alcohol 40, Water, Sucrose, Octacetate, Bay Oil, FD&C Yellow No.5<br /><br />You don't have to listen to rockabilly (1950's rock and roll) to use this stuff. The label is pretty hip/cool. Not a must-buy but still worthy of your money if you like bay rum.<br /><br />Hawleywood's is included on my Listmania list of over 40 different bay rum aftershaves if you want to check it out. People are always searching for bay rum and talking about it so I thought I'd do a roundup to help people out and let them know what is out there.
B004ML689A|4|The Secura Hot & Cool Facial Steamer arrived timely. It was just what I needed for my mobile spa business. Love the steam and mist. Very easy to use. LIght weight and portable. Haven't used the aroma therapy yet but that was one of the reasons I purchased the steamer. I recommend it highly!!!! The fact that you can use tap water was a plus also. My clients really enjoyed it.
B00IYDFUGO|1|It's white and ugly a pale white
B0096SPYW6|5|The black inks i had tried before were crap, but intenze is amazing. I can make a very very very small line and it will stay perfectly
B005HGWH26|4|It definitely reduces my urge to bite my nails, but it also transfers onto everything.  Even lightly wiping off your mouth can wind up getting this nasty taste on your lips.  It's definitely pretty hard to live like this, but hopefully within a week or two I won't need it anymore.
B002N5MI2S|4|I am not an expert on hair wax, but this felt very thick to me. It worked nicely when my hair was short (1-3 inches) but i stopped using it when my hair got longer because it just didn't result in a good look in my opinion.
B00B33XMEY|5|AAAAAA +++
B004L4EING|5|Great stater kit.
B005QZXM0E|5|I love this product! I love the amount of glitter it provides. I work on stage sometimes and I always get compliments. Revlon! Sell more and in more colors!
B00KN1EMVE|5|Amazing!!!!
B003YJAZZE|5|I am 30 and this is my first electric shaver....never even tried one before.  Was always hesitant they would not give a close shave, but this Series 7 proved me wrong.  I usually shave at the sight of any facial hair and I hated always having to lather up and use a razor.  I kept telling myself with the money I spent on Schick Hydro razor heads In a year I could have bought an electric shaver.  Just had my first shave with the Series 7 and my skin feels good and smooth. Hope the shaver lasts awhile!
B003UKM90Q|5|This was our second electric toothbrush.  We have been very happy with this Oral-B product and will continue to purchase this inexpensive one over the years.
B004SHFSX0|5|this is good price with very nice quality, not less than any those brand names, i like it a lot
B00GXHKF7M|5|Great wig. It has the tendency to tangle like all straight hair does but nothing a lil wig spray or oil couldn't fix. Fits and looks just like the picture. Not too bad, for the price.
B0015KHMRS|5|I loved the first I purchased so much, I went ahead and purchased another.  I don't use much of it considering how much comes in the small package, but what I do use, I like very much.
B0002Y5LQM|5|This product was recommended to me by my parents who have both, like many Californians had to have suspicious spots removed from their skin. I've started using this in the past year and its great. It does not cause breakouts. I work out with it on and it does not burn the eyes or run. I recommend it for everyone...use on sunny days, foggy days, overcast days to protect your skin. Worth every cent.
B002BWOY70|5|I have dry aging skin and hoped this product would smooth out those tell tale marks. This lotion absorbs into my skin and does not feel &#34;greacy&#34;. My skin feels and looks younger and is as the name says, wrapped in moisture, my dry skin is gone! Also appreciate the no perfume, fragrance free quality. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensativities to fragrance or very dry skin.
B003IRS450|2|This broke soon after I received it and doesn't have any elastic pull anymore.  Also, the beads starting falling off.  Looks good, but not worth buying,
B003G42Y6A|5|great product!
B00141DEAC|5|Don't skip this because you've tried all the other sucky $10-$20 battery operated trimmers and hated them.  This one actually works and is a treat to use.  Highly regret not buying it sooner.  This unit makes all the other companies offering the 'contribute to the islands of ocean trash' ones seem like the devil spawn.  In fact, I'll probably mail my two most recent pieces of garbage that I haven't tossed yet back to Phillips or Remington or whomever.  With a lovely holiday card. To their corporate headquarters.  Registered mail, signature required.
B000C230GM|1|This bottle of \\"something\\" smells vaguely like Quelques Violletes, but you'd better smell fast because the fragrance loses it's potency so quickly. Smart move Amazon not to allow returns because you'd get every bottle back. I am sooo disappointed because I love this perfume so much.
B008Z91MGE|5|I love these, my clients love these, and they came on time! Just beware that they get glitter everywhere.
B00BBFH240|5|So I had REALLY BAD acne cysts probably around 5 on each cheek and a huge one on my temple. In 2 months of using it it has eliminated them completely. Right now all I have are redmarks but that will leave if you use NATURAL ORGANIC products to feed your skin AFTER on acnotin. I bought 2 of these 3 packs and might buy another one to have a 40mg dosage because 20mg wont do it.
B00D82KKPW|5|good for hair body lips u name it. many uses one bottle
B000C1Z6K6|5|THIS IS THE GENUINE PRODUCT
B004LTYLF6|5|I never use soap and Vanicream is not soap. I use this product for body & face..it is fabulous cleanser
B000TXV3UE|4|Really good scent, complements the patchulli well.
B00441ISVO|4|The 50 Ultrasun was used in Thailand and Hawaii once in the morning and lasted all day - with no burning. Great stuff - but must use the 50SPF.
B0077LAJT2|4|Lot a bang for your buck. The blades work real well and leave my face as clean and smooth as I can expect. I would certainly buy these again.
B000BD4T94|5|Great product - love the fact that you can use both gel and lather; it heats in no time and the shave is perfect!  A must have for any man in your life.  Two men in our household and we love it!  I even ordered a second for a gift.  AWESOME!
B005F3VLPU|3|I usually love Vitabath..... the scent was underwhelming.
B00HHR0SYW|4|This is a good vitamin C serum to purchase. It doesn't sting when you use it on your face like others I have purchased, tend to do and it makes your face feel tight after it dries. I recommend it.
B0062K33CE|5|Smells great, and the bottle is much bigger than I expected! Great product for the price. If you do not want to pay $40 for beard oil, but you need something to control your beard, try it out!
B002HWS7NQ|5|Does its job just fine
B004B0U57S|5|It was, at least for me, everything they said.<br />I actually took the time to count them and all 500 pieces were there.<br />None of them where broken, dirty, or unusable.<br />Me being me I couldn't wait to use them and because I didn't have anyone's nails to do at the time I did my own. I love them. And when I run low I will order them again
B00CKZOV9Y|5|All that I expected and more. It fits extremely well!
B003U5039A|3|I bought this, thinking it would only take a few quick sprays to show up with how many blacklights there were around (every light socket in the room was full of them, with a few extra). It ended up taking a pretty long spraying session to get it to show to any degree, and even then the glow wasn't too bright. It did work, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't the highest quality, and with how much you put in to make it work you can definitely see it in regular light.
B000FRWNKS|4|Got this dryer for a trip to England & Ireland and used it in locations ranging from an international chain hotel to a local B&B. With the appropriate plug adapter (I also purchased this reasonably priced set from Amazon: [[ASIN:B00013BL18 Lenmar AC5 World Travel Adapter/Converter Plug Set]]) it worked very well in every location. As some have noted, it is a full-sized dryer so travelers need to keep that size/weight in mind; the folding handle & retractable cord help when packing but it still is a big unit. While I do not have long hair, it is very thick and I need a full-sized dryer...this one, on the low speed recommended for UK use, worked as well as my dryer at home. For me, it was exactly what I wanted and needed.
B005GX1A6O|5|I've tried many brands of shampoos to cleanse my hair and this one is the BEST. Obviously, I need to purchase this on the web because some of the supply stores don't carry it. Hair spray, pollen and basic dust in the air can make your hair seem lifeless, dry feeling and just plain drab but this shampoo is safe to use daily and you will see a difference the first time you use it. Lanza has some great hair products.
B0091W3622|5|I luv It's a 10 products.  Expensive, but has saved my permed + colored hair!  Other people have written about other products, but none compare pricewise.  If it's 3x the price, it BETTER be better.  If u can find anything else that works as well for this price, I'd like to know!
B002HPBF32|5|This is exactly what I needed it to be. I wanted an easy way to test out BB Creams without committing to tons of some product I didn't end up liking.<br /><br />It is four different BB Creams from Skin79 packaged in a box. None of the tubes are all that full, so really it is enough product just to get an idea of what you like or dislike about each of the different creams.<br /><br />I have pretty fair skin (caucasian) and normally buy if not the palest foundation the next shade up (when I bought that stuff, which is almost never).  They all blended into my skin tone with no problem, and judging from the tint of the cream, they would work on people with darker toned skin as well.<br /><br />What appealed to me about the idea of BB Cream was that it had SPF in it (all four in this set are SPF 25) and from other reviews I read it was a good by itself bit of makeup. I am pretty lazy when it comes to a beauty routine (that is possibly the first time I have typed that phrase).<br /><br />I found I could wear most of these without anything else and feel pretty comfortable, and washing my face at night, I could tell from the wash cloth that it stayed on pretty well during the day. It felt light and unlike when I've worn liquid foundation it didn't feel like some painted on mask. It really felt like I had just put on some light cream.<br /><br />1)Gold (VIP Gold Collection)-- I read was better for older skin. It is the thickest of the creams and is meant to cover more fine wrinkles. It was probably my second favorite of the batch, I actually almost bought it before I saw this tester pack, because from reading online it seemed like the best match.<br /><br />2)Hot Pink (Super Beblish Balm Triple Function) -- My favorite of the four. It covered really well and I was the most comfortable wearing it by itself. I liked it not being as thick as Gold.<br /><br />3)Light Pink (Diamond The Prestige)-- still less thick thank Hot Pink. I found this one worked best when I put a powder on top of it. It really held the powder in place during the day.<br /><br />4) Pearl (Pearl Diamond Collection)-- the least useful of the four. It is best probably if you only use it on say your cheeks. It has a shimmer to it, so putting it on say, your forehead..it made me look greasy. However, it would be great as something to put on your cheeks or under your eyes from some fun going out make up.<br /><br />I put all of these on by themselves and also with a layer of powder (Sephora) and blush to test them as stand alone makes ups and foundations. All of them held the other make up in place really well and helped that make up have a really finished look. None of them gave me the cake face I associate with foundation. Overall a worthwhile buy to find the right cream for me.arl (Pearl Diamond Collection)-- the least useful of the four. It is best probably if you only use it on say your cheeks.

B008O4YM4Y|5|This brush works exactly how they say it will. I bought one for each of my daughters, one with long curly hair and one with thick straight hair. It worked very well on both types and the girls are very happy with their brushes. Would definitely recommend.
B0043G7TLK|5|This is the best spray ever made! It is super light weight while providing the best shine. I use it when I flat iron and it is perfect. I also use it to make my natural curls pop. Buy this spray...you can't go wrong.
B000NL0T1G|5|Very satisfied
B0049LUI9O|5|This little item keeps unwanted hair out of many places, and travels really well. Also, has a feature to use while wet, which is pretty handy for grooming and cleaning.
B0012J138G|2|If you're looking for Filling + Sealing Wrinkle product, this one is only \\"ok\\".  But since there's nothing better in the market, you can give it a try.  When initially putting it on, it seems to be doing the job.  But the problem is, it doesn't have staying power.  If your upper lip becomes moist or sweats, it just melts away.  Powdering over the product helps a little, but again, it just doesn't last well enough throughout the day.
B000OYJ9AO|5|I received the product with bad shipment all the lotion was out of the bottle etc but they fixed the problem in a timely manner and I am very impressed!
B0039ZI3KC|5|I love my Hot Tools flat iron. It gets plenty hot for my hair and it doesn't take me near as long to curl my hair as it did with my old curling iron.  My hair type is long (past my shoulders) and fine.  I find it very easy to use.
B00I6DZ3V4|5|I have been using and I am thoroughly loving it...feels creamy and dreamy....just putting on after a long, hard, day...wow...what a superb feeling...
B00KEBCRC4|3|It is a good mascara - but not perceptibly better than less expensive ones. Wonder how the professionals rate these items - as I bought it because it was so highly recommended by other sites as well as Amazon. It is good - but feel there are so many others that are equal or better for less money.
B0091NB71I|5|Works well for me. Does not have too bad of a smell.  Did not excessively dry up my skin/problem area.
B000PY17PI|5|Quick hair drying that adds volume as you dry.  Allows you to keep your arms lower that with standard blow-dryer-and-brush method of styling.  Very durable. Light weight. Low enough price to keep one for travel.
B007V5IVZS|5|This stuff works!  I have eczema and eczema opens the skin to being invaded by staph germs.  CLn gets rid of the germs.  As you probably know,  the treatment of eczema is three prong:  some sort of medicine to calm the inflammation,  some sort of lotion to smooth the skin to keep it moist and soft, and finally, killing the bacteria on your skin.  CLn is the best for this last prong.  So get a good cream (I like neosporine eczema cream or cera ve), a good Rx lotion from your dermatologist that you put on when needed to combat flares, and get Cln.  Doctors often recommend taking bleach baths.  But I hate baths.  Fortunately,  CLn allows you to take a bleach &#34;bath&#34; in the shower. As it is easy to use, you can use it once or twice a day and get results  (I would never take that many baths). The result, for me, has been to get rid of almost all itching within a week and redness within a month.  Of course, it does not cure eczema so flare ups are always possible.  But it gets rid of the major cause of itching.
B00ITGOT7W|5|Arrived quickly and looks great. The kid is wearing it as we speak for a halloween party. Will buy from seller again
B00D8ZOVMW|4|love it!!
B000PRCQP0|5|Perfect! The name says it all and then some! My boyfriend and I appreciate the intense feeling it produces...It is watery BUT doesn't interfere with the pleasure it provides for the both of us! 5 STARS!
B00B76ALVO|4|Love how hot this gets, love the digital display, and love the results. Only complaint is that you really have to cram down on the handles to get a tight squeeze. Wish the flat iron plates were just a bit more perfectly parallel to one another.
B000VPPUEA|5|I had a scar about half the size of a dime right in the middle of my forehead from picking and picking at a pimple. I thought it'd never go away and it made me super super self conscious. I tried everything, including expensive creams and gels from Sephora, and nothing reduced the appearance of my scar. I stumbled upon Bio Oil, and after about 3 months of daily use, the appearance of the scar was GREATLY reduced. You can't see it at all anymore, and I feel so much better about myself!! This product truly worked for me
B004X1QY20|1|Smells really bad.
B0069AHQIY|4|I just ordered my third shipment.  The combo pack really works great and from experience, I can say this is the best hair removal product on the market for men.  It's strong enough to be effective, but without the awful odor some of the other products have.  Another benefit is that the lotion isn't super cold out of the bottle.  I've noticed hair grows back finer than some of the other removal creams as well.  The soothing skin salve is great and I use it for a day or two after application.
B0064WAG84|5|This is my favorite soap and it is very hard to find. It smells SOOOO good and leaves you literally feeling squeaky clean
B002C741MM|5|This trimmer is just great. You can keep your beard at any length you want; from just a hint of stuble to about an inch long. It makes it super easy to maintain your hair at an even length. Its really light weight, and actually feels a little less sturdy than other Norelco razors I own, but it seems to be just as sturdy. I've dropped it a few times and its still like new. Anyway, I would definitely buy this if you want an easy way to maintain your beard.
B00FRDPMNK|5|i love this stuff. it has a reasonable amount of strength, and it doesn't leave my hair looking greasy or oily!
B007G80K8Q|5|This is wonderful and I can't buy it anywhere around here. Thanks !
B0038YW3BY|5|love how small the straightener is, it's perfect for my bangs and fits in my purse! Gets hot really quickly, and works well. Low price too!
B002F34YG6|4|I bought this along with the shampoo. Firstly I have hair that can not stand to go without a conditioner, as it will feel dry and straw like.<br /><br />Why would you want to buy this? it smells awesomely fresh without smelling too feminine. You'll feel clean after using it, even though its just a conditioner. Paired with their shampoo the two work well to keep your hair soft, but I suspect you can have a similar or better effect(with less of a great smell though) for cheaper.
B00C6NH98A|2|I didn't find it to be particularly special.
B007SOIAUS|5|This does lengthen your lashes but you have to have some patience as it takes about 3-4 weeks to see results. I checked the ingredients & this contains progesterone (like latise) which is why it works but also has the issues associated which are redness at the area of placement etc. be sure to place it on evenly or else you can get some uneven growth like I did. The price is amazing considering that most with this active ingredient cost 3-4 times as much.
B003VSH574|5|I love the colors in this palette.  Very rich, and very easy to blend.  Would definately purchase this again.  Also, nice size.  Will last long time.  Delivery was speedy and productr was in perfect condition when it arrived.  Very satisfied with Shany products.
B001N0D8OQ|4|I ordered three of these Golden Delicious candles for my daughter's teachers in lieu of the obligatory red apple.  They arrived in perfect condition and the packaging was great.  I really liked the appearance of them; the containers were good quality and looked really nice.  Unburned they did have a waxy candle smell, but that is probably common for soy candles.  Since they were gifts I cannot comment on the smell when the candle was burning.    Hope this helps :)
B00RWG5H6C|5|This sleep mask has tiny elastic pockets on the side of the band to store ear plugs.  The ear plugs fit very comfortably and help reduce any noise that prevents me from falling asleep.  The outside of the mask is silky smooth, and the interior is made of a breathable fabric.  I like the fact that the sleep mask comes with its own mesh bag for washing so that it's less likely to get snagged on anything else in your wash load.<br /><br />In return for my candid assessment of this product, I received a discount on this product.
B000HLWG0O|5|Love all Bare escentuals products, they are easy to use, and do not irritate my skin.  A little goes a long way.
B00IJNX1KQ|4|goes with all my outfits,, silky and soft . its a good buy...... all white outfit or an all black outfit....... or just mix it up
B000PARERW|5|I've had laser treatments and resurfacing treatments (HUNDREDS of dollars) that did nothing for the deep wrinkles on my chest due to sun damage and sleeping on my side.  Placement was a little difficult at first - getting it just in the right spot so it didn't bother me at night. I find it easier to lie on the bed to position it before I go to sleep.  Try this - it really does work!
B009CP9QVI|5|My soon to be husband, smells AMAZING in this. He wears it all the time. Its very clean. Very manly. Very appealing.<br /><br />Makes me wanna jump his bones. ;)
B00J9TPVK2|5|Works great.
B00BQLIMT8|3|These are great necklaces, but it doesn't fit well around my fat neck.
B00147FGJ8|5|I tanned for almost a month with a different tanning lotion & it seemed like I could not get any further on my tan (which I hadn't got far on in the first place) so I decided to try paint it black and even after the first couple times I tanned, I fell in love. It's given me a great color which is hard for me to get, because I have fair-ish skin that prefers to burn & takes a long time to build a tan! Love it!!
B004AI97MA|5|Leaves skin looking younger and rejuvenated. Nice soft comforting scent. It's amazing that it's not greasy even if it's an oil. Really evens out scars and marks on the skin. Bio-oil leaves you feeling rejuvenated with healthier looking skin.
B00GNH6JZE|5|I love these lashes. They are convenient and easy to apply. They last about two weeks. Having the option for a 3 pack was perfect since they no longer sell them in my town. I had an issue with the delivery but they contacted me and resolved it. Would purchase from again! Thank you!
B00O1WPYDQ|5|very sturdy material really like these hair bands. i have very thick hair and these make my hair stay up in a ponytail all day
B000GREPOY|1|I have used products with Shea butter in it but never pure Shea butter. I just received this and I opened up the tub and this strong diarrhea smell came pouring out of the tub. Is this the way Shea butter is suppose to smell because it is the sickest smell I have ever smelled in my life. I put some on my hands and the smell is deep in my pores. I thought it was suppose to smell nutty and pleasant not like a babies dirty diaper. Maybe it's rancid??
B0049WLP5O|5|Super fun curling rod, pretty simple to use. Includes a glove so no burnt fingers
B007JZ7MVE|4|I really like these masks. I put them on for about a half hour and it significantly reduces any puffiness and swelling around my eyes. You will have to lie horizontally or they tend to slide off, though I have managed to use them sitting up if you push them up every few minutes (of course this is much less relaxing.) My only negative comment is the price on these bad boys, I think they are pretty overpriced. I would probably use them once or twice a week if they were less expensive, but I can't justify the expense and use them before special occasions when I want to look fresh and awake at night. Otherwise, these are probably the best eye masks I have tried. They do much more for the puffiness then the dark circles, though.
B00DBX0H2E|5|I absolutely love the Cologne.
B001ET7ECI|1|Not that effective, and kind of overpriced.  You're better off with the Palladio rice paper instead.<br />Also, way to excessive packaging.
B000J10IRU|5|I've used this product for years and love this line for my skin type.  Best price I could find for this
B000LRL3Z8|5|Strange little tool for cleaning around toenails; but it work really well. It's not sharp, so it shouldn't cut you. However, it has just the right angle for \\"pushing\\" between toenails and the skin around toenails.
B003Z388CQ|5|After years of struggling with cellulite I proudly say that the nightmare is almost over!<br />I purchased this product based on the good reviews it had, and the low cost..Let me tell you I do not regret it one bit! It's been the best $6 I've ever spent!. I use them while watching TV, in the shower ir whenever I can. I think consistency it's key!<br />I have been using the cups for almost 2 weeks once a day (and riding my bike 3 times a week). I could say my cellulite issue is 75% corrected, It's unbelievable!<br />I must warn you that it is a little painful BUT you can control the suction also, I would recommend to use with some type of lubricant (cream, oil, etc).<br />This stuff really works! My husband noticed the difference so I guess the change is visible.
B00II99588|5|used this to repel ants around my house-I live in the country.  This works GREAT for that!  I mixed it with water in a spray bottle where they were traveling most heavily and they pretty much disappeared from there nearly immediately!  I purchased more for keeping them at bay this summer.  Wish I had known this sooner!
B003CP12O8|2|I got to try this product free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, but I must say, after a few weeks, I'm not impressed. My teeth do not feel cleaner, they feel thicker and more sensitive if anything. They also are not whiter by any means! I'm kind of disappointed. I really had high hopes for this as I usually enjoy Crest products.
B000NL0T1G|5|This razor makes me enjoy shaving! I know that sounds a little over the top but honestly one of the best purchases I have made in awhile. I also got the Proraso shaving cream and the Clubman Pinaud after shave and I can honestly say that it has been the best shaving experience I have ever had. Easy to use with no razor burn or cuts!
B007K6CC6C|4|I made the mistake of using one-click to order some items, and ended up paying separate shipping for each item.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice cheerful orange color, poorly named. I like the color very much, but the gold flecks you see in the bottle don't show up when applied. It's opaque and plain - no shimmer, glitter, or anything like that. I'm posting this review because there seem to be so few images online of this color applied (but I did find one at least). It goes on quite nicely in 1 or 2 coats.<br /><br />If you need a nice bright orange for Halloween, this should do very nicely. I intend to use it this winter to keep me cheerful. I made a nice flower on my nail with it that I'm currently enjoying. The orange is a very nice one. (I seem to need a thesaurus here... lol)<br /><br />The weekly sale items on the Sephora site have made up for the initial items I purchased here using one-click and thereby paid too much for.<br /><br />The bottle is .23 oz.<br /><br />I've since also purchased the Vivid Metallic - I would describe it as Copper. Oooo - shiny! - lol This one looks way cool with a couple coats of nails inc. Diamond Nail Jewelry (Burlington Arcade) on top...
B00L4FQVB2|5|Leave my hair a little dry but extremely soft
B00H28V8UO|5|These essential oils are 100% the best quality I have ever bought. I have been a holistic and organic consumer for over ten years and can without a doubt confirm that they are of the best quality. I mainly use them for aromatherapy but my wife loves the lemongrass for cleaning as we have small pets and children and do not want any toxic or unhealthy materials in our home. Top grade essential oils and the best part was that it was a great deal and I would've paid even more for the quality I received.
B000S1P9JI|4|Good product.
B00HA0SN7A|3|Received all colors in product advertisement. The orange color broke on first application and was rendered useless.
B000VSG1PO|5|I ordered from Minoya, fulfilled by Amazon.  There are a lot of previous reviews that state that people are receiving fakes, but it appears as if Amazon has clearly remedied that issue.  The one I received is authentic... and AMAZING.<br /><br />My eyelashes are thick and dark but they stick STRAIGHT forward from my face, parallel to the floor.  I've tried every lash curler in Sephora (yes, EVERY one, even the heated ones, even the Dior heated one, even Tweezerman, etc etc etc), and nothing even comes close to this thing.  It bends my lashes straight up towards the sky and they stay that way all day, even without mascara, until I wash my face at night.  Best beauty purchase of my life.  Seriously.
B00FZESMKG|5|I love this wash.  I have combination skin, also getting a little older and this product is awesome.  First off, it smells great.  But lots of things smell great, but contain too many chemicals.  I've started getting more into botanicals and essential oils and love that this product uses those in its formula.  I like that I can understand what the ingredients of this product are. It also works fantastic, it doesn't dry out the dry areas of my skin or make the oily areas oilier. It is a nice balance.  My skin feels refreshed, clean and not dry or tight.  It lathers well and as stated, a little bit is all you need to really cleanse your face.  It works well for removing my makeup at night.  I'm glad I had the chance to try this product out in exhange for my review.  It is definitely one I'll reorder.
B0039UTO5A|5|The BEST mascara by Covergirl. Length plus non-clumpy volume... What more could you want. I use it every day.
B0053EM5HY|3|Just a annoying thing to work with, I noticed that liquid latex was doing good enough, and it seems to be stuck to me more than it was to the actual latex so I would not really recommend... stays in dried clunks for a period of days....
B001H9289Y|5|Works great, stays on all day.
B00132H4P8|5|This is probably one of the best I’ve used.  If you notice the way the brush is made with a wider barrel then the other kind offered.  I  have been using electric toothbrush for over 20 years and found waterpik is the best.
B006GQYSGO|5|I've used Philips Norelco shavers consistently for almost 40 years.<br />Bought the PT730 recently to replace a Norelco shaver I bought in Saudi Arabia in 1996.<br />This model gives great close results, the trimmer works fine and I really like the ability to clean it with running water.
B000UQB2TM|1|The product arrived without a blade that was supposed to be included which makes it  useless.
B00QSG3BEC|5|Like the way it makes my skin feel
B00158OO1M|3|I like the cream, but it didn't come in the little jar, it came in the pump. And I hate the pump, its awkward to use and wastes the cream, which gets crusty at the tip and you have to keep wiping it off after each use.
B00GUNFE6G|5|Loved
B0014ZUHB2|3|The fragrance in this lotion is so strong that I could not use it enough nights to see if it works.  I suspect that it would work because I have always had great results from Curel products.  I have found no other Curel products to have such an overpowering fragrance.
B0014ST5Y4|5|I recently got Invisilign braces.  This machine cleans them very nicely.  The price was excellent and much cheaper than the one offered by the Invisilgn company.
B0034BV6KA|1|Not very effective at removing pill-y sweaters.  Wish i had bought a larger one.
B0028QVAGW|5|I really can't believe it.  I ordered this moisturizing lotion to go with the facial cleasner and they really do a great job.  Never really heard about this product before, but I love it.
B0092L3550|5|This is great for controlling wetness and odor - and smells great - so if you do get sweaty, you still smell good!
B000V87C2U|1|I do not like this stuff. I can't get past the smell of it to use it on a regular basis.
B004VHPWRO|5|Are you tired of those &#34;Q-Tips with the paper shaft? They bend on you at the worst times. No problems with that here! REAL WOOD SHAFTS! And at a good price too!
B000PBQ7LK|5|I have had this before and just bought a bigger bottle. Love it, could make brush bristles longer to fit to bottom of bottle.
B00138Y8NI|5|perfect texturing reminiscent of those summer beach days. spray then let dry and go at it. has a nice pleasant smell which is an added bonus. when it arrived, it was apparent that it had developed a small leak in transit. however, the amount lost did not warrant a return. will buy this again when i run out.
B00AOF2BZI|5|I am very glad that I purchased this steamer! It is an excellent option to a hair dryer because it moisturizes the hair instead of dry it out.
B001KWADKO|5|Great product. I LOVE IT....This is a very good product been using it for a month still working great . My sister bought one as well and she loved it
B009B6Z41E|3|I like this BB cream, but the color is a little light for me.  I actually mix their two shades, but both are light.  I wish they would make darker shades.  It covers well though.
B0009F3O90|5|Great softener/protectant for lips!  Cocoa butter scent/flavor is very pleasant .  Can really slather it on and no white build-up in corners of mouth.  Also, reasonably priced.  Been using it for eleven years.
B001E77KMY|5|I've been a long time Gillette user, for no other reason that they're everywhere so it's easy to buy them. I travel a lot and one time I left my razor at a hotel so had to buy a new one for my trip. I got whatever they had, and luckily for me it was the Xtreme 3 - by far the best blade I have ever used. This shaves smoothly every time - no razor burn and no rough spots. This blade has seriously lasted me three months! And to top it off, it still works better than a brand new Gillette. Maybe it's the flexible blade (which I didn't realize it had until I was here looking for a replacement blade). I'm never using any other blade. I'm on Amazon to do a six-monthly subscription to the 4 pack - that will work just fine for me.
B001OMI93S|5|Very efffective at providing moisture and continuing into the morning when it can be applied for the day also.  I have used this lotion/cream for over 25 years
B003SU25LQ|3|This product is okay.  But when I sent a message to customer service, I didn’t care for the comment “plainly shows” that was relayed to me.  I wanted to order 1 and I ordered 2.  It was a bit sarcastic. They didn’t even offer my return of the 1.  Not too happy about that.  Don’t bother to ask me to change my response. :-(
B0028RBZWA|5|Amazing…i FREAKING LOVE these towelettes
B00DT03YHO|5|I really love these travel perfume atomizers, just what I wanted.  Perfect size for travel, or even everyday use.  I like the glass vs plastic bottle too.  I tested these out by filling them with water and storing them upside down just before I went to bed.  Checked them in the morning, and no leaks!  Also tested them for number of sprays, which I found was about 100 sprays per bottle.  The sprays are somewhat weaker than a typical cologne/perfume sprayer, but no problem, just apply a few more sprays than you normally would.  Comes with a plastic &#34;eye dropper&#34; and a small funnel to transfer your fragrance.  If your fragrance bottle does not allow you to transfer it this way, you could just directly spray the fragrance into the funnel (after placing funnel into the atomizer, of course).  Hold the perfume bottle very close to the funnel to avoid overspray.  Shipping was very fast.  Highly recommended.
B00NPEAKH6|5|This sink is GORGEOUS!!! My husband installed it without any issues. Then he spray painted the PVC pipes under the sink with high gloss black paint. I love it!! I've been a hairstylist for over 20 years and this is the biggest and best sink I've ever worked with. Very happy :)
B002CMLS46|5|I recenlty had a keratin hair treatment which smoothed and relaxed my hair to a fairly straight style. On days when I want a bit more body and bounce, I add this to my style products and love the outcome.  A great way to change my style with little or no fuss.
B00CMF59HU|5|This product lives up to all its promises delivering great results as a daily moisturizer and quick relief for all kinds of skin problems. I like the natural and organic ingredients. Non-greasy and absorbs fast. Highly recommend.
B00NLFQAS2|5|Awesome stuff
B001EWEPDG|5|I'm tempted not to review this product, as probably most Queen Helene consumers are, because one does not want to spill one's secrets. This does absolutely wonderful things to my hair. I already had pretty soft hair with not a lot of breakage, but this oil gave it a hearty portion of oomph and sooo much shine. I don't have to use conditioner on days when I use it because the brush already glides so effortlessly through my hair after the hot oil. My friends accuse me of getting a haircut without telling them. \\"Your hair always looks good, but some days it looks _special_.\\"    Thank you, Queen Helene.
B000YHSZ2E|5|The product sells for much more at a salon.  I was happy to find it on amazon.  The product arrived promptly as well.
B002ZSW7OC|1|What. Is. This. Goo?!  So. Wrong. So. Thick. So. Gooey. So. Non-spreadable. So. Gross.  So. Viscous.  So. Not. Right.  So. Not. Worth. Buying.<br />DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY.
B0014F812E|5|This shampoo is wonderful, I have thick course, wavy hair and this makes my hair soft and manageable.  Received the product quickly.  Thanks
B007SZWY86|5|This is my favorite style wax / paste. It was great to be able to find it on Amazon for a competitive price.
B009M4XFP2|5|Excellent product, been using for some time now for my joints and helps a lot as I play squash which is quite demanding.
B000EY4YLS|5|very good product, best I have used, would order from this seller again
B00JB4WDUQ|3|It's a great product but the seller sent something stinky.  I think these were slightly expired or expiring soon.  I can't imagine Clinique would make something stinky.
B001MA0QY2|5|Love that I can do my hair quickly in the morning since it heaya up so quickly.
B000EMYHBM|4|Quality of the product is high but the pair I received were not new. There was hair stuck in the oil on the blades. I sanitized them and used them but these were listed as &#34;new&#34;.
B00150LT40|5|No matter how many layers of nailpolish you put on, this stuff will dry it REALLY fast. I definitely recommend it for those of us who don't have the patience to let our nails dry.
B00BIAKTMU|4|Such a great color. Didn't apply as easy as some of the other colors but i made it work! Thanks
B001V80A96|5|This is such a inexpensive and easy to use product and makes it easy for my husband to put his shoes on.
B00C3WT680|3|I had heard great things about this product and decided to purchase. It is very matte and I don't like wearing a gloss over the top for shine. It doesn't really go on smooth either.
B000143JSK|5|Doesn't smell as terrible to me as it seemed to to some people. It would not stop me from buying it again. Works great.
B008I2IKH2|5|Got exactly what I wanted in great price.<br />The pack is very good and the size is bigger than regular.<br />I assume I will order the one again & again.
B000P20U7G|3|This was a gift. Not my favorite, but it's not bad. Smells a little like Lolita, but spicy, less sweet.
B000ILZS1C|2|The color is way too sheer...does not even give nice natural rose color to my very pale lips.  I will try another lip stain product.  Also, it is drying to the lips and causes them to feel sticky.
B0000AJ3PU|5|The scent is lovely and the lotion moisturizes very well.
B0017L4CVO|5|I only used it on my eyebrows and it truley worked. You have to be avid about putting it on every night tho
B007UK215A|5|just as expected
B002QIADX8|1|This product is terrible. Do not waste your money! Not even 2 hours after being applied, this liner was flaking off my eyelids. I tried to apply on many occasions with several different eye shadows & primers, I even tried using this product by itself - still the same flaky, cheap result. Will never buy again.
B00AH5HFA6|5|Great product. Have not seen anything like it in the market. Holds well without the sticky pasty hard feel that leaves unwanted residue in your hair.
B00BPGGK3O|4|This lip balm is very smooth and hydrating. It also lasts a long time. I would highly recommend it. Also it's used by Lupita Nyongo, so you KNOW it's good!
B004VE3MEM|1|The whitening gel is so foul you can't possibly keep it in your mouth for the recommended time. It's very messy too... should've just stuck with the Crest strips.
B009RNUH54|5|Love the foam! Only need one pump per wash.
B00DC60BDK|5|Barbaro!!!!
B00O27PGPQ|3|Imitation of konad stamping plates.<br />the stamping of st Marie and the images of the bible work well. You have beautiful designs on this stamping plate which are great on nails. But, i have problems with some images: their stamping are very bad<br />.
B005ZI3432|5|The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Couldn't ask for more. I wouldn't purchase items currently available on MACcosmetics.com because of the huge markup but it was definitely worth it for a limited edition shade.
B000XVTYYY|5|These are best blades ever made. They don't get clogged with whiskers. I just wish they last longer.
B00CHKB4EM|4|So happy I purchased this flat iron and for less than half the price at Ulta. I have long thick wavy frizzy hair and Im finally able to straighten my hair in record time, about 20 minutes or less depending on if I blew it out he day before or not. The iron gets HOT fast, the satin finish grip is still cool at the base. Super long cord is great too. The display will stay illuminated even when off until unplugged. I think I read that it turns off after an hour by I always unplug after use so I'm not sure about that. I was told by a professional that titanium is better han ceramic plates for hair, alhough I can't confirm or deny that I will say it's glided over my hair much smoother than any other iron Ive had. I'm very pleased with this straighter and can make great curls too.
B003S516XO|5|Arrived within 2 days & work really good . couldn't wait to open it !
B008I0OXR0|1|I was so excited to receive this wig as my hair is short and I have always dreamt of having long, thick hair. But, I was unpleasantly surprised when I tried it on. It did not fit my head properly at all, it tangled effortlessly, and the hairs at the part were extremely short and broken off. I have requested a refund and hopefully that will at least redeem the seller a bit. If you're looking for a quality wig, I suggest not buying one online. :(
B003V360NY|4|I got this razor for Christmas and still haven't used it more than 5 times, but I really liked it so far. You can get a fast and clean shave because you can use it with your dry skin. I tried also using it with shaving foam and it was fantastic! It glides really well and doesn't keep pulling your hair. It also comed with a trimmer, so if you want to shave it all off, you can still use it to even it out. I loved it!
B000JWM83G|3|Use it as prepper supplies!
B00RY9Q1LC|1|The brush is not picking up the make up product, I have trouble using it so I bought another set from another brand.
B002R2B4F4|5|I usually use eyeshadow from the drugstore, i.e. Loreal. Most other brands irritate my eyelid and cause a roughening of the skin or rash.  After a couple of days of using this shadow, the irritation was gone and my eyelids are smooth again! Also, I love the texture of this shadow. I use a shadow brush and the color is very rich and opaque when you sweep it on, unlike other shadows where you have to keep getting more on your brush.  The color of this shadow is a very dark reddish brown, great for a dramatic smoky eye look when applied to the crease of the lid. P.S. I've just started using NYX eye shadow base and that stuff makes the shadow go on even smoother, even though you go go without it.  A little bit goes a long way.
B001IZZX1C|1|Very disappointed in this item. Does not shave clean- leaves spots. Wish I hadn't waisted the money and bought a better brand.  Don't waste your money!!!
B009XPRZL0|5|I ordered this product in several colors as gifts for workmates as a little morale booster.  The price was right, and it exceeded my expectations as far as quality and function as well. They arrived on schedule, as promised. Would definitely recommend this seller and product.
B003I4TM8G|5|This moisturizer is very moisturizing and thick without being heavy or greasy.  My skin was dry and acne prone and this moisturizer has helped me a lot! Their soaps are great too!
B003N4ST94|3|I am so surprised at how few options there are for truly all natural mascaras. This one is passable and I'm definitely going to use it all considering the insane price tag and that I'm pregnant and have to use bare minimum makeup. First, the brush is really strange, it flares out at the bottom and the tip, and I almost always end up over applying when I try to get my smaller lashes. I know how to apply mascara well, and this brush makes it really difficult. The color itself is great and when I apply powder under my eyes it stays put beautifully.<br />However, I am really surprised that a company who touts itself as being all natural and markets itself towards the &#34;organic woman&#34; demographic would add excess packaging to it's products. This, along with their lip tint and concealer, comes in a completely useless cardboard tube that you toss as soon as you buy. I guess 100% pure does equal 100% environmentally conscious. And the Amazon packaging certainly doesn't help either--please start mailing in envelopes instead of huge boxes!
B000C1VXM6|4|Jean Claude Ellena has created another lovely, dry, very wearable fragrance for all of us. When first sprayed on the wrist, the citrus tickles your nose and is swiftly followed by the raisin-y, figgy middle notes. You are left with a mellow cedarwood with traces of mild fruit to enjoy over the next several hours. Un Jardin sur le Nil by Hermes and Jean-Claude remains my top choice but this is a pleasant change of pace. Thank you Amazon for securing the Hermes scents so that we can enjoy a bit of luxury in these hard-pressed times!
B00KR3FD3E|1|HATED IT.  RETURNED IT!
B004FOQ9NY|5|Well, first I love the fragrance. Coppertone smells like summer to me. Then there is the sunscreen factor....this lotion gives me protection and a lovely golden color that I can't get from any other product I've tried. This is a staple in my beach bag. Light and not greasy.
B000VPPUEA|4|Actually, my wife is the one who tried this.  I did too, but only once.  She tried it regularly.  The directions say the user will see improvements after 3 months.  Since this is an Amazon Vine review and we have to post our reviews before the next monthly offering in order to continue with the program, obviously my wife did not get to use this for the full 3 months as recommended.    For the time she has used it, however, she said that her skin did feel tighter, i.e, it firmed up wrinkles. Since her skin is on the oily side she didn't want to use it in warmer weather (with which we are now afflicted in Southern California) because it made her skin feel oilier. She also said it smelled quite strong but I think that was from applying too much.  Bottom line, she said it does seem to work as intended.    I also tried some so I could put in my two cents. The bottle dispenses only a small amount and you really don't need that much. As the label states, it doesn't really feel very greasy and it is readily absorbed into the skin (I used it on my hands). It has a pleasant, mild herbal smell that I didn't find too strong.  I think my wife used too much at one time or else her sense of smell is much more sensitive than mine. The area on my hand to which I applied the oil does feel smoother, though.
B001LNOEN4|4|This was probably my first experience with the Linden scent. It is balsamic, but not &#34;piney.&#34; Ever so slightly astringent but in an interesting tree-resin kind of way ~ warm, like gem amber, or a very faint cousin of frankincense. It is NOT as bold or distinctive as frankincense: think distant cousin. It is also green, but a very mild, sweet green. Not as sweet or as green as sweetgrass. Overall, an interesting scent, and I would guess based on the way this came across to me that Pre de Provence handled this with a master's flair. An enjoyable experience for me. The soap was also as creamy and non-irritating as you would want.
B0012IW034|5|This is a high quality jar. My wife was very pleased with this for her back bar.
B00N4GZZRK|5|It was perfect! Unfortunately I cut my hair super short before it arrived but it is just gorgeous and when my hair is long again I'll use it.
B00518N1BQ|5|Love my eyeshadow. I was really hard to find this color. The color is very vibrant and it came in good condition.  Thank You.
B002QIEI8O|5|Item as described. Fast shipping. I little smaller than I though they would be , but still works well for what I got them for. Would recommend this product.
B0017GQ4WE|5|Naturally curls your lashes for you.  I will not go back to another mascara again.  I am satified with this product.
B00HKU9YP0|5|Seriously Love These Brushes! They Are Soft, & All Are Marked Exactly  What They're  For. So Great For Beginners.
B002C7487U|5|I loved this brand for their all-natural ingredients and cruelty-free production; had used their creamy cleanser and 15 SPF moisturizer, so I thought I'd try their night cream as well. I see a noticeable difference in my skin after 4 days of use: it's firmer, the pigment is more even (I have scarring around my chin and mouth from past break-out problems), and my skin just feels clear and healthy.  I used a little too much the first time around :-o so my skin was itching/burning a bit, but I did some research and found that because alpha hydroxy uses multiple types of acid, you only need a tiny bit on your skin each night. There's also an adjustment period of 1 week for your skin to get used to it. I started using a tiny bit, and then putting moisturizer on afterwards (at night) or STRONG sunscreen (in the day, which you need when using A-H), and it's all good now.  I'm excited to keep using this and will probably indulge in some more of their line!
B00AI0ULLU|5|I love lumene BB cream, it works great, it hides a lot of imperfections. I've used this for a couple of years.
B00AREGVUM|5|I love bio oil. I really see a difference when I use it. My skin is smoother and the tone evens out over time. Also, not irritating and it smells nice. Good product.
B00BZ2VVA0|4|It works great, does not pull any of my hair out.  I will buy another.  The only issue is that, I just didn't think about it, but it is made of plastic and is a bit more plastic looking than I thought it would be.
B000C214CO|5|My husband wears this all the time and women always comment on how great he smells.  So single guys or ladies that like your man to smell great, BUY this!!! Very fresh and clean smelling.
B008FHE254|5|I loved this product, but it has been discontinued which makes me very sad.  I haven't found anything that worked as good as this smoothing serum.
B00CNWY1YY|5|Feels great, keeps my skin from breaking out! Love it
B00J7XQB1S|5|I wanted this for my hair as it is very fine and frizzes very easily especially when its humid out. I just squirt the oil a couple times in my hand and rub hands together and then apply directly to my hair. I dont rinse it out, just leave it as a leave-in conditioner. So far it has helped against any split ends and fly away hair as well.  I am going to use this all over since it worked so well for my hair and left no greasy feeling on my hair. Cant go wrong with this one!
B004JFTMM4|5|Don't you just love it when a product exceeds your expectations?  Not only is this bottle well designed and made, but I really appreciated the included squeeze bulb pipette for transferring. Like a previous reviewer, I had a broken spritzer on a nonrefillable bottle of juice and attempts to fill smaller bottles using a funnel resulted in spills.  The bottle has substance - a good weight and thickness. The spritzer screws securely onto the bottle with no leaking and provides a even wide spray. I would love to know if the smaller purse size bottles sold by this vender are of the same fine quality.
B00028M3N2|4|Good Product.
B00BDIFLSY|3|Color I wanted
B000GR9OIQ|4|I got everything I asked for with this order.  I didn't do all the math and shopping around until after I placed the order though.  It ended up not making a difference whether I picked up this product at the grocery store or from Amazon.
B0067F28ZW|1|Brushes are very cheaply made. Not what I expected but it's very affordable so can't complain too much.
B00112AFDI|1|it does not curl my eyelashes at all it just feels like it pulls them. i was expecting more but i am very disappointed
B0041M5VPM|5|It is very difficult to find a safe cosmetic, now days.<br /><br />This mascara is made in Germany, under the stringent requirements set by the EU.
B003761B84|4|Keeps the color longer than usual. Accessuble price. For me one of these lasts for 6 months.<br />Worthy to try it.
B0058GW8HE|5|Love these false lashes. They feel good, comfy to wear and are dramatic but natural at the same time. Obsessed.<3
B00LQF63VI|1|Your are going to need a hair style to make it look like the picture.
B0006IQK5U|3|Did anyone else see sparkles all over their skin after applying tend skin?? Or is this some new ingredient. I am totally serious, the entire area where I applied it is shiny, sparkely, and glittery looking. It's pretty, but I don't see how that will help irritation, or where it is coming from (which ingredient?).   Also, I don't believe I have ingrown hairs yet, I just got bikini waxed yesterday, so why did the waxer say to put this on 24 hrs after...i guess to prevent them? However, I do have a couple irritation bumps, and am worried this weird cracked out sparkle version of tend skin they gave me is not helping. Any ideas?    As for the smell, this is nothing compared to a shot of tequila or everclear :)...it's really not bad at all! So far, I would recommend it as it was highly recommended in the salon, it feels gentle when applying, and does not have such a bad order. Other options such as calomine, to me, would seem much more nasty smelling!
B004FEO38C|4|I like this tingle lotion it is my 3 favorite that I have found in the tingle. I'm so use to tingles this might be hot for others be sure to have a base tan before using any tingle lotion
B001MJSAJQ|5|Friggin' sharp, so inexpensive that they're basically free, what else can you ask for?
B000KFX10G|5|Wife loves this product--uses it daily.  Smells good, too, and doesn't leave greasy stain.
B001A3HPT0|3|I got this at Wal-Mart.  It worked very well for the price.  I do recommend it to get you started if you find badger brushes out of your price range.  The brush consistently sheds but it wasn't a huge issue for me.  The soap was pretty nice.    Here's the thing, its not being a snob as some other reviewers infer to appreciate a nicer brush.  I was able to get a real badger brush for not much money and it is a huge step up.  I get much better lather and no shedding.  It is also much more comfortable on the face.  For me it was definitely worth an upgrade once I had committed to wet shaving.    I still love the bowl and will keep the brush around as a backup.  Don't let the fact this is boar hair keep your from trying wet shaving - get this and go for it.  Be prepared to really enjoy it and want a better brush, though.
B001Q537NU|2|You can just buy food coloring and get the same results at less than 1/2 the price.<br />This will dry out your lips. I tried it- I learned something. Learn from me.
B000GF4I84|5|Over the last year, this product has been phased out from local retailers and is becoming very hard to find.  I love the shampoo and conditioner and will be ording more.
B0002G21GI|5|Although this item is compact and is great for travel, I use it all of the time!<br />It takes less space to store and gets the job done.  Much smaller than my last<br />larger set and just as good.
B007L5H7XK|1|DO NOT ORDER - this item is regular not lite.
B004VFXVJW|5|I bought this for my very picky husband.  He regularly shaves in the shower, and likes having a mirror.  He's bought several (many?) mirrors over the years - including at least one that cost close to $100.  None worked. I decided that, for the $10 this one cost, it was worth a try.  He (and I) were pleasantly surprised.  This one works well.  I did have to convince him to be patient enough to run it under the hot shower water for a few seconds, (maybe up to 10 seconds?)  so that it could become, and stay, fog free.  As they say, it works on basic science (fog is condensation and is drawn to cooler surfaces - warm it under the shower and no fog). While he initially wasn't excited about that part, I was able to convince him that it was worth the (minimal) time - and certainly less time than he used to spend spraying things that didn't work on mirrors in an attempt to restore coatings that didn't work.  Several reviewers have commented on the small size.  My husband has a 'less than small' face - and once he got used to the mirror size admitted it wasn't an issue for him at all.  It adheres well to our ceramic tile shower.  Definitely recommend this mirror -
B00F11045Y|5|This is a beautiful bridal hair comb. The comb's teeth are metal, so give the comb more stability. My only criticism is that it was mailed without any protective packaging. I had to glue 2 of the pearls back on. But other than that I am very happy with the comb.
B0014DDWZM|5|I first came across this shampoo at a friends beach house and was hooked on its scent and the noticeable amount of shine after just the first wash. This shampoo is very expensive when you're considering the 8 ounce bottle... with the 1 litre size (you will want a pump for it, and its not included, i used a starbucks syrup pump and it works perfectly) its economically priced and you will not be disappointed. I'd also highly suggest buying this with the conditioner as well.
B000WITHVI|1|Caution ~ The seller of this product is trying to use a fresh listing to sell this absolutely useless product. Go to the Amazon search page and type rejuvinol. Then sort the reviews from worst to best and you will find an honest review of this product. This is my review and my own experience with this completely overpriced pasty product:     ~ This is the WORST product ever! After using it EXACTLY as the instructions stated, my wrinkles were enhanced and my face was extremely dry. There was no relaxing of the wrinkles, in fact, new ones appeared since the product dried my face so drastically. I looked like I had aged 20 years in one month of use. I only purchased the product due to the glowing reviews I had read on amazon which were written by salespeople who work for this company. I tried Rejuvinol and Rejuvox, HATED them and tried to return them. The seller ignored me so I was unable to return the product. All I can say is learn from my expensive mistake and if you really want something that will relax your wrinkles, use botox!     Do NOT waste your money, do not purchase this product because if you do, you will be very sorry! Remember this review!
B005IMHAFI|3|I bought these for the color.. surprisingly hard to find just a plain pack of the blond color. I'm already disapointed though, that they lose their shape so quickly. Not sure I'll be buying these again.
B003T18TE6|5|I bought this for my teenage daughter with waist length hair and a couple stripes of color in it. It smells amazing ( almost like berries) which we both love, and it left her hair soft and silky.
B004RRES96|3|I purchased these viatmins for my son who's had facial acne since last summer..  It had really gotten really bad and I took him to see a dermatologist, but my son wasn't faithful with the topical & medication.<br />Well; he's been using these capsules and I do feel alot better about it because they are vitamins.  His face has gotten alot better, so I'm surmising that it's due to them.  Yay!
B00BCNR4PI|5|Very comfortable. Blocks out all the light from the tv my bf keeps on all night. Also helps when I have a migraine.
B000V1YEI2|4|I was looking for a light moisturizer for my relaxed hair that wouldn't weigh it down or be greasy. All the other reviews I read were from persons with natural hair but I thought to give it a try. So far, I like it. I use it sparingly after a wash or before I apply heat to my hair. I also use it to two strand twist my 3 year old niece's natural hair and I love the way it comes out. All in all I think this is a good product and I would recommend it. Also, a lot of other reviews complained of the smell. My personal opinion is although it is lemon scented it is soft and not overbearing. I really can't even smell it after a day or so and my husband hasn't complained-I say that b/c if it was a harsh smell he'd be the first person to let me know.
B0009IK198|5|The Braun 1775 is the best shaver I have ever purchased (for the price & features). You just have to shave every day for the best results. Believe me, this is as good as it gets..
B0015KHMRS|5|Can never go wrong with this purchase $10.00 and after 8 months its still going i use it every other day
B0012RSXNG|5|Awesome scent my girlfriend loves it so I use it rarely along with my other Colognes cheaper then Wal-Mart price this bottle should last me for years
B000R8U52I|5|This is the best clarifying mask that is also very gentle and non-drying. I have been using this mask for years and since the department stores no longer carry it, I am grateful that I can order it through Amazon. I have combination oily/normal/dehydrated skin. It really clarifies but is very gentle on any skin. I can leave it on a little longer for a deeper cleansing effect without worrying about the mask becoming dry and tight against my skin because it never dries out or becomes tight! This mask is simply fantastic!
B000EPJNPE|3|This flat iron does not get hot enough to effectively style your hair - found one @ walmart for approx. $15-17 that works much better. I would not buy this again after using the conair product.
B00BB3K1WC|1|I think it's old.... Smells rancid !
B00J2APFMW|5|Arrived on time and as expected
B0045K71C6|5|The tiniest dab of this foams up into the most luxurious foam that feels hydrating on the skin and has the amazing scent of most all Shiseido products. I use a makeup remover before using this, so I can't attest to makeup removing abilities, but it rinses away the day and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.
B000JVDDNQ|5|My son has horrible eczema.  I have tried many creams and lotions.  this one has done the trick!  I put it on him twice a day and he is clearing up with no steriods!  The only change in his care has been using this lotion.  I can't say enough.  I bought it from my local health food store and was looking for a better price with Amazon, but with shipping not a super deal here.  But well worth it if you can't find it locally.
B00HNWNXAW|5|This Soap works Great.<br />I would recommend it to other.<br />Helped clear my skin in one week after I started using the soap.
B008KEJ1LM|5|We've only been using it for about a month, but so far we are VERY happy with the product. We just need more time to determine how it will hold up.
B00SXBZN6E|1|Brushes were bent with brissles falling out constantly. Very displeased
B002NQ8EAW|5|It scrubs and moisturizes/oils at the same time. Smells rather exotic, but I like it. For some it may not be what they'd expect from the &#34;blossom&#34; type of smell.
B00009YJSJ|3|Works great but I wish it had more power.
B0022H6JQI|5|Great for nourishing hair.
B002CSPIKA|5|Hello,<br />Before I used exposed skincare I had tried every kind of products but without results.. one day I find these products on internet and I decided to proved them..from that day my skin cleaned up  ..now I have no more skin problems and I had recommended to my friends too.. and they are satisfied too. so I recommend to all of them who have skin problems [[ASIN:B002CSPIKA Exposed Acne Treatment - Expanded Kit]]
B00H1OI5XC|5|Very nice I recomended to use it
B0043U1ZU2|4|I love this lipliner! The color is perfect and is exactly what I was expecting which is always a relief when purchasing beauty products online. The only reason I took away 1 star is because once the &#34;tip&#34; was used, I was not able to adjust it to get the rest out. I'm really disappointed that it's stuck because this is one of my favorite colors.
B00APEO74G|1|I received this mirror in the packaging minus one suction cup. A waste of money.
B008GHDLFK|5|Love pale coral color...Great for summer. I do wish this color was a standard...It is light and goes with many various colors...Very versatile!<br /><br />...
B00MFYGT7W|5|Arrived timely.  Love this fragrance!
B00BFZFVW6|5|Great value! Seems to be nice quality & love diluting essential oils with it!
B00JJ6MVBW|5|I am super impressed with all of the Truly Radiant products that I am currently using. Dentists actually recommend Arm & Hammer products more than the other leading toothpastes.. The spin brush makes my teeth feel cleaner than ever before.It gets down and really cleans you teeth. It makes my teeth look whiter and brighter. Now my other family members are using them. &#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&#34;
B0034KYDRE|4|Boxed nicely. But it was a little hard to open. Small chip in mirror in the corner, not sure if from shipping or what? One of the shadows was completely crushed. Other than that not bad w/primer.
B00IMPUTGU|5|This oil is high quality.  Smells great and I used it for an entire week to mix as a carrier with my essential Oils.  I will buy again.  Thank you!
B00CJK72PA|1|This is ridiculous.  Only a hand towel would fit in it, not at all what I would purchase for a towel warmer.
B003UKKHB4|5|this is the second oral-b for myself. love it. can not live without it.
B00A76CPUA|4|I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TODAY BUT WAS SHORT TWO I READ OTHERS REVIEWS WHERE IT SAID IT WAS 3 SETS OF THE SAME BUT I RECEIVED ALMOST TWO SETS OF THE SAME WHICH IS 12 DIFFERENT COLORS THE FOLLOWING ARE THE COLORS I RECEIVED<br />GOLD (4), HOT PINK (4), GREEN (2), WHITE (2), PURPLE (2), SOFT PINK (2), SILVER (2), BABY BLUE (2), RED(2), BLUE (2), GREY (2) AND SOMETHING CLOSE TO COPPER COLOR (2)
B0002KHT8Y|5|I bought Oral-B 3000 for my mother and she likes it.  Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  I recommended that she does not charge it after every brushing but rather only when the low battery indicator turns on, and she's been following this suggestion.  She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.  I was especially pleased when she told me that she noticed her teeth getting whiter and her mouth feeling fresher.  That's all I need to recommend this toothbrush.
B006YPXACU|5|To all future users of the Orabrush, don't hesitate to purchase this product. It works really well and, with the tongue foam, I've never been so satisfied with my oral hygiene. At last, products that don't mask odours but get to the bottom of the problem by removing the bad germs.
B003V21WO2|5|So far my wife loves it!  I like that it heats up so fast, and we get out of the house quicker. :)
B000TFQH5I|5|Great product
B00D62XBRS|1|It was extremely slimy.
B00TR0XQ46|5|Thank you!
B00AA9BB5Y|5|Been using 4 months. Stretch marks almost invisible!
B004F563CK|3|First tattoo with this gun my own ink don't use this ink they give u on your own skin
B004GV8H7C|5|I spent a lot of time looking for creams to stimulate my hair curled. This is certainly the best to make curls naturally.
B002E027DC|5|Works great and smell's great! Nice cooling sensation with a sweet lime scent. Scent fades quickly, so it doesn't fight my cologne. Will try Booster's other scents.
B00BZ1T450|5|I have really thin hair. But when i use this product, it always gives my hair volume and body after blow drying. Plus your hair feels soft afterwards.
B00GTXCM8U|5|Good mascara I really like it
B00277JKY6|5|I cant find this in stores anymore, and its my favorite self tanner ever. It shipped sooo so quickly too.
B001B80FTQ|4|I bought several of these types of tools from Amazon for ingrown nails and this one had the most utility. The finish is not great, but it was the only one with two different shapes of thin files that allow for access to problem areas that other tools did not.
B001BQXV4O|5|I got this for my cousin for Christmas; he likes it very much, and he's a REALLY picky guy. The fragrance is nice.
B00J7CAXGI|5|Very moisturizing! I really like them. I don't know yet if they are helping, I am just starting to use them but I have dry skin and the moisture  from the masks definitely helps.
B002HWS7UY|5|I received the items very early. Very useful product, during hair treatment and hair color. Because of it's light weight I do not feel uncomfortable.
B009DU4QYE|5|love love love this product and use it exclusively now -- on my fourth bottle. I have always been frustrated by my oily hair AND itchy scalp -- it seems like you should only have one or the other! and I was always annoyed that every shampoo in the drug store seemed to be for dry hair. if I used head & shoulders for my itchy scalp it would make my hair flat and oily after a couple hours. I love having bangs but always ended up pinning them back mid-morning because they just got oily and gross. this stuff is worth every penny. my scalp never itches and my hair looks good all day. also, for those who are acne prone, this stuff won't make you break out around your hairline. love that it is natural. expensive, but one bottle lasts a couple of months even with daily use. you wear your hair every day, so I think it is a great investment if you are tired of dealing with oily hair. buying in bulk right now!
B004OHQR1Q|5|Great product and price!
B00IXYHBL6|4|so far so good
B005P0CZMG|5|When I leave it over the tense knot in my muscles for a long enough period of time, I find it reduces or eliminates the tightness.  Gets to those &#34;hard-to-reach&#34; places!  The product was just as depicted.
B00AACC2ZY|5|I LOVED THIS PRODUCT IT WORKED FOR ME!!! I GIVE IT 5 STARS
B00E6BQEEA|5|Works like a charm! I actually don't mind shaving now.
B007L65XA8|1|This item didn't work for me at all , the top of the dropper kept falling off , so eventually I ended up throwing it out .  The product didn't work for my hair didn't see a difference in my hair at all.  So don't waste your time buying this product , try something else !!!!
B000M18WMK|5|Ever since I switched over to Clinique's pressed powder my skin has cleared up SO much. It's a light powder but still has great coverage and you never have to worry about your makeup looking caked on. I would definitely recommend, just don't forget to get the right color.
B00A5LUC7K|5|Works great for my hair, keeps it healthy and shiny. I tried other Kerastase products and this is definitely one of the best.
B004ARS14Q|4|One of the few that I liked. The first layer of the strip, a second layer of all fixes. But more to buy this paint will not. Chanel nail polish I like, although more expensive.
B00E07VB6G|1|Waste of money
B0094GHGQM|5|This is my favorite mascara ever. I almost never have to worry about clumps and they make my lashes look nice and thick.
B003AVNK0S|3|My wife bought this sunscreen and a bunch of other similar brands as she's on a minimalist ingredient kick.  Used Blue Lizard Sensitive in FL for long beach days (yes very frequently reapplied for reasons - see below) for our kids and yes it does work to block/reduce the sun's rays so that's not in question however there are some substantial downsides that the husband/father (me) doesn't like.  1) it's not the easiest by half stuff to apply nearly akin to pure zinc oxide it takes a lot of rubbing to get it to at least not look like you are walking around looking like a pasty mime, the kids both hate it because of that; 2) it's not water proof or even water resistant.  Some of their lines are water resistant but the sensitive version eschews the chemical that adds the resistance.  Which means you have to reapply every time you go in the water.  Which means if you plan on spending any substantial time swimming playing in the surf/water/pool you may be exposed to sun burn.  Oh, and it also seems rather expensive.
B004DKAYUE|5|My hair is wavy, wiry and fine, so I have a lot of difficulty styling it. My secret weapon against a particularly troublesome cowlick is this 3-day Straight styling spray. I spritz the cowlick 2 or 3 times, then iron it out with my Conair 2-in-1 curling iron (it's a curling iron/blow dryer combo). It tames the cowlick for far longer than the advertised 3 days. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005A43X Conair Hot Air Curling Combo, 1.5 Inch]]
B004EDWMBO|5|The hand cream is very well
B0009TP7QO|5|it goes on smoothly, the tube lasts a VERY long time.
B000MUTD4M|5|I have purchased this items several times usually at Target.  This time I ordered on-line since the price was very good.  I have used this many months and I think this is the best product out there for a nighttime cream.  I have tried many others including more expensive ones such as Clinique but always return to this one.  Not greasy and soaks into skin immediately.  The results after several weeks are amazing.  Less brown spots and a brighter complexion.  I use this in combination with Aveeno SPF 15 and their scrub.  I only use Aveeno products now.
B00A2F06Z2|5|Is in use, see how it works.
B005EM5DT2|5|Handy for travel and for storage between uses.  Holds my entire brush collection.
B00UR6HH5I|4|As someone with EXTREMELY pale skin, I reapply every hour, or whenever I feel like My skin is burning (usually less than an hour!) I've used everything from Hawaiian Tropic, Bull Frog, stuff I bought at Sephora to this stuff... YOU NEED TO REAPPLY!!! I'm Sick of, \\"this works this! This doesn't!\\" The sun doesn't care what you use, watch your or your kids skin. Everyone is different, nothing is a miracle cure. Stop blaming media bulls*** for your mediocrity's.
B006GQYSC8|5|Dad loves it.  Good price and good product.
B000WUD83E|4|I like the smell, cleanliness, etc of this product. Have used it for more than 6 months but have just recently broken out with a rash that I'm hoping isn't from this. The Dr will hopefully be able to tell!
B00UKDLA6U|5|i could keep putting more on with out clups. My lashes also stick together with mascara and they dont with this they look thick and full, great product.
B002GJU2XI|5|This is my fourth generation of these shavers, I lost one in Iraq.  I am pleased now as I was with the first generation, I hope they never stop making them as the item works for years until it can no longer keep the charge.
B000KI44KE|4|I purchased the FootSmart Bunion Regulator to try to straighten out my large toe and reduce the size/intensity of the bunion on my foot.  I have used this product for one week now and it is comfortable to wear at night.  I have noticed a slight straightening of my toe, but no lasting effect during the day.  However, this condition took years to create, so I don't expect miracles overnight.  I will continue to use this product and hope to see more results in the coming months.
B00E4R4A0G|5|Just as described in the picture.. made the wife happy great gift :P
B000KEIPC6|5|This stuff keeps your hair from going all over the place.
B00CBK88KQ|4|This is my favorite body spray from Secret. I love the scent. My only issue is that the nozzle is defective which can be very annoying. It will work just fine for a while and then stop spraying. You have to hold the sprayer down for a good 5-10 minutes so the liquid can work it's way back up the straw and start spraying again. I'd buy this more often if it weren't for that one inconvenient flaw. I usually purchase mine from Walmart and all (I mean ALL) the bottles mess up like this.
B001A3HPT0|5|Nice soft brush and foamy soap
B00T5VO8DK|3|you only get one that's so stupid
B002MZM8O2|2|I bought the RoC Retinol Correxion, Deep Wrinkle Serum a month ago after reading the good reviews it received from other consumers.  Not knowing the age, or skin type of the other fine reviewers I was just hopeful that it would work for me...sadly it hasn't seemed to make any difference in my wrinkles whatsoever.  I will tell you that I am 44 years old.  I am brunette and didn't really get any wrinkles until I hit my 40's.  I have an olive complexion and try not to spend too much time in the sun (I do live in Arizona however) so when I do go out into the sun of course I use sun screen. I only have wrinkles on my forehead but there are two deep wrinkles right where my eyebrows meet my nose (on each side, I don't have a uni-brow just yet:) that make me look like I'm always scowling.  Anyhoo, I have been applying the serum to my forehead every day, twice a day for about a month now and nothing has happened.  Nada, zip, zilch, zero, difference.  I still have my DEEP wrinkles on my forehead and the two DEEP wrinkles above the bridge of my nose.  In fact I would say that the added moisture to my skin has kind of made it more oily thus causing breakouts...YUCK.  So I continue to look like an angry brunette (I look angry because of those nasty wrinkles between my eyebrows) and I'm out $20 bucks (including shipping).  I would say if you have dry skin this couldn't hurt because at least it will moisturize but if you have naturally oily skin you might want to reconsider...unless of course your partial to adult acne.
B004FJPBRE|5|fiuts in most of my hand bags, and i love the organizational areas within this organizer. i would recommentd it because it is firm, dosnt collapse and is light colored on the inside to easily identify your items.<br />fits an amazing amount of stuff. really!
B0015TJPW4|1|Thankfully this product was not expensive because it did not work. My child sucked it right off her fingers! It was a mixture of lemons and pepper.
B003U8K6M6|3|The battery life, power and portability are great.<br />The length settings are a bit hard to hard to determine. To be sure of the setting I'm on, I have to click it all the way down to zero, then count the clicks back up to where I want it. It's too hard to read exactly where it's currently at solely based on the measurements printed on the side of the trimmer.<br />This trimmer gives a good, level and consistent trim. The spring-loaded guard makes it easy to navigate the tip of you chin while maintaining a constant length.<br />However, the feature that I bought this trimmer for, the vacuum, is only about 60% effective so it may as well not have a vacuum at all. Even though a good portion of the whiskers are collected in the small compartment behind the blades, there are still about 40% of the whiskers that get sprayed all over your countertop, sink and floor.<br />Overall, a good trimmer...but if you're buying this model for it's vacuum feature, but that money towards a model that has the digital  length setting display.
B00L0088YE|5|very good, second time to buy, my skin getting better
B00AZIXV0S|3|Just ok conditioner. Try Pantene cleansing conditioner instead. Works great.
B003CTVSKC|4|Creamy texture, nice fresh and light smell, hair felt smooth with a nice sheen...I would recommend. If your hair is thick and long, purchase more than one. I have fine just past the shoulder length hair and I can afford to stretch the product. I like so far.
B00V6ZLQ06|5|Great just what i needed
B001738KBK|4|I'm in my early twenties and I am in a constant battle with my face.  I use to have really bad acne which left me with a lot of scarring.  Obagi helped a lot by getting rid of the scarring.<br /><br />I started using Clarisonic recently. I was little hesitant at first because of the price. But heck, it's my face, and whatever I can do to make it a little better, it's worth it.<br /><br />First of all, the brush does clean my face well.  My face does feel cleaner and smoother after using the brush.  I like taking in to the shower with me as well to use on my body.  I use it on the back of my arms and it has helped get rid of those little red pimples.  By the way, the brush is not harsh on the face as long as you aren't pressing down hard. By the end of the first day, I had it on high with the normal brush head.<br /><br />Is it worth $200?  No, but it's the only one on the market in its class.  Trust me, I looked.  Nothing compares to this one.  Yes, it is definitely overpriced and they probably make a HUGE profit on it.  Probably in a year after they get some competition from other brands, it will be cheaper.<br /><br />One thing I do hate about the brush is the number of buttons.  Basically one button does everything on this brush.  It turns it on, off, changes speed, changes mode...it's ridiculous.  They need more buttons on this thing.<br /><br />Another thing I hate about this brush is that you can't replace the battery!  So, after three years when the battery breaks (and eventually they will all break), you have to purchase a new Clarisonic brush.<br /><br />Overall, if you have the money, go for this brush.  If you don't...wait, in a couple of months, the price will probably drop when other brands create similar products.
B002UVUSGS|5|I love this perfume and was pleased with the price and speed I got , I will be back again!
B00ZQDKDIU|5|good
B005P02U8A|4|The brush has very Soft bristles, did come a little apart in shipping box but otherwise great product! Provides great for over coverage of my powder and bronzer,
B00CPTH5FC|5|Loved this bag. All my make up fits perfectly.
B0001EKWPI|2|Made me itch more....did not like it. Gave it to my daughter and she does like it. But her skin is not as sensitive as mine.
B005846QWY|5|Super delicious smell. The cream is very luxurious and my skin feels like silk. Will order again. Loving this. Thanks!
B000EGK4LK|4|I like the way it makes my hair shine. I also like the way it makes my hair feels its good.
B00ON1GWMM|3|I was sent a tube of Full Lash Bloom for free from Influenster to test. I do like the product a lot, as it stands out against typically plain black tubes. As far as the mascara itself, it gives great volume and definition. I was not a fan on the clumpiness, and the applicator was not defined enough to comb through those clumps one on my lashes. Along those same lines, removing the mascara even with makeup removing was a chore. Overall it gives a great look, but application and removal is difficult.
B00H1DVQMK|4|I´m not from the USA so I don´t have the machine yet I´m still waiting for my carrier to send it to my home as soon as I get it and try it I will rewrite this review but i need to rate the seller because they were so nice to me I definitely will be buying more things from them
B000CNIHF0|4|I really love this one and not too strong so I can wear it to work
B000Q31IVG|5|It's wonderful
B001DJ3GI0|1|I have used Skinceuticals products religiously for about 4 years and have had the chance to try out lots of their serums. This is the only product which has disappointed me. I used it for two weeks and noticed my sunspots getting darker! Very upset about this and would never have given it a try if I knew that this was one of the side effects.
B0086HTWH6|4|I only have a small gap in th emiddle1mm aprox. I wear them only at night and I skip some nights so I cant jugde acurately cause havent been consistent.I dont think these will fix your teeth permanent but will definately work if you wear them for 1 or 2 days prior a big event.wedding photoshoot new eyar or whatever.Ive tried 2 bands and results come quicker but teeth seem to return to their original position too faster than wearing only one.Anyway Im not aiming for completly close the gap cause it wuld cause another 2 gaps on the sides and ruin my smile.Since the rest of my teeth are all together Im just reducing the gap size to half and even though it still creates the gap on the sides those gaps are the same size of the reduced front gap and my smile looks balancedNeedless to say my overall look improves tremendously.So people dont go for the complete closing.I dont give 5 stars cause I dont think its a permanent fix but Im very satisfied.FAST delivery good price and effective product<br />Note. I even leave the band on for pictures,its not uncorfotable at all and if you roll it to the top near the gum no one will notice.If you got a small gap orde NOW.<br />If you got an event use 2 bands the days before at night,then  rest about 8 hours and wear 1 band during the event as a retainer
B00F4TQ4QG|3|When I selected this shampoo, I was leery. I am a huge animal lover and have not liked Procter and Gamble for over 20 years. I have followed their animal testing throughout the years. 20 years ago P&G was heavily involved in animal testing and I did not buy their products then. However, throughout the years, they have changed their practices. The FDA requires certain chemical be tested on animals. P&G could have avoided that but they did not. However, a few years ago, a friend that works for a rescue group that I am connected to, took a job with P&G, she explained they no longer test. That was not enough for me. However, there is still a lot of negative press out there regarding their animal testing. If you want the FACTS you can go to their website and it reads:<br /><br />Are Herbal Essences products tested on animals?<br />Unfortunately some misinformation has recently appeared which may have compromised your trust in Herbal Essences. rather than trust wrong information here are the facts:<br />* Herbal Essences products are not tested on animals. full stop. nor do we ask any supplier or contract lab to test them on our behalf. all messages implying Herbal Essences or any other P&G Beauty & Grooming product was tested on animals are wrong!<br />* we passionately believe that ending animal testing is a benefit for all--consumers, animal welfare and industry. in fact, P&G is a global leader in supporting alternatives to animal research, having invested more than $250 million to date in helping to develop more than 50 proven alternative methods. we collaborate with governments and universities to promote acceptance of alternatives. if you want to learn more about our efforts, please visit http://www.pgbeautygroomingscience.com/<br /><br />I don't like that their products do not state they are not tested on animals. I called customer service and spoke to `Jasmine' and she was not professional and very misinformed. She kept telling me I had to speak to corporate reading the animal testing. I told her I knew from their own website they did not test but she kept saying she was a consultant only there to help consumers. I then asked if I was as consumer wanting products that do not test on animals, which one would she recommend. With a bad attitude, she said again, I had to speak to corporate. So even though their website states they do NOT test on animals, their customer service is lacking in knowledge and education. Had I just been a consumer, I would never buy their product with her lack of knowledge and her attitude.<br /><br />I will say, I have used this product several times and it does clean well. I have really long curly hair and it cleaned it each time. I could smell the grapefruit and the mint scent. It did not leave any residue. I use a different conditioner but I could tell it cleaned well. The first time I just used a diffuser on my hair and it was very curly and full. That is in high humidity.<br /><br />I like this product but and on the fence if I would buy it again. It cleaned well but if the company does not know what they are talking about when I call them and they also get an attitude, I am probably not going to buy their products. My mother also buys their products and also has the same ethics I have and she was upset the company was not only evasive, but rude. I think I will stick with another brand that cleans just as well with great customer service.ng the animal testing. I told her I knew from their own website they did not test but she kept saying she was a consultant only there to help consumers. I then asked if I was as consumer wanting products that do not test on animals, which one would she recommend. With a bad attitude, she said again, I had to speak to corporate. So even though their website states they do NOT test on animals, their customer service is lacking in knowledge and education. Had I just been a consumer, I would never buy their product with her lack of knowledge and her attitude.<br /><br />I will say, I have used this product several times and it does clean well. I have really long curly hair and it cleaned it each time. I could smell the grapefruit and the mint scent. It did not leave any residue. I use a different conditioner but I could tell it cleaned well. The first time I just used a diffuser on my hair and it was very curly and full. That is in high humidity.<br /><br />I like this product but and on the fence if I would buy it again. It cleaned well but if the company does not know what they are talking about when I call them and they also get an attitude, I am probably not going to buy their products. My mother also buys their products and also has the same ethics I have and she was upset the company was not only evasive, but rude. I think I will stick with another brand that cleans just as well with great customer service.
B00CD9749G|2|I used St.Ives cleanser and make up remover for many years and loved it. Suddenly they decided to discontinue totally perfect product and I guess this Apricot Cleanser was put in its place. I don't understand why they needed to come up with another scrub. That's exactly what it is. And although I use and like their Blemish Scrub and Green Tea Scrub, I would never use them twice a day like a normal cleanser. So this cleanser is very harsh, more so than their other regular scrubs. I literally felt scratching my face (and my skin is not so sensitive) and saw redness afterwards (trying to remove day make up, not a heavy make up at all). Of course, I couldn't even imagine touchimg my eyes with it! The old cleanser was so gentle and creamy that it left my skin calm and moist, and clean from any even  heavy make up.  This one, besides being very rough, is also drying. I couldn't  wait a second to put night cream to somehow get my skin more comfortable. Once is enough. It's going back to Walmart. Not a smart move from St.Ives  with this product.
B00GSIZGSE|5|Honestly was impressed with the Quality of the wig. Loved it! Great for Cosplay or daily wear c:
B0001TQ9WI|5|i have been using this stuff since they invented it.  itsa the ONLY lotion i like in the whole world!!!!  not greasy-and it works. and it smells AMAZING
B00GV5NMBM|4|I really like this brush set and its carrying case but I was surprised that there wasn't more variety of brushes. it seems like a lot of the exact same brush is slightly different sizes. I was hoping to get rid of my old brushes and just use these, but even with 24 different brushes it doesn't quite accommodate what I need. It really needs a blender brush and a narrow crease brush
B005PP2094|1|It says blue and it showed more pink than blue in the picture. Would have preferred what was in the picture. Very disappointed the they advertise the wrong picture.
B006IJK96W|5|This wig actually looks BETTER in person than it does on this picture! The color is a better shade of blue than shown on the picture (much more appropriate for anime cosplay), and it even came with a free wig cap! The quality is perfect, and you won't find a better short blue anime wig; trust me, I looked!
B00P75KOQI|5|reduced fine lines
B001E96QJK|5|This floss is hard to find in stores where I live.  Not sure if that is because it is not carried or is very popular.  My guess would be the second.  Thanks to Amazon for carrying this.
B002CVTVVY|5|Last year, I had $20,000 worth of dental work done. Needless to say, I need to protect that work and prevent having to go through it again. I have some problematic teeth so I splurged and got this toothbrush. I'm not really an electric toothbrush aficionado, so I don't know from one to the other. All I know is that this one is great because it doesn't vibrate so much that it hurts or makes my head feel like it's full of bees, but it really gets my teeth clean. The massage setting soothes my gums, which don't like being brushed, and that two minute timer is a Godsend (I am five, apparently, and I need to be reminded how long to brush). And it's really nice to have the blue light aspect, because bacteria is my No 1 enemy. My dentist actually noticed a difference after only a week of using this. When this one finally dies someday I will definitely get another.
B00442VT9Q|5|Very nice
B006K9OQSC|5|Four of them for such a low price. Two are small size and two are normal size.Very worth the money.
B004Z245C8|5|Great price good value
B0040B2U7G|1|Very disappointed. Packaging very cheap looking. Sizes of containers misleading and quite small in actuality.  I purchased for a gift and really could not gift it in good conscience. If you just want to trial the product yourself then this is perfect!  But if you plan to gift this do not waste your money.
B002LHG9HI|5|I purchased this a while back because it was cheap, and i had terrible purple stretch marks all over my arm. After receiving this product i never used it till like a month or so after because i thought it was just another lowsy cream. I started using it with no expectations only because i didn't wanna waste my money and OMG prolly like 4 or 5 weeks after my stretch marks became silver. The sad part is that i was ran completely out but of course i'm gon purchase some more...i highly recommend this especially to brown skin girls. works really great:)
B002FCGEI8|2|I was looking for LOVE'S RAIN SCENT (Not Rain Forest scent) that was available in the 80s.  This is not it.  The scent is acrid and overpowering---it made my Cairn terrier sneeze---so I tossed it and will know better next time.
B004HEM57Q|4|The best neck cream I have used.  I am 57 and have tried many products for the neck area.  This smooths out lines and firms as well as you can expect with a cream
B004Z209HS|5|i use this product every morning on my face and hair and it works great
B004DBUAGG|3|Good lotion for the price. Will purchase again.
B001AMRQ2W|5|I bought this for my husband for Christmas a few Christmases ago. It's lasted a few years with frequent use and doesn't need to be charged constantly. I like it because it's quiet so it doesn't wake me up if he has an early morning. It gives a close shave and doesn't irritate my husband's sensitive skin.
B000PJMPU4|5|I have one in each bathroom. I especially like the 1x magnification and the flexibility in placement. Exactly what I needed and wanted.
B00CO2BHI6|1|I bought these because I had misplaced my nice ones. I hate these. They're so hard to use. Never buying these pieces of crap again.
B0099LC5OK|5|Love it a little goes a long way and it smells so good,really helped my split ends. I wash my hair with Wen
B0011UR1H8|4|a good taning lotion to start a tan base<br />if you love austalain gold lotion (the smell)<br />this is a tanning lotion for all type of skin
B005HR5ZOW|5|Very pleased with purchase, product received as expected carfeully wrapped to prevent any damage although container/bottle is plastic. I use it on my hair and love the softness it provides, I also use it on my skin but only a little because I also use grape seed and coconut oil. Size/quantity was very appropriate to price. I would purchase again and recommend to buyers.
B001TXB4G6|5|I've been using this product for about a month and my skin has greatly improved. My cheeks were covered in red marks and I am seeing the marks fade and my skin soften.  My skin isn't perfect, but I've seen a reduction in breakouts. I use this product with black african soap and I think the results are due to the pairing of these products.  I make a lotion using 4 tbs pure organic aloe vera to 1 tsp tamanu oil with about 5 drops of grapeseed oil for extra moisture. I keep this mixture stored in a jar, it absorbs well mixed and it lasts a long time. I love it!! I estimate one bottle will last me several months...Im back to stock up!!
B004EMPCLW|1|Not what I expected  it is just another stick toothpick
B008M2ASBO|3|The musk Amber oil arrived before the sellers anticipated time and was packaged very nicely. I like the roll-on applicator because I am disabled and cannot operate other methods of scented products and this little glass bottle fits very easily in your purse or bag. It is portable and definitely easy to use. I can apply it to my wrists or neck or under my knees and have the warm scent stay with me all day. It is nice but it is also very deep and masculine as well. I would call it a unisex fragrance. It is not feminine in the flowery sense. It is warm and possibly makes the skin smell even warmer. It makes me think of lying naked in front of a crackling fireplace or maybe sunbathing in someplace exotic.
B001UFSAL0|5|I love the mint smell on this soap. Gentle on the skin and a very good size. Happy with my purchase!
B001E72308|5|Love this. Not too spicey
B007BLN17K|2|Bristles are too thin to really do anything. Can't make small lines because the hair will stray. not sure if I'll ever use them again but they were cheap so I'm not upset.
B004M49OU2|5|I love this color, and it left my hair feeling healthy, not stripped.  I will certainly buy it again.  The color still remains vibrant after a couple of weeks, although it has changed somewhat from a deep, purplish fuchsia, to a lighter, brighter fuchsia.
B000VWP390|2|I see a lot of 5 and 1-star reviews, and I think people are overreacting in both cases.  I've been using it on my legs and bikini area for about 2 months, and here's what I've found:    Pros: It's cheaper than waxing, hair definitely grows back slower and less dense, and between it and the buffing, my legs have never looked smoother.    Cons: It still leaves stubble that you can feel if you run your hand over the skin, it takes a very long time to use (I usually do it while watching TV just to keep from getting bored), and the razors burn out way too quickly.      So if you hate going in for waxes and have time to spare, the NoNo might be worth it.  However, the high initial price plus the cost of replacement razors made me knock it down an extra star.  The fact that I paid $250.00 and will need to keep paying $21.00 every few months to keep using it makes it feel like a scam, especially considering that its results are far from perfect.  I would be much happier with the product if the makers adjusted one or both of those prices.
B004L96O4C|1|I would not waste my money on this. You have to stir it up every time you use it because the oil keeps separating from the salt. It smells really bad. It burned my hands and is really rough. Worse of all, it leave this oily, yucky film on your skin that is impossible to rinse off. Very unhappy with this purchase.
B002Z13TG4|5|This has been my favorite for 50 years and was pleased that Amazon offered it - the real thing - and at a good price.
B0013E5J62|5|It was a gift to my wife, she loved it! It compliments her well. She has used this product for a few years and loves it and so do I on her!
B004MTRIXC|3|it did not work for me but maybe works foer someone else its dry my hair thank you anyway good luck
B003EN4T2U|4|I quit using Proactiv because I was getting frustrated with the automatic delivery and billing with Proactiv, but my skin started breaking out again. I knew I had to keep using it and was so happy I was able to order it here on Amazon!
B00473Y8UO|5|Amazon is a life saver! I can not find these deodorants anywhere in the local grocery stores.. . I love them. They work great for 24 hrs, they don't smell and they don't leave any marks on my clothes. I wish you could find them everywhere in the US.
B005M2AQRI|5|Very nice
B00120XR0M|5|My new favorite every day cream for winter. Great for my face in the AM (though not before working out) and in the PM. Love the smell and the feel of it. Not greasy at all, but good moisture for my 50ish skin. Nice product!
B000ZTDFOO|4|Love it
B00JGQOCD0|5|Love this hand soap. My hands smell great even after chopping onions or garlic
B00819HT92|5|I like his product because it does what it promess to do. In addition, it is a great value and it is delivered very quickly. Very satisfied!
B008QFRPFY|5|I really like this product. It smooths out my wrinkles on my forehead and face.
B008BTE7KQ|4|I decided to try this on a whim based on all the great reviews. While I haven't seen any improvement in my skin, I haven't had any additional problems occur from using this either. It's a simple system, and I'm really hopeful that I will get amazing results from using this. The cream is a nice, light weight moisturizer (too light for Michigan winter), and is unscented. The pill portion is about the size of an aspirin & is easy to swallow.<br />If I see any major changes in my skin I will update my review.
B004DN8F4S|2|The swivel mechanism lasted a month and now is lose, so the mirror will not stay in position.  The magnifying side is useless, like others have said it is distorted and very low quality.  The only positive thing about the mirror is the light, and mirror size...bright enough to put on makeup at night, but everything else about it is a fail.  I could have just purchased a task light.  What a waste of money.
B00GTO0H8G|3|When you put the stickers on &#34;Merry Christmas&#34; is backwards but it was fairly easy to turn it around and put it in place.
B00JAJNDZ6|4|I have noticed there is no seal. I'm concerned.  Is this normal?
B008CC42CU|4|As we age, we lose enamel on our teeth so a really vigorous brushing may not be needed. Along with regular cleanings at the dentist, this Oral B soft brush is certainly enough. Oral-B is a trusted brand that one can rely upon. For your next toothbrush purchase consider this instrument. You'll be satisfied.
B000LD3KDU|5|I adore this eye shadow! It's an excellent shade with a very, very subtle shimmer. I bought one for myself and one for my mother and it really highlights our green eyes. You can also layer the shadow for a lighter or darker color.
B00PSKTVO8|1|Do not buy this product.
B001KNZC22|1|Disappointed.  Distorted view. Adheres to well to larger mirror, but can't use it.
B002RTV4Y8|5|I recommend this product to anyone who may have a dry scalp. I bought this exceptional quality oil and added a little to my shampoo & conditioner and after washing my hair my scalp felt amazing. The delivery time was very fast, I actually had it in my mail box sooner than I expected.
B003654SVS|5|Thank you for the quick delivery.  Perfect rating!
B000225ZL0|5|Use this product for over a decade! Fantastic!!
B000O5WGHG|2|Not a good product in my eyes. Didn't care for it. Didn't do a thing. Love most of the products but not this one.
B004HYNCA0|5|This is a super fun product, great color, and so easy to put on for a natural cheek color.
B00J2AP9F0|5|I got to try Gillette Fusion Proglide for free as a bzzagent. I love the closeness of the shave from this razor. The flexibility of the razor allows it to contour to your face so you aren't left with stubble in creases or on the sides eliminating the need to go over things a second time to get it all. It's almost effortless compared to other razors as it just slides right over the surface of your skin. I don't get as many bumps and nicks with this razor either.
B000P22TIY|5|Good purchase and fast shipped, it work for me
B00QIVGFX6|5|This stuff has helped my husband and me with our tender, torn hands.  I think with regular use it also prevents your hands from tearing in the first place.  I would recommend this to anyone that has callouses or rough hands.
B0010VLJ58|5|I love the simple fact that when washed off there is no black left under my eyes. It doesnt smear or look chucky. Its thick enough to make a great lash and light enough to look natural. Love this product!! I've bought it has gifts too
B00H8I424W|5|Very good product. It leaves your skin feeling soft, and hydrated.
B00HO146BM|5|Looks great I love it
B004WMFVJW|4|it is helpful! My hair is seriously dry hair. Since I use this product, dry hairs are diminished. Better than before. Not the 100% recovery but I like it.
B00L673IWI|5|Squishy! No priming. Works like a charm. 💕
B0013F4EQC|1|One reason why some of you may be breaking out is because of an ingredient that Bare Escentuals uses called Bismuth Oxychloride. It's a by-product of lead and copper refining and it chemically resembles arsenic. It's basically a non-toxic heavy metal. I started using BE thinking that it being all natural would be better for my skin. Since I've started using it, my skin burns and turns extremely red when I sweat...almost like a sunburn. Plus, I used to have fairly flawless skin and now am a broken out mess. After changing about everything in my skin care routine, I discovered this chemical and have concluded that I am super sensitive to it. I have stopped using all my BE products and no longer have the burning/itching side effect and my face is starting to clear again. I would highly recommend doing some research of your own on this if you are experiencing some of the same symptoms. A lot of the more popular mineral make ups out there contain this ingredient, however there are some that don't. Just an FYI for those of you experiencing problems! Hope this helps!
B00MOL4AIQ|4|great smell
B001LFF4DG|1|this is horrible. Do not waste your money. I recommend salon perfect pomade even though it isn't a gel. It's like the Anastasia Beverly Hill's Dip Brow only cheaper. It;s very hard to find good quality eyebrow products that are from a drugstore.
B0080FFDVS|4|I really love this product and it helps to make gold gradation colors on your nails. Big gold shining is difficult to remove!!! But is is worty.
B00Q74SOVU|5|Awesome Product Works Well!!
B000UVWGGA|5|I love this scrub,the tub is huge and you only need a handful for the whole body,it exfoliate gently but firmly and rinse off easy,i will get different scent.
B002WJHK1O|5|I use Thymes hand cream, lavender scent, all the time.  Love the fragrance and find that it is good for my cuticles also.  Great product.
B004K3D0FK|5|This product is amazing.  It really makes a difference in my hair and I LOVE IT!  Makes my hair feel much healthier!!
B00112BT88|5|Previously I was using Clinique brow liner.  I liked that it was an auto-sharpening pencil, but I didn't like the price or how quickly I went through the product.  It was hard to find an equivalent at the drugstore.  These pencils are great.  I have them in blonde which is perfect for me.  My hair is bleached platinum.  Also a benefit of not having the auto-sharpening is that they are much sharper when I sharpen so I can be more precise.  The other thing is that though these are pencils that need sharpening the product is not at all hard, which I had feared.  It is a softer consistency just like my auto-sharpening pencil was.  Overall this is a great product and a great value!  I will definitely be repurchasing.
B00H7XIPOG|5|I love this product.  My skin is smooth with those little lines gone and is a great moisturizer.  Living in  dry cold climate takes a toll on your skin - but this helps to keep my skin looking great.
B0017K8HJS|5|So far so good. It arrived a day earlier than expected so that was great also. It isn't cakey, and hasn't left any build up or residue .
B00I6GQVTE|5|good
B0016BC2BM|4|My hair looks fuller and thicker within a few shampoos. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. The fragrance is a bit strong.
B0009OAIQ8|5|Love it
B008JWW5K4|4|Brushes are soft but there is plenty of them. Gave them to my 20 year old and she loves EM
B000052XZ0|5|Best shampoo ever. Died quietly in its sleep in 2006. Its memory shall live on always.<br /><br />R.I.P.
B000NGB9C4|5|This is a great makeup bag..it is classic looking and fits all of my makeup with room to spare.
B00PVDA6P0|1|Have had these brushes for about a month. Already four have bit the dust. Not sure if twenty if them will last as long as a $22 pack of three. Buy knowing you will be disappointed.
B000052YM7|1|Make my skin rashes not working for me.. Use only one time and throw it away in the trash :(
B001MA0QY2|5|I just used my straightener and I LOVE it!!!<br />It straightened my hair perfect, heated up quickly and stayed hot. So simple to use, and actually straightened my hair a lot faster then my old hair straightener.
B002IX3J9Q|5|I order this time and time again. The 'gritty/sandy' texture is great for styling when you don't want a 'wet' look.
B000GHGYP2|3|Its' okay.  Smells like Lemon Grass .I was looking for something for an itchy scalp.  This didn't work.  The only thing that really worked was Selysen Blue.. but my husband likes  using this.. Gives you a clean feeling
B000I1QQBI|2|Way underpowered.
B000C1Z19M|5|Great perfume, great price!!! I recommend anyone who likes a light, sweet, floral fragrance to try Shi, you'll love it!
B0006IO3OK|4|I no longer remember what I was looking for when I found this cream, what it promised, or what my expectations were, but it's a nice, quality cream that feels great going on, gets absorbed easily and leaves my skin soft and supple. However, although it's called a \\"moisturizing treatment,\\" the small print on the jar says, \\"dual action facial re-firmer.\\" I didn't notice that until it arrived and, frankly, I haven't noticed any re-firming happening. Not sure I would get it again, but the price was right and I have no regrets. More like 3.5 stars, than a 4.
B000FLIIQC|5|This takes a while to get into your system and must be taken regularly once you build it up in your system, but it is one of the things that works to keep my hot flashes down to a bare minimum. I have multiple severe hot flashes 24 hours a day with multiple triggers. These help keep me sane.
B008PTPSF0|3|A bit big and bulkier than I thought.
B007ZR2RRA|5|This color is glamorous. I feel like you can where it everywhere for a classy and confident look. I'm very glad I bought it from online instead of the store, especially with Essie's price increase to $8.50 a bottle--though it is well worth the money if you buy it full price! This is probably my favorite gold metallic I've seen, since it isn't too much on the yellow side. Yellow nail polish really looks horrible with my skin tone, but this gold one somehow looks amazing. So glad I purchased!<br /><br />I'm very happy with my seller too--they gave me free shipping but I got my package within 3 days even though they ship form California and I shipped to the East Coast. Awesome!
B00481PTDU|5|I have short, no body, and fine hair.  My hair dresser tried this on me. I love it. This works better on my hair than any mousse I have tried, and I have tried quite a few. I just wanted my hair to look thicker and this does work. I wasn't looking so much for volume but I do get some with this. I use about a little more than a quarter size. My best suggestion would be try the amount that works for you on your hair, its all different for everyone. Sorry ladies for those with curls I cannot give you a review ha ha. But for us with fine hair I suggest highly you try this.
B007K6K0IY|5|I am trying a free sample of this from #buzzagent through the #epic48 change and #gotitforfree challange. I like it so far and it seems to be working well.
B005C1C02S|5|These little beauties are filled with sparkle and the stars seem to twinkle in the sun!  I use these on nails and in making necklaces.
B0077PLO60|1|I had the silk-epil 5, and it was great. On this one they changed the on/off button, which is a bit awkward to change from speed II to I you always have to turn it off first.<br />Also the head now moves and makes towards you have to pass several times on the same spot to remove the small hairs. It takes much longer... Unfortunately I do not recommend this one :(
B009TJ7ARE|3|This fragrance smells like tangerine, grapefruit and cheap spritz hair spray.<br />Needs more spice or something to make the dry down better.
B006BZ6ZU2|5|The exact sale lotion as the tanning bed places sail for 1/3 the price I say well worth it 100%
B005R6X6NK|2|Package was wrapped in newspaper and did not receive any contact information.  I thought it may just be an honest mistake, but the review below was similar to the problem I faced.  Was unable to open the package.  Will have to pry it open as well.
B0073XUS54|5|All the memories of Hawaii without the air fare! I love this oil, it is such a sensory treat! If you have ever been to Hawaii, this oil will remind you of your joy.
B001G1ZXSQ|5|My favorite fragrance for years. Not overpowering and lasts all day. I have received many compliments when wearing it.
B0046DCJ6U|5|I have been using this razor for about a month now and have to say, it's really a fantastic little model!  It's very lightweight and petite (the handle is the same length as a standard contact lens case) and easy to use.  I would say just go slow and use a light touch, and you'll have no problems getting used to it. From the first try, I got a nice, close shave on my legs and 'pits and no nicks anywhere.<br /><br />I love the red and black Bakelite and the simple styling.  Mine also came with an art deco styled travel case and ten Merkur blades. Pair with a luxurious shave cream or emollient and this turns the mundane act of shaving into something enjoyable. I also love the fact that I'll no longer be throwing disposable razors or replaceable heads in the garbage can. You can reuse the blades in household scrapers, resharpen with a Razor Saver, or recycle.
B003PG21IU|5|I absolutely love this body butter.  My skin is exposed to chlorine almost every single day.  It gets so dry that it just drinks any other moisturizer up in less than 20 minutes.  I pretty much swear by the body butter. It deeply moisturizes and soothes any irritation or itching.  I definitely would recommend trying it.  Its worth every penny.
B000AMA4BI|5|These are great for travel. We have a beach bag ready to go and I got this to keep in there at all times.  Nice to have a non bulky but fully functional towel.
B00DOGAYZ8|5|If I want highlights, this is the only thing that keeps my hair soft and (able to comb).  It's worth the price if you color your hair.
B0012IN8Q2|5|Good for blending in with your eye make up--however, it does make my eyes burn and make my eyes water.
B001MA0QY2|5|They work wonderful and they came on time, I love everything about them.
B002SUXSKO|4|I've been using this product for years. It's cheaper than other brands like Toppik, but it works perfectly for me. Sprinkle it on lightly, pat it down gently, then hair spray. There's no mess for me, unlike some of the videos I've seen on youtube about other products.
B00DWL660M|5|excellent quality
B000NWDSAE|5|I have subscribed to these. They are a great face washing product, wash your face in the shower and unless you have a bad case of acne that all you have to do. The price is a dollar or more than other stores so why not buy these on amazon. With prime you're saving time and money.
B00194197O|5|MY 89 YR OLD MOTHER BROKE HER ARM AND HAD TO GO TO A NURSING HOME REHAB LOCATION. UNABLE TO GET OUT OF HER BED BECAUSE OF THE PAIN SHE HAD DEVELOPED SOME BED SORES. THIS PRODUCT HAS WORKED WONDERS IN HEALING THOSE AREAS.<br />THE BED SORES ARE HEALING UP FIND AND SHE NO LONGER AS THE DISCOMFORT SHE HAD.<br />GREAT PRODUCT !!!
B0049LUI9O|4|Works comparable to any good brand nose hair trimmer on the market. I have experienced no pulling when using it to cut nose hair. It is also a capable eyebrow trimmer as well, but I don't have any ear hair to test it on. The cutting head has a tendency to heat up while in use but this is common with other brands as well. The ability to wash it with water with the vortex action is convenient but I believe it is still necessary to remove the head after washing to allow it to dry fully.
B00EL1HZ34|4|The shimmer is beautiful and natural looking. Its not over bearing it just gives you a nice natural glow.
B0040F6SXO|3|The Stick looks like a pencil with the flower attached to the end. The flower end came broken and it cannot be used now! To return it will cost me more than the price of the product itself. HIGHLY Disappointed.<br />But anyway I decided to give it 3 stars because, it would have looked pretty if it was not broken.
B0013TVEYS|5|We are very pleased with the Brushheads..Can't find them at any store in Redding,Ca.so I found them on line..They got here in just a couple of days...Will be ordering them again soon...Rowdy
B003VP1EFG|3|I HAD BEEN ORDERING A MULBERRY SHIMMER LIPSTICK FROM ANOTHER VENDOR FOR YEARS WHICH THEY HAVE SINCE DISCONTINUED.  THIS IS THE CLOSEST COLOR I COULD GET TO THE ONE WHICH I HAVE WORN FOR YEARS.
B003V7KWB6|5|I've been using this serum for about a week now and am already noticing smooth thighs! I workout a lot too so that probably helps but before I started using this even all of my workouts wouldn't do much to reduce the appearance of my cellulite. It tingles when I put it on. When I wear my tummy tuck it seals it in more which makes it even more tingly and I think more effective. It sometimes feels a bit sticky on my skin at first but it does give my skin a nice glow.
B00LNN0RLK|4|Smell great but a couple didn't drop very well but for what it cost it's okay. Got more than my moneys worth overall
B003XU8ABA|5|I ordered the Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro Haircutting Kit to begin cutting my fiance's hair. I had never cut anyone's hair before, and the step-by-step guide really helped. The combs are numbered for an easy, straight-forward haircutting experience! For the money, you really can't beat it... and I think it's of an excellent quality. Great product!
B00795XKXS|4|After a few weeks of use it seems to help the deeper folds around the chin, lip area.<br />It help the deeper lines and I am happy thus far with this product.  To me it seems to work as good as Botox.  This brand is worth trying as it seems to be as good as any of the higher priced skincare.<br />Of course, everyone is unique  therefore, it may not work on others.  However, I would recommend it.<br />Only a small amount is necessary to apply as I believe it is concentrated.<br />I can only go by my own experience with this product as early use shows a good result.
B004ZQSTMQ|5|Great with your hands!
B000NL0T1G|5|I've gone from disposable, cartridge, and electric razors and HATING shaving to actually enjoying shaving. I purchased this along with a variety pack of blades, Proraso shaving soap, and a midrange badger hair brush. Razor burn and ingrown hairs are a thing of the past. The process takes longer but is definitely worth it.<br /><br />The Merkur 180 has a nice heft to it and is extremely easy to clean, replace blades, etc. Do yourself a favor and make the switch!
B00HX168UA|5|This worked well. Just be sure the cartridge is inserted correctly.
B00L3LB0IG|5|I apply this cream directly onto my face after I cleanse in the morning and and night. I allow it to dry before placing any additional moisturizers. The result is happy, soft and mostiturized skin. I have very sensitive skin but this doesn't not irritated or break out my skin. It also helps plump fine lines and pores to give a more youthful appreance. I highly recommend this product!
B007PAD71M|5|so not only does it help my hair to hold a curl all day but i am able to style it into the 40s look i love so much and a friend of mine said her daughters hair just doesn't hold a curl so i told her to try this and she bought one herself.
B00GAVOE1O|5|Super value for the price, and got here before the earliest estimated date, so plenty of time for when I needed it. Doesn't have a cheap feel to it and I haven't noticed any shedding. My only complaint is that it was difficult to part to keep it from falling in my face like Cousin Itt, but I remedied that problem with some cute clips. Was just perfect for my Pinkie Pie costume and several people asked if it was my real hair. I'll probably end up wearing this one just for funsies because it does look so nice and maybe order some more in different colors.
B005HO0AR2|5|Dermatologist said Dove is Best bar soap and bar soap in 2014 has better properties for dry skin than liquid soap. Liquid soap in guest rooms/baths. In my bath, Dove bar soap
B00GW1HKHW|5|hi lite
B001MBR0ZO|5|I luv Natural leave-in Crecepelo. I only wish it came in a larger bottle. After using the entire line, My hair has grown 4 inches in 5 months. With such long hair, more product is needed for all this long hair. the shampoo, treatment, rinse, leave-in is all fantastic for the hair. It stimulates the scalp for speedy growth. The leave-in makes it less difficult to blow dry the hair and no hair falls out. On utube, I saw a little girl with very long,thick, virgin afro nappy hair. Her mother used this product on her hair and her hair was silky and straight after her mother blow dried it.<br /><br />This is a great product for that added protection after treating or conditioning your hair. its the best for blow drying protection.
B001282H2S|4|I agree with the reviewers who cited the color discrepancy.  However, the problem is easily solved with a coat of nail polish.  I lightly dabbed purple polish on the ugly pink petals and now it looks beautiful. Green polish was applied to the leaves to enhance the leaves. You could choose different harmonizing shades.<br /><br />The item lost one star because of this issue.  Otherwise, it's a five star barrette.
B00655WLIS|5|I was very happy with my purchase. This is indeed the real \\"famous faces\\" by devoted creations. I have tried every face lotion out there and THIS is my ultimate favorite in the past I have used luminary face and obsessed for the most part these are both very good face lotions by designer skin however I got 3x more color from this lotion in a single session which is very difficult for me having fair skin. Also this stuff actually smells good where luminary and obsessed smell like play doh famous faces has a very sweet smell with no ATO. I will be purchasing this item again.
B00028M3N2|4|Nice smell. I wish the cap had a dropper attached.  It would be easier to use.  Other than that, product is fine.
B0009ET4V8|5|I have been using for about a month--I got the recommendation from the EWG. I have very sensitive skin, and so far, it is not clogging pores or causing breakouts. Love it!
B00FLNFYPC|4|Amazing! So comfortable..especially in hot weather. Stays in place and looks natural under clothes.
B004BC9T9G|5|The product was good but directions would of been nice.
B00NXDOTLM|5|Nice
B00K3022LM|5|Excellent, love it. Fact sheet that the seller attached explains everything. Packaged very well also. My skin is responding very well to the treatments I did already.
B002LM3V8S|5|I love this company and their products. Everything works great! I will continue to support them and promote them happily.
B0086VI9TO|2|These are compact size. I didn't think I would mind the smaller brush head but I prefer the larger ones.
B001I8MJ2K|5|I love this so much! I have extremely sensitive skin and I just started waxing. My skin gets red and bumpy from the irritation and applying this heals my skin very quickly. I will definitely not go without this ever again. You don't need to apply very much of it either.
B002E30XDU|2|I recently changed my birth control and started experiencing some break outs.  I've been a fan of Boots Botanicals products for years and thought I'd give the Expert line a try.  I tend to have dry, sensitive skin and have severe environmental allergies.  In the past, Boots products have been gentle enough for my skin and irritation doesn't occur.. not the case with this foaming cleanser. This product actually exacerbated my problem.   It dries your skin out so much that it feels tight after cleaning.  I tried to give the product a fair chance and used it for a month.  After that, I had to stop b/c it wasn't helping.  I believe this product might work very well with true acne, not the occasional breakout.
B003I90DH0|5|My favorite dry shampoo. I will sometimes buy a cheaper brand at the drug store, but those are really inferior. Batiste leaves no white residue in my hair like others and seems to get it cleaner and leaves it looking better. Plus you just can't beat the tropical scent, it smells like vacation! :)  The listing when I bought the last time said bottles were 5ozs like most brands but they're actually 6.73ozs, so it's an even better deal. One bottle lasts me about a month and I use it 4-5 days per week.
B000066SYA|3|Great seller. Overall, this was my first experience with the body wash so the 3 star review is not about the sale, but product. I love the lotion, but am let down by the body wash. Doesn't have a strong,  wake me up scent at all. Very mellow in comparison to the lotion. Which, let me down a bit.
B003EOFEJ6|5|Very nice for the price - good eyeshadow in different colors - the light ones are a little chalky and don't show up - you also get three blushes and three bronzers. I'm not going to rave over the quality of the makeup because it's quite ordinary, but as far as I'm concerned this is a great deal - if you don't think so try to construct the same type of set buying separate items for under twelve dollars.
B003AVNK0S|2|What the other reviewers don't say is that this stuff is really greasy.  I put it on to go to the park, not to swim.  Any dust kicked up sticks to your skin.  Despite putting it on thickly and working it in, I have noticeable color (tanning) on my arms after being outside for several hours.  I didn't expect that with this type of sunblock.  Since I wasn't swimming, I had to come home and shower before I could sit on furniture due to the greasiness.  I will keep it around to see how it does if I do go swimming this year.
B007F4I79A|5|So cool!
B00IJYHRAK|5|I happen to really love this moisturizer. There is a hint of mint, makes my face so smooth, and cool. Will get it again
B0041HTTA0|5|I have always been very satisfied with my Braun shaver and replacement parts. This shaver provides a very close shave with no irritation. The replacement heads are wonderful.
B006JUYTCU|4|I like to use this in tandem with whitening strips to get in between my teeth where the strips sometime miss. I have never used it alone without crest white strips, but its a great touch up tool. Its tiny but it lasts pretty long. Make sure your teeth are dry. I wouldn't rely on this alone to whiten teeth.
B000ONGB9W|5|I have been using the Obagi line for years and it was so expensive through my dermatologist. I was so happy to find it online for $20 cheaper. I have always had problems with acne and the scars I get while healing, but once on this product, I no longer worry about breakouts or hyperpigmentation. If you are using this product it must be in conjunction with the entire line #1 cleanser, #2 toner,#4 exfoliant, #5, & #6 to be effective.
B002F72MS4|5|Non toxic.  PINK!  FANCY!  PIGGY PAINT is wonderful for little girls to feel special.  This Gramma proud to give to my granddaughter and paint her piggy toes and fingers with her.  I also bought the top coat and think it was a good idea.  Clear.  Both dry quickly.  Arrived quick, packaged well.  Love Piggy Paint.
B000YDPU4Y|5|This is what I wanted.  Expandable floss.  Don't know why Walmart and Walgreens doesn't carry this but glad Amazon does.  Nice to be able to order a whole bunch at one time.  I will definitely re-order these.
B004RILAHI|5|Great find...I've experienced about an inch of new growth in a single month. Balm also helps to manage my natural curls. Iy even helped fill in a thinning area.
B00CA8WX6O|5|Exelent
B00KOHS9ZW|5|I always used Kat Von D lock it tatto foundation, but when I saw this at Walmart, I felt in love with it! It's has really good coverage and its 95% cheaper! I payed 5-6$ I believe! Totally worth it and totally worth switching from high end foundations to this one :)
B00A2WPDOO|4|Yes, I really like Wei's products, I have tried several and still using them. My favorite product is the Face Treatment pads. Thank You.
B001GEEJ7Y|4|Good brand and product, but just not as strong as the yellow bottle...
B004WAGFQC|4|Fast shipping, Good price. Works as well as my old professional one.
B00FZLROZS|2|It worked the first 2 times I used it and then it just left my hair feeling dry
B001NM85Q0|5|Works really good. Have to use it everyday but I'm very happy with the results.
B000PLUZL8|5|I must admit I was sceptical about the product's claims - but it has definitely helped decrease my acne breakouts and has helped to get rid of some bumpy clogged pores, especially on my forehead.  I bought a Groupon recently for a salycilic peel (right before I bought this product).  Well, I went to the skin care clinic, and their peel felt and acted _exactly_ like this product.  For $20 this is a great deal,  now I am excited about trying the glycolic peel too!  Oh and great shipping, it arrived in just a few days.
B002GN4DRU|5|I love piercing earrings because I was always losing one earring before.  Now, when I wear these, my earrings stay put!  These backs don't come loose!
B007HERMKI|4|I received the necklace 9-10 days after ordering it. The photos are true to the actual necklace. However, the actual skull necklace seems like it has more blue in it than the actual photo. It's a super cool design. The necklace is shorter than I prefer, but it could always be switched out. The entire necklace is good material and heavy duty! Worth my money.
B004L01NVA|5|Leaves my hair (previously natural and now relaxed) feeling soft and silky. It also has a lovely scent.
B00DIIIWVK|5|WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!
B0009MFZAE|5|I was quite skeptical, but I used them 2x a day for just one week before a family wedding and the results were excellent. I strongly recommend the PREMIUM PLUS over the regular whitestrips and without a doubt over other brands like Rembrandt,  etc.
B0000536P3|1|I am disappointed with this product. I have used Oil of Olay product ever since I was 13 and have loved it.<br />I usually use the original beauty lotion, I should  have known better to switch. Oh well, don't know until you try I guess.<br />Back to the Original for me. :)
B001EJOPXE|5|Used lots of moisturizers.This doesn't cause any breakouts or irritations. And the price is right. Since it's not $50+ a bottle, don't mind using a little extra during the coldest windy weather.
B00GHXHSPY|2|I am a very fair skinned Caucasian over forty.  If it has made a difference, these past several weeks, in my opinion, it is ever so slight.
B00A967Q3O|2|Don't expect these to last even a week each, cheap but worth the price, breaks really easily
B000TAE0RK|5|I used have pimple on my arms but since I start use this soap it's getting disappear and my skin become very smooth. I like smell too. (^O^)
B001J6O0HI|5|Keeps my face clean shaved and my beard away. I would recommended this product to all that has this type of razor
B00AU831VC|5|Love this product so much I bought one for me and one for my mom.
B000C1Z2IM|5|buen producto
B000W0C0OC|5|Understated sexy and long lasting!
B001QX7QIY|5|I haven't bough clips like this in a while.  I have thick, wavy hair that is more course on the top layer.  These kinds of clips never used to work for me, but the no-slip part is awesome.  I have shorter hair now (used to be to my waist and now it's to my shoulders) and the clips keep it back easily.  I also like that there are 3 different &#34;clicks&#34; you can shut the clip to (according to how much hair you're trying to put in the clip).
B000PKKAGO|2|I bought it, tried it, returned it. Not because it is a bad shaver, but because it performs just like many other shavers that I've owned over the years, just \\"eh\\". I've tried about 5 different electric razors and always went back to blades and cream for a truly close shave that didn't leave a burn. I fell for the hype around this one and being a gadget fanatic I had to try it. It shaved just ok, but definetely not worth the hefty pricetag.
B00NKZLEVG|1|It's a waste of money. Chit
B006NBZ1MC|5|my husband love this polish on me.Nice spring time summer color. love it.I never wear pink but i really love this one. this color is really light not to bright.
B000SZXNPQ|5|I use a shower chair at home but I needed something that would be compact  (to store away) at my Sister's house for my annual Christmas visits.  I had the first stool sent to her house and it was great.  Just opened the box and it is ready to use.  I can now visit and take showers with ease.  I loved the stool so much that I bought another one that I can take  with me on road trips.  You will be very happy with this purchase.  I love it !!
B003YJAZZ4|5|With such sensitive skin I have always struggled to find a good shave. I used manual razors for over a decade but even the best ones still resulted in razor burn and I get acne too and the occasional in-grown hair. I also want a close shave. I tried the expensive ones and the cheap ones; nothing worked. I decided to bite the bullet and invest in this product. I absolutely love it and to me, it's worth every penny. I shave every 1-2 days. I never get razor burn even if I put it on the close shave setting and use it on my neck. I get the close shave I want without any of the irritation I've been putting up with for years.
B00H5BDX7Y|4|Feels nice. I think id need to use it more regularly to see optimal results. Good on the spot pimple zapper though.
B000XYD7CG|1|I bought 2 packages of these for my wife and daughters who have fairly thick hair.  She put a clip in and it slips right off, very easily.  It just doesn't stay at all.  The no slip plastic sleeve is actually slippery.  If it were rubber, maybe it would hold better?  Return postage wouldn't be worth the effort for a $4.36 refund . . . I only wish I'd only purchased 1 package and tried them out first.  I don't understand how these can be called &#34;no slip&#34; and how some reviewers are suggesting that they work great.  They are very loose.  Am I missing something here?  (My wife has used hair clips for decades so I'd be a bit surprised if this is some sort of user error.)
B003O7JM78|5|I like it. Bought it to replace Neutrogena tinted lotion which was discontinued.
B00BKEX71O|5|Sturdy and a perfect fit.  Easy to use and the strap is staying tight. It serves its purpose at a good price - good purchase.
B00NI8LNX4|5|Love it so much!
B002RTS1JO|5|Perfect and on time
B000GOIJWG|4|Excellent chair for the price. We use the chair as a transport only not daily use. Light weight makes it easy to use. Folds very easy.
B00C92XBGW|5|I've been wanting a small pair of scissors to carry for a while now.  The picture doesn't do  justice as to how ingenious this pair of scissors really is.  It folds together so that the sharp points and edges are sheathed so that it is safe to carry in a pocket.
B000C1VZWY|5|I use Tabac shaving soap and have fallen in love with the scent. This cologne is no exception to the warming fragrance of the soap. I can pick up the hints of lavendar, citrus, and floral from this cologne which is not overpowering. I also appreciate that it is not a sweet fragrance like many of the designer colognes in use today. This cologne is definitely \\"manly\\" in smell.
B001EUS62Y|4|Love this soap.  Did a great job clearing up my back with ache.
B00AE07IGK|3|I am a fan of Dove - have been using it for years, often even taking it with me when I travel.  I love the the curved shape, the copious lather that it generates and I love the way my skin feels after using it.  It's a fantastic product.<br /><br />There are only two things that differ between this product and regular Dove: the color and the scent.  The color is light green/blue (a lighter shade and definitely less blue than in the photo shown above).  It's closer to the color on the side of the box than the one on the front.<br /><br />I didn't like the scent.  Firstly, it's not what I would expect a \\"fresh\\" soap to smell like.  To me, fresh scents are citrus or neroli, or even a linen style scent.  This is quite floral, with no orange notes that I could detect.  I found it cloying.  It smelt like a grandmother's house.  It's also strong - you can smell it when you walk in the bathroom.  (Though the residual scent on the body is not strong).  I wouldn't go so far as to call it unpleasant, but it wasn't what I expected it to smell like and I wouldn't buy it again.  Obviously, reading other reviews, many people have liked it, but it wasn't for me.
B009NNFB0O|5|My husband loves this product!
B008CZBC7U|4|I love my veil but it didn't smell too good when I opened it.
B0091JL3IO|5|My husband travels, and with the sanctioned size by the airlines this product saves us money.  He previously traveled with his full size cologne, when checking his bag it was not a problem but with a carry on it was.  After losing one full size bottle to TSA who are just doing their job I decided to buy it in a smaller size to the tune of very expensive.  The Travalo is awesome; easy to refill after every trip and works great!
B000PXYAL2|5|great for the price.. get's a little hot for fine hair after a bit so have to stop if you are using for a long time. Can't beat it for the price
B00V9134T8|5|Tremendously impressed with product; it has to be the best deodorant I've used.  I personally had no problems adapting to rubbing the paste to the skin instead of a more easy-to-use roll-on or stick deodorant.  Don't let the manual application deter you from Primal Pit Paste!  I bought three different fragrances, and all are pleasant without being overpowering.
B000VEWF2Q|5|love this brand cuz it works!!!  Will order again
B000HK1OOY|5|This soap is awesome! A tiny bit foams up nicely to clean while in the shower. It doesnt create any bubbles if used in the tub but it softens the water and you get our felling clean. This size will last forever and it is now my chosen soap for my whole family. This is safe and a better choice than other soaps with all of the additional chemicals.
B00392A5U6|5|I had bought this product last year and couldn't find it anywhere. I love this eyeliner, so I bought two!!
B0000ZLEJG|5|I have to say, the reviews that the smell is \\"horrific\\" and other negative things -- are almost funny to me.  If you don't like the smell, then don't buy it!  (Stinky hippies? That's just sad and unnecessary meanness.)  Obviously it's not a great idea to buy any type of perfume online without knowing it first.  The reviews that are most helpful to me would be about the bottle the scent comes in, or if it arrived in the time expected.    The smell is beautiful, simple, and different on each person who wears it.  That is what makes it unique.
B00BUQ6656|1|Didn't work.
B00N9YOXE8|5|I love it so much!! Going to buy more in other colors!  Thank you!
B005HO0A1I|5|My family and I love all dove soaps.  The scents are nice without being overwhelming and I appreciate the fact that they are advertising using real women!!!
B000GDDKIU|5|I bought this cleanser for my son and I have noticed a difference in his skin. However, it is recommended to be used with an acne treatment gel/cream product.
B000F4USF8|5|I got this trimmer for my husband to use on his beard. He loves it and says that it works well. There are a few attachments with it so that you can trim different lengths. He's very happy with it.
B000C1UDZY|5|Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.
B00KCWRNOM|5|I had to get something after burning the crap out of my thumb and finger. These really help to protect me from branding my hands as I learn to use my straightener/curling iron. LOL! What was I thinking when I thought bobbed straight hair was going to be easy?
B000GRB3SA|4|It a bit more scented than I would like but I like it better than the bar plus make bathroom easier to clean
B00152SXLU|2|I heard great things about this particular hairbrush and was please to find it at a reduced price on Amazon. I have 3C-4B hair, shoulder length (Different textures) and I was told this brush is great for smoothing out the hair, but I have yet to experience that. I will re-try once I decide to blow dry, maybe I need the smaller version perhaps?
B001H989XI|5|I bought it for my fiance and she loved it,<br />thank you! I recommend this product to everyone. The color
B00CA7VAX2|2|They left glue type marks that were hard to remove.
B0016A03B4|5|I have been an Obagi user for over a year now and I love it!  Never used toner in the past but this is wonderful.
B007P29BCY|5|Cute and holds well. Looks more expensive then in the picture
979079777X|1|Although this packaging was the one I had hoped to receive, turned out vendor shipped me the wrong formula under the new packaging.  I have alerted them of this - they have offered to return it, which I did last July 17 and have yet to be reimbursed for it - it is now August 13, 2013!  Running after vendor to find out when my reimbursement will be issued on my credit card !
B000AORUEA|5|Smells good, arrived fast.
B009VK3O0S|5|This is a wonderful product! It protects your hair from the heat of drying and also shortens the drying time. It leaves your hair soft, shiny snd with a lovely scent
B00GTZCKXA|5|I have used this item twice since I purchased so far and can see color immediately, it does like it says and will continue to color throughout the next several hours. So far, seems to protect tattoos. Does seem to make me look firmer as well. Subtle smell- great product.
B00G8XL53E|5|This case is perfect and holds all my brushes perfectly...  Color is really pretty also...
B005GMYSC8|5|I am quite happy that I received this order sooner than expected.  The color of the lip shimmer is true to the decription, and I have found that it doesn't cake up and flake.  I am glad that I purchased is.
B000R8ZCUS|5|love this product.  it has a wonderful feel, smooth and easy to apply.  I find it evens out my skin tone. great under your moisturizer would recommend it.  The gal that does my facials introduced me to it years ago.
B006F5NOFW|5|i love it
B000WOVIC8|5|All great
B000W405SG|5|I like the performance of this hair trimmer and it's angle, just right to get at those unwanted stray hairs in the nose and ears, it also works great for trimming your mustache and beard if you have one.
B001DIOPIQ|4|not overpowering in coconut scent.  nice cleanser for sensitive skin.
B00RUJNUNI|3|It  leaves a white crust in your face, was not impress with this product..
B005MIFIQG|4|It doesn't seem to lighten my hair but it does condition my hair very well!
B001G7Q27Q|1|The bath sponge never softened up at all and did not conform to hands or body. Remained hard and stiff.
B00CNOUZE2|5|Works great, just shaved in the shower this morning. They also email detailed instructions to make sure you get the most out of your new mirror, great customer service
B0023XF60Q|1|Too oily, it may seem to work because your skin naturally gets use to shaving and the bumps will no longer appear so this is really doing nothing. It doesn't smell too nice either.
B0009J8XSS|1|Clippers came in box but appeared to be used once or more before. Blade was not straight and slightly crooked. Metal piece also had some slight damage to it with some dents on it. Then metal also had a bunch of finger prints. This was definitely not new and when I ordered it, it stated it was new. I am returning this and ordering another one. Hopefully this time it is new.
B001G0CBVY|5|Great lipstick. Very moisturizing.
B00JQ6LY3Q|5|Love it
B0058Z7PMI|5|It smells divine! Perfumes tend to bother me, but not this fragrance. Love it!! Would recommend to all that enjoy a light clean fragrance.
B0075AVBQA|3|As expected
B00O7A55MC|4|The product is good and i love it! Yet delivery is bit delayed.
B00BDJFLT2|4|Very nice. Makes your hair feel silky and healthy. Don't look for squeaky hair here because this shampoo does not do that, but don't worry, your hair is clean and really very manageable.
B00GZYZ14A|5|I got it so quick and quality and price was perfect thank you
B005BT9IO4|5|I like this. It has a light minty flavor. A little chalky. My story - I bought a relatively cheap rechargeable electric toothbrush for kids at Walmart (Oral B Pro Health Jr) because the adult version was just expensive, then used a daily regimen of combining several products - StaiNo Tooth Stain Eraser to rub problem areas directly, brushed with Plus White Xtra Whitening Toothpaste, then brushed with Eucryl Smokers Toothpowder for an abrasive, rinsed with Nature's Answer Complete Oral Care PerioWash, and then brushed my gums and gum line with NaturaRx Dentizyme drops. This was all to remove embarrassing dark brown stains along my gum line caused by years of smoking, coffee, tea, and soda.. that I thought was decay. My dentist verified this as being decay and said there was no way to remove it, but I was determined. I can't say exactly which products did the job, as I bought everything I could find with a great review and used them all at once.. but the lines were deep stains, and the stains were gone in a matter of days using these products. When I came back the following week for my first cleaning in years.. I also had almost no plaque left, other than a small amount between my teeth. Fastest cleaning ever.. 6 months later, the stains are still gone and I barely use anything but toothpaste now. Amazing, and I'm no longer embarrassed to smile!! Pain that I was having from a filling also subsided. To me.. all of those products get 5 stars!!
B00069Q342|5|excellent product. Hardens nails, and makes an excellent top coat. Not that easy to find. The seller got this to me in a timely manner. Very satisfied.
B0049LUI9O|4|works very good!
B00IID8SBY|5|Let me tell you, everyone I know has been talking about how beautiful my hair is lately! my eyelashes and nails have grown longer. On top of longer lashes, my skin is glowing. This is an amazing product that I will definitely continue using and recommend to everyone! *sample provided to review
B00021VCVS|5|Gets rid of chlorine odor and it's gentle on my skin.
B003W5YCVI|4|Nice smell....a good break from shampoo.
B00563K6VO|2|This glove does not work well - you can feel the heat through it and it makes it very difficult to style your hair with the glove on. I was going to return it, but paying for shipping really doesn't make it worth it.
B000O63ER6|3|can someone write about the packaging? Is it discreet? I don't want my parents or whoever receives my mail knowing what I buy:)
B00153JZ16|5|Great deodorant and hard to find in stores.
B00Q8JORQ0|5|I love, love, love these make-up brushes. They were given to me as an unexpected gift and I was shocked when I received them. I'm used to using cheap brushes and these are so luxurious and plush that it almost felt wicked using them.Also there is a brush for everything. The fibers are super soft, the handles are substantial and they come is a pretty sequined bag. They work so well I'll probably be making up my face a lot more than I used to.
B008IR8W7U|4|Arrived as expected very quickly.
B009MIYG7Y|5|this mirror is a good little mirror, got it for my granddaughter it serves the purpose.So is your looking for a cheap little mirror this is ok.
B007MF8846|5|Absolutely LOVE this product! It smells and amazing and feels great on my face. I'll definitely be using this face moisturizer from now on.
B00GJ1ZNXI|4|It kind of hurt my arms when I used it, but no problem on my legs.
B000GG0R1U|5|This is a great product, does what it is supposed to, but maybe 100 is too many. They are sealed and stay fresh but I only use 1 wipe every 20-30 days so a box of 100 may last me over 6 years. You might want to save some money and get the box of 50.
B005XSZS92|4|It makes my eyes look so much younger.  It is a quick fix and not a permanent one but I'll take that.  Once you wash your face or get it wet its gone, so NO crying ladies, and watch the eye drops too.
B00005JS55|5|I never thought I'd like an electric razor but so far so good.  I'm giving it the 30 days like it says to get use to it but I really like it.  My daughter, it's really her razor, loves it.  It's convenient, the battery stays charged a long time, and the shave is close and smooth.
B003JKC7VS|5|Came as promised promptly and works great as a deep conditioner.
B007K6LID0|4|If you only rinse for the 30 seconds the bottle says to, your tongue and mouth won't be burned.  I made this mistake once, and after I realized what the problem was, it didn't happen again.  I only use this at night as it does seem to affect the way food tastes when used in the morning.  I'm on my second bottle, and my teeth feel so clean.  Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  Also, the bottle says this may cause stains on your teeth, but that's only because of inadequate brushing, they say it's not permanent.
B001XURHBQ|4|A great shave and a convenient, sturdy container.<br />It would be nice to be able to pick which &#34;flavor&#34; of soap it came with.
B001RMP7M6|1|I was very disappointed with this product and returned it after a couple of tries. It didn't work as it was described.
B0037MIMK8|5|I've never used any other powder-- Covergirl Clean and Clear has been my key to keeping my skin looking nice since high school.  I will probably buy it again because it seems like the price on Amazon is the same as Walmart.
B005H46O7M|5|I luv these made my skin feel fantastic.  and thse facial masks  are a great price. I will  buy again!
B000TTBUBU|5|I have purchased several other breast enhancement creams, and I feel I have faster and better results with Lushbust.  It just disappears into the skin and not only are my boobs more full, but my skin feels stronger and more youthful lookng as well.
B00A8DHBH4|5|EXACTLY AS SHOWN AND I LOVE THEM
B009AFH0S6|4|Perfect size, seems to be well made, though there is some serious off-gassing from the plastic. Just don't take nose hit an you'll be fine.  Just what I was looking for.
B00PM26PLO|5|I absolutely love this product! I was looking for something light and fresh smelling to use as a toner and cleanser, and this is my favorite product by far. It does exactly what I need for it to do, and it's so light that it doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts. Highly recommended!
B0038397AA|3|I read about this product in a magazine recommending products for fine hair.  The writer said it was the best available for fine hair.  I do not care much for it.  I will finish it but will probably not purchase again.  My hair is fine, but not really thin and this product does not seem to add much volume and it dulls my hair.
B00BTYOBOC|4|I admire these lashes! Second to best from a lot I've tried.
B00GJXGMSQ|5|I've been using these for over a month now and am really impressed!  They did have a smell when I first received them, however, after machine washing the bag and hand washing all the brushes, the smell seems to be gone.  I haven't experienced any issues with bristles falling out either.  This is really a great set!  The only brushes that I don't really use much are the smaller eye shadow brushes.  All the other brushes I use daily.  Excellent quality -- especially for the price.  The only thing I would change is to make the bag a darker color -- this would do a better job of hiding makeup that gets on the bag from the brushes.
B008B7VTA4|5|Loved te color! And the shipping was so quick!
B00JOSEHTO|5|this is my first GHD product and i just dont  have words.<br />😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
B002X09I76|4|I did not really use this for skin. I used it for health. I'm not sure if it worked but I'm still alive.
B001CWY7KO|5|a must in every makeup bag!
B0002DO1RS|5|Happy with purchase
B003K2IF4I|5|Awesome product. works on the worst of cracked heals.Got some for my daughter and it worked for her as well.
B00NG7R5RA|5|The case is awesome!  Nice bright color.  Works great.
B00D2J39PE|5|No complaints.  I received all the colors as advertised.  They fit nicely and function as intended.  No complaints.
B000WHNI2I|4|There is not much for me to say about this product, but I needed toothbrush heads to brush my teeth. So they work, they were new, and I was satisfied.
B004H3QCPS|5|Good for scar, but it is better to buy a massage applicator with it.
B000FKLLOY|2|I usually use Beyond the Zone's version of this but amazon doesn't care that line so i settled for this. it's not nearly as good or even worth bothering with.
B00D0NNR6S|5|nice
B0030HHXAU|5|I bought this product for my wife. She absolutely loves it. I am sure that she will buy again.
B006Y7TZUY|5|I've tried a lot of Shea Butter soaps in the past, and I've got to say, this is great stuff, especially for the price.
B00JQ12U0M|5|face feels very clean
B002PMP34Y|2|This was the first time that tried coloring my hair to hide the grays that were sneaking in. I chose an ammonia-free color (Soft Golden Blonde) because it was supposed to be gentle but my hair feels like straw after I wash it, even though it's been over a month. I used to bleach my hair years ago and it never felt like straw. I wouldn't use this product again.
B00T7FOPPU|4|Love the rings. Some of them came broken but I didn't mind they were very cheap.
B001KYRLTI|5|I was using Chapstick Peppermint but I noticed my lips were getting addicted to it because of the lanolin so I switched to Beeswax and now I do not have to apply as often as I use to.
B0013SLPX4|1|These are only really useful if you use them with the [[ASIN:B000ZWR1DW TheraFlu Flowing Vapors Vapor Fan]] they fill.  They aren't medicated, they don't have all that powerful a smell, and they just aren't much use unless you're just looking for the smell of eucalyptus.  At least they come with a replacement holder to go in the fan incase you somehow broke the original.  I got no benefit at all from these.
B0088E402E|4|soap and shea butter very good quality, wish the packing had been containers. not plastic bags. I wasted a lot of the butter transferring to a container,
B00IIECUU8|5|super soft brushes and very little shedding. I use it everyday. Definitely worth the money! I would recommend this to a friend.
B007SPQA36|5|Great sun screen and moisturizer in one
B000SMOHHW|5|It is cheap and feels good can't tell your very wearing it so if your looking for a eye mask this one is the right one
B009JVYBM4|5|A bright medium pink with lots of sparkle, not for your french manicure.  Has good lasting ability, I can get at least a week to 2 weeks without too much chipping.
B001I9MZXC|5|Solved our eczema dilemmas where thousands of dolla s worth of products failed! We use organic raw Shea butter everyday and this for skin breakdown.
B000F63TW0|5|Definitely see and feel a difference after using regularly for around a month.  My skin is sun-damaged from growing up outdoors under a tropical sun.  I use this around 2X a week (final step in the shower) and I love it!  My dark spots are evening out, and my skin looks and feels much smoother.  Pushing 50 and my skin glows!
B00HLZ8SG0|5|Really love this wig! Beautiful color, looks natural - not too shiny. Has great body and curl. Can't see the tracks, looks very good on. Very happy.
B001ET7K6S|5|It makes your skin feel good not greasy.  It is a very light moisturizer.  It smells clean That is all I have to say
B00CHT0OGW|1|The metal part seems very good but one side of the plastic thing came broken. It was not well protected when it was delivered. I have read that the same thing happened to others.<br /><br />it should come in a small box and with good protection because it came in an envelope. I will ask to be replaced, but I am disappointed because this is the first time with Amazon Prime that some like that happened. I think is a good item but it was not well protected.
B00126ZXPI|2|not happy
B00QYOSKH6|5|After years of owning poorly built trimmers that feel like they are held together with rubber bands, I wish I would have found this sooner. Very solid built, strong motor that doesn't slow when it nears hair out of fear and the accessories are all well designed. The carrying pouch tops it all off to help keep everything together and clean.
B00BS2FT64|5|i love it.  will by it again thank you .
B00GRIKO00|5|It came in well packaged and with a new wig cap. I didn't have any issues with it being thin in the back like some customers reported. It does tangle very easily but such is to be expected with long wigs. A good wide tooth comb and some tlc and it says perfect. I ordered to use for a cosplay and it is exactally what I wanted.
B00AAY5KZQ|5|Great price, cheaper even with shipping
B00K30GKHY|5|When I ordered this I just knew it was the best price, but I did not realize how large the bottle was.  This size at any local store would have been 20-30 dollars more.  Very happy!
B00I33UL3W|4|Great color!
B00U1WC2JY|4|I would give this 5 stars but its a little smaller than I thought it would be. For most people, its a pretty standard size but I am a big guy lol. The quality though is really good and its easy to suds as well. It also seems to be holding up well.
B001CB4OCQ|5|It heps mend fried ends.
B008B4TIPA|5|I have searched my whole life to find something that worked for my hair. I have long straight hair that even with a gallon of THE BEST hair spray ($20 A BOTTLE) still would fall out no matter what I did. I really didn't want to spend more $ on something that yet again didn't work. A friend told me about the Curling Wand and told me to try it. So I purchased this one and OMG I am so happy I did. It took me 1/4 of the time to curl my hair and 4 hours later IT STILL LOOKS LIKE IT DID THIS MORNING WHEN I GOT DONE!! and they best part I didn't use ANY hair spray!!! I couldn't be happier with this product. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
B0009QZSS4|5|I AM HAPPY WHIT THIS ITEM. IT IS GREAT. I LOVE IT. I RECOMEND IT. IT IS WHAT I WANTED.
B008DFV92M|5|Great product!!  Holds twist for days!!!! Light and not greasy! Perfect for natural hairstyling to promote healthy growth. Love it!
B0010ZEUVY|5|I purchased this perfume not to long ago and I love it. I also go the Love on too and they both smell wonderful. I truely recommanded you try it, you will not regret it. I get so many compliment.
B00474HAT4|5|This was a gift, but I have one and absolutely love it  Holds a lot of stuff, good large compartments,  perfect for travel to take everything in one place
B00475J4R4|3|This product is just as good as ones found in the drugstore but at twice the cost.  I won't be buying again.
B000OLXRXC|5|If you love a flawless finish with your foundation then this is the one for you. I have been using this product for years and it always has the same wonderful results.
B001OQKVO4|5|Was looking for an inexpensive option to my Lancome and this is great! Will definitely buy it again. Love it!
B00CB8S8LC|5|Love this product --
B008EH0R0O|5|every one of these was well received.  this is Haute Coutre perfume; only one drop is needed for neck and wrists.  i love that each one is individually packaged, so i got 5 presents for 5 different ladies, all in one package and for a great price.. well designed perfumes: they give off different &#34;notes&#34; throughout the day.  ooh-la-la!
B0001AFM34|5|Not wanting aluminum in my deodorant, it can be difficult to find one that also provides good protection. Liquid Rock does the job and it's safe to use.
B00H93NJLS|4|High Points: Little goes a long way Bottle is large and price is cheap Skins feels great after a month of AM and PM use  Cons: Bad odor
B00066N93I|5|It is my most favorite body spray.  I use it everyday. I have my mother, daughter and sister using it. LOVE IT.
B000CRZ02E|4|I purchased this basket for my mom and we both loved the scent. The basket is nice as well and the items inside were exactly as described. The basket itself is a great piece.
B00479FP4Q|5|I love these facials cloths. You can cut them in half and double the amount you get. They really do a good job removing the dirt and oil.
B00FZ84P7Q|5|I used to soak my hair in conditioners. I used Aveda products and now I've changed my ways to the completely natural line of skin & hair care from Christina Moss Naturals. I put a small amount of conditioner in my hair while using her silky glycerin soap and then a smaller amount out of the shower as a leave in for my ends - great idea for longer hair. My new favorite conditioner!!!
B00E1IHVS6|5|beautifully done - nice fabric and size. The rhinestones are perfect
B001SERK9G|5|Love this face cleaner, works great.
B002B8VE4U|5|My daughter is in UK and her friend used it. She apparently did not flip switch so it stopped but did not short out. Once they got the correct setting it worked well.
B00MYIIWP6|3|This stuff doesn't last and it's not the easiest way to contour. Overall, it's an OK product.
B001ET774S|5|I cannot find at any store and must purchase  online.<br />This foaming bath makes me happier than the white rain product I used for a while.<br />It has a wonderful soft smell, it is very thick and creamy and I would give it 10 stars if I could,
B00150DBN2|1|After using other Revaleskin products that were excellent, I find this product disappointing.  It does not lather, and I don't feel like my skin is clean after using it.
B00PJAH2UW|5|I never write reviews, but this serum really does work. This is not a &#34;fake&#34; review. I have been using this twice daily for two and a half months. I have noticed that my eyebrow hair has become longer and thicker. There has also been new growth! I still have to fill in areas to make the perfect brow...who doesn't at age 49? Now I feel that they just look better. I have taken pictures before and after. The serum has allowed me to pluck, trim and give my brows some real shape. I will definitely continue to use this product.
B002VA4LMU|5|I have tried all kinds of age spot products and this is one that works. I have a large spot over my right eye above my eyebrow and it makes me feel older than I am. I bought a sample size for $1.00 at WalMart figuring that I had nothing to lose. Well, I lost the age spot; it is gone. I have started using it in other areas and have gotten the same great results. For the price and performance, this is well worth it.
B007MPDZ44|5|I only buy hair from them. I normally keep it in for about a month
B00CLIC7E6|5|Best leave in conditioner. My hair is severely damaged and dry, but this makes it look soft and healthy
B0000AOWP6|3|This model was my first epilator.  Compared to other epilators:  it does work on batteries, and is not as loud as most others, so that is convenient.  But--the big drawback--it does not remove hair as well as the more pricey models.  It removes some hair, but other hair, I went over again and again and the hair still sat there untouched.  I love epilators, but I recommend that you spend a bit more for better quality.  What good is an epilator that does not epilate?  The Emjoi Gently Gold carress is rechargeable, and works well, but I think the Emjoi Optima and Braun silk-epil, both corded, do the best job.  Check them out before you buy this one.
B000Z604G4|4|I usually don't write reviews but I LOVE this mascara.  I tried a sample about a year ago and I haven't turned back since.  I refuse to purchase any other mascara.  It does take a extra second or two to dry but once it does you will have long think lashes.
B003JNCJWW|4|It is ok and it did not make my review to the highest.  My feet still hurt and sometimes real bad.  I had wanted the cream to stop the hurting fell short.
B006UET4XE|2|the pen seem to dry up pretty fast. After 2 weeks use then pretty much seem dry and hard to use afterward
B0049LUI9O|4|So far, this item is working just fine. It is very comfortable to handle and so far it does not pull the hairs.
B008CC3SMK|4|A good antiperspirant, and as advertised - lasts 48 hours. Double pack makes it a good price point. Using for about 6 months and pleased with the product. Doesn't stain clothing, clear gel goes on easily and dries quickly.
B00A6KN146|5|Aha, I'll have plenty of this for a while - YAY!
B001EWEP86|5|This is an excellent buy and it works in an excellent way. I am glad I bought this and have appreciated it's dependability for a while now!
B00T2TQW52|5|Love these NIPOO Chiffon Flower Hair Clips! These are So Pretty & Delicate Looking. Lovely Summer Fun Colors. Made of Soft Chiffon fabric. Very Pretty and come in five bright vibrant colors. I'm glad I got to test these out for my honest unbiased opinion.  I'm really impressed with these. The quality & everything. Looks very Pretty on, Me & my daughter are Enjoying them. These are just really well made, easy to use, and clips are strong and stay in place.
B00011THUC|5|I first discovered Irene Gari Lip Base locally several years ago.  I was unfamiliar with the brand, but I'm very glad I gave it a try.  As I've gotten, um, older, my skin has become much dryer; in addition, I live in a high-altitude area where dryness is a given.  I've found that this product is the best to use with lipstick or lip gloss.  It keeps the lipstick from bleeding and also provides needed moisturizing help.  And it does those jobs better than anything else I've used.   I can't find it locally any more, so I'm counting on Amazon to keep me supplied!
B00O1IZPE8|5|Loved these even more than 24/7 Urban Decay eyeliner. Once they are on they stay put even on my waterline. Great price, I will be repurchasing these. Trying to find other colors.
B00AO3778Q|5|Works as expected - price was right.
B00BQ03A28|5|Great lashes
B00B7ULV78|4|The texture of this is very similar to a traditional solid deodorant. It doesn't irritate my underarms like some of the other natural brands do. The scent is light and not overpowering.
B005GQ6FYS|2|Sleak and Shine's conditioner is amazingly thick and creamy and cuts right through my messy hair.  BUT the shampoo is thin without any cream.  I had to rinse and  repeat just to feel clean.  I recommend Triple nutrican for shampoo ans sleek and shine for conditioner.
B002XQ1RAG|5|I love the fragrance, while it looks like a tester, the fragrance is soft and beautiful and lasts all day.<br />Great purchase for me to try D&G products.<br /><br />Love it.
B0050NWCQ2|4|The one drawback is its a little too small and the larger ones don't have the attached fold out mirror!
B006GDEBB4|5|Just as expected, fast shipping
B001D3K6U2|1|Not crushed shell. It's just glitter. It says crushed she'll and all I got was some glitter.
B0050C76CI|5|So refreshing!
B008PQ5YC0|5|i love trying new  make up but hate paying full price and then not liking them this sample pack is great because now i know that i love the poreless and the lip primer
B0019JF0Q0|5|This hairspray is light and has almost no fragrance at all. It holds very well and combs out at the end of the day easily.
B004S9W2SC|5|It's only one application needed vs the four applications I have used daily with other brands. I appreciate the saving of time and it looks great
B003I90DH0|5|Best dry shampoo brand. Only one I use and have tried dozens! Hard to find in stores so so happy I found it here!
B009CHBQCI|1|Bristles are way TOO HARD!
B007D3S9CI|5|I am so happy to find a natural antibacterial hand soap. We got a couple of these especially because we were expecting a baby and wanted visitors to be toxic free when touching baby's skin. Now I'll never use anything else!
B0074RLEZC|5|I Continuously ordered this protect for the last three months and I love it.  It works fast and my spots are near gone.  I will continue to order for everyday maintenance!
B0016B5HU0|5|I love the smell of this oil blend.  Very hippy!
B002VANNWY|3|I pretty much summed it up in the summary line above.  We love the scent of the bubble bath and like California baby products but if you use 3-4 capfuls per bath, which is on the lower end of what they recommend, it doesn't last long at all.
B00J6NDPAY|5|I absolutely love using Beauty Junkee brushes. Super dense and soft. Holds product very well. I like how large the brush is. This brush did not smell at all. I am a loyal Beauty Junkee customer. Thank You Beauty Junkees!
B00JX979CQ|5|I love this stuff!! And so does my niece as it helps with her eczema. Its reduces the visibility of scars too ....very happy
B0007KX8FW|5|So happy to have found this!  It's the only thing that works on my curly hair to &#34;straighten&#34; it.  Very hard to come by. Great Value!
B000XXTAZK|1|Very disappointed in this product.<br /><br />After using perhaps four times, it started to not cut properly and would grab my hair while I was trying to cut it.<br /><br />Then it started making a VERY loud rattling noise.<br /><br />The Wahl I owned before this one lasted 15 years....guess I'll have to buy a Wahl.
B0015Q0VCA|5|My stylist first used this when she did my hair and I fell in love with it!  It helps me to make my short hair into sassy short hair!  Smells fantastic - I love it!
B001HC4W2M|5|WONDERFUL!
B00KFNDWSY|5|This is a great product, it smells wonderful and the natural ingredients does not bother my skin or burn my eyes when i sweat.
B00HSNWXZM|5|I use Caress Body Wash a lot and like it.  It lathers well and a little goes a long way.  It rinses off well and doesn't dry out my skin. I enjoyed this new scent as well.  It is strong so if you are sensitive to scents you might not like this, but the scent doesn't last for long either so I have no problem with it.
B002TTN7RS|5|i love it its awesome
B00J4EXPE6|5|great product
B0092MCQH2|4|I am transitioning to natural. Does a great job straightening my roots! However It doesn't straighten the rest of my hair as well
B002ZU4T96|5|I have used this mascara for years now and it is all that it says it is.  I hope Maybelline never stops making it!
B0015NZ6FK|5|Blocks light well but heavy.
B00BMVQXQQ|5|This is the best product for in between hair coloring.  It really hides the roots.
B00E4PMQAO|4|Advertised to come with a battery, but I had to buy one to use it. Seems to work fine, I hope it lasts a quarter as long as the lifetime warranty.
B00E7FBPVC|5|Nice - really love the scent
B0053V5HYU|4|This is a good product if you don't use it everyday. I only wear it if I am going somewhere and then I shampoo immediately when I get home. It can clump up on your scalp and it makes quite a mess when you put it on. Seems like that powder flies everywhere. But once it is on and I spray my hair, its good to go for a long time. Like I said , it does work.
B0094GHU3Q|3|This is a pretty lilac color, which I'd say is true to the picture.  I have two major gripes though: firstly, the product is fairly powdery, and has quite a bit of fallout when trying to apply -- and secondly, there's a definite glitter effect which I didn't expect.  The chunks of glitter are quite large and noticeable.  The shadow stays on okay with primer, but isn't the most long-lasting.  Not bad, but I'd look for a less glittery shadow unless you really like that look.
B000G1785S|4|Gives a great shave, and cleaning system is very convenient. It looks cool too. <br />Slight negatives: (1) not the quietest way to shave your face; (2) cleaning mechanism creates a lot of noise--you'll need to get used to it or avoid it by vacating the room or just hopping in the shower after shaving; (3) cleaning fluid will easily spill out of the base if you're not careful with the base.
B0015TI71Y|3|I bought this b/c I thought it's 4 packs as it's said. Usually, toe spreader comes with 2cts per pack so I thought it's total 8counts if it's 4 packs. That was totally misleading. It was 4 counts not 4 packs! Plus, it didn't even come as sealed package instead was inside of ziplock bag. Worse, the medium size is too big for size 6 woman feet. Should have ordered regular 2cts per pack in small size. I really want to send these back for return. The product otherwise very soft. Would have been nice if size fits. Very disappointing.
B00IAA4KP8|5|Great Buy!!!
B00153C644|5|I think this is a great product.  It's much more trimmer than Bliss product- but the lotion that comes with it is very nice and effective, even though I personally associate citrus with stinging and this was not the case.    There are many attachments and although this product is a little pricey, I've been needing something like this and it will basically do anything you need it to do. I have not tried the epilator yet because I'm scared of it.
B00J1FKWUS|5|I have use many many cleansing cloths, but they are not like Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing cloths. It leaves your skin Clean and smooth. I will purchase it again again.
B00EBUQUOU|5|Nice gift for a teacher
B0054Y44YK|5|I only use this for my hair. Great coverage for gray hair.  Leaves my hair shiny and feeling so soft.
B00QIY6VKU|4|I gave this product four stars due to the fact that I have never used the product prior and did not receive any instructions with it. So I attempted to apply the product and found that it is personally not for me. The tightening of the skin  around my eyes when I applied the product, I could not handle. If you are looking for a firming lotion; this is for you, but I did not like the way it made me look.
B00CDX0XWM|3|I bought this because one of my friends with acne scars said this helped her get rid of them or fade them significantly. I personally don't have a problem with acne or scaring or any other facial blemishes, so as far as my results go; My skin feels fresh and firm after using it, and maybe a little brighter but nothing long term and nothing I haven't seen in any other clay or mud masks.
B00HZDVZ2M|4|This is the best self tanning I have ever used, you get a true real tan and I get so many compliments, but hat the smell and the glove does not last long...But the best of the best
B002NVBR24|5|This is amazing stuff. I've tried the stuff you can buy at drug stores, but there is nothing that offers the same results!
B00C7V58CU|5|good product
B00538TSMU|5|Very nice to have different looks . Dark lashes which feels a little heavy but I wear those at night going out.  The lighter ones are perfect for everyday wear as they don't feel heavy .
B000VOHNCI|4|bueno
B0076L9YW6|5|I love these nail strips! They take minutes to put on and last for days, Plus my nails r small so i get two uses out of each box instead of just one.
B006GQYSC8|4|Seems a little slow to shave with, but it works
B008JD4PGU|5|THE REPLACEMENT PARTS HAS IMPROVEMENTS COMPARED TO MY ORIGINAL PARTS. AND FIT GOOD. MY ORIGINAL FRAME TAB DID BREAK. THE REPLACEMENT PARTS SEEMS TO HAVE STRONGER TABS.<br />THE HEAD SUPPORT FITS GOOD ON MY FOREHEAD.
B006R4C79A|5|I LOVE this product; the smell is amazing!!
B001NOEH6K|5|Best clippers ever!
B002YJAV3Q|5|I came across AG Colour Savour shampoo when I was trying to find a paraben free shampoo due to developing a allergy to topical parabens. (Yes this was diagnosed and I would break out in blisters on my head and body with contact to any parabens.) I also wanted a great color care shampoo so I came across AG. I now can't imagine using anything else! It is so excellent and lathers so creamy even though it is sulfate free. I can honestly say that my hair is in the best health it has ever been (and I get my hair colored blonde so it easily would get dried out and break.) I orginially bought this when my hair was dark and I thought it did an excellent job of keeping my color from fading and now I have lightened my hair and I still think its great. Just all around very gentle and good cleanser for your hair.
B00354R9RU|5|This coglone smells like ck euphoria, and smells really nice, well worth the price.I originaly bought some of this in NYC on the street and loved it I could not find it any where so I was excited when I found it! I  had to buy 2 of them from this seller.
B00HJAXZ4M|5|I was very skeptical ordering this since it was cheaper than if I bought it in a store. It arrived promptly and it is the real thing. it looks small but wen you apply water as ou are supposed to it quickly grows to the size you see you tubers and professionals use. Wonderful product and authentic.
B001E0VBDK|5|love it, it's better for you to purchase shea butter with it. And use it after face washing
B00336EUSQ|5|With everyday use - multiple times a day of course, this toothpaste really does whiten your teeth. I am a smoker and I can definitely tell a difference 100%. The mint taste is great and my mouth feels very clean and fresh after use. You don't taste any whitening ingredients or aftertaste as with some of the other whitening toothpastes. I have tried pretty much every whitening toothpaste out there from various brands and this is the first and only one where I could actually tell that it worked and worked well. The only downfall and this is very minimal, is that it does seem to make my mouth a little dry right after use, as well as my lips. I use lip balm or gloss constantly anyway though, so it isn't a problem. Just thought I'd mention it though. I definitely recommend this toothpaste and Amazon has the best price to buy in bulk!
B00CPWRV08|4|Two days using and my skin feels so much better and my acne is clearing up.<br />I don't use the cleanser it came with. I use coconut oil because I have oily skin.
B00CQ7QHXY|5|I like it better than regular floss, it's unwaxed, it's sturdy, doesn't easily snap, and it's gentle on gums.  The Reach woven floss was gentle on gums but would snap and get fuzzy which would start to wear certain spots thin.  The fibers would sometimes get stuck in between my teeth and then the thin spots would break/snap.  Dr. Tungs holds up better.
B00QB3SGJW|5|I like the fact that it truly is unsented. Some days thats what you need
B0002I407Y|5|I am a big fan of peppermint and I almost fainted when my boyfriend gave this gift pack to me for our seven month aniversary.  It is the most pleasant, yet effective way to wake up in the morning and stay cool in the central valley of California.  Everyone should try it.
B004JTOBB2|5|I love my eyeliner! !
B002UD52WQ|3|There is no such thing as a miracle shampoo that will regrow hair lets face it. I have tried everything and this was no exception. The good thing is I noticed a lot less hair falling out into my sink when I run my hands through it. Downside is I don;t see any new hair growth. This stuff is pricey too. Over all a decent product but again it's pricey. I also used this will the spray.
B000S94HM0|3|I've always used astringents as aftershaves (oh, Bonne Bell, where are you now?). As a Khiel's fan, I bought this astringent, and have to say that I was disappointed.    One, it's quite drying, which may be fine for people with oily skin, but isn't for me, especially after shaving. Two, once it dries it creates a kind of barrier on the skin that, at least in my case, prevented my moisturizer from being absorbed. There it sat, on my skin, until I wiped it away.    So, to reiterate, I'd only recommend this is cases of chronic oily skin, and not as an after-shave.
B007U90JC8|5|Perfect
B008TBTA6C|5|I finally used these scissors to cut my daughters hair, they were amazing! So smooth and they cut so nicely.
B001E729CK|5|I have used this for years. They quit selling at my local store so I purchase from Amazon at a great price. I use weekly as a full body salt scrub which leaves my skin baby soft...
B007JLKYO0|5|And still loving it. This seemed like an extravagant buy when I got it. I justified it as a Christmas gift, but now that I've used it for a year I couldn't live without it!  This thing totally organizes the mess on  your counter. Very high quality plastic. As pretty as the day I got it. Easy to clean. Buy with confidence!
B00O4F2KO6|5|Amazing fragrance!
B00FBVRR4U|5|I know the price could be a but outrageous, but I have to say I've spent far more on bottled conditioners that didn't deliver as well as this does.  I ONLY use this on the ends of the back of my hair, unless I'm going for a ponytail then I will massage my scalp also.  It smells good, its so creamy and makes my hair feel like silk!!  Just a little to heavy for my scalp but like I said its nice to use all over for scalp moisture when you don't plan on wearing your hair down.  Hair is soft, bouncy and manageable.. my brittle ends are doing really well and I haven't had much breakage, if any,  since using this product.
B000F5NRQY|2|I love Truefitt and Hill but this is way too watery.
B004N53U46|4|Its true what it said in the label that it can shrink your pores. And about the whitening,i need a little more time.coz ive been using it for i think 2 weeks now. Feels very quick to absorb by your skin. Thats all i can say for now.
B0037WXB0Y|5|I love this perfume and I was able to get it for a lower price than I would at a department store. Shipping was pretty fast too.
B001QX4GDC|5|These are great and functional everyday hairbrushes.
B00PR2NQJS|5|This is a great tool....I love it ..  I would highly recommend this curler ... Its easy to use and the results are amazing...I could be a spokes person for this product... I am a Cosmetologist .... it makes my job easier ...
B00H5A513O|5|Beauty is painful because this really works! By the end of the week i was shedding massive dead skin and new skin was resurfacing. I saw an improvement with my wrinkles and its only been a month that ive been using it so unfortunately  my acne scars and dark spots are still visable. Hopefully they start to dissappear over time. Im using a soft face scrub bought from daiso along with the  Neutrogena soap bar for acne (since my skin gets super oily and breaks out easily). Also the brush is definitely a great tool to use to remove the dead skin. Its really difficult for me to stay consistant w the derma roller because its really painful -_-' is it worth the pain though? Absolutely! !
B001CD3M72|1|Purchased the Micro Touch Max for my husband. It would not trim anything. He tried the back of his neck, around his mustache and even down his arm and not one single hair was removed. What an horrible Christmas gift this made.
B00K5ZN0CU|5|Love this! I have eczema and have been searching for a cream that doesn't make me bumpy. Seriously the best I've tried!!!
B00029P414|5|I bought this massager for my 87 year old aunt, who suffers from leg cramps so bad that they wake her up at night.  She is a heart patient, so even though she is thin, she has some restricted circulation problems.  I asked her doctor before hand if this would be a good product (always a good idea to ask the doc, especially with the elderly).  Any way, he said it couldn't hurt, so I got it.  <br />SHE LOVES IT....NO MORE CRAMPING AT NIGHT AND NO MORE NUMBNESS IN HER LEGS..  She is one happy camper. <br />The only negative is that it is a bit pricy.  By the looks of it, they could sell it for less, still make money, and a lot more people could be helped.  I thought long and hard before spending nearly 300 bucks for this item.  <br />Bottom Line...If you can afford it, buy it..It's great..
B00IMB9HJ4|4|This shipped to me a week earier then the estimated ship date. It was extremely affordable. 7 out of the 8 colors were wonderful. One of the blacks was not powder but felt more like sand and cannot be used as eyeshadow. But again for the price, 7 out of 8 was good. It did come with another black that was perfect and lasted long.
B004UGW58A|4|The fragrances of other Healing Garden lotions are too strong for my liking, but this one has been a favorite for years.
B003CJ1HOY|5|I spend like 3 months looking for the right brush, since my hay is really wild and frizzy. They really take out those unwanted waves once you use it with the hair dryer. I bought 3 different sizes.
B00KOCR17Y|5|I really like the gloves and they fit my medium size hands really well.  I think they're well-constructed and I haven't had any problems with them.  I recommend to anyone looking to protect their hands from harmful UV rays.
B000C1UBR4|3|Eternity is a rather weak perfume. It's barely perceptible after application and its effects wear out in a few hours. It is not suitable for a full day use - especially if you have long working hours and a high-stress work enviroment. I am going back to Chrome Azzaro
B007ZSQ5HM|4|Pros: good quality. durable plastic. works well.<br />Cons: points are a little sharp, can be scratchy if you brush too hard.
B001IJ1PBK|5|I had rosacea pretty bad. My skin was blotchy and I had flare ups often and I have sensitive skin as well. This product (along with a change in diet) cleared it right up. My skin looks even and glowing and I get many compliments on how good it looks. Also, I do not wear foundation. If anyone has rosacea and is having a hard time finding a moisturizer give this a try!
B00E4ZPV9M|5|The product works fine, does not have a too strong fragrance, and also does not contribute too much for stains. I recommend.
B00FKR7SZS|5|So far the clippers work great. I have only cut my husband's hair twice with them, but they work great and I love not having to deal with a cord. I went with Wahl Professional clipper because the last one I bought lasted 15 years.
B00A46ORLS|1|I have only been using this product for about 4 days but so far I'm not liking it!  It feels sticky going on and it starts flaking as it dries!  I also bought the Radiance Eye Cream and that seems to be better but of course it's really to soon to tell if it is going to work for the undereye area...the lotion I would love to return but I threw away the box it came in because although I have not been totally inpressed with other face lotions I have never had one that flaked on me....that's my opinion of Radiance!
B00PC7YG88|5|Fun color changing polish!
