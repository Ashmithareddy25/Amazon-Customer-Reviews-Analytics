B00005NWRS|1.0|Ryan Adams is a minimally talented, pretentious, pompous twit with an ego as vast as San Fran Bay. There's no realy way to describe this album other than to say it's profoundly silly and creates in the listener the deep desire to destroy every acoustic guitar and coffee-house warbler from Norfolk, VA to Long beach, CA. Adams thinks he's making deep and significant Art; unfortunately, so do his deluded, oh-so-sensitive fans.
0789723107|5.0|A practical Web design usability guide, &quot;Don't Make Me Think!&quot; is based on empirical observation not exhaustive statistics. Steve Krug's five years of usability consulting and testing are distilled down to this thin yet gem-filled how-to. Krug observed how people actually use the Web rather than how we *think* they use it, gleaning key usability guidelines. Most folks can't afford a full-blown usability consult, but they can afford to buy a $35 book. This book shows you how to conduct your own usability tests on the cheap. What follows is a summary of the book's major rules and observations:<br />1. Don't Make Me Think!<br />The number one usability rule, most often expresed by users. Web pages should be self-evident, obvious, and self-explanatory. Buttons should have short text and look clickable. The default search for your site should be simple.<br />2. Design for scanning not reading<br />By observing users Krug found that people glance, scan some text, and click on the first reasonable option (called &quot;satisficing&quot;). People scan Web pages, they don't read them. We don't make optimal choices, we satisfice.<br />Here are some things you can do to make sure users understand as much of your site as possible:<br />a. Create a clear visual hierarchy to show relative importance of content (H1/H2 etc.) <BR>b. Take advantage of conventions <BR>c. Break pages up into clearly defined areas <BR>d. Make it obvious what's clickable <BR>e. Minimize noise <br />3. Users like mindless choices<br />Make each click an unambiguous orthogonal alternative.<br />4. Omit needless words<br />Get rid of half of the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left. This is especially important on home pages and<BR>gateway pages.<br />5. Navigation: Use street signs and breadcrumbs<br />Factoid: The back button accounts for 30 to 40 percent of all Web clicks. Persistent navigation appears on every page of the site and should include the following five elements:<br />a. Site ID <BR>b. A way home <BR>c. Search <BR>d. Sections <BR>e. Utilities <br />Your navigation should answer these questions:<br />a. What site is this? <BR>b. What page am I on? <BR>c. What are the major sections of this site? <BR>d. What are my options at this level? <BR>e. Where am my in the scheme of things? <BR>f. How can I search? <br />6. Your home page should convey the big picture<br />What is the site about? Use a good short tag line and welcome blurb. Rotate site promotions. Remove everything nonessential.<br />7. Most Web design usability arguments are waste of time<br />These &quot;religious debates&quot; consist of people expressing strongly held personal beliefs about things that can't be proven. All Web users are unique. There are no average users. There are no simple &quot;right&quot; answers for most Web design questions. What works is good integrated design that fills a need, that's carefully thought out, well executed, and tested.<br />The antidote for religious debate is to ask specific questions and test with real users. The last three chapters of the book show how to perform testing on the cheap with three or four users. I really enjoyed this book, especially Krug's easy humor. From WebReference.com.

0156421178|5.0|This story provides vivid depiction on the Spanish civil war from someone who fought the batlles in the trenches. Like all Orwell books the subject matter is dealt with in an extremly honest manner. The story takes place as a young Orwell follows his idealistic goals in fighting for the Spanish Anachists. The book demonstrats the mess the war evolvs into.<BR>What I really appreciate most about Orwell is his candidness and open mindedness. The book starts with his conviction of the rightness of the communists and anarchists and ends with his disgust with the insainity, corruption, and incompetence of the players involved. Sometimes virtue and good intentions alone arnt enough.<BR>I would judge this book as one of the best of Orwells works.
B00000DLUV|5.0|Whether one is new to the Bee Gees or a seasoned fan, this is a must-have CD. In fact, for the newcomer, there is really no better place to start than with this 24-track 77-minute live disc covering a 30-year time frame (1967-1997).<br />The brothers provide a gorgeous overview of their early years (1967-1972) with a few of their best-loved songs--gems like &quot;Massachussets&quot; and &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; to name but two.  Naturally, no Bee Gees concert would be complete without a selection of songs from their most commercially-successful period to date (1975-1979), and this era is wonderfully represented with songs that include the Saturday Night Fever hits. (&quot;Night Fever&quot; and &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; are, it should be mentioned, abbreviated versions with the former melding seamlessly and stunningly into the latter).<br />Lest anyone be surprised and, perhaps, disappointed, foreshortened versions (with all three brothers around a single mike and fairly minimal musical accompaniment) are presented for &quot;I Can't See Nobody&quot; (1:23), &quot;And the Sun Will Shine&quot; (1:49), &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot; (0:58), &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (1:00) which was originally written for Dionne Warwick, and &quot;Guilty&quot; (2:15) which was originally written for Barbra Streisand.<br />Features which are unique to this CD include: A full-length, fully-accompanied version of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (originally written for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton); &quot;Our Love (Don't Throw it all Away),&quot; during the latter part of which the Bee Gees very tastefully and touchingly accompany the previously-recorded voice of their late-brother Andy; &quot;Grease,&quot; the title song to the 1977 movie, the latter part of which is performed by the previously-recorded voice of Frankie Valli, with the Gibbs accompanying; and last but not least, &quot;Immortality,&quot; performed by Celine Dion and accompanied by the Bee Gees.<br />Most impressive of all on this CD is the quality, not only of the music, but of the presentation. Unlike so many live recordings, there are no mumbled or off-key vocals and no sloppy musical accompaniment. On the contrary, the performance by the band (which includes Maurice, Barry, and Barry's son Stephen) is as tight, smooth and professional as any studio recording. Vocally, the harmonies of the Gibbs are as impeccable as ever, with voices as strong and resonant as they were 30 years ago. Further, a very classy and effective strategy was the use of &quot;You Should be Dancing&quot; to encapsulate the concert, giving it a nice feeling of completion with the performance coming full circle.<br />In conclusion, there may, perhaps, be other artists who have produced live recordings of an equally exceptional quality; there are, however, none who have produced better. This CD serves as a testament, more than anything, to the fact that the Brothers Gibb are far more than great studio musicians; they are, in addition to being first-rate songwriters, absolutely outstanding live performers. The end result is a CD that is not only one of the Bee Gees best, it is one of the best of all time. Extremely highly recommended.
B000002NZO|4.0|I think Trespass is probably the most overlooked and under-appreciated albums in the Genesis catalog.  Released in 1970, it has a few things going against it from the start.  It didn't feature future front-man Phil Collins and it was released as a one-off in the United States on MCA records.  Because of this, it typically isn't marketed with the entire Genesis catalog and did not receive the remastering it deserved until after Atlantic had remastered its Genesis holdings.<br />Trespass clearly lights the path for future Gabriel-era releases.  While its predecessor, the debut From Genesis To Revelation, featured three-minute pop songs, Trespass relies more heavily on typical progressive rock blending acoustic and electric guitars with haunting keyboard work and Peter Gabriel's unique vocals.  And despite the fact that drummer Phil Collins does not appear on this album, the percussion work is surprisingly strong.  While Steve Hackett is credited with developing the trademark Genesis guitar sound, its amazing to hear the guitar work on this album.  Guitarist Anthony Phillips truly laid the groundwork for the Genesis guitar sound (Steve Hackett joined with Collins the following year).<br />Trespass has its flaws.  It suffers from age and the production isn't perfect.  But it's an important piece in the development of Genesis.
B00000B9BD|5.0|The strawbs are one of my favorite bands and in my opinion one of the most unique and special bands to come out of the 70's. They released a number of good albums during the 70's but this was their peak. Most of their better albums (hero and heroine, ghosts, bursting at the seams) were actually a bit inconsistant, especailly compared to this. This album however is pretty damn great from start to finish. Their appears to be a theme going on, probably something war. Most of the songs are great, but i have one complaint..the song &quot;ah me ah my&quot; is not only out of context but is such a bad, stupid, ridiculuos song that it hurts the whole album in my opinion..besides that song this is a great album pretty much from start to finish.
B000002J1M|5.0|In 1972, Genesis had seemingly gotten over some of the hurdles and personnel changes they faced and settled down to produce Foxtrot - their most ambitious piece yet.<br />Foxtrot contains three Genesis staples - the haunting `Watcher of the Skies', the bleak portrait of an overcrowded future `Get `Em Out By Friday' and the epic `Supper's Ready.'  `Supper's Ready' would go on to become a fan favorite and is widely hailed as a classic and enduring progressive rock epic.  <br />Lesser-known pieces `Time Table' and `Can Utility and the Coastliners' are also exceptional.  The short acoustic guitar piece `Horizons' seems slightly out of place amid these experimental and complex progressive rock pieces but it sounds excellent.<br />All-in-all, Foxtrot is one of Genesis' finest moments and is a must for any collection.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|A movie unlike any I have seen (and I watch a lot).  Very well written and acted.  Similar to a Seinfeld episode but with a different twist and motivation.  <BR>I had to watch it and my son, who is studying to write movies/TV had to add it to his library as a great example of a mind twisting tale.  Pay carefull attention, or go watch it a few more times.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Ees great. Dis moovie full of things we can relate to.Dis kina ting happens in real life. It really hit close to home. Except the money. I only make small change. But it would be nice to have all that dough.
B00003CXFV|3.0|This is something of an oddity. A story based on real life which isn't about high drama. There's no desperate missions to liberate Nazi art treasures or courtroom custody battles over polio-stricken children. However director Soderbergh makes sure every ounce of tension is wrung from this seemingly unromantic plot. I watched this movie having already heard the whole plot on the radio, and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the piece. Julia Roberts is in one of her best roles, making the rather strident character she plays likeable and identifiable with. Albert Finney provides fine support as the gruff American lawyer, and thoroughly deserved is Best Supporting Actor nomination. The pathos is overdone in some of the scenes featuring ill children, and the romance subplot seems a little unresolved, but - hey, it's based on the truth, and not everything works out well in real life... or maybe it does!
B000002897|4.0|I hadn't heard of the Screaming Trees in the Summer of 1993, after I'd just gotten my driver's license.  My sister told me she'd buy the ticket for me, if I drove her up to the Orange County Fairgrounds to the Screaming Trees, Spin Doctors and Soul Asylum concert.  I balked for a couple of reasons, but mostly because I hadn't heard of the Trees and the Spin Doctors made me nauseous.  The Spin Doctors did little to turn me around that night.  The Screaming Trees, however, did good work.  Very good work.  I picked up Sweet Oblivion the next day.<br />Mark Lanegan's hoarse voice, which at times is barely audible, gives this essetially  Seattle grunge band a full force push in the right direction.  &quot;Nearly Lost You,&quot; (off of the Singles soundtrack) is the obvious standout here.  However, I was just as impressed with several of the other songs on the album, including &quot;Dollar Bill,&quot; &quot;Winter Song,&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Season.&quot;  They are an extremely talented band, with the Connor boys backing up Lanegan on guitar and bass.<br />The Trees never reached the height of popularity they should have, based mostly on poor timing.  Sweet Oblivion was released prior to the Singles soundtrack, rather than the other way around, which didn't allow the band to build anticipation for a new release.  Add that to a 4 year break before releasing a new album.  Mix liberally and you have a band that was musically capable but unfortunately didn't become as successful as they should have.<br />What you do have here is a great album with a great sound, solid guitar work and a bonafide would-be hit.  Buy this album.
0767805712|5.0|I am sure from the many reviews this has already been said, but I just want to add my two cents. This is a great movie about a dream and the determination behind that dream. To strive to be better than they all thought you could be. I highly recommend this movie.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is the most soul haunting music I have ever had the pleasure of listening to.  Enya, ( and production crew's,) style is so unique that it is impossible to go any length of time without listening to this CD again... so relaxing, so soothing, a real treat to the ears and mind....
B000002MY3|5.0|Well, If you decide to actually buy this album, you passed by test of a good music selector.To start off, I think the lyrics in particular are very good and her harmonica I like. I don't think you'll have to hit the skip button at all! Every song has something addicting about it. \\"You Oughtta Know\\" is my favorite, followed by \\"Ironic\\" and \\"One Hand In My Pocket.\\" Gosh, all the songs here are great. Also just about everyone will enjoy her music.
0440219078|5.0|This was a great book for those who are analyzing people and their society.  It gives a good example of our society's flaws, even when the world seems perfect.  It makes you realize that perfection is not always desirable.  Another book that you might enjoy reading is Kurt Vonnegut JR's &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House.&quot; This is a collection of short stories highlighting Vonnegut's satirical outlook on mankind. The short story &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; reflects the same theme, but in a more dramatic, pessimistic way.
B00000DFTH|4.0|Essentially this is a greatest hits album, and some songs sound better than others.  In a nutshell, any Sabbath fan should have this.  Otherwise, you might want to stick with one of the greatest hits compilations or getting the original albums.
B00003CXX8|4.0|****1/2 stars<BR>One of the best teen thrillers I have seen in the past few years, &quot;The Glass House&quot; actually delivers. We already know who the bad guys are, and that's a plus. The suspense comes with not knowing what they will do next. No one is safe...<br />The film starts off well with an image of breaking glass, the film title, and the glass shattering into pieces...well done...but I started to roll my eyes and muttered &quot;Why?&quot; when the film opened to a screaming teen girl running away from a masked killer wielding a sharp kitchen knife, one as big as Micheal Myers used to carry around...This just didn't seem like that kind of movie...As I sat watching, I said &quot;Not again&quot; when it was revealed to be a movie within a movie in the first few seconds, but I was fascinated nontheless as we shifted from the dark movie theater where Ruby Baker sits to the image on the screen of the frightened girl fleeing her attacker...so begins this dark and suspenseful tale of murder and revenge...I enjoyed every minute of it...from the overdone opening scene to the climactic car chase at the end, this film kept me on the edge of my seat...there were some things I didnt like...for example, most of the scenes with the teenage girls didn't go along with the rest of the movie...the story is so dark, the atmosphere so claustrophobic and creepy, then you have these colorful teeny bopper girls showing up for a few seconds, and for no apparent reason...that's the only thing about the movie I didn't like...otherwise, it was an edge of the seat suspenseful and shocking picture....the whole audience, which wasn't much, was really into it...and this is one of those rare film's where I actually cared for the characters and hated the villians...I'm not going to give anything away, but I was impressed by how much I felt for the characters...a sign of a true artist...this was a great film and i definitely recommend it...I for one loved it...
B000001FSR|5.0|Tom Waits' &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; puts to record some of the music he composed for the play &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; that he and his wife wrote and produced with the legendary Robert Wilson.  While no official version of the play has been released, the record takes on a different narative than the play.  It exists both as songs from the play, and it's own work.  Tom's character Frank (whom we first heard of in &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;).  Frank sets off from his work a day life in search of the dream of making it big.  Frank writes one memorable song and ends up back where he started, one can only imagine in the gutter looking at the stars.<BR>    This album is by far the best of the post &quot;Swordfish&quot; Waits.  Here his style and penchant for twisting a good story and clever word play together are fully realized next to his flair for some of the most organic tin cans and car tires approach to music witnessed in popular music.  This record  shows Waits depth as a performer and brillance as a musician.  <BR>     In respect to the lesser known 20th century composers (such as Partch, Varese, Ives, and Cowell) Waits has abstracted his Jazz /Blues/Cabaret roots into a very American, very poinent sound.  Utilizing instruments that were set to pasture by musicians long ago, he creates a music that never fails to haunt or intrigue.  Simple rythyms are banged out on empty boxes while a $19 bullhorn serves to strip his voice of any fidelety, yet infuse it with so much emotion that your arm hairs stand on end.  Truly a magnificent work not merely a &quot;Pop&quot; album or simple &quot;Rock n' Roll.&quot;  This music is both complicated and eerily simple.  A break down of musical convention resusitated with the breath of new life.
B00000J8EK|4.0|Prodigy, The Chemical Bros, and Fatboy Slim should just go ahead and write movie music, which they would excel at.<br />Why should the big beat crowd switch to movie music? You may have noticed that action movie scores have gone techno in the past decade.<br />But nobody does it better than the above mentioned artists. ...
B00000K2UX|5.0|This album (when it was originally released) was the first cd/tape I ever bought.  By far one of the best soundtracks to a movie.  I highly recomend it to anybody that likes the 80's and the spirit that went with it in the music.
B000000993|5.0|TOOL,  what can i say about TOOL,   everything they do is incredible.  This is there finest work.  If you have not yet picked this one up,  you are missing out.
B00004Y6RO|4.0|This CD has a few absolute classics on it: (sic), Wait and Bleed, Spit It Out, Surfacing, Eyeless etc...but towards the end of the album it begins to suffer.  The extra tracks on the digipack make up for some of it, but for the most part Iowa was a significant improvement.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE 25 TIMES AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!!!<BR>HUGH JACKMAN WAS SEXY, JOHN TRAVOLTA WAS COOL AS ICE AND HALLE BERRY WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE AWESOME; THE PLOT HAD TWISTS AND TURNS AND YOU NEVER KNEW WHO WAS PLAYING WHO. IF YOU LIKED TRAVOLTA IN PULP FICTION, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM IN SWORDFISH!!! I REALLY HOPE TRAVOLTA, JACKMAN AND BERRY DO ANOTHER FILM, THEY WERE ALL INCREDIBLE IN THIS FILM.<BR>SWORDFISH ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Another video game made into a movie? Yes, I fell for the hype and saw Indiana Jones in a dress(or a sleek jumpsuit, or in a shower). The movie was a special effects extravaganza leaving very little time for actual plot or character development. There were a few errors in continuity and the CG (computer graphics) were somewhat amateur in regards to the stone creatures that Lara Croft fights. Where is the centuries of dust on these things? How about some moss or lichens growing along the exposed horizontal planes? How about the multitude of insects and spiders and snakes the normally inhabit the nooks and crannies of areas left undisturbed by humans for long periods of time? Is this the best effort that Hollywood can give us in joining &quot;The Rock's&quot; head and torso to an arachnoid trunk and legs? I found the suspension of belief that we feel when we go to the movies severely encombered by fits of laughter after viewing the amateur way the CG was NOT well blended in this movie. Angelina Jolie should be commended on her execution of the stunts she did without a stunt double. You can tell that she worked very hard on getting the stunts just right without cutaways. It definitely helped make her more buff too!
B00003CXSP|1.0|This is a truly awful sequel. Not only is it overly gross and boring in many segments it has to live up to 2 great movies that preceeded it. Do you remember Exorcist 2? This is as bad. Moore and Hopkins give credible performances considering the weak script. I only give it 1 star for the acting by it's 2 stars otherwise were it possible I would give it zero.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I can barely *put down in words* how extraordinary this movie is. Ewan McGregor has such an amazing voice and proves how terrific of an actor and he is.  And he's cute too!  Nicole Kidman is excellent as Satine, a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.  She can sing well, too (but let's face it, next to Ewan, it's tough to be that great!!!)  They have such * spectacular * chemistry and whenever they are on the screen together, it just makes you smile.  Ewan singing &quot;Your Song&quot; to her is just such a good scene, he's so adorable.  <br />    Besides the main love story, this movie is filled with hilarious parodies of popular songs, such as Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;.  If the &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;.  If that scene at least doesn't make you laugh, then I just don't know...<br />    Richard Roxbourgh plays the evil Duke, and man, do you just hate him after the movie! He is very, very convincing as a possessive, neurotic, evil character and definitely brings a very evil element to this movie.<br />    The music in this movie is just so wonderful.  As I mentioned, Ewan McGregor is an extremely talented singer, and he sings a lot in the movie!  It's truly a unique experience in the movie theater.  I'm not guaranteeing that this movie is for everyone.  But it is at least an experience.  Whether it is good or bad, I leave to you! For me, it was one of the best experiences of my life!
B000009QPG|5.0|By mixing the sound of their previous 2 albums (South of Heaven and Reign In Blood...both must-haves as well) Slayer made this album, which is their best album In My Opinion.<br />What makes this album better than the others? Slayer has always been known for it's aggresive style and just awesome music.  This album took South of Heaven, which was a little bit heavier than previous albums without quite as much speed, and added the speed from Reign in Blood.  Listen to War Ensemble...you will understand what I mean.  Dead Skin Mask and Seasons in the Abyss are essential Slayer material, or heavy metal material in general.  Not until God Hates Us All would Slayer make another album in this style (GHUA is awesome, but this is the one to get if you have never heard Slayer).
B00004YYDI|5.0|This was one of those great surprises you get every now and then, I have this in my &quot;Top 5&quot; of my collection. A well picked cast that works very well together. One of the reasons Gary Oldmen is the scariest bad guy alive, they must have wrote Leons part with Jean Reno in mind.<BR>A &quot;love&quot; story that isnt and why it works so well.
0767817664|4.0|This movie is destined to become an all time classic.  The soundtrack is also worth listening to with its rock/disco sound.  To Three Rivers, Michigan:  The songs you asked about are:  &quot;Good Man in a Bad Time&quot; by Ian Hunter; &quot;Give It Up&quot; by Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King; and &quot;You Can't Hide From the Beast Inside&quot; by Autograph.  When will the soundtrack come out in a CD version?  (It originally was issued as a record and cassette tape.)
B0000524CY|4.0|While this film is infamous for certain scenes: projectile vomiting and rotating heads amongst them, it is actually an intelligent and disturbing film. The cut between the initial dusty scenes in Iraq to Washington DC is an instructive culture shock. Regan's diagnostic imaging and therapy at the hospital appears to be as much torture to her as the exorcism itself. Ellen Burstyn is a brilliant actress and shows a full range of emotions here. Jason Miller as Father Karras is also convincing as the troubled priest. Max Von Sydow somehow has managed to look 70 years old for the past 3 decades - again a good performance.
B000007T1M|5.0|When I first bought this album, my initial reaction was &quot;What on earth is this?&quot;  I put it away for a little while until I saw the guys live, and they impressed me.  I brought the CD back and now it is in my everyday rotation.  War? and PLUCK are incredible anthems of frustration and anger, and each song on this CD has a different feel and message.  Anyone who has only heard Sugar doesn't realize what they are missing on this album.
B00005NB0H|5.0|It would be difficult to suggest that a concert recorded in early 1970 has not been surpassed. Well, then you sit down and listen...listen long and hard in a dark room with the volume as loud as you can take it. Nothing, I say again, nothing to date conveys the sheer power of live performance. I know a great many who hate this band and even they have to admit this is an amazing performance. As others have noted, I too have every version of this album released to date, and if they release another one, I'll probably buy that one too.....AMAZING !!!
B0000020C4|5.0|This 2 CD set will go down in history as the best recording of this musical.  By gathering the best people from the various productions of Les Miz, the producers made sure that this one-time concert would have the best talent available.<br />The emotion present in this recording is simply powerful.  Phillip Quast, as Javert, does a tremendous job.  IMHO, he, along with Alun Armstorng as Thenardier, stand out as the best characters in this recording.  That, however,  is not meant to detract from the others.  Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Lea Salonga, Ruthie Henshalln and the others are terrific.  <br />Among the best numbers on these CDs are:<br /><br />Valjean's Soliliqy &amp; Who Am I :  When Colm Wilkinson sings these introspective and soul-searching songs, you can't help but feel for Jean Valjean.  <br /><br />Master of the House:  Whenever I hear this song from this recording, I can't help but smile and sing along.<br /><br />Stars &amp; Javert's Suicide:  The two songs that define Javert's character.  In Stars, he presents his unchanging worldview.  In Javert's Suicide, he realizes how wrong he's been all his life.  Phillip Quast does these songs brilliantly.<br /><br />On My Own &amp; A Little Fall of Rain.  The two songs dominated by Eponine are, likewise, a treat to listen to.  <br /><br />Empty Chairs At Empty Tables:  Another heart-rending song, sung beautifully by Michael Ball (Marius).<br />As a previous reviewer mentioned, it would have been nice had lyrics been included too, but this album is a must-have even without them.
0345347951|2.0|While at the time it was published, this book may have been very successful for Clarke, it is now extremely dated. Although he makes prescient remarks about the development of birth control, the novel has otherwise not stood the test of time. It was clear on every page that this novel was written many, many years ago. And even if you overlook the dated viewpoint, the human characters are cardboard. If you are looking for great classic sci-fi, choose Rendezvous with Rama instead and you won't be disappointed.
B00005NW02|5.0|HOLY COW!  Along with God Hates Us All from Slayer, this is the album of the year for 2001!  This CD has such dimension to it...at first it seemed weird, but after about 5 listens you really understand how great it is.  Thumbs up...WAY UP!
6305537542|5.0|this is the best horror movie ever made.  i dont see why it does not have all five stars who is the loser who did not give halloween a 5 star should be killed by Michael Myers.  i have all the halloween movies and can not wait untill HALL8WEEN comes out.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|In these days of mad terrorists working to bring us all down, this album restores one's faith in at least the absurdity of our modern little world. As for the one reviewer who didn't like this brilliant record I think that his comparison to Elton John's Songs from the West Coast pretty much speaks for itself. <br />They say times are hard<BR>If you don't believe it you can follow your nose<BR>It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere<BR>We'll just have to see how it goes
B00000K19E|5.0|Yes, I've watched this over and over again.  Indeed, I have used the lobby scene constantly to shoot up my adrenaline and impress friends.  And of course, I also noticed that the movie is just too green, and I mean chroma green.  But heck, who cares?  Movie magic has a long way to go but this is one helluva start!  <br />Get the DVD.  Take the pill.  And you're off to Neverland!
6303148352|5.0|This movie is great!Only one person gets eaten.But when they go on the tour they dont see any dinos...until the T-Rex gets free in the park!This movie is funny exiting and fun!
0736618503|4.0|While this was Waugh's least favourite of his own books, the one that he blamed for exposing him to the trials of fan mail and public recognition, it is in fact, a great and glorious book. Spanning the short adult life of Sebastian Flyte, it is told retrospectively through the eyes of his friend and former lover Charles, who goes on, once youthful experimentation is over, to carry on an equally passionate and hopeless love affair with Sebastian's sister. But in some ways, these themes are not the great story. The larger pictures are of the slackening grip of British aristocracy, the power of love and the power of Faith. Waugh paints a masterpiece of the sweet, desperate years between the wars, at Oxford, in London and Paris, with one generation lost and the next helplessly watching history lurching towards a repetition of the same madness.
B000006NPY|5.0|Since this is probably my favorite album of all time, I figured I should probably review it.  Everyone reviews their favorite album, right?  Well, I bought Adore after hearing a blip of the song &quot;Ava Adore&quot; on MTV.  I was still exploring my music tastes, having recently received my first ever CD player as a birthday present.  I figured I should have some CDs to go with it, so I bought this album on the basis that that blip of &quot;Ava Adore&quot; was the most amazing sound I had ever heard.<br />  Yes, I was disappointed.  &quot;Ava Adore&quot; was great, and there were some other really nice beats in &quot;Appels + Oranjes&quot; and &quot;Pug&quot;, but the rest were kind of slow and boring.  But since it was one of only three CDs I owned, I kept listening to it.  And listening to it.  About the tenth listen, I stopped and thought: that's pretty.  And a few listens after that, I thought: that's REALLY pretty.  It just got better from there.<br />  I now own all the Smashing Pumpkins albums and they are all great.  They are also very different than this one.  Less mournful, more angry.  Or at least louder.  But they all have Billy's very recognizable artistic strain.  I think some people will naturally have an affinity to the Smashing Pumpkin's work and others just won't.  So figure out which you are and go from there.  But if you a fan who only likes the hard stuff (which I'll admit is wonderful), you're missing the point.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I love DK and have all her records; I agree with most of the reviews regarding her wonderful voice and the sensuous orchestration. Two faults in this otherwise beautiful record:<BR>The lack of variety, and Christian McBride's near anonymity. This CD would pack more punch had one or two tracks out of ten been uptempo, big-band style numbers. McBride, one, if not *the* premier bassists around, is hardly noticeable (perhaps that's what he wanted?). For completists, get it. If you're just starting out with DK, get &quot;All for You.&quot;
0684833395|5.0|You must read this book. Scroll up the page, click on &quot;Add to cart,&quot; and get on with it. Don't read any more reviews, don't let anyone tell you anything about the story. Discover it for yourself. This is important. You won't be disappointed.
B000002N3N|4.0|Ok, first off, Enya rocks.  If you don't know that already, go buy her compilation album, Paint the Sky with Stars.  It will enlighten you.  If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done, there is something wrong with you.<br />All right, so maybe Enya isn't for everyone.  But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music.  She is soft, soulfull, and dynamic.  And yeah, so her music all sounds the same, but when it's so good, how can you complain?<br />Highlights from The Memory of Trees include &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot;, and &quot;On My Way Home&quot;.
156224003X|2.0|Sorry, but I just couldn't take this seriously enough for it to be helpful. I can see the point it's trying to make about positive thinking, but I actually found the CD rather funny,especially when it says &quot;Relax your kidneys&quot; How on earth do you do that? Perhaps we Brits are just too cynical.
B00003CXV4|5.0|Well I saw the movie and it was grate and it was really the <BR>best that I saw Keanu Reeves in besides the matrix and speed!!<BR>Also I like movies like this but it was sad at the end and I don't think that it should of ended up like it did. But it had to for the movie I guess that's what made it good!!
B00005N9CV|3.0|Oy veh!!  There are enough strings on this CD to make Ray Mathis and his 101 collaborators jealous!  Enough with the violins, already!  Diana's voice, as always, has that wonderful throaty, clipped, understated quality that makes almost anyone a fan.  However, one of the most convincing things about her music is missing from this album - the relationship between her, the piano, and her band.  Everything is smothered in this cloying sauce of over-production.  What happened to the essential jazz quartet?  There are some real classics on this album that suffer under the hand of her producer.
6300214354|5.0|The title says it all. If you are a fan of spoofs, as I am, you will find this to be the best one ever made. If you are not a spoof fan but still like to laugh, you will still love this movie [based on friends who are not spoof people]. Nothing more can be said than that.
B00000ADG2|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I expected BIG things since this album was nominated for 10 Grammys, and won 6.  At first, I was disappointed.  But that was after I listened to just a few tracks.  Then one day when I was really bored, I listened to the entire album without skipping anything(including the parts where the kids are just talking in the class room) and it was just so, well, GOOD!  &quot;To Zion&quot; is probably the greatest love song I've ever heard.  There's beautiful singing on the hit &quot;Everything is Everything&quot;.  &quot;Doo Wop(That Thing)&quot; and the title track are also both great.  Whether you like her opinions about white people(I'm white) or not, you can't deny that this is one of the great r&amp;b albums of the past ten years or so.
078062999X|5.0|The Hamlet by Kenneth Branagh has been a perfection.<BR>The whole plot is recast into a magnificent form.It is very intense through out the whole movie .you will find all<BR>the details well arranged and orchestraed by the director.<BR>It is very hard for me to imagine any perfection to this version of Hamlet.
0783225970|4.0|Aside from Blue Velvet, one of the masterpieces of the eighties, DePalma's '83 gangster spectacle, Scarface, may well be a near perfect cinematic metaphor for the excesses of the Reagan era. Over-the-top, with a tastelessness bordering on the hilariously obscene, Scarface is that rare maverick film that offers up cult-like pleasures in a big budget studio package.  Mixing elements of Brecht, 30's - style gangster drama, and South American B soap opera, Scarface, a film never flinching from outrageous form, is a dead-on social and aesthetic critique of corrupt early 80's US culture. Mordantly witty and still compulsively watchable almost twenty years later, Scarface is a movie that makes no apologies.
0790742705|3.0|iam now 23 years old i frist saw this when i was five and still love it fact i just bought the dvd yeterday. have got to see it yet thou. how ever the movie it self is great funny at times creepy at others.my fave part is when the gremilns send the old lady up the staris in the wheel chair.
B000002N9L|4.0|I'd Buy it again. Overlooked as a throwaway album, Chaos and Disorder is infact a jem.  The guitar solos are scorching and loud.  This isn't the Prince your Mama likes_ no, the artist didn't come to deliver his usual mysterious sexuality, or smooth balladry_ his message is aptly titled. I think the problem most fans suffer in trying to enjoy this CD is that they were expecting something commercial, or some smooth glitzy tracks that Prince is very capable of_ that is obviously not the aim of this CD. This is released at a turbulent time in Prince's relationship with Warner, and leave it to Prince to deliver an artistic responce.  HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME:<BR>Title Track_ clever lyrics and rip roaring introduction<BR>I like it There_ Roguish, Funny, and LOUD!<BR>Dinner with Dolores_ rocks in an introspective way, as we picture his Dinner with the overindulgent Dolores.  Other favorites: Zanalee, I Rock Therefore I am, Dig U Better Dead and lastly, the haunting Had U. Prince is truely the artist.
0060930187|4.0|So, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; isn't a book that many 30-something males find themselves picking up and bonding with.  Granted, but the only reason we were given horizons in this life, was to push those babies out...that's right expand 'em every chance you get.  The Bell Jar did expand mine to some degree.<br />The writing would probably reach out to a young adult more so than someone in mid-life, but it is solid throughout and tells the story of Plath's largely autobiographical descent into mental illness.  Plath comes up with an apt metaphor for her condition, calling upon the strength of language she was bestowed with as a talented poet.  The Ball Jar descends around her cutting her off from the &quot;normal&quot; world...it sets her apart, cuts off the air.  I think Plath must not have been able to escape the Bell Jar in the end as a tragic suicide ended her gifted art early in 1963.<br />It gives us hope today, that we have found better ways to deal with mental illness since those times and individual's stricken with a condition are allowed options and get the chance to chose life.  I guess reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; at this stage of life did expand some horizons, but would probably reach out to those coming of age and let them know problems are out there, and they can be dealt with.  I wouldn't call it an essential read for me, but it might be to others.  Read Sylvia Plath for her poetry over her prose and study her life for a cautionary tale and appreciate what we have learned since then.
B00004XQ83|4.0|I watched this movie on a whim and found it to be a lot of fun.  I have just recently started listening to bluegrass and I found that I quite enjoy it.  The soundtrack to this movie is what makes it so much fun to watch.  I would definitely recommend this movie and soundtrack for anyone who would like a simple, upbeat good time.
B00005OWEG|5.0|i've read the other amazon reviews as well as a batch of other published reviews. in my opinion the original cut worked really well, but the new footage adds in a worthwhile way. there is a filling out of character and historical situation with the new footage. this may not be essential to the movie, but apart from the added length (which most people won't be able to stand), the movie is in some ways more satisfying. i think it makes a strong difference to have the french plantation scene because it brings women into the film in more than just the playboy bunny way. though of course there's sex involved, the woman in this case has things to say that matter, especially in the midst of all the male killing and shouting. and the bunnies-for-fuel sequence, as far as i'm concerned, makes the bizarreness of the whole heart-of-darkness world all the stronger by moving directly into the realm of sex/women as a commodity. the extra footage with kurtz and the kids may not add much *except* with respect to visuals. those kids and kurtz peering down through those jagged wholes in the sweat box make a stunning and unique image in a film full of stunning and unique images. anyway, the thing that matters is that anyone who has not seen this film now has the chance to see the gussied-up dvd print, and there may be no other movie that is so visually striking. in 3 1/2 hours there are maybe 15 minutes of just neutral images. *everything* else you can sit and look at like a painting. and then there's the music. fantastic shifts between the doors, and this running electronic score that fades in and out from machine-sounds to music, and then just a little actual instrumental music at short precise moments. very fine. no movie-fan should miss it.

B00004Z459|5.0|Ok, I have never written a review before because every CD I own honestly isn't worth my time in writing. Alas, Linkin Park comes into the picture (and into my CD player) and there is magic. I cannot stress enough the quality of this CD. Absolutely every song is wonderful and it makes for great driving music. If  you really want to get the most for your money, this CD is for your collection.

0316776963|4.0|This was my introduction to Sedaris' wry sense of humor, and I was not disappointed.  I had never heard of David Sedaris before picking up this book.  No radio shows, no earlier works, nothing.  I found myself laughing aloud at the descriptions of family life, world travel, and especially, the essay about crossword puzzles.<br />In spite of this, I give it four stars because I felt the subject matter was more suited to a narrative than a series of essays.  There are essays in this book that are out-of-place, and this tends to alter the tempo of the book.<br />Still, I highly recommend this book to fans and newbies alike.
B00005N5RM|5.0|If you wish to read of my adulation for this grisly, shocking, excellent remake, just scroll down to my March '99 review &quot;Steve Mcqueen, Eat Your Heart Out!&quot;<br />As far as the long-awaited DVD release of &quot;The Blob&quot; is concerned, I must say it is an absolute treat for this here horror/sci-fi buff! Just to see Chuck Russell's masterful film in its digitally remastered 1.85:1 widescreen glory, along with the original trailer feature, really made my collection's day! My only qualm is that Columbia/TriStar was rather remiss towards the sound design (still in 2.0 surround, just like my old VHS copy). &quot;The Blob&quot; is a film that is definitely made for a 5.1 or DTS mix with all of its explosions and the oozing, organic sound effects that helped breathed life into this infamous &amp; reviled movie monster.<BR>An awesome flick and a 4.5-star quality DVD...worth every cent.

B00004RFCM|5.0|Hello, being a guy you don't think that one would write a review for this show. On the contrary, my wife got me hooked and I really enjoy this show. This is the \\"Whole\\" first season on just two DVD's. The price is excellent. Follow the adventures of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte explore being single in NY. It has trailers for each episode as well as other goodies. Its a must have video.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I was surprised by this CD. I had heard &quot;Thank You&quot; played a zillion times on the radio and never thought to even purchase the CD until a friend leant it to me. I gave it a try (and a try and a try), and discovered a treasure - Dido! The CD speaks for itself. Dido has a beautiful voice and the music echoes the lyrics (or vice versa?).<br /> &quot;Hunter&quot; is perhaps my favorite - it puts me into &quot;hunting&quot; mode, like a strong wild panther searching methodically (thoughtfully) for new prey. Awesome!<br />&quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; - picture vastness, a haunting emptiness and then delicate music and tempo to ease the pain.<br />&quot;All You Want&quot; is another great one that starts out innocently, a woman yearning for her lover's intimacy, but slowly the truth unfolds and the yearning turns into persuasion, scorn and then anger! (you'll be angry too!)<br />&quot;Thank You&quot; is just plain refreshing after having to &quot;Hunt&quot;, be empty,yearn, persuade, scorn - finally, a refreshing relationship with refreshing music to match.<br />And there's even more . . . <br />Enjoy!!
B00005N9CV|4.0|Yes, she is changing.....Would have loved a DUET with JULIE LONDON on \\"CRY ME A RIVER..!\\" Just Kidding...The other songs, like..\\"I remember you!..\\" and others are better than the featured songs...She's great and the strings from the ABBY ROAD recording studio reminds me of...YES!..GEORGE MARTIN and the boys!  LISTEN to it...
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana Krall is the most exciting performer to hit the stage in a long time.  I love her piano style, her smoky voice.  But this album disappointed me.  There are few songs on the album that feature Diana singing with her trio and jazz musicians often make the mistake of allowing someone to talk them into playing 'with strings' which in Diana's case as with the late Chet Baker are unnecessary.  I found the strings distracting and although her choice of tunes is great she really did not give her usual flawless renditions, she sounded like an 'ordinary' band singer, which she is not.  I saw her a few years ago in a small club playing on New Years Eve, she had her trio with her including the great Russ Malone and this is how I want to remember her.
B00003CX95|5.0|Fantastic movie.<br />Little bloody and gorey for some people, but, if you can handle the hack and slash of body parts and spilling of blood, this movie is for you.<br />Great story, great acting, fantastic characters, and extremely fast paced.  It'll grab you in the first 5 minutes.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|\\"Queer as Folk\\" Series One shows most of the famous British television series centered on a cluster of gay male friends and acquaintances in Manchester. Unlike most similar ensemble attempts, there are serious, substantial linkings out to the men's families, workplaces, schools, and lesbian friends. This produces a well-rounded depiction of contemporary gay male life in the U.K. and a sense of the variety of responses and accommodations gays and straights make for one another. <br />The core of the drama is the ostensibly unrequited love retail manager Vince Tyler (played by Craig Kelly) has for long-time friend, publicist and seduction phenom Stuart Jones (played by Aidan Gillen). The drama kicks off with the coming out of 15 year old student Nathan Maloney (played by Charlie Hunnam), who starts off with Stuart, irritating Vince. Complications, subplots, and a variety of potential love interests all intertwine, coming to a satisfying conclusion to Series One. Series Two continues the Series One story reasonably well.<br />The Manchester accent and some local slang appear throughout. Some replays may be needed to get the exact words spoken. There is a script book (with photos) available of the detailed, pre-shooting script. The TV/video/DVD final version has a number of small improvements on the original. You might check it out.<br />The major actors are all brilliant. Surprisingly, the minor actors are too. The plot lines are all reasonable enough, the characters evolve plausibly, and actors look and play their ages. Production values and photography are first rate. \\"Queer as Folk\\" is simply the best gay ensemble movie ever.<br />Note there are two DVDs in one case for Series One and a single DVD for Series Two.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|I just bought this DVD yesterday. After seeing it a couple of times I have to say it is one of the greatest compilation of videos I've ever seen. Alice In Chains is one of my favorite bands, and it's sad that they're not together anymore. This DVD takes me back to my grunge days when I was still in High School. It's got 17 videos plus a little documentary and some clips of the band between videos. It also has a complete discography and videography (only missing Greatest Hits, and that's because that one was released last month), so you'll know if you're missing any of their recordings. It's a great DVD, and I recommend it to any fan and any person who likes rock music, 'cause that's what this is, one of the greatest rock bands of all time.<br />Get it. Trust me. You won't be dissapointed.
0440224764|5.0|Grisham's The Partner was an excellent book, and kept me guessing until the very last page.  This is only the second novel I have read by this author, but after the Firm, and now The Partner.  I think that i am sold on his work.  Patrick Lanigan steals 90 million dollars, and disappears into the outback of Brazil.  Four years later he is found, and is extradicted to the US to stand trial.  What follows next is a masterful look into false identities, the electronic movement of funds overseas, and more plot twists (pulled off successfully) then i have seen  in awhile.  If you are an old fan of Grisham's work, or a new fan like myself.  Treat yourself to The Partner, and with the deal Amazon has going right now.  You might as well get the Firm which was excellent as well.  enjoy!!
B000002UAF|5.0|Being the first Beatles release to solely feature Lennon/McCartney originals, this classic soundtrack is a must have for Beatles fans! It perfectly encapsulates the band at the height of Beatlemania, and is just as exciting now as it was 37 years ago. For some reason, the ballads just stick in my head. &quot;And I Love Her&quot; is simply stunning and stands in a class by itself. John and George's acoustic guitars fairly weep with lovely classical tinges, while Ringo's bongo backing underneath Paul's youthful, eager vocals (in perfect harmony with the others) is still enough to make you cry. &quot;If I Fell&quot; is that same eagerness set to another stunning melody and digs into your heart with it's plea of love and devotion. The fast songs aren't too shabby either! The ringing, hard opening chord of the title track is THE most recognizable first note in all of rock'n'roll, and sets the tone for both the album and the movie! &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; is an early Lennon cautionary tale that still drips with venom ('gonna let you down and leave you flat!&quot;) and is one the catchiest tunes of his career. The closer &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;, set to a great acoustic guitar melody, is another Lennon gem that lets both the girl and the listener know that our hero is not someone who will be easily dismissed. If you know John, you know this is no idle threat, you'll love this song. George Harrison's 21 year old tenor is positively joyous on &quot;Just To Dance With You&quot; a catchy, uplifting song that gets better with age! There's not a single dud to be found here and &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; stands as a perfect example of Early British Invasion pop. Though any Beatles LP is highly recommended, this is THE best soundtrack album ever made. A CLASSIC WITHOUT PEER.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I saw &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; the day that it came to the movie theater, and the movie had everything!! Action, romance, a great storyline, and a great cast!! The film's center of attention is Ben Affleck, who plays Rafe McCawley, and his best friend Josh Hartnett, who plays Danny Walker. Rafe falls in love with a beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by an outstanding Kate Beckinsale), whom Rafe had the terrible discomfort of leaving her behind to go off with the Royal British army to fight alongside other fighter pilots. When word gets out about Rafe being shot down in action, both Danny and Evelyn were filled with grief over the incident. But in an unexpected twist of fate, Evelyn and Danny became emotionally attached to each other. But, one night, Rafe suddenly returns much to the delight of Evelyn, Danny could not believe it either until Rafe figured out that something went on between the two of them. And then, history intervenes when the love triangle is put on hold and both Rafe and Danny put aside their differences to go out and fight the Japanese fighter pilots that started the attacks on Pearl Harbor, an attack even we Americans never saw coming. The acting in this movie is superb, especially with Cuba Gooding, Jr. playing Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight playing FDR. The soundtrack is outstanding, especially with Faith Hill singing &quot;There You'll Be&quot; in the film. This will definitely be a DVD must-own when I go out and buy it. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is Ben Affleck's best film since &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Josh Hartnett's best film since &quot;Here on Earth&quot;. Kate Beckinsale's best film since &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s best film since &quot;Men of Honor&quot;. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is truly a movie masterpiece. Quite possibly the best film of 2001!
B000001FDI|5.0|This 1969 gem still sounds fresh, lively and fun today! Steve Winwood (what was he 21?) is in terrific voice throughout and delivers the lovely &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; with a gentleness and poignancy that just makes you ache. The bluesy, rousing opener &quot;Had To Cry Today&quot; is built on one of the catchiest, heaviest rock riffs ever recorded and is guaranteed to stick in your head eternally once you've heard it. The interaction of these four brilliant musicians is remarkable and makes me wish this sort of rampant, bold experimentation was still found in pop music today. Though this &quot;supergroup&quot; was initially brought together as a marketing ploy, the music they produced is stunning. Throughout this jam-filled one time outing, the freedom and joy these men feel is evident. The almost 14 minute closer &quot;Do What You Like&quot;, is a Ginger Baker masterpiece and finds the band stretching out to stunning effect. His drum solo and Rick Grech's bass solo are the highlights on this spacey, jazzy jam! For an album released 32 years ago, &quot;BLIND FAITH&quot; hasn't aged a day. Any lover of classic rock should own this.<br />Essential and Enjoyable.
B00005A46T|2.0|There are 4 words that describe this album; hard, hard, hard, and hard but is it good? These guys have an ok sound but come on they have 9 ... people couldn't they possibly create something more creative? It is a good thrashing album but every song is \\"f' this\\" and \\"f' that\\", \\"I'm insane and psycho\\", \\"I'll kill you all \\", \\"I can't take much more \\"(even though I have a feeling that 3 albums later they'll still be taking more)blah blah bland.
B00000253N|5.0|His best?  Hard to say, it's got a lot to compete with; but it does rank among Freewheelin', Highway 61 Revisited &amp; Blonde on Blonde as one of his finest albums, and his single masterpiece of the 1970s.  It begins and ends with the album's only two well-known radio tunes, &quot;Tangled Up In Blue&quot; and &quot;Forever Young&quot;, but what lies in between are as solid a set of songs as Dylan ever cooked up.
B000022TSY|1.0|A somewhat interesting movie due to the time period this movie was filmed. Basically, this movie was nothing special and pretty much like a million other movies out there. <br />The movie is totally overrated mostly due to the cast, Fonda, Hopper, and Jack Nicolas.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|These guys are very funny...been around for years, in a short 10-minute television series airing after Mr. Show with Bob &amp; David on HBO, and numerous concerts and TV appearences.

B0000024RQ|5.0|Dylan's first masterpiece, and the best all-accoustic folk album he ever put together.  Not a weak song in the bunch, and contains many Dylan ESSENTIALS: &quot;Blowin' In The Wind&quot;, &quot;Masters of War&quot;, &quot;A Hard Rains Gonna Fall&quot;, &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot;, &quot;Oxford Town&quot;, &quot;Talkin' World War III Blues&quot; &amp; &quot;Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance&quot;.  Okay, that last one is a cover but it's just a fantastic version &amp; he makes it all his own.  This whole album is great and it's not a bad place to start your Dylan collection.
0156421178|5.0|In late 1936 George Orwell went to Spain to write newspaper articles about the civil war, but joined the POUM militia almost immediately &quot;because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do ... it was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle.&quot; Seven month later, he escaped from Spain, a wanted man, sought out by the Stalinist forces because of his membership in the communist POUM militia! Although an eye-witness, Orwell recognizes the subjectivity of his account:<br />&quot;I hope the account I have given is not too misleading. I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can be completely truthful. It is difficult to be certain about anything except what you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or unconsciously everyone writes as a partisan. In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now: beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.&quot;<br />Orwell describes the misery of life in the trenches well. Prior to reading this book I had viewed (and reviewed) the video LAND AND FREEDOM, which is loosely spun off of Orwell's experiences. This book manages to capture the misery and discomfort that most war movies gloss over: lice, cold, damp, chill, sleeplessness, etc. Although he has much positive to say about the equalitarian nature of the militias (the same pay, food, &amp; clothing for officers &amp; men, mingling on terms of equality, voting on decisions), he repeatedly points out &quot;uncivilized&quot; and unsanitary conditions and behavior. For example:<br />&quot;Sometimes it gave you a sneaking sympathy with the Fascist ex-owners to see the way the militia treated the buildings they had seized. In La Granja every room that was not in use had been turned into a latrine-a frightful shambles of smashed furniture and excrement.&quot;<br />Besideslife in the trenches, he tells of the street fighting in Barcelona between anti-Fascist forces, tells of being wounded, of treatment, the ban on the POUM, and living as a wanted man until his escape. <br />The politics of the Spanish civil war are Byzantine at best. Orwell separates the political struggles of Republican Spain into two separate chapters, allowing readers who wish to ignore them to focus on his account of life during the struggle. He characterizes the Spanish struggle as the collision  of three forces: 1) The workers (the anarchist FAI &amp; CNT, the communist POUM, and liberal socialists), 2) the Fascists (led by Franco's rebellious forces), and 3) the &quot;republican&quot; Liberals, Communists (Stalinists), and &quot;right-wing&quot; socialists. The workers seized the opportunity of opposing Franco's Fascism to promote social revolution. The Liberals and Communists worked to oppose social revolution and championed their struggle as one of liberal democracy against totalitarian Fascism. This led to the suppression of the workers' parties and militias.<br />Orwell returned to England, still hoping that Franco with his Nazi and Fascist mercenaries could be turned back. Ultimately, the social revolution in Spain was suppressed, first by &quot;liberal&quot; forces, and then, they, too, were suppressed by the Fascists. <br />This tale paints a human picture of life during the Spanish civil war. Orwell was able to leave the conflict. Most were not. Although the terrorism of smashing jumbo jets into skyscrapers shocks our consciousness, the systematic terror of Franco's government had a far higher toll in human life and liberty. As we face the challenge of responding to terrorism, let us remember that governmental suppression is far more dangerous in the long run than a few determined fanatics. <br />Five stars for literary ability. Five stars for being able to present the Spanish political situation comprehensibly. Five stars for an enjoyable and powerfulstory. While less well known than Orwell's ANIMAL FARM and 1984, this book intensifies the meaning of his more popular writings.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue about this review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email.

0446605409|3.0|At the start of this book Nelson De Mille says that concerning the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Disease Center at Plum Island, he has taken a &quot;small amount of literary licence regarding the island and the work done there.&quot; In this age of terrorism, genuine fear and paranoia, one wonders just how much licence the author took. Previously we would have expected exaggeration; now we almost hope he played it down. <br />John Corey is both hero and anti-hero. A Manhattan homicide detective badly wounded in the line of duty, he is convalescing at his uncle's house on Long Island. Friends of Corey's, an attractive couple of research scientists, are murdered. They worked on Plum Island, where dangerous biochemical experiments are performed. Corey's friend, the local township police chief, Sylvester Maxell, hires him to help on a consulting basis. Corey's efforts seem to comprise equal parts of consulting and insulting. He has a &quot;wiseass&quot; attitude, which is amusing to read, but his motivation for so much sarcasm is not clear. Maybe it goes with his profession.<br />Immediately, different levels of government converge on the case. The CIA and the FBI behave in usual enigmatic fashion. However, Corey is more than ingenious, and he continues to make headway on his own despite subsequent efforts from higher-ups to lock him out of the investigation. The female detective in charge of the county's investigation at first gives him a hard time and then works with him.<br />Corey is tough and cynical, and he is also good looking, constantly attracting attractive women. It is fun to follow his exploits in this department while he narrows the chase from feasible red herrings. <br />Increasingly puzzling and frightening events escalate relentlessly. In this story, DeMille's characters appear somewhat more archetypal than in some of his other tales, and the final denouement is longer than it has to be. But the plot is instructive and the prose highly readable.

This latest disk unfortunately, does not. Diana has shifted her priorities over the years from emphasising her piano to developing her vocals. This may be great for those listeners atrracted primarily to her singing. If you're like myself however, and was hoping to hear her &quot;WOW&quot; you on the piano, you are going to be sorely dissapointed.

B00004TLN3|5.0|NORTHANGER ABBEY by Jane Austin was written when she was very young (late teens?) and I believe it was her first novel. My understanding from a college course I took on Austen was that NA was the least polished of her six novels (EMMA held first place). However, many of the artistic elements and themes found Austen's later novels can be found in incipient form in NA so for that reason alone it is important and worthwhile to view and read NORTHANGER ABBEY. It amazes me that the very young daughter of a country vicar in 18th Century England could have written such a thoughtful, clever, and provocative book.<br />Catherine Moreland, Austen's heroine in NA is a very good and natural girl, without guile but not a fool either, probably somewhat like Jane Austen herself although we know Austen was a bit more sophisticated about Gothic novels than Catherine as she soundly criticizes them through the voice of Henry Tilney. However, like Fanny Price, the heroine of MANSEFIELD PARK, Catherine Morland can detect &quot;ne'er do well&quot; young men and their sisters when they attempt to subvert her. And, like Fanny, Catherine recognizes goodness when she sees it in Henry Tilney and his sister.<br />As in Austen's other novels, civility, propriety, sense, sensiblity, honesty, and forthrightness are important themes. Austen had a strong distaste for 18th Century Bath with it's false manners and insinuating habits. Her dislike is evident in the depiction of Bath society apparent on young Catherine's visit. The aged widow of the French Marquis (guilliotined) reminds one of the Elliot's relatives in PERSUASION.<br />Austen was fond of politics (albeit from a drawing room perspective in NA) and her political sympathies are somewhat revealed in refernces to Whigs (she probably sympathized with them), the French Revolution, neoclassical garden design and architecture, clothing, nature versus artifice, and the rational versus the irrational.<br />NORTHANGER ABBEY is beautifully depicted in this DVD. The film was part of a set of BBC productions made in the late 1970s and 1980s and although many of the films based on Austen's other books have been reworked (some more than once) since then, NORHTHANGER ABBEY has not been redone. I own the VHS version, and am happy to say the DVD is much better. Although this film was originally made for tv viewing, my DVD copy is clear as a bell. The settings for the film are scrumptious and those who have visited Bath (and like it) will not be disappointed by the beautiful cinematography showing the city and the surrounding area. Shots include the Royal Cresent; the Cathedral and the old Roman baths which were still operational in the 1800s (shown in this film with folks in 18th Century regalia); and the Assembly rooms.  As usual, the BBC costuming, artifacts and other apsects including the marvelous conveyences such as litters and carriages lend verismilitude to the film.

0064407667|5.0|Lemony Snicket ( a dubious moniker if there ever was, and certainly not to be trusted) has set forth the task of developing one of the most enjoyable (and downright nasty) children's series of books, aptly entitled \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\". The events that befall the hapless Baudelaire trio (Violet, Klaus, and the infant Sunny) are shocking, disturbing, cruel, and very, very unfortunate. So why read, one may ask? Well, for one thing twisted accounts of devious circumstances are always enjoyable when viewed from a distance (ie. the pages of a fictitious book, fictitious meaning \\"not real\\") and while bad things happen, even worse things are averted through intelligence, cunning, and the urge to teethe. Besides, who could resist such dark fun? It is sad, it is funny, there is an overlying sense of menace throughout but one reads in the hopes that our loveable protagonistic trio will prevail. But will they...? A Series of Unfortunate Events is a great way to get kids who are reluctant to read to do just that, much easier than say leaving such a child bound and gagged in a bird cage dangling thirty some feet above unpleasantly hard ground until they come to their senses! By no means is this series just for kids, \\"kids\\" meaning the offspring of goats, or perhaps humans? If you like Edward Gorey you'll love this series. Just pray that Lemony Snicket doesn't realize how deranged he is and decides to take medication to alleviate his madness. I, for one, enjoy it!
B000003BF1|5.0|For those about to start a &quot;Rolling Stones&quot; section in their music libraries, this is the first album to buy. While the singles the Stones released will certainly sound fine on a &quot;Hot Rocks&quot; collection, the listener does himself/herself a disservice by not learning about how the Stones paced an album. Even for those interested only in the hits, this disc features three of 'em right off--&quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; &quot;Midnight Rambler,&quot; and &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;--and those three rank among the finest of this band's vast catalog. My advice: listen to the album before buying a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compendium. The lesser-known songs may just fill in some holes.<br />Now, to what makes this record great:<br />It's an affirmation of what made Rock &amp; Roll great: danger. Rock &amp; Roll once was an emerging movement among African Americans--it originated in a subculture on which the mainstream had spent more than a century projecting all of its own worst fears of humanity. Lust, violence, and all other sorts of animalistic hungers--these &quot;dehumanizing&quot; aspects were projected onto black culture by generations of whites. As such, the exuberance inherent in the music became interpreted by older white people as inherently sinful and fearsome. It fascinated the younger generation of whites, many of whom were quick to appropriate the music for themselves. The sexual connotations, if somewhat diluted, still remained. Parents were still appalled. Lyrics thinly disguised situations in which &quot;heavy petting&quot; could ensue.<br />The Brits, when they finally got their hands on some of this music, were quick to see the essential connection between the rowdy exuberance of Rock &amp; Roll and the swaggering bravado of the blues music that spawned it. Musicians like Keith Richards and Mick Jagger listened to Muddy Waters as much as they listened to Chuck Berry (who was NOT far removed) or Buddy Holly. In the earlier British Invasion material it is easy to see the insistence of the teenaged libido. The Stones' covers of old blues standards were gleefully suggestive. Even the Beatles' early music incorporates this driving impulse.<br />Soon, however, other influences caused a shift from the raw and impulsive. Dylan (whose own take on the genre involved vast, cynical national portraits) wowed the Beatles into introspective songwriting. Musicians began incorporating eastern instruments and arrangements. A haze of drugs and experimentation resulted in a period in which rock's foremost groups were swept up in &quot;hippie&quot; ideals. Messages of free love intermingled with notions of pacifism. This Rock &amp; Roll almost seemed more influenced by Gandhi than by Muddy. In this period the Beatles released the supremely influential &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967), which heralded an era of higher-concept rock. Also at that time was the world broadcast of their straightforwardly-titled &quot;All You Need Is Love.&quot; The Stones followed suit, being somewhat drug addled themselves, with &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; (1967). Even in the depths of so-called &quot;psychidelia&quot; the Rolling Stones maintained a bleak edge to their music, but it was bookended with mushy indulgences and gentler themes.<br />When in 1968 the Stones shed the hippie trappings to record &quot;Beggar's Banquet,&quot; this was hailed as a return to form. But while the album was definitely devoid of the spaced-out, it was also oriented toward the acoustic. It reestablished the savage vitality of the Stones and set the stage for things to come.<br />This brings us to &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1969), which introduces new elements into the newly renovated malice of the 1968 Stones. The portentious opening song warns of a terrible, impending violence, always one small step away. At the same time, the embryonic self-referential irony of the previous album has been brought tothe forefront as Mick pokes fun at his own overwrought public image: &quot;I've got nasty habits. I take tea at three. Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner must be hung up for a week.&quot; He snarls these lines and the guitars snarl with him--the malice seems sincere, but it's obviously not a sincere statement. The predatory sexuality evident in &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; and &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; has also been expanded to absolutely mythic proportions with &quot;Midnight Rambler.&quot; Truly one of the band's most potent accomplishments, this song still gives me shivers. Here is the kernel of that essential danger--Mick sums up the whole song in the roaring close: &quot;I'll stick my knife right down your throat.&quot; Around this central lurking threat are situated the rest of the songs, along with their casts of shady characters: voiceless barroom queens, junkies, casual-sex-friends, and, finally, an unattainable seductress who drinks men's heartsblood. If the Stones really aren't as demonic as the &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; would have us believe, then the rest of the world more than makes up for it--specifically the women, who call out &quot;rape&quot; when the boys make their fabled midnight creep, but shun them when they lay down their love like an empty plate (&quot;just waiting here at your kitchen door&quot;).<br />What the Stones have done is to take the danger and the fear which initially characterized Rock &amp; Roll to their generation and elaborated on it. It's bleaker here, tempered by a bit of experience, but certainly just as forceful--a fine, cynical, vital farewell to the 1960s.
B000009QOC|5.0|Glenn Danzig's second album &quot;Danzig II Lucifuge&quot; is just as hard hitting as his first release.  The album grabs the listener and takes them on a journey through evil.  Danzig brings raw powerful songs like &quot;Snakes of Christ&quot; and &quot;Long Way Back From Hell&quot; and mixes them with soulful ballads such as &quot;Blood and Tears&quot; and &quot;Devils Plaything&quot; to make an incredablly powerful album.  Danzig  shows us that you don't have to be hard and fast to dwell in the realm of darkness.  This is one of Danzig's best albums if not the best.  Buy &quot;Danzig II Lucifuge&quot; and take a walk down the path of all things wicked.
0345440757|5.0|Secrets of the Baby Whisperer is a book all new parents should have. If you don't get anything else out of the book, you should get the fact that your new baby is already a person and deserves respect along with patience and love. We were very lucky in the fact that our baby is close to an &quot;angel&quot; baby but this book helped me to have a more relaxed attitude towards caring for my child. That attitude may have helped her to be more content. I love how practical Tracy Hogg is and her theories are very down to earth and easy to follow. On a personal note, I wish there was a little more on going back to work, but that was not the focus of the book!
6302968100|4.0|nothing can describe this movie other than as a kick a$$ film. It is cool, hip and fun to watch. Although some parts are very violent it is still very entertaining. Written by Quinton Tarantino (pulp fiction, jakie brown, resevuiar dogs) it is even beter. The story starts out with Christian Slatter (Very bad things) and Patricia Arquette (flirting with disaster, A nightmare on Elm ST part 3) as the love bug couple. OH its a nice quiet film untill Christian slatter desides to mess with Alabama's (partricia arquette)former pimp Gary oldman. Boy that makes a mess of things! also with Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Chrispher Walken and Samuel L. Jackson this movie awsome to watch! Directed by Tony scott this movie a masterpiece. the only thing that did make me a little puzzled about this film was one scene where Patricia Arquette was violently getting beat up. Rated R for Strong violence, lauguge and some sexuality this movie deserves 4 stars!--dillhead005
B000002P2V|3.0|This can't be the same band that produced &quot;Tommy,&quot; and &quot;Who's Next?&quot;, can it?  Unfortunately, by the time the punk explosion was in full swing (1978), The Who released an album of lumbering dinosaur rock the kind of which the punks were rebelling against.  Not to say the album is actually terrible.  In fact, many artists would be lucky to record an album even this good.  But the magic had worn off The Who formula by this time.  Songs like the title track (which gets in the &quot;f&quot; word, perhaps in an attempt to identify with the punks) and &quot;Sister Disco&quot; are kind of stirring, but nowhere near match the band's classic output.  Lyrically the band had pretty much run out of things to say.  Also, burned out drummer Keith Moon (who dies not long after the release of this album) shows little of what made him so great.<br />Overall, this album is for Who completists, but everyone else probably ought to save their money.

B000021YQV|5.0|After hearing Chop Suey I had to get this cd. As soon as I heard the first song, Prison Song, I knew I would love this cd. (I could rant for hours and hours about the drug war and the current ridiculous drug policy but &quot;Prison Song&quot; pretty much sums it up). Other very good songs are Forest, ATWA, Deer Dance, and Toxicity, but those are just my personal favorites-all the songs are good. There's little filler on this cd, if any. System is kind of different and not everyone will like them, but people who decide to give them one star should at least have enough musical knoweledge and intelligence not to compare System and Drowning Pool. They have different styles, System's being far superior, much more unique, interesting, and talented than Drowning Pool's (who should be classified under unoriginal, untalented, headache-inducing, Korn clone *expletive*-(censored courtesy of Amazon.com). This is completely random, but speaking of censoring isn't it great when Mtv shows some video that has fairly explicit and graphic scenes and then they go and beep out the &quot;s word&quot;. Well anyway, to sum up all the points in my random useless review I think the drug policy in the U.S. is idiotic, Drowning Pool sucks, I don't like censorship, and the System cd is awesome and everyone should go buy it.
B00004STPT|5.0|Outside of being remarkably akin to &quot;The Insider&quot; sound track, I found the music to be moving and even emotional at times (&quot;Sorrow,&quot; &quot;Patricide&quot;). The solos (cello and trumpet {I'm writing this w/o the CD insert so I might be mis-remembering the latter}) are especially lovely and strong. I would have wished for information on the insert to be more meaningful, i.e., an explanation for the title &quot;Progeny,&quot; did the &quot;lyrics&quot; mean anything?

I loved the movie and watched it on HBO quite a few times as well, even tho' I own the video.<BR>(In case you are wondering about my age, it's only 61!)

B00000DFSK|5.0|Having recently been lucky enough to see U2 at home in Ireland on the Elevation Tour (at Slane Castle), I just want to emphasise how brilliant they are live, and on this cd. Most of these songs were performed at the concert, and listening to the cd, you don't think they can sound any better... but they do when you hear them live in an open field full of 85 000 die-hard Irish fans. (who know every breath, guitar riff and word) =)<br />So buy this cd, and begin to experience their pure talent and utter genius- evident on songs such as the perfect 'With Or Without You', the haunting yet serene 'All I Want Is You', the mesmerising 'Where The Streets Have No Name' (brilliant, although Bono hates its beginning) and the best anthem ever, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'. Once you have heard this collection of songs, you will HAVE to see them live to experience them in an even better way. The only downfall will be that it cannot last forever. =)
B00003CXXS|4.0|I am a big fan of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; series, i loved the first one, the second one was well dissapointing, silly, a bit tedious and quite heavy for me on the violence, but Jurassic Park 3 is a big improvement over the second one, a smarter script, very good acting, great action sequences, but the plot seems a bit too thin, but it's quite a movie that reminded me of the first, but if they do &quot;Jurassic Park 4&quot;, i hope we see again to good old Dilophosaurus, all the characters from the other films, also that we see again Isla Nublar, i think that would be great, Jurassic Park 3, is not Oscar Winning Material, but it does do a big improvement over &quot;The Lost World&quot; as not being as cheesey, predictable as the second one, but it needs a better plot, but i enjoyed it.
B0000203YT|5.0|Shakespeare In Love is flawless. It is witty, funny, romantic, fast moving and very entertaining. The cast, acting, directing, editing, costumes, set direction, etc., could NOT have been any better than they already are in this film. The writers Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard are brilliant; and John Madden's directing made it all come together to create this masterpiece, which won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow's onscreen chemistry was believable. Miss Paltrow was well-deserving of her Oscar for her role as Lady Viola. This is still her best performance ever. Judy Dench, and Geoffrey Rush made their characters come alive by their talented portrayals; and everyone else in the cast played a character that made the film full of diversity. The story of Romeo and Juliet is told in a new perspective. We see the play from start to finish through the characters' eyes, as they rehearse and perform it; and it is Shakespeare's writing of this play that moves the story along. If you don't think you like Shakespeare, don't let the title of the film keep you from seeing it. You are sure to enjoy this film, and films this fantastic don't come around very often. Enjoy the movie!
6300184064|5.0|How to describe Brazil to someone who might never have seen it?  Its my favorite film but I still find it hard to put into words just what makes it so special.  This is one of the unusual films that, despite its considerable length, never fails to surprise.  On each viewing, I discover some new nuance, some previously unseen humor that only makes me appreciate this film all the more.  Every frame of Brazil contains a new surprise and it would be unfair to rob the viewer of those delightful discoveries by revealing too much about the film itself.  The plot is rather complex but, taken on its own terms, remains comendably coherent.  Sam Lowry is a burned-out civil servant in a country that seems to be England but apparently isn't.  He spends his days relishing his obscurity, living a highly detailed fantasy life where he takes the form of a winged hero that lives the type of exciting life that the rather drab Lowry can only dream of.  However, when an innocent man is arrested for &quot;terrorist acts&quot; and later killed during questioning, Lowry finds himself drawn into the nightmarish reality that he'd rather pretend didn't exist.  To give any further details would be unfair.<br />So, what is this film?  Some people have called it science fiction but it isn't.  Instead, its clearly a satire of everything reality has to offer.  Lowry lives in a tyranny that is maintained not through any grand schemes but instead through the oppression of constant and continual paperwork.  Its a world where people have sacrificed their individual liberties to a state that promises to fix any and all problems but only after the right forms have been filed with the right departments.  And, most frighteningly, its an increasingly plausible vision of a world where a man can be branded a criminal because he actually fixes a malfunctioning heating duct himself rather than waiting for &quot;Central Services&quot; to arrive.  As a filmmaker, Gilliam has always had the ability to create someof the most amazing dreamscapes that one could imagine and no where is this more obvious than in Brazil.<br />Some critics have complained that the film is, at times, excessive and lacks a strong central story.  These critics miss the point.  This film isn't about a central story.  Its about a vision of a society that matches our own more than we'd like to admit.  While the nominal villians at first come across as comical buffoons, they are revealed -- at the film's haunting end -- to be far more powerful and far more dangerous than anyone could have guessed.  <br />However, Brazil isn't a somber film.  Instead, its one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.  Despite the dark mood of many of the film's scenes, one can't help but laught out loud at the horrifically absurd situations that Lowry finds himself in.  Gilliam, of course, got his first taste of fame as a member of Monty Python and Brazil is filled with that troupe's anarchistic sense of humor.  As well, it features several wonderful performances.  Though Gilliam envisioned a younger man in the role, Jonathan Pryce is irreplaceable as Sam -- bringing a everyman feeling to a role that, as repeated viewings reveal, turns out to be a bit of a jerk.  Robert De Niro turns in a wonderful cameo and nice work is done by English character actors like Ian Holm, Jim Broadbent, Peter Vaughnn, and Ian Richardson.  However, my favorite performances are contributed by two people you might not expect.  Katherine Helmond, sadly known mostly for appearing in subpar sitcoms, is a true wonder as Sam's narcisstic mother while fellow Python alum Michael Palin manages to be both comically bland and believably threatening as Sam's friend Jack Lint.  (Palin also contributed one of my favorite throw away lines.  When asked about his twins, Palin blandly responds, &quot;Triplettes now.&quot;)  Only Kim Griest, playing Pryce's dream girl, is a disappointment.  Supposedly, she and Gilliam did not get along on the set and its obviousfrom her somewhat detached performance.  <br />Well, I wish I could sum this review up with something more eloquent and thought provoking but nothing I could say could hope to match up to the film itself.  So, I'll end with this.  If you've never seen Brazil, see it immediately!  (Just be careful to avoid the 90 minute version which was cut without Gilliam's input by nervous studio execs.)
B00005NB0H|4.0|Here we have one of the greatest rock performances ever recorded.  Period.  From a personal standpoint, I find this newly remastered deluxe edition easily worth the money.  Is this an essential purchase for the casual fan?  Maybe not.<br />The original 1970 release contained six rock masterpieces which showed the rough side of the Who.  Amazingly, given the growing public appetite for garish double live albums that was beginning to gain momentum at this time, the original Live at Leeds album was not even thirty minutes long.  It was this release that came to be known as perhaps the greatest album ever recorded.<br />In 1995, the original album was generously expanded to over twice its original length with the restoration of performances form the concert which showed the poppier and more experimental sides of the Who.  It also sounded better than ever.  This beautiful release only increased this album's already giant stature.<br />Now in 2001, we get the &quot;deluxe edition&quot; of this classic which now contains the complete performance of Tommy from this same show.  One could debate the placement of Tommy out of its original performance sequence by placing the entire thing on disc two, but I don't really think that this is a problem.<br />Personally, while I have always had a great amount of respect for Pete Townshend's first masterpiece, I've always considered it overblown, pretentious, and slightly dated (I've always considered Quadrophenia to the the better of the two).<br />On its own merits, the previous incarnations of Live at Leeds were perfect albums for anyone with more than a passing interest in rock and roll or the blues.  It is therefore appropriate that the original tracks be relegated to disc one.  It makes for easier listening.  These same casual fans may not really appreciate the pomp of Tommy on disc 2(although, in all fairness, it IS a really good performance).<br />In short, casual fans will definitely be more appreciative of the non-Tommy tracks and may be better served by purchasing the less expensive '95 reissue.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Nickleback's new album, &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; is well put together with powerful vocals and strong instrumentals. The lyrics can be related with most people using topics such as relationships, as seen in &quot;How You Remind Me.&quot; Nickelback can be compared to other bands such as Staind because of the combination of both hard and soft vocals. With other new bands coming into the music scene with similar sounds, Nickelback stands above them all.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I saw this movie expecting another teen comedy starring another actress who deserved a better role. Such actresses in the past have included Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Kirsten Dunst, Rachel Leigh Cook etc etc etc who not only out shined the movie, but suffered in the shadow of the movie's blandness. However, Reese Witherspoon fits perfectly as Elle, a charming and intelligant blonde who's shadowed by her own beauty and never given credit for anything but her looks. Put down, disrespected and broken hearted, this determine's our heroine Elle to try out for Harvard law school. Not only to prove to her ex how smart she can be, but to everyone...including herself. This film, although highly predicatble, is the most enjoyable, light-hearted movie since Clueless. Suprisingly touching and moving, Elle will win your heart, teach you a lesson and leave you with a smile.

0789723107|5.0|That was the nick-name I gave this book -- I got so much value without having to read a densely written text. It's one of the most usable, practical, and  well designed books I've ever read. <br />Bottom line: I learned how to conduct beautifully effective user testing with minimal investment, time, and reading!
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the only review I've ever bothered to write because I truely believe this disk deserves it. From start to finish this was the best line-up and best set of songs to come from Megadeth and I love em all! I think it's the energy you can feel that put's this one over the edge compared to all others. I think Dave's voice is perfect for the songs. So unique and original, that's a lost form in it's own right. And for those who are into lyrics, listen to &quot;Holy Wars&quot; (which was writen how long ago?) and look at today's events. Wow!<BR>I say, there is NO BETTER!
0784011796|5.0|This movie is shear genius! Aaronofsky will be remembered forever for this classic.  I won't go into the story because anyone who reads this will buy without question.  In the history of film there are only a handful that stand out at as landmarks in creation.  The \\"still cam\\" that is used will be seen often in the future.  (Already, Ritchie uses it).  The feelings that come over you during the viewing take you into the mind of Max.  You feel crazy!  Good Job.
B000056NX4|5.0|Allow me to summarize Jesus Christ Superstar's plot for you, roughly:<br />John 11:1-19:41.<br />There you go.  A bit out of order, but that's the story JCS presents to you in somewhat more modern, rock tones.  And then there's a bit of history that goes with the rock opera.<br />Jesus Christ Superstar started out as a concept album based on the work of an up-and-coming British composer/lyricist team, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.  It was released in 1970, a hit in the US, and not long after, JCS was produced on Broadway.  In 1973, a film by Norman Jewisson was produced, with some decidedly avant-garde choices of set and scenery, and a very '70s feel to the piece.  JCS kept going strong, including the Australian / New Zealand concert tour in 1992-93 (with dramatic re-envisioning of the musical elements) and the major 1996 British revival, which created a second concept album and brought stardom for Glenn Carter when he took on the role of Jesus.  (The 1970 concept album, Broadway cast recording, Australian cast recording, and 1996 concept album are all great entries in a cast album collection.)<br />In 1999, I believe, Gale Edwards revived the musical again, this time with rather minimalist staging (mostly centered around a very gothic set, with lighting as a major, major element) and starring Glenn Carter, again, as Jesus.  The costuming was modern, with bizarre choices for the priests and Roman guards, as well as for the ensemble in the second act.  Andrew Lloyd Webber, upon seeing this production, knew that it was the one that needed to be captured on film.  So, a cast was assembled and made into one incredible movie.<br />Glenn Carter plays Jesus, and does a dang good job of it.  He has a very distinctive voice and look for the role, such that he seems Jesus-ish even without a beard.  Carter's performance throughout is strong, bringing particular portions (such as &quot;Surely you're not saying we have the resources...&quot; in Everything's Alright) to completely new life.  He is very much a great physical presence in the film, and absolutely brings the house down with his rendition of Gethsemane, and it shows in this film.<br />French theatre star Jerome Pradon plays Judas Iscariot.  His inimicable singing voice adds just the right dimension to Rice's lyrics over ALW's music time and time again.  Visually, he re-defines the role of Judas--Jerome is downright frightening in a rather simple costume, including black leather jacket.  He is also a spectacular visual actor, and it is wonderful to see a Jerome performance on film record.  Particularly great are his Heaven on Their Minds (the first song with lyrics) and Superstar (last song with lyrics).  Throughout, he is certainly not a great person, but remains slightly sympathetic to the viewer.<br />Renee Castle is Mary Magdalene.  She takes the role to its own heights, especially in I Don't Know How to Love Him, which is entirely her own song by the time she's done singing it.  Mary is clearly and vividly portrayed here, and her interaction with Jesus makes IDKHtLH seem perfectly in place when she sings it.<br />For these three performances alone, the video is a must-buy.  But there's more.  Fred Johanson's Pontius Pilate is a strong and downright scary rendition, and although it's not my favorite (listen to David Burt on the 1996 concept album), it comes close.  Very close.  There is a brutal force of character to be watched here.  Rik Mayall as King Herod takes the most fun song in the show (the only fun song), and turns it into a somehow grotesque pageant, complete with lots of dancers.  It is the delivery of this piece that keeps it in pace with the rest of the show.<br />Frederick B. Owens as Caiaphas and Michael Shaeffer as Annas make for an otherworldly pair--for the bass, you've got a large, angry, shaven-headed, impossibly deep-voiced, goateed black man, with a Darth Vader look to him, and for the tenor you have a thin, pale, frighteningly hairless white man.Both make an incredible impression, especially on the definitive version of This Jesus Must Die.  Tony Vincent (dubbed &quot;The Militant Backstreet Boy&quot;) and Calvin Cornwall as Simon and Peter, respectively, bring a freshness to the roles.  Particularly, Cornwall's brief Peter's Denial establishes more character than has been seen in the song in most of the other recordings.  In Simon Zealotes, Vincent is downright convincing as well.  These songs both establish that even the ensemble in this film is spectacular.<br />Much of the movie--the use of about three sets for twenty-four scenes, with just lighting for the incredible variations, and the unique look of the film--must be seen to be experienced.  This movie is, fundamentally, a stage production transformed into a film, and it works.  There is no &quot;staged&quot; feeling here, and the whole thing flows remarkably smoothly considering that there are no real transitions in Jesus Christ Superstar.  Many (such as the brilliant change from Judas' Death to Trial Before Pilate) are almost daring beyond imagination.  In general, this movie can be appreciated by those with no, some, or extensive knowledge of the musical.  It's a treat to see it performed so well, and I think that every ALW fan, every Tim Rice fan, every JCS fan, and heck, every musical fan could benefit from owning this sweet, sweet recording.  And even if you're not a musical fan, you can still enjoy this film.

0790736039|5.0|I will be the first to admit that \\"accidents\\" do happen. The first time I saw this movie I was about 11 years old.  My 6 year old sister and I got it on tape as a Halloween gift from my \\"loving\\" older brothers.  Imagine my surprise when this horrible clown sucked poor Georgie into the gutter. \\"Don'cha' want a balloon, Georgie?\\"...\\"We AAAALLLL float down here.\\" AAAAHHHHHH!!!! What was he thinking?  Who in their right mind, talks to clowns in the sewer?  After that scene it was all down hill from there. <br />My sister left the room repeatedly during the movie but I was mesmerized.  I love to be scared.  The first tape caused me to lose all control of my bodily functions.  I did not eat or talk, I did not move, I did not go to the bathroom for the first 2 hours of the movie.  Once I had gotten through that, I figured I had conquered the world.  I never hid my eyes or flinched or jumped.  I was powerful at that moment.  Scared to death, but powerful still the same. I grabbed a sandwich, stretched a bit and popped in the second half.<br /> The second tape wasn't as bad, or so I thought...that is until the little old lady, Mrs. Kersh decided to give Beverly a tea cup full of blood... Her teeth turned brown and her voice changed....\\"Get Out\\"...WHEW.  Needless to say, I regained my ability to move again...my bowels.  I've been afraid of clowns ever since.  I'm 19 years old.<br />I've always been a Stephen King Fan.  The first novel I read was Salem's Lot at 8 years old and I love how he always pops up in all of his movies but for this one, I really,really hate him.
630027120X|5.0|This movie features Jeremy Irons playing a Jesuit Priest and Robert DeNiro who begins the movie as a slave trader.  The setting for the movie is South America where Spain and Portugal vie for land and power in the New World.  Featuring a beautiful soundtrack and lush scenes of forests, the movie appeals to the eyes and the ears.  The story of the Church and the priests caught up in the political world that takes this movie to another level.  Irons wants to protect the native people from slavery and domination while still keeping his vows.  DeNiro undergoes a conversion, but he favors any means necessary in defense of his new beliefs.  An excellent movie.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson is a musical genius. His first CD out of HIStory is amazing. But then again, so is his second. But people don't agree with that. Maybe because the songs weren't so commercialized or maybe because they were made after Michael got a bad rep. All I know is that Michael is a major influence on so many singers (and me) and his second CD is just as good as the first. If his second CD was more well-known and had a lot of good reviews, I'm sure many more people would follow that example and agree that it is ingenius and pure &quot;Michael Pop&quot;. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B00005NGZX|3.0|perhaps some of you missed out on the death metal craze of the early 90's? well, converge obviously didn't. they've done their homework and listened to some of their favorite death metal and grind albums. <BR>yet, i must say that it is a good album and i always give credit were credit is due. other than coalesce they are one of the best bands in a genre turned metal. and at least they've managed to make up for that mediocre split w/ agoraphobic nosebleed. cheers!
6305971099|5.0|HALLOWEEN 5 is a scary sequel that has all the susepnse and scares you'd expect from Michael Myers and company.  You might say this is the sequel that officially made the series a &quot;stereotypical slasher movie&quot; but I look at movies like HALLOWEEN 5 and compare them to sequels like FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 5 and you suddenly realize HALLOWEEN 5 is a masterpiece.  H5 has a dark atmosphere, some really frightening set pieces, and Donald Pleasence gives his best performance as the crazed Dr. Loomis.  The DVD is pretty good, with an old documentary, &quot;some&quot; new interviews, a TV spot (no trailer!!) and a booklet.  The new transfer is also the best looking print I have ever seen for this movie.  Worth the cash.
B00005NP04|5.0|This CD is really cool. I has all the most popular songs on it of hers.  Three of the songs are:  Independence Day, God-fearin women get the blues, and Love's the only house.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Even after 70 years, few horror movies match the spooky ambiance of James Whale's original FRANEKENSTEIN.  And few actors who have since tackled the role of the Monster have been able to invoke the same ambivalence of feeling that the master of the macabre, Boris Karloff, can stir up from in audience.  Indeed, Karloff's sympathetic yet horrifying performance alone makes this film worth watching (again and again!), but add to it the gothic sets and Whale's interesting direction, and you have that nearly perfect spine-chilling mood for which all horror aficionados search--and all without graphic gore.  Though this film does not precisely follow the novel by Mary Shelly on which it is based, no other film version of the theme matches this one.  The DVD not only includes includes the infamous girl-at-the-lake scene, but the previously distorted line of dialogue--&quot;Now I know what it feels like to be God!&quot;--is also restored!  (One of Whale's best films, he actually outdoes himself in the sequel, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.)
B00004X01U|5.0|This album is an absolute must have. Madonna has never sounded better, and Music is an awesome follow up to Ray of Light. I can't wait to hear her next album!!!
B000001FS3|5.0|This album literally changed my life forever. When I had cancer and was in sucidal state. My brother got me 3 CDs that he thought I would cherish. Nirvana's Nevermind, RHCP's BloodSugarSexMagik, and this one. I do cherish these, especially this one. It taught me to love life and fight what was in my way. I lisened to these CDs over and over again until my cancer was away and now I'm as good as new. Thank you, U2.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|This CD is worth owning for many reasons, especially for the rivetting philosophic debate in &quot;Summer Days Summer Nights&quot; regarding the possibility of repeating the past. What's that? You can't tolerate philosophy in your music? &quot;Why don't ya just shove off if it bothers you so much?&quot;
B000002J1X|5.0|YES before they were YES. This album stands above their first eponymous release as being more closely linked to what they would eventually become with the inclusion of Steve Howe. Peter was still with the band at this time, and his jazz chops jive well with the strings (a harkening forth of where YES's music would go, with more complicated song structures and arrangements). This is a curious mix of prog rock fundamentalism and late psychedelia. The band's past is in evidence as it struggles to forge its future. Jon Anderson's lyrics have more in common with YES ALBUM and FRAGILE than the story-song drivel he wrote for the first LP. This is quite honestly the prequel to THE YES ALBUM, and it shows. The only thing is missing is Steve Howe, but Peter Banks allows you to forget all about him. Banks is a strong musician and it would have been interesting to see where YES would have gone had he remained with the band.<BR>All things considered, this is a terrific album. They utilize two cover tunes (as they did on the first LP), which is something they didn't do later in the life of the band. It's interesting to see where one of prog rock's greatest heroes (or rock in general) came from.<BR>Must see it to believe it. An all-around great CD.[....]
B00004W4UB|4.0|Another remake of classic Jeckyl &amp; Hyde story. Now from the point of view of the maid, Mary Reilly. This is well made movie but it performed badly in the box office. I believe this is the worst performing (box office wise) in Julia Roberts career. I really don't think this is the right part for her. The rest of the casts are wonderful. John Malkovich is excellent as both Jecky &amp; Hyde. Glenn Close has supporting role. The DVD is quite good. Picture is sharp &amp; clear despite a lot of the movie took place in the dark. The Dolby 5.0 is OK, why they don't add the .1 for the subwoofer channel is beyond me. But if you like the Jeckyl Hyde story, this DVD will not disappoint you.
0312954468|5.0|River God is one of the best adult books I have read in a long time.  I am facinated by ancient Egypt, and this novel really helped me understand what may have been common then.  Also, I don't care for overly dirty books, so this novel was a perfect choice for me.  It was very realistic yet not overly graphic in the sex department (possibly because the narrator is a eunuch.) It is never boring and Mr. Smiths, wording makes the book feel so colorful and alive.  He is certainly a gifted author.  Even though the story came from an ancient text, he has translated it into a novel any lover of books would enjoy.  Take may advice and read this book.  You won't be dissapointed.

B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is a shocking veiw of the drug world and the true effects it has on people. Through its four characters, played brilliantly by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, you see the effects different kinds of drugs have on different walks of life. The excitment of this wonderful film is nurtured and at times heightened by the amazing cinematography. This electrifying film will have you hearing the requiem of the lovable characters and dreaming about the chance that this could happen to you.<BR>   I thought that Requiem was a wondefful work of art that deserves to be seen by all that coudl fully appreciate it. I thought it was wonderfully done and perfectly cast. Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of the secluded and desperate Sarah was Oscar worthy and one of her greatest and most intriguing roles.

B00005Q4GA|5.0|I didn't think I would really like this movie; at the time Angelina Jolie wasn't one of my favorite actresses. But I was having a good day anyway when my mom asked me if I wanted to see it with her at the theater downtown. One thing about it is that the score was great!!  I wish they would have included more of it on the score Cd. Some of the fight scenes were cheesy, but it was a very intriguing plot. Hardly a bit of boredom came to me. I like the way it ended.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This really is the way the life was during the time of the Godfathers.  Really Mafia but either way its a very real movie. And Marlon Brando made it Great!! I just love the movie and how they respected him and the ones that stepped in his shoes after death. They were a very close knitted family and thats the way family really should be.  Especially if you still live with them. Or if you respect and honor them.  I would very much like to see Godfather IV. It was on T.V. with Pacino very gray and his son was given the ring. But Pacino sister didn't like him. And I can't remember if the son took it or not. If possible fine this movie, please. If you like the way life was then or still is then you will really love these movies. I believe you can get a child to understand these movies. But you have to really handle it very carefully. Adults now has a hard time understanding themselves more less others. Maybe thats why I have always liked this movie. To me its not just their way of laws,dues of rent or others taxes. But who was #1.
0515127485|4.0|I had especially saved &quot;Archangel&quot; as a read during my first-ever trip to Russia, and hats off to Mr. Harris for recreating the country's atmosphere and scenery so brilliantly. &quot;Archangel&quot; is a well-written and dark thriller, the characters come across as extremely believable.<br />The only problem I had with the book is the over-the-top ending which somehow does not fit the pace of the rest of the book.

0446608955|4.0|\\"Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends in a tear.\\"  This famous quote depicts the lives of the two main characters in A Walk to Remember.  While reading this heart-warming novel, I could not help but become overwhelmed with the story itself.  The fact that two teenagers could make a connection, which is beyond ordinary society's comprehension, besieged me and showed me that the idea of true love could actually develop between two opposites.<BR>     Landon Carter was a typical teenager, who was overly concerned about his outside appearance and his reputation among his friends.  He was the type of person who would do anything to fulfill others' expectations of what they believed he should be. He lived his life in the shadow of his father, whose main goal was to mold Landon into a younger version of himself.  While doing so, he was so self-absorbed that he did not take the time to notice all the wonderful surroundings. <BR>     Jamie Sullivan was far from a typical teenage girl; she was not disturbed with outside appearances, popularity, or the materialistic world.  Instead she thrived on her innermost feelings, emotions, and faith.  She came from a very religious family and was very loyal to volunteering at the local orphanage, taking care of her widowed father and helping injured animals.  Jamie came across as a quiet content church going girl.  <BR>     Throughout the book, Landon and Jamie display their differences, but when the homecoming dance is only a few weeks away, everything shifts.  Landon is left dateless, and Jamie is one the only girls left.  He ends up asking her to the dance and she agrees.  The two end up hitting it off really well.  Through this a close bond begins to form. She begins to change his perspectives on life, helps him though a major decision, and brings out the true beauty within him.  <BR>     This touching novel illustrates the true beauty inside of us all.  Landon Carter went out on a limb to ask Jamie Sullivan to the homecoming dance even though she was not his first choice; as a result he found true love. By reading this book and watching the characters change each other over time you will be astonished.  It is amazing to watch the beauty of true love grow so pure between two young teenagers who appear as complete opposites.<BR>     Nicholas Sparks has written another brilliant account of a relationship his readers can relate to.  I feel that A Walk to Remember is a remarkable book that everyone can connect with.  This breathtaking book is a must read for anyone growing up in today's society.
630542845X|5.0|I was working for a radio station and our station did a free screening for this movie, so I got my friends tickets.  I was so busy working that night that I did not have time to watch the movie.  A couple days later, I asked my friends what they thought of it? They replied, that it was the best movie they had ever seen, I laughed and said you don't have to go overboard in gratitude for the free tickets...they further replied, that they were serious. Well, I never got around to seeing it at the theater and so ended up waiting till it came out in video.  I was totally expecting this film to be a so, so, well it wasn't so,so, it was incredible and moving, not too many films have touched me the way this one had. So as far as rating it...it is easily a 5 star movie.   It was not till now in stumbling across the title that I realized that I can own this on DVD, so hence here I am [...]making sure that this movie is part of my collection.  The sad part, that there is no way you can do a sequel to this. :-)
0789723107|4.0|First of all, let's be clear what this book is all about. \\"Usability\\" is a measure to determine how successful a design, whether it's a newspaper, a web site, or a WalkMan, is when engaged by human hands and eyes. There are no set \\"rules\\" of usability, just tried and true \\"common sense approaches\\" that make sense, right off the bat, to just about anyone who comes in contact with a piece that has been designed for interaction.<br />For example, think of your average stereo or mp3 player. If you wanted to hear music, what would you do? Just about everyone would scan the object with their eyes, trying to find a symbol or word to guide them. In this case, they'd look for a right pointing triangle, commonly known as a \\"play\\" button. This all happens within milliseconds, subconsciously, but we all do it. The easier it is to find what you're looking for and engage that option, the higher usability marks the object receives. That's a rather simplistic explanation of usability, but it's the basis of this book when applied to the web.<br />Author Steve Krug makes a living critiquing web sites to establish how easy they are for your average Joe to use. He gathers willing participants, sits them down in front of a computer, and asks seemingly obvious questions like \\"do you know where you are?\\", \\"do you know what this company does?\\", \\"where would you click first, and why?\\", etc.<br />It's not rocket science, that's for sure. But if a company is planning on making money off of their web presence, a confusing web site could put them in the dog house with consumers.<br />And that's the important thing to realize about \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" -- this book is written from the viewpoint of what \\"works\\" with e-commerce sites. It's the greasing of the wheels to make a shopping experience fast, intuitive, trusting, and most importantly, EASY.<br />If you are a graphic designer, consider the web to be your personal playground to create, engage, shatter conventions and develop new ideas in design, this book is not for you.<br />Krug acknowledges this up front, but insists that the lessons learned in this book can be applied to just about ANY web design that deviates from the norm. And in a sense, that's quite true. If you were to build a shining new city on the hill with ultra modern buildings and cutting edge style, you'd still need an effective transportation system to tie your creation together.<br />But where the book stumbles is that Krug only promotes (or acknowledges) one ubiquitous web design style -- a company logo in the upper left corner, folder tab navigation across the top, and subsections down the left side. Sound familiar? It should...take a look at the top of this page.<br />P>His opinions would be more trustworthy if he would critique non-standard, but successful examples of web design that are just as effective. But he only offers one solution, and it's one all of us are very aware of already.<br />Krug does have useful points to remember -- including consistency of style, navigation, and brand identification -- but when you get down to it, it's all COMMON SENSE. Open your browser, check out eBay, Outpost.com, or Salon.com, and study their navigational systems, use of color and contrast, and copy length. See how they allow you to move between pages, subsections, and the placement of navigational icons. Then ask yourself, how did I KNOW to click there? Was it the wording? The color?<br />This book would be a lifesaver to anyone who was just starting out designing for audiences on the web however, so if you have yet to design your first web site, by all means pick this up. The lessons to learn here are just as important (if not more so) as learning HTML. Because if you didn't want people to use and enjoy your work, you wouldn't be putting it on the web.
6302054982|5.0|Though I love Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, I must say Goodfellas is my favorite Scorcese movie.  The other two movies were great dramatic pieces, but this movie is just to damn cool.  First of all the pacing is beautiful.  This thing moves like gangbusters for the whole movie.  The second is the editing.  The quick cuts add a ton to the movie.  Next is my all time favorite actor Robert De Niro.  Though in a smaller part than in other Scorcese pictures, he still puts in a good performance.  Joe Pesci is also great as Tommy DeVito rightfully won the best supporting actor award.  So overall, being the Scorcese afficiando that I am, Goodfellas stands out as the best of Scorceses career.  Raging Bull had better acting, Taxi Driver was more disturbing but the clicher has to be the &quot;how am I funny&quot; scene which is classic.<br />So if you like the Sopranos or any other gangster movie see Goodfellas.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Orchestral strings largely displace the guitar strings, and sap a little of the bounce and originality from Diana Krall.  Still, her vocals are thoughtful and where the piano gets a chance, it doesn't disappoint.<br />I would certainly be curious about how much Ms. Krall contributed to the style of the arrangements and orchestration.  In some ways, this reminds me of Billy Holiday with the orchestra.  While Diana is left to improvise a little with vocals, the strings aren't all that interesting, and it seems like we lose a dimension.<br />It's hard to find a guitar, piano, and great vocalist combo.  Maybe she'll get back to that next time.<br />Still, if you're a Diana Krall fan, you should buy it.
B00004X01U|2.0|Madonna's latest CD, Music, is not what I was hoping for.  There are only two songs that I really, really like...Music and What It Feels Like For A Girl.  I like Music because it's a clubby dance song.  I like What It Feels... because the music and tone are reminiscent of Rain...one of my favorite Madonna songs.  Both songs reflect Madonna's Material Girl style.<br />The rest of the songs are a little too &quot;Spanish-guitary&quot; and folksy for me...as if she's being experimental, which is a good thing.  Unfortunately, I haven't listened to Madonna's previous albums (Ray Of Light &amp; ) so I don't know if these songs are actually indicative of her current style.  But as I mentioned, I prefer her clubby dance hits, which may no longer be her music focus.<br />So for me, this is a CD with 2 great songs and 8 not so good songs.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Simply put, this is the best live album ever released and possibly that there ever will be. I haven't owned it in any previous form, but couldn't pass it up in its extended form. Could not have been more pleased. There is no live album out there that puts off so much raw energy or sound. The Who seem to be putting there collective energy into each song as if it is the last time they'll ever be able to perform it and as if they are out to prove something. Cover versions of &quot;Young Man Blues,&quot; &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; and &quot;Shakin' All Over&quot; expell a rawness long forgotten in rock music and re-create the songs into hard-rockin' masterpieces. The Who also seem to put new energy into their own classic in &quot;A Quick One..,&quot; &quot;My Generation,&quot; and &quot;Magic Bus.&quot; And that's just side 1. Side 2 features one the greatest achievements in rock history: The Who's Tommy in full live version. The classic shines in the live form with each Who member putting their all into it, even after playing it live for the last year. Really this is where live albums begin and end. No collection is complete without it.
B000002UDB|5.0|This album is stuck between Sgt Peppers and the White Album but recently I have begun to listen to this again.  THis album contains some of the best songwriting and musical experimentation in their careers.  &quot;I am the walrus&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; are two of John's best work and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; is one of Paul's best.  Throw in &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;, &quot;All you need is love&quot; and the title track and it sounds like you are listening to a greatest hits album.   Honorable mention needs to go to &quot;Baby you're a rich man&quot; as one of my personal favorites. I agree that &quot;Flying&quot; is a bit goofy, but hey, it's the Beatles... they can make anything sound good.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Wow! - This album is one hell of an album. I do not know why the editoral review is so critical of the songs on this album. [. . ..] This is music that is passionate and sincere. I can not stop listening to this album. It is incredible. I can not wait until I get a chance to see him live. If you like any of Ryan Adams previous material, this is a must have. Go get it, you will not be disappointed. Rock on--
B000002W5J|4.0|This album would be just another good album if you just look at its two big hits &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and White Rabbit&quot;.  It is the other songs that make this album a 1967 gem.  &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Coming back to me&quot; are beautiful Marty Balin balleds.  &quot;She has funny cars&quot; and &quot;3/5 of a mile&quot; are great 60s San Fran tunes.  I give it 4 stars because side two, with the exception of &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, is somewhat weak.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I picked this album up not knowing what to expect, having never heard sigur rs before.  I'm an avid Bjrk fan, but this furthered my appreciation for Icelandic music and the language.  The music goes from ambient to soothing orchestration to jazzy to almost straightforward rock.<BR>Definitely a must-have.
B00004X01U|4.0|Although this album is not as deep and contemplative as &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; it offers a variety of catchy and ORIGINAL fast and slow tunes.  I guess you could say it's the lighter side of a mature Madonna.
B000002552|5.0|THE BASEMENT TAPES' central problem, and here I speak of the official, double disc 1975 album is presentation.  If the reader will read very many of these reviews he/she will keep coming to those who talk about the historical inaccuracy of this record and why, with so much (still unreleased) music in the vaults, it only makes this album all the more flawed.  I will not go into detail on the historical inaccuracies other than what is immediately relevant to my own review as other reviewers have covered this topic quite thoroughly (given the review word limit).  Alexander G. Lynn's review (7-1-01) is an excellent introduction into the various historical inaccuracies.  <br />Essentially, the eight Band songs present are not legitimate but recorded later by The Band.  The commonly agreed reason (well backed with evidence) is Robbie Robertson's ego.  Historically this release paints The Band as being nearly as active during as Dylan, which simply isn't true.  Dylan was the clear domineering force in the sessions, although that should not alone be reason enough to discount the worthwhile contributions that The Band brings to these recordings.  Dylan and The Band fed off each other's energy.<br />My main gripe with the presentation of THE BASEMENT TAPES is this blatant deception by Robertson, for the unimportant reason of feeding his own ego, totally throws this otherwise flawless album into the gutter simply because it entails all the wrong criteria to judge this work.  From a historical viewpoint, this record needs an incredible amount of work.  Eight tracks passing for THE BASEMENT TAPES when they were not even recorded at the sessions do indeed have no business here (from the historical standpoint, that is, though not necessarily a musical, ascetic standpoint).  Not only that, these eight tracks were made to sound lo-fi to fit more into the official release.  It is bad enough to include tracks not recorded at the sessions, but to tamper with them makes it even worst.<br />We now come to the crux of the matter: the wrong criteria (from an ascetic point of view) is used (and must be, because of the method of presentation) in judging this work.  With the release of THE BASEMENT TAPES, everyone came at this work from a historical vantage point.  This is still prevalent, and it is not unreasonable.  Because this criteria is used, THE BASEMENT TAPES are often viewed as deceptive and a botched opportunity (which, again, this release is indeed guilty of historically).  To be fair, it would have been unprecedented for Columbia to release the complete Basement Tapes recordings.  The five CD-set, with the extended time length unavailable to vinyl records, would be a massive set unparalleled with anything else in 1975.  Box sets were not established as commercially viable until the mid to late 1980s with the publication of Dylan's BIOGRAPH and Clapton's CROSSROADS.    This is important facet for my view of this album, because without this facet the view I am about to state would be damnably undermined.<br />If you strip this album away from the mindset of \\"This is the Basement Tapes,\\" and instead approach it with \\"This is Dylan and The Band reinventing Americana,\\" suddenly the problems with this album just melt away.  All of the music here is brilliant, including the eight Band songs.<br />What would make this album a success would be had it been released not as THE BASEMENT TAPES, but a double album utilizing parts of THE BASEMENT TAPES and Band songs that had not been officially released to give us a chronicle of their reinvention of Americana.  From that standpoint, this album becomes an absolutely smashing success.  Had this approach been adopted, the historical inaccuracy would not exist for the fact there were songs included that were not Basement Tapes would simply not be an issue because they were not being presented as Basement Tape tracks.  <br />The reason why the establishment of Box Sets had not been included was because therewould be the very reasonable question of WHY didn't they just release all of them?  My answer, had it been presented properly, would be they found an official reason to release the songs.  As it stands, the entire body of recorded Basement Tapes songs give us the same feeling: this is Americana at it's wildest, weirdest, and, oddly, most modern, yet because of the fact that had not been established, instead they give us this double album.  <br />If this was presented as a study in Americana, this would be fully appreciated as the wonderful album it is.  In his 2001 release LOVE AND THEFT*, Dylan does much the same with taking old musical traditions, letting them retain their traditional feel to it, yet giving us uniquely modern music based on traditional song structures and breathing new life into them.  The reason THE BASEMENT TAPES are so famous is because Dylan does the same here*.  In a time when psychedelic was at its most prominent, Dylan and The Band was recording music that were at great odds with the musical community.  CCR is the only comparable band during this time frame that engaged in the same sort of musical rebellion, and although they have a string of must-have albums, they do not reach the brilliance here.  Their music was recorded for release whilst this was not. <br />Another thing this ascetic way of approaching this album has going for it, while historically a travesty, the eight Band tracks provides a context for Dylan's wild and extremely loose approach to these sessions, as AMG points out.  <br />Bottom line:  From a historical viewpoint, a botched opportunity.  From the viewpoint of a study in Americana, this stands as one of the best albums ever issued. ...Dylan synthesized older traditions into music for our day and age. ...  Dylan could not have accomplished this without burying himself in traditional songs and the older music of an era long ago.  THE BASEMENT TAPES of the 1960s and LOVE AND THEFT of 2001 have so much resonance becauseof Dylan's presentation of the older style of music in a distinctly modern approach, creating a tension that would not otherwise be there.
B000001E3V|4.0|This album is a pretty nice document at their only stint at the Fillmore East in Oct. 70', with some nice moments from the Dominos, which was arguably Clapton's finest moment (sorry, it isn't Crossroads). Where is Duane? Well, he was touring with his own band of course (he did join them for two known shows)! This leaves Clapton as the sole axe man during their first &amp; only US tour. <br />The playing is loose, relaxed, even a little nervous... especially in EC's singing. There ARE other recorded shows by the Dominos which has them as tight as a fist, &amp; on fire. Listening to their shows a month or so later, the performances are like night &amp; day. No kidding. <br />A shame... b/c these &quot;other&quot; performances were never recorded professionally. They really did get ALOT better live after their Fillmore stand. Either way, this is a nice little set of a band that was too good to last. By the time they peaked live in early December, it was the beginning of the end. It's also probably Clapton's best live document available commercially, which is rather odd after all these years.
0393312836|5.0|This is a book I had to buy 3 times before my mom stopped throwing it away, and she threw away the DVD I bought of it too. It's trash, she said. I thought it was a good commentary on what's wrong and what's right with the world. I read the book in school, because I _wanted_ my teachers to see I was reading it, because I wanted to wear my mind on my sleeve to some extent, by showing them a book that meant something to me.<br />Much to my surprise and chagrin, they did not respond as my mother did. In fact, they would ask me why I found it engaging (and believe me, I did), and they would talk to me about the characters and the story. It was a book that made me re-evaluate a lot of things in my world, and to a large degree, it helped me (indirectly) gain some valuable insight into myself and the people around me.<br />To say this book didn't change my life would be a lie. In fact, I'm sure this book changed in one way or another the life of everyone who's read it. Lately, in America especially, people will hide behind the veil of decency and what's right and good to repress and take away freedom. ACWO indeed gives a deep insight into this sort of action, and the deadly and terrible consequences it may have.<br />It dares to ask the question of if good is good because of intentions or because of instinct. In a more direct way of saying it, it says &quot;does society act civil because it wants to or because it is somehow forced to by an influence other than its own&quot;.<br />Like &quot;Mother Night&quot; by Vonnegut, this book points out that the individual, no matter how much you might not like them, or how much you might not believe who they really are, is defined by their actions and their words, and that the world around them forces who they appear to be onto them, or forces its views of who they are onto them.
6302732875|5.0|Probably the best ensemble acting I've ever seen.  Proves that Mamet can translate to film as long as he's not directing it and none of his wives are in it.<br />By the way, this is Al Pacino's best perofrmance ever and, for that matter, Alec Baldwin's best too.<br />Everyone is strong in this.<br />A GREAT GREAT Film.
0525457585|5.0|I remember as a kid, going to the movies with my family to see this movie. We were all completely enraptured with the movie because we all cheered, laughed and cried along with the characters. When I finally got the book a few years later, it was so much richer and detailed and it had many more adventures that Atreyu/Bastian went on. The movie is good, but the book is MUCH better! It has characters and adventures that would have filled at least 5 movies worth of material.<br />The concept that the story inside a book is real and changes based on who is reading it, is intriguing and has you really believing that it could happen to you. I am so glad the movie introduced me to this book because it is a delight to read again and again. I highly recommend the illustrated, hardcover edition as it is the closest to what Mr. Ende had in mind when he wrote it.<br />If you were a fan of the movie like me or want to see the story in action, pick up the DVD or VHS version. Even though I don't really recommend the sequel to the original movie since I feel it is the same movie rehashed and the book tells the story so much better than any movie. Still, for completeness, you may want to see the second movie. Finally, there is the third movie (which I haven't even seen since I have only heard bad things about it) although it might be best to pretend that it was never made. ;)

0380788624|5.0|While some of the events of history have been altered for the book, it is amazing how much more interesting the PBS (educational station in the USA) special was the following weekend on cryptography and WWII.   Not only does this book show a real side to the challenges faced in the past, but also in the future.  It is ironic, if not a catalyst, that the book came out and a few months later Seal Island became an island soverenty trying to be a data haven.  Our real world, whether predicted, history being told, or present being reviewed, is brought to life in a real way.  I've read Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, and he just keeps getting better.  Don't think one night's reading will get you through this book, because it won't.  But what a mind-altering experience!  Wow!
B00005J9U1|4.0|If you're not a huge reggae fan, but just want one or two cds in your repertoire to represent the genre, then &quot;One Love&quot; is for you.  It's a nice collection of familiar favorites, plays well into a shuffle of party music.
B000059MEK|1.0|That was really the only worthwhile track on the CD. This purchase confirmed my sneaking suspicion (obtained via several vain attempts to have a good time clubbing in France) -- i.e., the French do not rock.
B000056PAO|5.0|THIS CD ROCKS!!!!!! If you are a fighter or even a fresh fighter you'll love this CD. Fraternity, which is not on the U.S. version, is one of thier best tracks to date. If you like any form of rock you must have this CD.
6304994540|5.0|This is another masterful work from the Coen Brothers loosely in the style of their previous comedies.  The characterizations are fantastic, and are magnificently portrayed by Turturo, Goodman, Bridges, and Buschemi.  The camera work is also wonderful: take the scene that introduces Turturo in the bowling alley...fantastic application of both motion and cutaways. <br />And of course, the dialogue is typically brilliant Coen.  &quot;I'm the dude, so that's what you call me, you know? Uh, that or uh, his dudeness, or uh, duder, or uh, you know, el duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.&quot;
B0000029GA|5.0|A lot of rap albums come out, and they get a lot of glamour.  Filled with slammin' beats, these rap albums may play well on the radio for a few weeks, but most don't have playability - the ability to play over and over again in your system.  That's where Nas' Illmatic is different.  I bought Illmatic in 94' and guess what?..it's still in my 50cd changer after all these years, despite the fact that i have a 100+ albums.  It's that good.<BR>  Illmatic has no filler material.  Every song is unique and adds value to the album.  There really isn't a bad song on the album.  On the other hand, there aren't any radio hits either, which makes this a very underrated album.  Many people have never even heard of this album which is sad. However, I have to say if your expecting Warren G type beats, you're in for a surprise.  The 10 songs on the album have a laid back beat, with an emphasis on the lyrics rather than the beats (although the beats are damn good, i.e It Ain't Hard to Tell).   <BR>  My favorite songs on this album are It Ain't Hard to Tell, The World Is Yours, Represent, and One Love, but the rest of the songs are very good songs as well. The thing about this album is that the more you play it, the better it gets, even after 7 years of listening to it.  This would probably be the greatest album of all time, the second being Tupac's Greatest Hits CDs.
6300182282|4.0|After I watched this film, I felt like someone had ripped my heart out, stomped on it and then put it back.  <br />The acting is excellent, especially on the part of Ellen Burstyn, who is always just fabulous in everything she does.  She and Alan Alda managed to make even the silly lines seem natural and appropriate.  After playing the character on stage, Ms. Burstyn obviously embodied Doris by the time she made the film.<br />While I found both George and Doris irritating at first, they grew on me, and by the time it was over, I found myself liking and even respecting them.  I don't think adultery is ever acceptable, but somehow they made you forget what they were doing was wrong because of their chemistry and bond.<br />I saw Same Time, Next Year for the first time this year and it does seem a little dated in some ways.  However, I believe that the core message is basically timeless.  Both actors do a great job of conveying the personal and physical changes that the characters were supposed to be undergoing over the course of 26 years.  I think I read somewhere that Ellen Burstyn only has one adopted child, but she was completely natural in the part where Doris was pregnant.  You would have thought SHE really was pregnant at the time.<br />Overall, though, I don't think I could put myself through the emotional distress of watching this film very often.  Yes, it is sweet, touching and even funny at times.  But, I also found it gut-wrenching.  The whole concept that two people who are soul-mates could find one another by chance in the great big world but can't really be together is one of the saddest things I can conceive.  <br />Perhaps what made the love Doris and George had for each other so special WAS the fact that they spent only one weekend a year together.  What they had never became mundane or tired because of how little time they had together.  It makes you wonder if they would have made it as a couple on a day-to day basis.  If you really love someone asmuch as they seemed to love each other, 2 days a year together is simply not enough.  You want to share everything with them.  <br />While I admire their devotion to their families, these two characters just broke my heart.  I probably don't appreciate film for film's sake enough, but I've accepted that I like traditional happy endings.  This one was a little too bittersweet for me.  I bawled like I had lost a loved one when it was over.  In fact, if I want to cry on cue, all I have to do is think about Same Time, Next Year.<br />It would be interesting to see someone make a film of the sequel. I think both Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn (especially Burstyn, who is even more stunning now at nearly 70) could believably play George and Doris again from the ages of early 50s to late 60s.  I'll probably just have to picture that one in my mind's eye.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Gold is Ryan Adams' most ambitious album to date, following hot on the heels of the release of Whiskeytown's Pneumonia and last year's landmark Heartbreaker. Adams is a formidable talent, with a remarkable back catalogue of stunning albums, including 1997's brilliant Stranger's Almanac, but with Gold, the little genius has perhaps produced his most awesome batch of songs yet.<BR> The scope of Gold (which originally was intended to be a double album) is bewildering; Adams effortlessly switches between piano and strings ballads and relentless rockers such as &quot;New York, New york&quot; and &quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues,&quot; the latter a track that Keef and Mick would be proud of. There is not a bad or dull song on the entire set, and the list of potential classics is endless, whether it be &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot; with its beguiling melody, the Van Morrisonesque &quot;Answering Bell&quot; or the bitter-sweet &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Blvd.&quot; The only minor gripe, and one that is down to a matter of personal preferance, is that &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; should be replaced by the superior &quot;The Bar is a Beautiful Place,&quot; one of the songs left off the album, but which can be found on the bonus disc. Ryan Adams is a contemporary singer-songwriter without equal, one of the very few that can truly aspire to greatness.<BR> Buy this album- its pure gold.

B00003CXN4|3.0|There are a few interesting characteristics to this movie.  The camera work -- particularly in the Mexico scenes -- is interesting.  The weaving of real people in government into the movie adds some flavor.  However, the overall experience is less than spectacular.  Michael Douglas is neither good nor bad, he is simply Michael Douglas.  The shining star in this movie is Benecio Del Toro as the gritty south of the border cop.  Start with a rental before you jump to a buy.
B00000IO4I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was funny and very entertaining. Jane Horrocks is so wonderful in this movie, her impressions are impressive. I loved the music, I happen to share the love for Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Marilyn Monroe, as does the character, L.V. If you didn't enjoy the film, don't waste your time writing an review with so many misspelled words. Oh, and I must mention, Ewan Mcgregor is very &quot;cute&quot; in this film. I only wished it had more of an ending. But despite that, i loved it still.
B000059TPN|3.0|Criterion do a very good job on The Rock.Other companies could take note of the packaging alone,the 2 DVDs are in a solid casing with two separate compartments.<BR>The set has a lot of interesting stuff.The 'Hollywood Gunplay' interview was particularly interesting,showing how fake some of the \\"film\\" versions of gunplay is.<BR>The special effects documentaries were good,as was the film of the premiere on Alcatraz,no less!The movie? Spectacular and entertaining,but brainless and nonsensical as are all the movies made by these people.Why would they hijack Alcatraz and take hostages when they could have launched the missiles from anywhere?One large non-nuclear bomb could have removed the problem.<BR>But the job done by Criterion make it well worth the money for fans of The Rock.
B00005N9CV|1.0|Yesterday evening my girlfriend came with a copy of the European edition of \\"The Look of Love\\", Diana Krall's new album.<br />First, we played it in our Meridian 588 but it sounded so bad -I mean over processed- that we thought that something was wrong with the disc or the player. So I removed the disc, turn off the player and when back on, I played a copy of \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\", one of her older albums, and everything was fine. So, I played \\"The Look of Love\\" again and there it was that [poor] sound quality again. Then I played the disc in my other CD and SACD/DVD players and got the same results. So we went to the record store and got the CD replaced by a new one just for getting the same sound quality. <br />In my opinion, the sound of this album is not only light years away of the typical Diana Krall's sound but worse than some of the... MP3 I have downloaded from the Internet. I don't know if it is due to a bad mixing, mastering, or if the record company has used any copy protection scheme that has damaged the sound at this extent, but it sounds like if the music was coming through a long metal tube and like it was converted from the analog tapes using a 49.95 sound card and some shareware software. <BR>All the warmth and resolution typical in all the older records of one of the best recorded female singers is gone...<br />This morning I went to AudioAsylum.com to express my unconformity with the quality of this recording and found a lot of complains about the very same album.<br />Hope the record company read our posts and know that tonight they will have one more copy of this particular record returned.
B000002MG1|5.0|I can already hear all you REM buffs screaming about how their major label releases don't compare to their early work, but sorry folks.  This album is REM at their best.  The only early piece that can even light a flame to this is &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; and even that doesn't come close.<br />I think the overall cohesiveness of the mood is what is so striking about this album.  It's a very subdued, mild mannered album, deep in emotion.  On the whole, the mood is melancholy and it conveys a depth not often seen in albums today.  It's melodies are beautifully orchestrated and crafted to weave between each other.  It is a daring effort and it is successful at every turn.  From deeply emotional &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; to the eerily nostalgic &quot;Nightswimming&quot; and from the subtle and soothing instrumental of &quot;New Orleans Instrumental No. 1&quot; to the poetic homage of &quot;Man On The Moon,&quot; this album doesn't fail.  It stays fresh from beginning to end.<br />It was the best album they'd released up to that point and it remains their best album to date.  If you like their music and you don't own this album, you are missing something very special.
0780619668|5.0|I wonder how a film can arouse so much negative reaction. Why are most people really angry about it not just ignoring it? From reading all the reviews I could find, I think the explanation is: It is too different from the mainstream formula. People think they get Stallone/Schwarzenegger/Willis mindless action when they get Kubrick-like intelligence.<BR>If the film DIDN'T have big names like Frankenheimer, Brando and Kilmer, people would not have a standard Hollywood cliche to expect. It confuses them.<BR>I came across a few quotes that sums up the anger against the film: &quot;it's weird and too many people die which leaves you depressed&quot; and &quot;it kills the sympathy the audience should feel for such tormented and abused beings&quot;.<BR>I have the opposite opinion. It's EXACTLY what makes this film unique. I don't need another Hollywood soap but most people are comfortable with the cliches they have seen in 99% other Hollywood films. They MUST have the superchic, the &quot;moral dilemma&quot;, the black judge and the happy end. They can't cope with a story that unfolds in a more &quot;documentary&quot;, bizarre way. For me the whole excitement comes from the sense of realism. The &quot;heroes&quot; dies when logic requires it. As a matter of fact! You watch things happen because it's inevitable from a biological sense NOT because it has to conform with a Hollywood formula. The main characters are not important, the &quot;has-it-all great story&quot; is not important, the essence is to show how strong a force biological mechanisms shaped through millions of years are. DISREGARDING the conformity rules of filmmaking. That's why Island of Dr. Moreau is a masterpiece in my mind. It's up there with Kubrick.
0060931671|5.0|So much of the \\"Pynchon phenomenon\\" centers around his reclusiveness and his epic novels like Gravy's Rainbow and V, so it seems unfair that shorter, more accessible works like The Crying Of Lot 49 sometimes get overlooked. Pynchon's genius is almost immediately apparent in this seamless blend of the comic and the poignant, the scientific and the human, the universal and the intimate.<br />There's very little I can say here that hasn't already been said by the literary intelligentsia. The critics seem to agree on a few general points: that the novel presents a compelling exploration of the equivocality of human perception, that the Trystero embodies the often-underestimated power of the word, the sign, and codes, and that Pynchon's discussion of entropy runs parallel to the disorder of information overload-a predecessor to the chaotic overabundance of input and information found in DeLillo'sWhite Noise.<br /><br />First, a note on the book's plot, or lack thereof: Pynchon leaves every option open, every thread untied. He leaves every possibility open in order to sustain the agonizing rigidity of an either/or dilemma. Writing in 1964, he is well ahead of his time as he describes the baffling possibilities of a digital world, and its binary all-or-nothing schema. Oedipa is left wandering under a sky blanketed by zeroes and ones, faced with a multitude of decisions, the results of which are irrevocable: She must decide blindly, not knowing whether she has made the &quot;right&quot; choice until after it has been made, and cannot be reversed. Pynchon wants his work to acknowledge this open-ended and infinite series of binaries which confound ordered plots and resolutions. Neither Pynchon nor Oedipa are content to relax and settle for easy answers, surrounded as they are by people who will.<br />Besides Pynchon's enthusiasm for science and Crying's discussion of entropy, the one most recurring theme in the book is that of fantasy versus reality. This is hardly a new theme for a contemporary writer to tackle, but Pynchon seems to put a twist on it, like he does with everything else: he proposes that there really isn't a boundary between the two, and that we shouldn't really care about finding one. Throughout the novel, Oedipa questions whether her experiences-the eerie recurrence of the post horn icon, the chance meetings with acquaintances, operatives, and intellectuals-are innately charged with predestined, synchronous coincidence, or if she is just being too fatalistic, and attaching more significance to these events than necessary. She never really seems to make up her mind on this point, and at the book's closing anti-resolution, we still haven't determined whether all these events have been orchestrated by fate, or simply coincidence; we haven't learned whether this really was a centuries-old underground conspiracy or just an elaborate practical joke Pierce wrote into his will. The reader gets the feeling, as Oedipa's quest continues, that maybe she is only seeing the post horn because she wants to see it; she sees it where it isn't there, so it can affirm the significance and urgency of her mission. We've all been in this position: we will shape events and signals in our environment to fit our agenda, attach meaning and consequence to random elements so we can feel like a part of something important.<br />The promise of hierophany is what drives Oedipa, and nearly any other human being, to attach spiritual, cosmic significance to secular events. By sublimating our secular world in this way, we attempt to order it and block out the horrific chaos threatening to impede on our paradigm. An atheist would say this is precisely what religion does: much as Oedipa strives to shape her experiences so they conform to her expectations, so do most major religions create world orders and belief systems in order to make sense of their experience, often in direct contradiction to non-believers' notions of validity and common sense. The Christian hallucinates the face of the Virgin Mary in everyday objects much as Oedipa probably hallucinates the post horn symbol throughout San Francisco.<br />The Crying of Lot 49 straddles the fine line between the sacred and profane, between the spiritual and the secular. In much the same way, it also conflates the &quot;hard&quot; science of thermodynamics with the personal and the emotional plight of a fictional protagonist. Few authors are smart or brave enough to do this; it probably doesn't even occur to most, and incorporating scientific minutiae into prose fiction is rarely valued as anything more than a means of showing off. But Pynchon manages to put a theoretical phenomenon like Maxwell's demon into pedestrian terms, and a scientifically impaired reader like me doesn't mind that he ends up hitting us over the head with the analogous relationship between Oedipa and the Demon.ian hallucinates the face of the Virgin Mary in everyday objects much as Oedipa probably hallucinates the post horn symbol throughout San Francisco. <br />The Crying of Lot 49 straddles the fine line between the sacred and profane, between the spiritual and the secular.

0380002930|5.0|I remember this as a favorite when I was young! I bought the book for my daughter, a bit apprehensive at first, thinking she may be intimidated by its size or the way it was written. She can't put it down!
B00000K0E5|5.0|Why is this no longer available? I'm glad I got it when I did, note to all wanting their favorite films on DVD. (don't wait!) This 18th Bond film is the best, Bronsnan is perfect & Sean Bean is perfect as his adversary, I can't think of a better actor for this villian, Famke Jensen is also great as a seductive but deadly villian, the film does make references to the cold war being over, but what is neat is the Soviet dictator who can't accept it, he conspires with Bean for world domination with Jansen as their personal assassin who seems to get off (literally) when she kills. But Bond's love interest is by far the most beautiful Bond girl i have ever seen, this woman is a knock-out, I can't spell her name without mispelling it, but she is perfect, her and Brosnan's chemistry really clicks, the two films that followed this were not as good, but this is the best of Brosnan's three Bond films.
B000002H70|5.0|This album could very well be the most depressing ever recorded. Pictures of You is probably the most depressing song ever. The rest of the album doesn't venture far. But that is what makes the Cure so great. You are right there with Robert Smith wallowing in self pity. It is so depressing you enjoy these brillant lyrics and enjoy Smith's piercing vocals. It's almost as if you are sharing his pain with him.
0072435186|1.0|Gnerally, I am extremely open-minded about other cultures, in fact learning about other people's countries is one of my favorite things today. No conversation is more interesting than one that opens your eyes to a different culture. So I read this book by Achebe hoping to dissolve any stereotype that I might have regarding tribal african societies. In the forward, it seemed like this was not too much to expect since that was exactly Achebe's purpose, but everything I had ever heard about the primitive nature of tribal society and the backward thinking was reinstated instead of eliminated. Perhaps I am more disappointed to find that these people truly are illogical and backward than I am in the book itself. But if you are reading this hoping to extinguish any prejudices about African tribes, this is not the book you are looking for.
0201633612|5.0|...<br />After years of writing code of all kinds,<br />Fun Video games as a kid,<br />Compilers for the heck of it,<br />Graphics programs for the love of art,<br />Interesting AI programs because I am a CS guy,<br />Boring Database Applications because I have to pay bills,<br />Nifty n-tiered web apps because the World went crazy..,<br />I found a programming book that could still teach me something.<br />After books from Knuth, Djikstra, The Aho Gang and the like, here is a book which goes straight to the point.<br />The book summarizes a basic set of Software Design Patterns, which have been found over and over in all the software we create.<br />Design Patterns is the perfect answer to all you OOP questions, Its an approach to sofware design as well as reuse.<br />If you are an artist, you would appreciate Design patterns better. The masters of the Renaissance began to see the world in terms of basic geometric forms..Spheres, Cubes, Cones and cylinders..this helped them in analysing an object..(any object, from the Human body to the Mountains and rivers.). Once they analysed any thing into its basic forms it was just a matter of detail. So, if you practice how to draw these basic shapes from different angles, and lighting,etc., and you learn how to analyse any thing into basic shapes, you have become a master.<br />The authors categorize all different software pieces into Creational, Structural and Behavioural patterns. Providing several possible patterns in each of these categories. A software designer, when confronted with a design problem, based on the needs, can pick a pattern from this catalogue and then fill in the details.<br />Well written, with UML diagrams too.<br />Caution: If you are new to programming, come back to this book a bit later.
0312954468|4.0|River God: A Novel of Ancient Egypt by Wilbur Smith is an exciting book of adventure, love and war.  Having never read any ancient Egyptian stories before I found River God to be a refreshing experience.   I cannot vouch for the historical accuracy used in the story but I find that to be of lesser importance than the over-all plot.  Remember this is FICTION.  As a matter of fact, its pretty good fiction.<br />Smith paints a picture of an ancient society that is fascinating.  The reader can visualize the Nile flowing in ancient Egypt and see the importance of their deities and customs.  Furthermore, justice is carried out swiftly in ancient Egypt and the punishment is usually not pretty. People are routinely executed for misdeeds.  As the reader is drawn into Smiths world you feel that you were part of the scenery.  This is where Smith excels.  This is my first book by Smith but it will not be my last.<br />The storys main character and narrator is the eunuch slave Taita. I will not give away the whole storybut in nut shell Taita helps his mistress the fair Lady Lostris maintain an illicit love affair with Tanus, a General in the Pharaohs army.  During the course of the story Taita is beaten, starved and nearly killed by a host of enemies.   Taitas old owner the evil and twisted Lord Intef (the Pharaohs Grand Vizier), desires to rule the empire.  It becomes Taitas job to foil his old boss and struggle to remain alive.<br />Only a few times did the story lose itself.  Taita is truly a Renaissance man (or person), in the book he invents a toilet, concocts a home pregnancy kit and creates penicillin-like drugs. He is a virtuoso singer, painter and writes books.  He is an accomplished spy-master and maintains his own informer network.  Additionally, he was awarded the Gold of Praise which is highest award given to any Egyptian citizen (even though he is a slave.)  I can go on and on but you can get the picture. He was so perfect that while I was reading the story I sometimes I pitied his enemies.  However, this is a minor complaint to an otherwise great story and fun read.
630469654X|5.0|I usually don't care for films set in mid-evil times, after all most are barbaric and gory, somthing I can &amp; usually do without. But this film is different in many ways, it shows a lighter side to mid-evil times, at first I did not care for this either, but every time I watch it I can't help but be drawn in every time, after a long,long debate I finally decided to buy this film on DVD, the widescreen format makes this movie even better than before, now I really love it, I have never been a fan of Matthew Broderick, but here I have to make an exception, this film is beautifully shot, the landscapes are amazing to watch, Director Richard Donner(Superman,Lethal Weapon) shows his creative magic with this film and makes it a wonderful fantasy filled adventure. But the highlight of this film has to be Rutger Hauer's performance here, an actor that usually plays bad guys, he is the best actor for this role, and proves his range playing a good guy for once, his Naverre is so cool you can't help but feel his pain for his love(Prfeiffer)who is a hawk by day &amp; him a wolf by night, the result of a curse by an envious Bishop played convincingly by John Wood, for those who like fantasy-love stories this film is a must have,to bad Rutger Hauer never got leading man status like say Mel Gibson, he sure has the talent to be a big star, but in my opinion has never gotten a fair chance, maybe he will make a comeback soon, he sure deserves it.

0425173739|4.0|On board a cruise on the Nile, a wealthy woman was shot in her sleep.  The obvious suspect, the woman jilted by the victim's husband, had a cast-iron alibi; the jilted woman just shot the victim's husband.<br />On board were other colourful secretive characters, not a few could have a reason to want the victim dead.  Also on board was Poirot who was determined to get to the truth, if for no other reason, that he was sleeping right through the murder!<br />Diverse clues were found throughout the book, a great deal given before the murder took place.  Agatha Christie unhurriedly built up the backgrounds of the characters in the book such that doubts can be cast on everyone but none could be suspect.  Her portrayal of an intelligent woman jilted, a beautiful heiress born with a silver spoon, idealistic cynic, hypochondriac dame etc were interesting, insightful and most descriptive.  Readers would find their personal responses to betrayal, persecution and temptation etc elicited from the various cast.<br />The only fly in the ointment was that Egypt as the setting was relegated too far in the background.  Ancient curses and scheming natives may be passe but one can't help but feel that the ancient Nile put up but a superficial appearance.
B000002IZ4|4.0|Since Purple's release, so much has been said about it that I would be lying if I said I were going to bring anything new to the table.  I do, however, have my perspective, and my experience with the album.<br />Since I got into music heavily some six years ago, this has been the album I have listened to most.  Though I would call Pearl Jam my favorite band, STP has undoubtedly received the most stereo play in my house.  Why?<br />The answer lies in the sheer excellence of this album.  It is no where near as heavy as most of Pearl Jam's work (conceptually, as in the lyrics, as opposed to instrumentation), but still manages to be relevant, heart wrenching and encouraging.  Try to hear &quot;If you should die before me ask if you can bring a firend&quot; and not feel some flicker of emotion run through you.  Ponder that line.  Would you want to be dead alone?<br />The album is not without its faults, though.  For one, I rarely have gotten past the eighth or ninth track.  I do not know whether this is because I at one time deemed the second half unworthy, or because STP stacked the best parts of its line up at the beginning.  I do know that the end of the CD might be as foreign to me today as the day I bought it.<br />Returning to the high points, I love the sound that STP puts across here.  They sound as if they are travelling in a direction that had not been explored much at that time.  They are climbing out of grunge and into somewhat of a nuclear fallout:  they combine grunge, classic seventies rock, and their own stylings to liven up their record.<br />Buy this album!
B00005K3O4|5.0|Please, please, please promise that the rumored sequel is really going to happen.  I have this on VHS and it's so badly worn I had to replace it with the DVD.  The movie is just as funny (and scary) as I remembered.  The deleted scenes were fun as were the other features.  I would really have liked more of the Dickies though - their ep with the title song also included eep opp ork ah ah and I'd love to have seen that included here.  even without it, these killer klowns deliver some killer laughs while using just about every clown trick in the book.
B00005MP58|2.0|The new widescreen DVD version is not a whole lot better than the original pan and scan DVD. The colour is still washed out (probably even more so than the original DVD). To make matters worse, this new edition has FAR too much contrast. The highlights are blown out, and the subtle shadow areas are all solid black. There's also FAR too much edge enhancement.<br />The only advantages to this new DVD edition are the use of anamorphic widescreen,  the addition of a brief &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and a few text biographies.<br />Be forewarned: you might want to hang on to the original DVD version. This new one is not an improvement, and in many ways, is even worse.
B00005LOUP|2.0|This movie could have been so much better.  It had everything going for it, when you think about it.  Jim Carrey, Ron Howard, a good score and a big budget.<br />I tried looking at this movie from both angles:  as an independent film and as a remake.  I don't know in which department it failed more.  The whole thing feels frantic and unsettling.  I felt like I had too much coffee watching it. <br />They could have made it so powerful, such a touching, funny classic.  Consider the ending.  Why not tell Carrey to let up for at least one scene?  Let Faith Hill's voice (or just the music) swell, then show the Grinch lifting the gifts with tears running down his face.  Or when his heart grew three sizes, don't turn it into another sight gag.  Use it!  Let the movie have some charm!  Let people walk out of the movie with the joy of Christmas in them.<br />Another thing wrong with this movie.  There is not enough contrast in all the characters.  The Grinch is not a bad person; he is just misunderstood.  The Whos are supposed to be protagonists, but they are greedy and self-focused.  And that whole love thing between the Grinch and Martha May was pointless and unneeded.  The Grinch doesn't change at the end.  He is still mean to the mayor.  He gets together with the antagonist girl. <BR>Who are you supposed to root for?<br />Carrey is funny, and he is his funniest when in moderation.  You would think such a successful actor/comedian would have learned by now.  Maybe Ron Howard gave him too much freedom in the movie.  Maybe he respected him too much.<br />It is such a shame.  Hollywood only got one shot at it, and they blew it.  I suggest we all try to forget it ever happened.
B00005NB0H|5.0|The Feb 14, 1970 Leeds show which provided The Who with their<BR>first official live album is widely regarded by collectors<BR>as not only one of the group's finest-ever shows, but one of the<BR>greatest live shows in rock history. The original album included<BR>only 35 minutes of the 120 minute show, and was still one of the greatest live albums ever; in 1995 that length was<BR>more than doubled for the CD remaster, but the &quot;Tommy&quot; portion remained in the vaults. Fans had to be content with the bootleg &quot;Leeds Complete&quot; in order to hear the whole thing, until now. Whether or not the piecemeal way the concert has been<BR>released over the years is a cynical MCA ploy or not, now that<BR>we finally have the whole thing, the show can finally be heard<BR>in all of its awesome power and glory.<br />One of the reasons &quot;Leeds&quot; is prized among Who collectors is<BR>that it is one of the best-recorded; the mix is superbly<BR>equalized among all three instruments and Daltrey's vocals, and Townshend's guitar sounds especially full-bodied and wet. The performance is one of the tightest and note-perfect of that<BR>period--without losing any of its heat or raw power--and the<BR>audience is amazingly quiet and respectful, which almost gives<BR>the show a &quot;live in the studio&quot; quality. A comparison with<BR>&quot;Live At The Isle Of Wight&quot;, the only other complete Moon-era<BR>performance of &quot;Tommy&quot;, is in order: although both shows are extraordinary, &quot;Leeds&quot; is superior for the above<BR>reasons (although &quot;Wight&quot; offers arguably better versions of &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; and &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It/See Me Feel Me&quot;). <br />For all of its dozens of incarnations, there is no doubt that<BR>the best version of &quot;Tommy&quot; was when the band originally performed it live in '69-'70; the volcanic fire which erupts<BR>from the group during &quot;Sparks&quot;, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; and &quot;See MeFeel Me&quot; approaches levels of nirvana not known on the comparatively tame studio record, campy '75 film or horrifyingly<BR>conservative Broadway version. And &quot;Tommy&quot; isn't even the highlight of the show--when the group pull all their muscle<BR>together for &quot;Shakin' All Over&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Magic Bus&quot;<BR>at the end, the energy released is beyond cathartic. Oh yes,<BR>this new 'deluxe' reissue also contains an expanded booklet<BR>with more photos, liners, etc. So, it took 31 years, but one of the greatest live shows ever is now available in its entirety.<BR>Now that we have &quot;Wight&quot; and &quot;Leeds&quot;, how about Woodstock?<BR>(NOTE: although the CD says that &quot;crackling noises have been corrected&quot;, one can still hear a little bit of crackle from the worn tapes during &quot;Tommy&quot;, esp towards the end--otherwise, the remix is superb).
B00005J6UP|4.0|I'd have given this five stars if only Corey would have shut up and let the others get a word in edgewise on the commentary track.  The movie was great and the commentary was pretty fun too.  The special features are definitely worth it, even if only for the hilariously bad Octopus scene (Ed Wood would have reshot it before including it!)<br />Even if you have it on VHS, the DVD is well-worth it.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal is one of the most gross movies I have ever seen, which makes it one of the best I have ever seen. Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, he makes the movie so convincing which makes it so much better than if there were any other actor. Moore is also a great actress, and its great to see her chase after Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lector. Ten years after his escape, he is taken off the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. He comes back and tries to meet Clarice. I don't wanna give too much else away. If I had to choose between this and Silence Of The Lambs, it would be a nearly impossible decision. If action is your thing, I'd go with Silence Of The Lambs, but if you like more disgusting exciting thrillers, try Hannibal. But just do yourself a favor and buy them both.
0385484518|4.0|A friend of mine loaned me this book during a time of loss and sorrow in my life. It really helped me to realize that life does go on and what really matters in life- people and relationships. It has helped me to once again seek out human contact- to help, learn from, and to touch somebody's life everyday. This book is a good reminder of what everyone already knows but has forgotten.
0316776963|3.0|Yes, most of these essays are quite funny but by the time I was halfway through, I found the author to be way too judgemental in his opinions.  Others have commented on his &quot;self-deprecating humor&quot; but I found him to be self-absorbed and couldn't find any particular justification for his superior attitudes.  I know that all the other reviewers of this book will disagree violently with me but I believe that there are far better satirical essayists out there.

B000000WHH|5.0|This is such a fantastic album. I don't think I'll ever not enjoy listening to this album. I think this is worthy of LANDMARK ALBUM status. It starts with &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; and keeps gettimg better. &quot;Black Money&quot; has got to be one of their best recordings. The vocal duet between Helen Terry and Boy George leaves you with chills. Never have I known a white singer that can sing like Aretha Franklin. &quot;Victims&quot; is my favorite and everytime I listen to that song it gets better.&quot;Church Of The Poison Mind&quot;, &quot;It's A  Miracle&quot; and &quot;Miss Me Blind&quot; were the bigger hits along with &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;. I also think that &quot;Mister Man&quot; is a fantastic song. It didn't get better than this unfortunately. They only had two more albums following this and they never came close to being as good as this one.
B000002JNG|4.0|This CD is GREAT! I can't beleive 1 reviewer said that Robert Plants \\"Shaken N Stirred\\" was BETTER! I love this CD because \\"Hurtin Kind\\" is a great song, with cool sound effects, \\"I Cried\\" has a Zeppelin Acoustic sound with Echo Effect, other songs you hear a combo of Roberts solo career, Zeppelin, Pink Floyd,Foreigner, Def Leppard , it was ahead of it's time for 1990 (BUT ZEPPELIN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AHEAD OF THEIR TIME ANYWAY) and sounds great for 2001, and is so thought out and ORIGINAL! Track 11 has a Moroccan/Arabic sound to it at the end, but just a bit.  ALL songs enhance Robs FANTASTIC VOICE!  WE LOVE YOU ROBERT! PLEASE COME BACK TO PHILADELPHIA & NEW YORK CITY AGAIN, YOU WERE WONDERFUL!

0451457994|5.0|Many books survive the translation into the medium of film, but the converse is rarely true. 2001 is one of those rare exceptions.<br />This is due in no small part to the very key role that Clarke played in the making of the film. The central and critical theme in the film came from \\"The Sentinel\\" a story that Clarke wrote long before Kubrick's involvement. Consequently, the film was built on a secure literary foundation and the concurrent novel could be sourced upon the muse of writers and not that of directors.<br />The other secret to the novel's success is Clarke. A lesser author would have floundered. But Clarke is one of the grand masters of the genre and, in addition to the prodigious intellect and creative powers that he could bring to bear, his reputation allowed him the freedom to depart from the film's script and impose his own vision on the novel. The result is a book with enough differences from the film that it can be separated from its twin sibling and judged on its own merits. This is especially important when we consider how large an effect the film has had on the genre's psyche.<br />So many superlatives have been heaped upon this work, that there is nothing to be gained in further praising it. More useful then, is defining who will not like it.<br />Those who wish their thinking done for them will not like this book. It asks too many difficult questions and has the temerity to leave them unanswered. It even implies that some questions can have no answers. Some people will find that this messes with their minds to a totally unacceptable degree. Likewise, it will not appeal to action junkies. The pace of the book reflects something of reality. For example, the journey to Saturn is described in much the way such a journey might feel - leisurely and methodically, with the crisis arising at the end and not a series of emergencies manufactured just to pump up the plot. The descriptions of astronaut routine are fascinating, but only to those who have cultivated a sense of patience. Those with the attention span of a flea will find this book boring.<br />Most of all, this book won't appeal to those who want comfort: whether the comfort of formula, the boundaries of the purely human, or the reassurance of what is already known. This novel has earned its reputation because it seeks to expand our minds, beyond the human and into the unknown. There is absolutely nothing formulaic about it.<br />The only beef I have with Clarke is that he didn't leave well enough alone. None of the sequels remotely approach the quality of the original and some of the subsequent explanations destroy much of the mystery that made 2001 so unique.
0425180638|2.0|A werewolf tries to kill her and she has to hide out with a friend who has a deep, dark secret and her niece is kicked out of the ATF and she's still in mourning for a murdered lover/colleague and she's investigating the death of a policewoman who was fiendishly plotting against her, but then she's accused of her murder. And there's a crooked prosecutor and the estranged son of her cop buddy who's lurking in New York with the Mob and the governor's wife is upset because some hate crimes might make the Jamestown colony look bad and then there's what happened to Mr. Peanut!<br /> This is the first book by this author I've read. It doesn't stand alone - there are so many characters thrown at you and bizarre plot twists that a first-time reader is overwhelmed. A novel this long should have a more definite resolution. You're given lots of details about characters, but not really introduced to them.
B000003N7R|5.0|A very coherent and moving recording.  I won't wax poetic here, but two things I will mention:  (1) It's always a joy to hear Duke play piano, and (2) their interpretation of Strayhorn's &quot;Little Brown Book&quot; is just a beautiful gift... among all the gifts on this one.
B000002JNG|4.0|This CD is GREAT! I can't beleive 1 reviewer said that Robert Plants &quot;Shaken N Stirred&quot; was BETTER! I love this CD because &quot;Hurtin Kind&quot; is a great song, with cool sound effects, &quot;I Cried&quot; has a Zeppelin Acoustic sound with Echo Effect, other songs you hear a combo of Roberts solo career, Zeppelin, Pink Floyd,Foreigner, Def Leppard , it was ahead of it's time for 1990 (BUT ZEPPELIN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AHEAD OF THEIR TIME ANYWAY) and sounds great for 2001, and is so thought out and ORIGINAL! Track 11 has a Moroccan/Arabic sound to it at the end, but just a bit.  ALL songs enhance Robs FANTASTIC VOICE!  WE LOVE YOU ROBERT! PLEASE COME BACK TO PHILADELPHIA &amp; NEW YORK CITY AGAIN, YOU WERE WONDERFUL! THANKS FOR SMILING AT ME ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS 2nd ROW ON THE FLOOR IN PHILLY 5/27/01 Hope you enjoyed the RED ROSE W/ BABIES BREATH I GAVE YOU! :)  Anyway, if you BUY this CD  you WON'T be Dissapointed AT ALL!  IT Rocks! &amp; a few mellow songs too!
0441172717|5.0|There is no praise that can be sung about this book that has not already been sung. When it was first published in 1965, it burst upon the science fiction scene like a supernova. Nothing had ever been written that was even remotely similar. Reviewers coined new phrases to describe the novel: space feudalism, feudal-futurism, even sand fiction. Yet, anyone who has read the novel can attest to the poverty of such labels. This is a book that defies pigeonholing.<br />Where shall I start? Firstly, unlike so much in science fiction, even by grand masters like Asimov and Clarke, this book develops characters of exceptional depth. They each have such vibrant inner lives that it is impossible not to identify with them. The writing is absolutely first class. Spare, tight, exquisitely metaphorical, not a word wasted, its a pleasure to read. The imagery is so effective you can feel the grit of sand in your teeth. Then there is the sheer genius of Herberts imagination. He borrows from history the religious and feudal societies, but transform them into something unique and original.<br />This is one of the most complete science fiction classics ever written. Whether it is writing skill, plot, themes, setting, characterizations, breadth of imagination or sheer weight of ingenuity, it beggars parallel. I cant think of a single fault, except perhaps that it had to come to an end.<br />The only unfortunate aspect of this work was that it scaled pinnacles of such extraordinary height that Herbert would never attain them again. Each of his sequels fell further and further from the mark set by this novel, and some of his later works were simply embarrassing.<br />Beg, borrow or steal this book. Just dont pass up the chance to read it.
0679777547|4.0|I bought the Club Dumas with some resevation--I had read the Fencing Master by the same author and thought that the book is very shallow.  However, Club Dumas exceeded my expectations by miles.  The plot of this bibliophile mystery is complecated, yet fully developed.  The main character Corso calls himself a mercenary--a private eye who tracks and purchases valuable books for book collectors.  What he turns out to be, however, is a more noble character resembling Dumas' D'Artagnian.  My only problem with the book is that the two plot lines do not have anything else in common but Corso.  THe reader is lead to believe taht the two mysteries are connected, and they are but only to the extenbt taht we learn more about the main character.
6303160344|4.0|Juliette Binoche plays the part of a woman faced with the awful tragedy of loosing both her husband and daughter in a violent car accident. She becomes self-destructive and tries to kill herself. When that fails, she is faced with the reality of having to live.<br /><br />With the love of one man in her life, she still denies herself happiness for the moment. She seeks oblivion in music. The luminious blue nature of the scenes and way in which the movie was filmed make this very artistic.<br /><br />A slow moving film that will make you feel tense. Yet it is hauntingly beautiful and filmed only the way a French film can be. I love the accents and am very attraced to French foreign films for that very reason.<br /><br />I am not sure if Juliette Binoche looks like Julia Roberts or if Julia Roberts looks like Juliette Binoche. I like their acting almost equally well, yet Juliette Binoche captures your heart and comes across as a much deeper actor with so much more to give onscreen. Her character was not cheapened by circumstance and she seems to have an inner strength which does not let her give up on life.<br /><br />Recommended for the patient and those who enjoy the artistic nature of French films.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

0345423496|1.0|I wish Clarke had stopped with the first book. 2001 was Science Fiction at its finest; a perfect blend of science and fiction, showing a mastery of imagination that affirmed Clarke as one of the maestros of the genre. Some of the best parts of that book were the questions it left unanswered. What did the star-child actually do? Why did HAL mutiny? What is the nature of the progenitor civilization?<br />All good fiction shares this one virtue: it allows the reader a private mental space. Our imaginations are given room to breath and we are afforded the opportunity to reach our own conclusions because enough of a resolution is provided to complete the story, but no more. Too much exposition fences in a universe that must remain, if it is to compel us, both expansive and elusive.<br />2001 also dealt successfully with big themes: humanity's place in the universe, the nature of sentient thought, the definition of life, moral judgment in a machine.<br />These are all elements that are missing from 3001. An astronaut is resurrected who should have remained dead. A society is exposited that is fundamentally no different from ours. This is a poor resolution, especially after an event as momentous as the emergence of the star-child. It's all terribly anti-climactic. It's as though we were given a thorough and detailed exposition of Odysseus' retirement after his great struggles. Enjoyable for Odysseus perhaps, and certainly well deserved, but hardly the compelling stuff of epic, and of no interest to posterity.<br />Blandness is the great pitfall of science fiction. Plot, character, setting, themes, even the quality of the writing can be second rate, but the imagination must scintillate. In 3001, the imagination plods and Clarke tries to make up for its absence with a series of vignettes that make no new contributions to the human story. We end up with a work that is too clever by half and too comfortable by far. All in all, one of Clarke's weakest contributions within a lifetime omnibus of the highest achievement.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I've had an advance copy of this album for several weeks now and have spent quite a bit of time with it and I must disagree with the Amazon review of this one. While Heartbreaker WAS overindulgent, Gold is amazing work. I think Ryan Adams has released his masterpiece. This one would get votes from me for album of the year. Pneumonia and Gold in the same year? Adams is on a roll.
B000050XEI|5.0|If you've been a long time Enya fan, you shouldn't be disappointed by this one.  But if you're not really an Enya fan, and hated 'Sail Away', you still should give this one a shot.  And if you're looking at this album because you liked the song from Sweet November, you definitely need to get this album.  It's the most relaxing CD I have ever owned.  I use to it study by.  I play it while I'm taking a bubble bath.  Heck, I put headphones on and listen to it while I'm falling asleep.  I have only owned this CD about two weeks, but I have probably listened to it on average 2-3 times a day!  FANTASTIC!  One of the all around best CD's I have bought in a looooong time.

B00004SVID|2.0|Pinkus Floydus. Fossilized dry in 'The Wall Live', the only bigger disappointments from the band bank in P.U.L.S.E. . Theres nothing in the album that betters or even matches the studio ensemble of feral resonance and word and it sounds oddly offkey even if you've listened and gotten used to the live version first. Audience, roars and screechs disturb natural accord and discord in the work, breaking turbulent music into domesticated songs.   'Vera'... well. lady wouldve gone to war. 'Comfortably Numb' gratefully doesnt lose much of its ethereal distance... but it alone cannot save a double-album. The others lie inbetween these two... lukewarm cause of fathomable reasons. <br />The visual theatrics during concert were Waters' brainchilds, where a self(or otherwise)made &quot;wall&quot; around around a man was &quot;necessary to deny painful aspects of experience&quot;...  and his &quot;disillusion with rock shows in open-air football stadiums&quot; hence the building of a real brick wall onstage beween the band and the audience. His concept of alienation is respected, but rock-theatre is uninspiring if you have it on tape, not memory. <BR>First timers, invest in the original Wall, to ripeing middle-agers nostalgia suggested: remember him in 'The Madcap Laughs', otherwise LIVE does good for collectors value.
6305922756|5.0|Assuming you wouldn't be looking for it if you've never seen it.  You already know it's good.  The DVD extras make this an especially choice addition to your collection of the finest in documentary films.  Bonus interviews and scenes add to the experience.<br />Go ahead, you know you want to.
B0000508U6|3.0|A nice album,  but nothing new on it. I stay with radiohead or for a more prog audience &quot;porcupine tree&quot;. I know that a lot of radio listeners doesn`t know that this album has a lot of progressive rock music in it.
0895292211|5.0|Dr. Howell's 'Enzyme Nutrition' is an excellent look at why it is desirable to include as many fresh, natural, and raw foods into ones diet as possible. He backs up his findings on the nutritive, health-giving, and cancer-fighting elements of living foods with years of research, statistics, and even labarotary animal cases. While the use of labaratory animals for research is ethically problematic- the statistics Dr. Howell has gained from them are a great boon to this book, his position, and the health enthusiast community. <br />For all the cynics who think a raw food diet is a silly fad, they might have difficulty arguing the facts present in this book. For those who follow a diet such as the Hippocrates Diet, or who realize the value of adding fresh and uncooked or minimally-cooked foods to their meals, this book will be a valuable source of information as to precisely why, in a scientific sense, your endeavor to eat living foods is not only justifiable, but very wise. <br />There's more to life than the foods you eat, but there's not much more to death than the foods you eat. Most people dig their own graves with their knives and forks. By understanding both the harmful and healthful qualities of various foods and how they are prepared, one can greatly increase once chances of survival through the 21st century. Of course, first one has to avoid getting hit by a car or flying airplanes.
0440219078|5.0|I had to read this book for a class that i am taking and now i wished i had reda it earlier.  I am not so big on reading but this has got to be one of the best things i have ever read.  The fact that they book is not only about sharing memories and the importance of that but it lso deals with conformity and all the problems that can occur through onformity.  The book describes very well and very creatively what would happen if we descnsitized every body in the world and basically turneds them into drones.  The fact that people in this story had their fates chosen by others kind of scared me and made me think, what would we do if this happened to us?  I really found this book to be interesting and at times some what confusing but it all became clear again within the next few lines.  So in conclusion i will stop babbling and say that this is a great book and i haighly recomend it to anyone who is into strange or unusual things.<br />...
B00003CXA3|5.0|I previously reviewed the movie. Now I'll review this DVD. <br />I have seen all of them: Terminator 2, Seven, Independence Day. This DVD tops any out there!  There has been a lot of work and care on this package.  The result is a delight!<br />First the commentary is terrific. I am listening to it right now as I watch it. Friedkin is a great commentator. Unlike other directors who talk about trivial items while the movie is running, Friedkin describes every scene and how it was created. He reveals many surprises as he talks about the movie, such as the classic chase scene. Many of the crashes were actually mistakes and many of the cars in the chase were not involved with the filming. They just happened to be there. The other interesting aspect of the commentary is the revelation of what action scenes were made for the movie and what ones were fact. Many of the scenes which appear farfetched actually did happen.<br />The documentaries are terrific, also. I especially like the sequences where some of the surviving actors go back and walk around the locations where the scenes were filmed. There's a terrific sequence where Sonny Grosso (the narrator) goes back to the actual subway where the car chase took place and describes it, pointing at locations, and even acting out the final gundown at the stairway. Other locations are looked at also (such as the hotel the villians stay in).<BR>Much is revealed about the making of the movie, such as Hackman wanting to quit after the first day.<br />Even the deleted scenes are entertaining. Unlike most special DVD scenes, these ones reveal a lot about the characters. Friedkin explains each scene and also why he deleted them.<br />This is just how a DVD should be made! Movie directors should use Friedkin as a model on how to give great commentary. DVD producers should look at this one as the definitive DVD.
006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud has done a wonderful job of presenting the rather nebulous world of sequential art (commonly called comics) to the layman and comic fan alike. Formatting the book as a comic book was inspired. It definitely helped to make the concepts he presented in the book clearer.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in that learning comics are more than just &quot;funny pictures.&quot;
B00005214X|3.0|I love George Harrison and his music, yet I only bought this on re-issue. The packaging is very well put together, and shows a bit of George's sense of humour as well as the artistry of Tom Wilkes and Barry Feinstein. My Sweet Lord is always beautiful to hear, and the new version is on a par with the original. Harrison's lead guitar if anything surpasses the original, but his vocal is thin and reedy (possibly because of his illness), so it evens out. The other tracks are not of the same high standard of this number one single. George has been the most consistent of the Beatles in terms of the quality of his albums, and on most of them, any track could have been a hit single, but here it is not the case and Extra Texture or Cloud 9 are much better examples of what the great man was capable of.<br />(Update 30/11/'01) George Harrison Requiescat In Pace 1943-2001. My Sweet Lord will be his memorial. Although he will be remembered for some of the best lead guitar lines in music history, courtesy of his work with the Beatles, My Sweet Lord really says all we need to know about George. A kind, talented spiritual man who will be missed by everyone.
B00005NWRS|5.0|A couple of years ago when Uncle Tupelo was breaking up and subsequently forming Son Volt and Wilco, a lovely little country-alt group named Whiskeytown was strumming their way across the country and campuses. After their sophomoric release &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot; came out, it seemed they were on their way to greatness.<BR>Then the merging of Poly Gram and Universal happened, and the group's eagerly anticipated follow up &quot;Pneumonia&quot; was shelved for two whole years. And before it came out the band split and moved on and Ryan's first solo album came on the Indie label Bloodshot Records...&quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was well received. Lost Highway finally got back online. Having finally released &quot;Pneumonia&quot; the members reassured everyone that they were no more and decided not to reunite one last time. So Ryan went on to record &quot;Gold&quot;.<BR>Upon looking at the cover (a picture of Ryan in front of an upside down American flag looking down somewhat humble) one gets an impression that this album is gonna be one of those albums that sticks in our collective conscious. <BR>The first track furthers this feeling, and as the album jumps from ballad to strummed rock songs, one gets a strong Neil Young vibe from the 26 year old singer/songwriter. That vibe of being a Jack of all musical trades and constructing songs from so many influences is really what makes this album shine. Tear soaked songs like &quot;La Cienga Just Smiled&quot; and &quot;SYLVIA PLATH&quot; to the piano laden &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot; and rockabilly &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; give a very strong impression that we are witnessing something great in the making. By no means is Ryan perfect on this album, but there really isn't a bad track either, and the inclusion on the first pressing of a five song EP just makes this album an incredible experience. Strings, gospel backing vocals, guest appearances, organs, pianos, guitar solos...you name it, and Ryan touches base on this album. Never has there been such a surprising an album since perhaps Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; when you just know the industry is gonna be buzzing.<BR>And with a &quot;Crazy Horse-esque&quot; side project called Pink Hearts that is due to come out early next year, that has been dubbed &quot;really punk&quot; you can see that instead of struggling with having so many influences like Buckley did, he's just going to wear more than one hat, and that is rare in this current industry.<BR>The Best way to sum the album up is the placement of the first song, &quot;New York, New York&quot;- his current home, to the album's final track &quot;Goodbye Hollywood Blvd.&quot;, the place he lived before moving to New York...it's a piece of Ryan's being...it truly is &quot;Gold&quot;.

B00005N9CV|2.0|I really adore Diana Krall but this long awaited new album is unfortunately a huge disapointment.<BR>For a start the sound is very mushy and the whole album is just over arranged and produced. I really can't classify this as Jazz, just pretty background music. <BR>Diana is at her best with her trio and not backed by large orchestras as here she just sounds lost among all the too-lush sounds.<BR>Where are the fantastic piano solos from &quot;All for you&quot; gone.<BR>I hope the next album will be a dedicated 'Christmas' album and the producer leaves Diana alone to do what she does best; play and sing.
B00005NRQE|4.0|This special edition is pretty good. With a mini-documentary and some photographs taken on location, this is the sort of value you normaly only get with DVD. You can also pick these up pretty cheaply too, sometimes boxed with Tommy. Phil Daniels does his usual thing, and he does it very well. It's rather annoying when his motor-scooter is run over by a van and he just gets cross, rather than getting the other driver's insurance details. Nevertheless the music is great and the film shows a lot of actors 'before they were famous', notably Leslie Ash.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana is one of the top jazz piano players in the business today, but you wouldn't know it from this offering. Her singing is better than ever and these are excellent arrangements, but we don't get to hear much of her wonderful jazz piano artistry. From my perspective her piano work is more attractive than her singing, so I'm going with three stars. Maybe she'll do a real jazz album next time.
B000002IHU|3.0|THis is good fun pop metal, but can also be judged as a disgrace to the genre. The musicians in RATT were all good, but their attitude was wrong.
B00005JKES|5.0|I have only recently seen the majority of Twin Peaks (three final episodes + fire walk with me to come! - Don't you wish you were me?) on a friend's English video version (much better than the current American video boxset, I am led to understand) but still substandard for a series shot on film.  <br />I don't even own a DVD player but I would buy one just to watch the whole series in a high-resolution, sharp and permanent format.  However, apparently there are a few problems with the upcoming version, which I will probably end up investing in.<br />1) No pilot episode.  This in itself is not necessarily a problem, according to my friend who owns an early European version of the pilot on video - he recommends watching series, fire walk with me, then pilot episode - so it would make sense to release the last two on individual dvds, once the copyright problems are sorted out, I guess.  Especially since the &quot;new&quot; version of pilot episode available in U.S. has additional footage from later in the series added.<br />2) Only episodes 1 - 7.  Does that mean that there will or will not be a completist boxset in future.  Will the second series be divided into two sets of, what, 11 and 12 each?  Or will the other episodes all be released together? Somehow I think water and testing come to mind.  <br />This is a natural series for the DVD format.  Like the Prisoner it is a series that works by word of mouth &amp; is easy to become addicted to.  The more copies that are out there, the bigger the market will get.  It is also a series which benefits from multiple viewing. <br />Please. The whole series on DVD, in seperate installments if you must, but do let us know in advance.
B00000253N|4.0|Very good album. Some people think it is the better thing ever recorded over the face of the Earth. I respectfully disagree..
6305313687|5.0|This movie is a great film and the acting is top notch. It is very depressing but if you want to see Edward Norton at his best. A MUST SEE.
B0000027F3|2.0|In some aspects, even TURBO is better than PAINKILLER. THis album is about JUDAS PRIEST trying to copy the kind of metal played in the beginning of the nineties. The music is noisy, annoying, Halford just screams and screams.. It has nothing to do with the glory days with Dave Holland on drums. Scott Travis is a great drummer, but he sounds too &quot;californian&quot; and does not fit into Judas. People say this album is heavy and so on and so on, but the chords are ridiculously simple. It's a flat and commercial production, disguised in &quot;aggression&quot;.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of the best and orginal movies ever. The only movie that goes backwards. It is an awsome thriller if you want a movie that you will not guess the ending rather beginng.It is a must see for all thiller fans.
B000009HF2|4.0|Very good, but still a compilation. Anyway, the vibe here is amazing.
630512762X|5.0|John Woo is an awesome director and the movie is also really cool. Both Cage and Travolta are awesome actors in this film in fact you will most likely get confused on whos who becuase they act so well like each other.
B00005K9LM|2.0|Theres no shame in PRIEST releasing this album. If their only option was to sell out, use puffy hair and thing like that, they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album. I must remember you that this was not a &quot;phenomenom&quot; that occured only with the mighty Priest, during the middle eighties: it also happened with SAXON, SCORPIONS, MICHAEL SCHENKER, RAVEN, ACCEPT, and other greta European bands, who tried hard to &quot;make America&quot;. In Judas case, they had already &quot;made America&quot; with their previous albuns, but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money. So, in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the &quot;great&quot; TURBO..
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this CD: this soundtrack is not the real soundtrack you can expect from this incredible musical movie. There a some great songs that was not included (who can forgot the great version of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; with the Duke and Harold Zidler???). Anyway, the CD is ok since includes &quot;Come what may&quot; and &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;, but if you're a real fan of the movie, wait to the DVD version and hear the music from it, or wait for a new real &quot;soundtrack&quot; realease!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm tempted to say this is Dylan's best work in a 40-year career, which is saying a lot. It's certainly the most musical, from '20s, 30s and 40s jazz to 50s rockabilly to numbers that would have worked on &quot;Highway 61 Revisited'' in the 60s. Dylan said in a recent interview that his objection to modern music is that it has no roots. This does.<BR>A note: I am almost exactly the same age as Dylan. I found &quot;Time Out of Mind'' depressing and overrated _ the whine of a 56-year-old man afraid of getting old. I'm glad to see that at 60, he's able to put together an upbeat and original album that covers about five generations.<BR>OK. Maybe &quot;Blood on the Tracks'' or &quot;Blonde on Blonde'' are as good as this. But not better.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is unlike any other film you'll ever see, a piece of film noir so original and so tense, it will stick with you for days. Told in reverse, the film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) as he tries to find the man who raped and murdered his wife. There's just one snag: Leonard suffered a brain injury while trying to protect his wife that fateful evening. He can no longer make new memories, only able to recall his life before the event, everything else fading away within minutes. He wakes every morning still expecting to see his wife, never remembering who to trust and who to fear. Relying on Polaroids and tattoos to keep track of clues he drifts on, forever looking for a man who may be a lot closer then he thinks. From this premise, writer/director Nolan weaves a perfectly crafted tale which unravels itself slowly and methodically through flashbacks. We, like Leonard, are completely lost. By starting at the 'end' of the film, we gather more and more information as the story is presented, a chunk at a time, until the shocking finish, which makes the preceding 110 minutes all the more devastating. 'Memento' is a perfectly executed film, full of wonderful montages and unpredictable twists and turns. The cast shines. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are by turns sympathetic and heart-breaking and Pearce has never been better. There are few films out there that truly attempt at reinventing a genre and even less that succeed. This is one of those films and it is not to be missed. If I see a better movie then 'Memento' this year, I will be greatly surprised. A masterpiece.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm tempted to say this is Dylan's best work in a 40-year career, which is saying a lot. It's certainly the most musical, from '20s, 30s and 40s jazz to 50s rockabilly to numbers that would have worked on &quot;Highway 61 Revisited'' in the 60s. Dylan said in a recent interview that his objection to modern music is that it has no roots. This does.<BR>A note: I am almost exactly the same age as Dylan. I found &quot;Time Out of Mind'' depressing and overrated _ the whine of a 56-year-old man afraid of getting old. I'm glad to see that at 60, he's able to put together an upbeat and original album that covers about five generations.<BR>OK. Maybe &quot;Blood on the Tracks'' or &quot;Blonde on Blonde'' are as good as this. But not better.

B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie is about what it was like to be a fan of 70s album music, albeit from the privileged viewpoint of a teenage journalist who had access to rock groups that most of us could only dream about.  Though I didn't see the movie in a cinema, I'm one of the fans who has gone a bundle with its release on video, buying both the DVD and the soundtrack CD.  Though there are already 268+ reviews of the DVD on this site, I feel I just have to say how much I too love it.<br />What I love about the movie, besides its gentle humour, its superb choice of music and uplifting theme, is that the characters are so fully rendered that there is so much going on in each scene.  Take the moment where guitarist Russell first speaks to William's Mum on the phone -- though the key to the scene is that she manages to freak even him out, writer/director Crowe still finds space in the same moment for Penny Lane to fend off another groupie making herself too available to Russell.<br />I also like the fact that the plot contains no bad guy or violence.  Though in the UK the DVD carries a '15' rating -- for the use of expletives -- I'm happy to let my ten-year-old daughter watch it with me.  (I'm using it mainly as a covert means of getting her to appreciate the 70s music that I enjoy so much!)<br />Despite the fact that there's no bad guy and the superficial resemblance of the film to a road movie, we shouldn't allow our senses to be beguiled into ignoring the clever plot structuring, which is still based on the Hero's Quest map used for 'Star Wars', 'Lion King' etc.  Lester Bangs makes an excellent mentor in this movie -- far more wisdom spews from his lips than say, William's Mum's.  Setting the climax in an aircraft poised on the brink of crashing in an electrical storm was a brilliant stroke.<br />The choice of songs for the movie was excellent. Camercon Crowe chose the high-quality album tracks of the period, rather than the dance-oriented oldies that most nostalgia movies go for. 1972-76 is the period in rock that I ought to know best, but there are several songs here, such as 'Tiny Dancer', 'Mr Farmer' and 'Every Picture Tells a Story', which I hadn't heard before. Even the Cat Stevens' track ('The Wind') was a revelation which has considerably increased the respect I have for the artist.  My appreciation of Led Zep's acoustic numbers and even Simon &amp; Garfunkel has also improved as a result of Crowe's highly intelligent juxtaposition of sound and vision. But I still loathe Rod Stewart!<br />But the soundtrack sound quality is so good that I'm half-convinced that Crowe re-re-mastered many of the tracks specially for the movie.<br />Much of today's expletive-loaded music seems to do nothing but encourage violence and bring out the worse in people.  (There I go sounding like William's Mum!) The late 60s and early 70s was a time when music tried to elevate our senses.  Many thanks, Cameron, for making this excellent tribute to the period.  One of my teenage friends at the time regularly went on about what a superb journalist Lester Bangs was.  Now I know what he meant.72-76 is the period in rock that I ought to know best, but there are several songs here, such as 'Tiny Dancer', 'Mr Farmer' and 'Every Picture Tells a Story', which I hadn't heard before.

B000002KIE|5.0|Honestly, I don't even know why i'm writing this review, as there isn't really much a 16 year old boy who was born 7 years post-pistols can say about an album like this that hasnt already been said. Honestly, it's amazing. When i got it i expected it to be the kind of album that you buy for it's historical value, just to say you own it, and then never listen to after the first time. Not so! Nevermind the bollocks is the kind of album that you buy expecting it not to live up to the hype thats built up over the years, only to be surprised at how exciting the music still sounds to this day. I cant in all honesty say that i know everything there is to know about punk music, nor can i pretend to understand the impact that this album had upon its release, but i do know what i like, and i know when i've heard something important, something that everyone should listen to, just out of principle, regardless of genre preference. And this album is just that. I guess that's all.. Later.
B00005QATY|4.0|O Brother Where Art Thou? starts off with a song that will have you crying tears of laughter. And it doesn't let up from there. Every time we watch it it only gets better, reminiscent of &quot;Let It Ride&quot; with Richard Dreyfuss. This could be George Clooney's best role ever. If you like &quot;sleepers&quot; that have you rolling on the floor, then this is it! (By the way, 4 1/2 stars to O Brother to Let It Ride's 5 stars)
B00005OAE6|5.0|Stranger In Town is one of Bob Seger's all time best studio albums. But anyone will tell you that, and the proof is in the music: superb songs like &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot;, &quot;Feel Like A Number&quot;, and &quot;The Famous Final Scene&quot;, as well as the perenially popular &quot;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.<br />So how is the remastering? Wasn't the remastering of Live Bullet a disappointment? Yes, but there is a different team in place here. Robert Vosgien has done a superb job on this remastering, and the packaging includes the insert photos that were missing from the original release.<br />What you get in this release that was missing in the original CD are nuances and inflections - lots of them. Listen to all the things Bob does with the lyrics to &quot;Brave Strangers&quot;. Hear the remarkable hi-hat work of Dave Teegarden in &quot;Hollywood Nights.&quot; Delight in the resonance of the acoustic guitar strings on &quot;Still The Same.&quot;<br />Yes, there is some tape hiss, but that is a good thing. This is the type of album where removing all the hiss would remove much of the music along with it. Thank goodness that mistake has been avoided here.<br />What we have is a classic rock album, in all senses of those words, restored to all its magnificent glory. Don't miss it!
B000003NA4|5.0|I recently discovered Diana Krall while researching what had become of Jeri Sothern, an old favorite of mine.  Diana and Jeri are very similar in style and voice, so Diana now has a new fan.  It is such a joy to hear lyrics again, and sung by such a voice!

I'ts never to late to make one especial when we have the ability to produce great special effects in films why not mucicals. I would defently love to see that just like many other fans.  I highly recomend grease a film to include in your home video collection. p.s When will the dvd come out it seems like most other popular film have already been relesed why not grease?
B000021YQV|5.0|How Steve-o can compare this album to anything Metallica and Anthrax did is beyond me. The Sepultura comparison is hilarious as well. <br />Anyways, this is a great album if you're looking for something different and are tired of the whole hip hop frat rock scene. From the message in Deer Dance and the ferocity of Jet Pilot, to the elegance of Chop Suey, Serj and company put together something original and fresh. <br />Small minds need not apply.

006441034X|3.0|I like to know what my 10 year old son is reading these days. His choices are the Harry Potter books, Captain Underpants, etc. This book looks on the surface to be a good choice for him, but once I got into the story it is more like a twisted romance novel for pre-teens. The sentences are short and choppy with oddly placed words. Story-wise, it is not bad, but CS Lewis or JK Rowling it is not.
B00000IONU|5.0|I read about the White Stripes in the NYtimes and bought White Blood Cells w/o any further provocation.  Not long afterwards I had to get my hands on another Stripes album, this being it.  This album does pack a lot within its 43 minutes and there seems to be a song here for whatever mood you may be in.  The three cover-tunes are worth the price of the album alone with &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; by Bob Dylan, &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot; an old Louie Armstrong standard by J. Primrose, and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot; by Robert Johnson.  You can hear musical elements of each of these artists within these songs, especially some of Louie Armstrong's trumpet work in the voice of Jack White.  My favorite track, and the one that every other reviewer fails to mention is Robert Johnson's &quot;Stop Breaking Down.&quot;  The slide work is ferocious if not outright feral and JW's vocals are both intense and playful.  Meg's drums throughout the album makes you want hammer away on the steering wheel of your car (mental note to be careful while driving and playing the White Stripes).  Get your lame self out of your chair and get this record.
B00001MXXG|5.0|Who couldn't love Ferris? He is popular, creative and gets away with everything. Ferris takes a day off from school and travels to nearby Chicago to spend a day with his friends and see the sights. He is faced with obstacles but remarkably can always overcome them. No one really knows a Ferris but we wish we could be like him. Ferris is played by the extremely talented and handsome Matthew Broderick (other work has included Glory, War Games, Election, You can Count on Me, and is currently starring in The Producers on Broadway) The movie also offers good performances from Alan Ruck (currently on Spin City) and Mia Sara. Jeffrey Jones is the pathetic principal who wants to catch Ferris breaking his rules by proving Ferris wasn't sick and instead skipping school. His bad luck and misfortune is completely opposite to Ferris's luck and confidence. The story is great and the cast is perfect. Overall this movie is entertaining and funny, mostly it deals with lighthearted themes but it does entertain some bigger ideas like living life in the present (&quot;Life goes pretty Fast, if you don't look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;) and the relationships of teenagedom (Cameron and his parents, the love between Sloane and Ferris, Ferris and his sister) The only criticism I have is the DVD doesn't include any interesting extras except for a commentary by John Hughes, the director. The VHS is just as good unless you are interested in John Hughes's inside information on the shooting of the film. But I still give it 5 stars because it is a funny and timeless movie that makes us remember high school and what its like to be a kid.

B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson is a musical genius. His first CD out of HIStory is amazing. But then again, so is his second. But people don't agree with that. Maybe because the songs weren't so commercialized or maybe because they were made after Michael got a bad rep. All I know is that Michael is a major influence on so many singers (and me) and his second CD is just as good as the first. If his second CD was more well-known and had a lot of good reviews, I'm sure many more people would follow that example and agree that it is ingenius and pure &quot;Michael Pop&quot;. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B00004Z4UW|3.0|The Matrix - The Warchowski Brothers<br />Stupendous special effects and placing Keanu Reeves in the right place at the right time  save this film from its insubstantial biblical plot.<br />The plot centres around creeping late twentieth century paranoia about technology, apocalypse and the idea that the human race will eventually destroy itself through too much evolution.   You could even say that this is the film to watch for late twentieth century ideas about the future.<br />The world has been taken over by Artificial Intelligence.  A situation brought on by the arrogance and irresponsibility of the human race and it is up to Neo (Reeves' character) to save it with the help of the inmates of the Nebuchadnezzer.  I say inmates because Nebuchadnezzer was sent insane by God for his arrogance (see where I'm going with the biblical plot).<br />So, in this gigantic floating lunatic asylum, or ship of fools if you like, live Neos' love interest Trinity, his guide/mentor Morpheus and an arch enemy called Cifer. They set about saving the human race from marauding PC's with true Hollywood win/win heroism.<br />The action is skillfully maneuvered and shot with groundbreaking use of film technology.  The fight scenes are not to be missed with choreography from Yuen Wo Ping. keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss perform fantastically in exhilarating interpretations of martial arts and the sentient matrix is horrific on an extraterrestrial scale.   <br />As an action film The Matrix is scintillating to say the least, it's definitely one of the most surprising and visual masterpieces made to date.  The Warchowski Brothers have shown the world what they're made of.

I even like this better than Load, which had too much filler on it. I would say that some of these songs, like Fuel, memory remains, and the Unforgiven II are all really good songs. Just because Metallica \\"sold out\\" doesnt mean that the music is bad!

067101756X|5.0|Having read a number of UFO books, I was drawn to this book because the Roswell crash was never really explained in any great detail. This book does just that and plenty more. This book re-writes history in relation to the cold war, the development of the US as a superpower and its ultimate victory in the cold war. If you only read one book about UFO's or as Corso calls them EBE's this is the one. It gets you right inside the secrets held by the US military and the way the roswell crash helped to develop new technologies from laser beams to bullet proof jackets. Get it read it and read it again.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Had I written this review a week ago, I might have just given it 4 stars but it gets better with each listen. Now I'd give it 4 1/2 stars (since I cannot give it that score, I rounded it up to 5). The album this one most reminds me of is the Basement Tapes. There's the same sense of fun, the same exploration of various musical styles. Those looking for another Time Out Of Mind are going to be disappointed. This is a completely different album. Song for song, Time Out Of Mind has the edge but as an album, this one is just about as good. It might be a totally worn-out cliche, but in this case, the whole is better than the sum of the parts. The only song that I don't care for is Bye and Bye. Either the song is totally lacking in melody or Dylan's voice is not equal to the task. One other (very) minor nitpick is that Lonesome Day Blues (which I like) is all too similar to Cry A While - the latter being a more interesting song what with the tempo changes and better lyrics as well. Other than those minor issues, there is nothing I can find fault with. It's amazing that the guy is producing such incredible stuff 40 years into his career. Hope he never stops.
0451203933|5.0|This is a very vivid account of a little talked about battle, a battle that will likely be repeated as we send our elite soldiers into third-world countries to root out terrorists. It was a simple plan: drop 100 elite soldiers in the middle of a run-down city and capture a couple of warlords, then return to base. It should have taken 2 hours. Instead, the Rangers were cut off by a hailtstorm of bullets and rockets from an enemy determined to wipe the hated Rangers from their city. The author takes you blow-by-blow through the fourteen hour firefight. Perhaps more important than the gripping combat scenes which fill this book are the points of view of the enemy and their motivation for hating the American soldiers.  As usual, our leaders failed to take into account the mindset of the indigenous population, most of whom were heavily armed. Its one of the basic mantras in the Art of War: Know your ememy. <br />This book should be mandatory reading for political and military leaders. Despite all the hi-tech gadgets and overwelming firepower, one of our elite units was cut to ribbons by an untrained but very determined mob. If it had not been for the armored units supplied by other countries, which eventually rescued the unit, the casulty count would have been much higher.<br />The author really did an outstanding job presenting this tragedy. With the U.S. at war with terrorists world-wide, it seems likely that similar situations will appear in the very near future.
B000002UEB|5.0|The one true masterpiece created by Queensryche.  The CD is the musical story of a lost soul caught in a world of manipulators, and the one true love who can save him, if she can save herself.  No other work created by this band matches the intensity or creativity here.  This CD even eclipses their live performance, which I found to be the weakest of any heavy metal band I ever attended.
B00005K3O4|3.0|How this got made, I don't know.  What I do know is that this was worth the $[PRICE] I paid for it.  This is an absolutely packed DVD from MGM, with two deleted scenes, audio commentary, a feature split into five parts, a blooper reel, storyboards, a still gallery, and, oh yeah, the actual movie.<br />The movie itself is mostly notable for how good it looks considering the budget (which even back in the 80s was basically dirt) and the cheerfully cruel humor coming up with violent ways to kill people with circus equipment.  Really, that's the reason to see this movie.  Something to admire if you've worked with no money, and worth adding to your collection for the humor value.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|`Today is blue<BR>A sad and lonesome day'<BR>Dylan<br />How appropriate that I should purchase the Love and Theft cd yesterday, 9-11-01. Even knowing that I needed to find out if we were actually at war, in a mild shock, I drove to buy the music. Being totally engrossed, as all were, I suppose, in the TV and radio information about the `Planes that Fall' I turned to the music. Finding so much there in his words - prophecy in music - always the prophet of times. He brought me back to the ever-original visionary thoughts that Bob Dylan has always represented for me. As a long time fan of Dylan - `67 and onward, I am always so touched by the lyrics. So touched by his insight. So touched by the personal aspect of his spirit. My spirit cries out in anguish in these times through my own expression - art, drawing and then through words, poetry - all inspired and fueled by our humanity.<br />My hope is that Bob Dylan is safe today, that he is creating - as most artist will find themselves doing (myself included) in reflection in the terror and that his spirit never darkens - always brightly lit.<br />Tapping my foot, moving my body - Honest with Me, what fun
B00003CX8J|4.0|All right, admittedly, this isn't &quot;The Usual Suspects.&quot;  It is, however, a well-done adaptation of a comic with a frightening backstory, both in terms of complication (I'm certain every single X-Man has died at least once, and if they haven't it's coming) and, well, stupidity.<br />I should say where I come from; I hate the comic.  Love comics, hate X-Men.  It's not a comic book, it's a lifestyle, a monstrously twisted and convoluted backstory that REALLY needs to be cleaned away (DC Comics has the right idea, doing some huge event that purges various problems and contradictions.)  As such, boiling it down, let alone rendering it watchable, would have been hard work.  Yet this is a perfectly accessible movie; you don't have to know ANY backstory to enjoy it.<br />Bryan Singer at the helm definitely helps, but the cast is also mostly sharp.  I wish Halle Berry hadn't done so many Quaaludes before every scene, but she's the only bad apple in the bunch.  The film shows a definite vision and cohesiveness a lot of action movies lack, period, let alone an atrocity like &quot;Batman and Robin.&quot;  The script is compact, well-written.  I only wish there had been a little more...but then, a good action movie always leaving you wishing for a little more.<br />This isn't Tim Burton's &quot;Batman&quot;, but it's excellent and I definitely think it should be in the discriminating action fan's collection.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Here´s what many of us expected to happen ever since Tommy Lipuma took control: an inane record by the otherwise exquisite Diana Krall. Whose idea was it, to ask Ogerman to take part on the project? Who decided that Krall´s feet deserve so much wider recognition? This time it feels like Krall started to crack as a musician and starts a whole new career on public image. A sad affair, all around. Rest in peace.<br />P.D. Some ideas for future releases: A Beatles´ album arranged by Ray Conniff or a Latin release (in the line of besame mucho in this cd) directed by Don Sebesky himself.

0679777547|5.0|The devil, Dumas and antiquarian books - there are very few authors who could bring such disperate topics together. Thankfully, Arturo Perez-Reverte is one of them. I absolutely love the suspenseful, intelligent, sardonic way the story is told. All the characters are very interesting and complex, and none of them are really to be trusted. This is a book to be enjoyed and to re-read. Watch for the clever reference to Umberto Eco in one of the last chapters (&quot;a certain semiotics professor from Bologna&quot;). All in all a very entertaining, learned book.

I liked to meet obi-wan kenobi (ewan Mcgregor) before he became Alec guinness,in episode iv. Did you know what movie made Alec guinness famous? I will tell you THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI which is a war movie. If you haven't seen it please do, rent it or whatever. As i said ealier i am an old and new fan. some people don't like jar jar binks but he is comic relif. I am sorry about my spelling please forgive me. I am looking forward to seeing the movie on dvd that i don't own untill october 16 2001 but my review is basied on the vhs tape, which i have watched many times. Something instrsting obi-wans light saber is blue in episode 1 the same color as it is in episode IV why is that. Enough of me watch the first one and look for things that appear later in episode IV. han solo in episode 1 is born or just about to be or not to be?
B00005A46T|4.0|With an abrupt drop of the now infamous bass drum/distorted guitar combo, it all begins again. The violently pounding beats, the guitars throwing you around. The absolute intensity of nine vicious beasts beating away at the very core of everything living, breathing, and musical. Slipknot has returned, and they've brought back all the old demons that seemed to be ripping them apart the first time around. Iowa picks up exactly where their self-titled debut left off, writhing in pain and lashing out violently at anything that comes close... but not throwing in any of the surprise maneuvers which would have made for a truly effective attack. Instead, this new work sticks itself right into the same pattern displayed previously. Except for a new hint of Slayer in some of the guitar riffs, there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the last album. After finding a mind-blowing, skull-crushing formula, the band has decided to just keep working it rather than take it to the painful depths which await exploration. The unquenchable rage certainly has not died down, but it hasn't exactly built itself up either. For new fans, Iowa provides all the essentials of Slipknot knowledge, but for returning listeners, there is little to distinguish this new offering from the last one.
B000002BUY|5.0|This cd is awesome.  At first I really didn't know if I should buy the cd or not.  I am happy I did.  This cd is more of  an experimental cd (that how they got the title S.C.I.E.N.C.E because of experiments) because this was the first cd they brought in the dj.  I am glad that all of the experiments that were tested came out positive.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I've never seen such an eclectic group of actors, as well as characters, that worked so well together.  Snatch brings together Hollywood major-leaguers Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and Dennis Farina and throws them into an off the wall British comedy with hilarious results.  <br />Loosely, Snatch is about a diamond heist, gone horribly wrong.  <br />Frankie Four Fingers (Del Toro) and friends pose as Hasidic Jews to steal an 84 carat diamond in Antwerp.  The plan is for Frankie to take the diamond back to New York (via a stopover in London) and give it to Avi (Farina).<br />However, he is waylaid in London by Boris the Blade, whom he goes to for a gun. Boris is tipped off by one of Frankie's collaborators (who just happens to be Boris's brother) about the stone, and about Frankie's gambling addiction (how do you think he came to be minus a finger ?).  Boris devises a plan to get the diamond for himself.<br />Enter a slew of characters that are as hilarious as they are diverse:<br />Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee), petty thieves running a not-entirely-reputable pawn shop, and their oversized getaway driver (\\"What the hell can he get away from ?\\" Vinnie asks Sol at one point) Tyrone (newcomer Ade);  Brick Top (Alan Ford),  a vicious modern day gangster that arranges (and rigs) all kinds of illegal fights (of both the animal and human variety);  and last but certainly not least Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephan Graham), partners (but not the kind that \\"hold hands and take windy walks,\\" as Turkish puts it) in running an illegal bare-knuckle boxing ring.<br />What follows is so fast-paced and intertwined that it is hard to describe it. [....] I loved this movie so much that I find it hard to keep it to a minimum when discussing it.  I haven't yet found a review that truly did it justice, and I'm sure I'm not doing much better.  But trust me. . .even if you're not \\"into British humor\\" you'll love Snatch.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is truly a great movie. Through it we see the life of one Charles Foster Kane analyzed: a man doomed by his own ambition, corrupted by power and with love only for himself. We see the creation of Kane's behemoth news empire and how it destructed. This is the single best character study I have ever seen, and it really defined the genre. This is a movie you can watch dozens of times and see something new every time, it is also a funny film (I laughed more than a few times), and such innovative storytelling and camerawork. The acting is excellent, and the score is perfect, not melodramatic, like many scores for older films, but entirely appropriate. In conclusion, if you like a well-made classic film that will make you think, pick up a copy today.
0792151712|2.0|I went into this movie wondering whether a Cameron film could survive DiCaprio.  Well, if you're talking about box-office, then he's a plus, but if you're talking about quality...<br />The first few scenes in the movie are thoroughly enjoyable, and I found myself thinking that this had the potential to be one of the greatest movies EVER.  These first scenes get one and a half of the stars I gave.  <br />Then, the flashback began...<br />The cinematography (sp?) here is beautiful.  I would recommend this movie just for that (the other half-star).  Then, someone opened his mouth.<br />From the beginning of the flashback to the time when I walked out in righteous indignation, both the plot and the characters were totally and unforgivably flat (a DiCaprio characteristic from the time he found out he didn't have to act to draw box-office -and since then he hasn't been able to act his way out of a wet paper bag, so he's almost forgivable, but for the others...).<br />This movie is not worthy of Cameron.  I will say it did deserve some of the Oscars it received, but not the Best Picture.  I will draw kudos to the Oscar Nominating Committee for leaving DiCaprio out.  Shows they haven't sold out completely.<br />I did borrow a copy of the video at one point to watch the rest (sometimes I swear I'm a masochist!).  The flashbacks only got a little better, but the last couple of scenes (including the last couple scenes of the flashback) were wonderful.<br />But like I said, the scenes with the old woman and the cinematography are sublimely beautiful...
B000003S0P|5.0|My unlce just ordered me this CD as a gift and it blew me away.  I really hadn't heard much classic Crimson, just Thrak, which I thoroughly enjoy.  The music was great, especially Bruford's drums.  Also, the horns fit great with Fripp's vision.  I was really blown away. This album is definatley going to be one that stays in my CD player for quite a while.
6305750750|3.0|OK OK I'll admit it.  This wasn't as good as the original, but HOW COULD IT BE?????  Not even Lucas could live up to expectations with the hype we've created since the his announcement that he planned on making these movies (about the time of Empire Strikes Back).  But let's face it.  Look at Lucas's style.  Was Episode IV REALLY all that different?<br />Lucas always starts with a movie more to introduce the characters than to give them depth, and then he spends the second film doing that, so we can expect to see this happen with Episode II.  Then, he rushes to a sterling climax with the third of a trilogy.<br />And just think, Lucas has to keep excitement in these first three, and still BUILD to the originial trilogy.<br />The only thing that ruined this particular movie for me was the annoying J.J.B. - and don't tell me he didn't annoy you too.<br />All in all though, I found this an excellent beginning.  I look forward to II and III personally.
0446677450|1.0|John T. Reed has published an excellent review of this book, more worth reading than the book itself.  He comments, <BR>Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains much wrong advice, much bad advice, some dangerous advice, and virtually no good advice.<br />What Kiyosaki is really doing is operating a cult of personality. Anna Quindlen had an excellent article about such cults in the 8/14/00 Newsweek. She was talking about politicians and says they seek to elicit the words, \\"I don't know why. I just like the guy.\\" Politicians want to be judged by their personalites, not their character or policies. To members of Kiyosaki's cult, it matters not how many false or probably-false statements I find in Kiyosaki's writings. They just like the guy. Personality is an appropriate criterion for selecting someone to hang around with. But it is a highly inappropriate criterion for evaluating Kiyosaki's advice, because he's not going to let you hang around with him and your family's finances are serious business.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I highly recommend this band.  I only started to listen to them after the release of &quot;why does it always rain on me&quot; and they appeared on &quot;The Panel&quot; (a tv show in Australia).  Firstly I picked up The Invisible Band and then had to rush out and get The Man Who and Good Feeling.  Have a listen and I'm sure that you too will become addicted!  I've been nagging my friends to have a listen.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Trying not to be the typical fanboy, giving excessive praise to an album that hardly deserves it, I have to say that &quot;Gold&quot;, after a few listens, stands as one of my favorites for the year 2001 so far. Adams first solo effort &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; showed his musical talents with equal parts melancholy and drive. &quot;Gold&quot; continues with that tradition, with tracks like the opening &quot;New York, New York&quot; making you tap you foot and bob your head, and gorgeous ones like &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; giving you needed repose. More than on &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, Adams utilizes melody and layers of instruments to power the music along, creating ultimately more complex and well-crafted songs. Highly recommended.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Don't listen to what people tell you about this movie. You must watch and form your own opinion about it without any prior knowledge. And yes, it helps to watch it at least twice. There are many things you catch the second time around that were not there the first time you saw it. The political message it sends is one fitting of the times, and may make you think twice about what you are doing with your life. <br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton each give one of their best performances as the main characters. Pitt is, I believe, one of the best actors to play a crazy person (see also: 12 Monkeys, Kalifornia). And Edward Norton is perhaps the best actor of his generation, although he doesn't seem to get credit for his work. The plot is very engaging, as long as you're not offended by anti-materialistic propaganda (which Brad Pitt spews virtually non-stop). In short, this movie is one that should be on everyone's 'must see' list. As an added bonus, there's lots of extra features on the DVD as well. It would be worth your time to watch the whole movie with the commentary on. <br />Here, I leave you with this thought: the relationship between Calvin and Hobbes (yes, the cartoon characters) is much the same as between Edward Norton's character and Tyler Durden.
B00000I0XW|4.0|In this album Sarah Brightman sings popular songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.From the Phanton of the Opera theres All I Ask Of You,(with Cliff Richard)Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,Music of the Night(originally sung by Micheal Crawford)and the title song.Theres also songs from Cats and Evita.But Sarah's rendition of Memory and Don't Cry For Me Argentina is not as strong or moving as other singer's versions.Theres also songs from other lesser known musicals.Unexpected Song,Anything But Lonely and Tell Me On A Sunday are noteworthy but not outstanding.The only non musical song is Amigos Para Siempre theme song from the Barcelona Olympics.Jose Carreras seems to outshine Sarah on this song.If you're a huge fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals and Sarah Brightman from her Phantom of the Opera days then you should enjoy this album.
0385484518|2.0|I think it's great that so many people have been touched by this book, but honestly, I found it simplistic and--perhaps less forgivable--boring.
B00005JKES|4.0|This collection does not come with the 2 hr first episode?  That's ridiculous.
B000002MY3|5.0|fantastic lyrics, poetic, great voice, arrangements, music quality. both strong and touching. best tracks: you oughta know, mary jane, wake up, forgiven. don't even hesitate and buy it. a must-have for a collector's favorite masterpieces.
B000009QPE|5.0|Well... this album... first of all, CLEAN production , ultra-fast guitar riffs and chaotic solos , very very fast drummming by master Lombardo, and some of the most known songs of metal history makes this cd the BEST thrash metal cd ever and probably the best metal cd made in the 80's, just PERFECT agression.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|This is some funny stuff. Jack Black and Kyle Gass have  great senses of humor and it translates well into the musical treat that is the &quot;D&quot;. Not only is this disc hilarious, but the music in itself is very good. Some of these songs on the cd are the funniest things I have heard in a long time. Hoepfully some sort of live DVD release will follow. Long live the &quot;D&quot;.
B000002H2H|5.0|&quot;Ride the Lighting&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; are by far the best albums Metallica ever released.  Although, not as tight as &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; you can see the direction and focus of the band better on this album than on &quot;Kill em All&quot;.  Instead of chocking the life out of the listerner with ultra fast songs like on &quot;Kill em All&quot; we begin to see Metallica develop musically and lyrically to bring the listener in as then slam them to the ground.  &quot;Ride the Lighting&quot; is a well planned and calculated album by Metallica.  If you are looking to see what the band was like back in the 80's then I would recommend this album.  It is a far cry from the Metallica kids know today.  It is a Heavy Metal Masterpiece from a hungry band fighting their way to the top.  There is plenty of classic Metallica songs on this album that has made the band what they are today.  Buy &quot;Ride the Lighting&quot; and experience a not so radio freindly Metallica for yourself.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|This is easily the funniest cd I've ever listened to. If you're an old fan you'll enjoy the new sound the songs have. If you've never heard of Tenacious D you're in for a great surprise. The D is not only funny as hell but they also rock.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I must admit that, even though I've been waiting for this album, I was a little skeptical when I heard that there would be full band versions of the D's classic tunes. I mean, I love the acoustic guitar. And the sound that these guys get, absolutely amazing. Well to anyone who might have had the skepticism I did, let me tell you, you need not worry. This album is incredible. It's still very acoustic based and the full rock sound builds on the songs previous versions from Kage and Jables short lived HBO series. There are some really funny comedy sketches in between some of the songs, also. Jack Black definitely lets his wit shine. This album is a must have for any Tenacious D fan.
B00004XOWM|1.0|limp bizkit lost it with this album. the 1st cd was great and the 2nd pretty good. but this one is not what they were in the first 2. they were hardcore in 3 dollar bill y'all. in chocolate starfish, hot dog flavored water- it really sucks. the songs are all the same about bein' hated or some crap like that. they went from really hardcore music to some sort of soft rock type genre. this album sucks. limp bizkit could've done better.
B000002NC4|5.0|This album is very difficult to describe, because words alone cannot communicate the power of the music.  I'll give it my best shot........<br />I have heard a lot of music where I've wondered to myself, &quot;Wow!  how in the world did this sound climb to such an impossible place?&quot;  These are bands like Phish, The Grateful Dead, Moe, Percy Hill, Blind Man's Sun, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, or even Jimmy Hendrix.  Although delightful to my hear, these artists always seem to leave me feeling empty inside, with no long-lasting feeling of satisfaction from the music.<br />I have also heard a lot of music where I've wondered to myself, &quot;Wow!  How in the world did these lyrics climb to such an impossible place?&quot;  These are artists like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Freedy Johnston, and Lou Reed, just to name a few.  Although these artists always seem to have a message with each of their songs, precious few of these songs actually had an impressive quality of sound as well.<br />&quot;Perfect From Now On&quot; is that unbelievably rare album that climbs to the highest peaks of your soul, both musically AND lyrically.  At at least one point in every song, I wonder to myself, &quot;Wow!  How in the world is this happening?  How did the song come to this point?  How did they get here?  It is IMPOSSIBLE for music to hit home like this.  THIS is how I feel.  THIS is what I've been afraid to talk about.  THIS is it.  I'm home.&quot;  Then the song is over, and the next journey starts.<br />Each of the eight songs on this album is a dynamic blend of wailing guitars, unique bass lines, and progressive rythms.  At the same time, each song produces deep emotion, and a profound message about human existence.<br />I just went to see BTS for the first time in NYC last weekend.  Folks.........they are the REAL DEAL!  No frills, no gimmicks, and no crap.  Just a band that really cares about their music, and the impact it has on their audience.  A rarity nowadays, to say the least.<br />Just for camparison's sake, here are the only albums I've ever heard that can even hold a candle to &quot;Perfect From Now On&quot;:<br />(Again, this is only my opinion.)<br />&quot;Animals, Darkside of the Moon&quot; - Pink Floyd<br />&quot;OK Computer, The Bends&quot; - Radiohead<br />&quot;Revolver, Rubber Soul&quot; - The Beatles<br />&quot;Keep it Like a Secret&quot; - Built to Spill<br />(yes, they have another beauty)
B00000DR52|4.0|...but entertaining, none-the-less.<br />It is always fun to track down anything David Byrne has worked on, but this soundtrack is a wee disappointing.  While listening to the soundtrack (as opposed to watching the movie which it underscores) you always have a sense that this is somehow a synthetic interpretation of what you expect when you look at the forbidden city...almost westernized.<br />It's great music, and a great and cohesive effort, but many of the repetitive melodies sound as if they might be more at home in Broadway hit than a period piece about the declining days of Chinese aristocracy.<br />If you saw the movie and enjoyed the music (as I did) there is no reason not to pick this disc up.  If you are buying this because you think you are getting some authentic Chinese music...keep shopping.
0553565915|5.0|Whether you believe in the reality of Betty's account or think it a work of fiction, it is beyond me why disbelievers would spew venom here for potential readers of her book. I do believe Betty's story, but even if you think it is a total fabrication, what harm has she done? My goodness, what a horrible person she is to tell us that God loves us unconditionally, that we should all be kind and forgiving just as God is, and that the greatest thing we can do is learn to love one another. If just one person reads her book and becomes a better, more loving person because of it, then she has done a great service to humankind! And I, for one, AM a better, more loving, more accepting, happier, and kinder person because of reading Betty's book. So, I thank her deeply for sharing her beautiful story with a world that has a lot to learn about love. Thank you, Betty! God bless you.
B00005NWRS|3.0|Lots of people jumping on the Ryan bandwagon lately.  Maybe the wagon can't handle all the weight, hence coming precariously close to a giant ditch.  I don't quite understand what he's trying to do here.  I realize we can't have Stranger's Almanac over again, but what has happened?  Shouldn't Ryan be writing these songs in about 20 years?<br />Paul Westerberg needs to sit Ryan down and explain that a studio full of strings and an over-abundance of back-up singers is not what will make a great record.  I'm sorry to say I see a pattern here- Ethan Johns is &quot;musically emasculating&quot; Ryan. (Sort of like what Jeff Lynne did to Tom Petty.) He needs to exit the production seat as soon as possible.<br />So, that being said, the album is not terrible, but I firmly agree with the previous reviewer who said this sounds like an album of b-sides.  This album misses that soul-inspired mixture of thunder and reflection Ryan is so wonderful at creating. Every song is a Ryan Adams chamber music re-mix.  I don't know if this is a self-imposed period of &quot;reflection,&quot; but please move on.  There really isn't one good rocker on it, and nothing as beautiful as &quot;Come Pick Me Up&quot; from Heartbreaker.<br />Ryan, I say this out of love- grab Caitlin(sp?)and Phil, drink a lot of bourbon, listen to every Replacements and G. Parsons album that exists, and write another masterpiece.  <br />File &quot;Gold&quot; under &quot;Nice Try.&quot;
B00004YA0T|5.0|First off, I say that at [this price], you are getting the Bruckner symphonies for [very little] per disc. Now if they were just ok performances, they would be a pretty good deal. But these performances are all nothing less than excellent. Eugen Jochum was truly one of the great Bruckner conductors, and this, his EMI cycle, is his greatest work in Bruckner. He is aided by the spectacular Dresden Staatskapelle. I'd describe this orchestra as having a very warm, big, well-blended sound. First off, the brass section, while not the most refined you'll hear, is surely one of the biggest and most full-blooded you'll hear, always vibrant and energetic throughout every performance. The strings have a very rich, organic quality to them, particularly in the 7th and 9th Adagio's. Full-blooded and vibrant are again words that come to mind. The somewhat subordinate winds(Bruckner orchestral writing was proportionately light on winds) are always very fine. And last, but most definately not least, the timpani makes his due presence known throughout, particularly in the 2nd, 6th, and 9th.<br /><br />Now on to the individual performances.<br /><br />No. 1: This was my first experience with Bruckner's first. I have only acquired one other recording, Daniel Barenboim's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic. On the list-mania lists, everyone seems to recommend this recording as the version to get for this symphony. After listening to both, I say to you that Jochum is just as good as Barenboim, both interpretively and orchestrally. Barenboim might be digital, but Jochum's stereo is still plenty good.<br /><br />No. 2: I have 3 or 4 other performances of the 2nd symphony, most others being editions with slightly more music. Even though I usually prefer an edition with more music, Jochum's performance is so electrifying and powerful that I'm perfectly content with it. It totally wins you over. My favorite recording of the symphony.<br /><br />No. 3: Another spontaneous, energetic performance from Jochum and his Dresden forces. This performance does displace the grand, majestic recording by Georg Tintner on Naxos, but it will more than suffice. This makes a fine alternative to the Tintner.<br /><br />No. 4: Once again, Jochum goes for a more energetic Bruckner, as opposed to say the great Karl Bohm/Vienna Philharmonic performance. But this is still one of the reference recordings for this work.<br /><br />No. 5: A towering performance of the 5th. This is Bruckner's most intellectual, seemingly questioning, and aside from the 8th, most \\"epic journey-feeling\\". Jochum recorded this symphony I believe 5 times throughout his career and his view essentially remained consistent. And this time he has his magnificent Dresden Staatskapelle to join him for the ride. The Dresden brass are particularly thunderous here. My only reservation is the trombones I think are just a bit harsh at the beginning of the 1st movement. But it's a really minor thing. Truly one of the great 5th's.<br /><br />No. 6:  It's always striked me as odd that this is one of Bruckner's most underperformed symphonies. I find it to be even more accessible than his 4th or 7th. In a nutshell, a grand heroic opening movement; a solemn, warm, spiritual Adagio; an energetic, menacing Scherzo; and Finale which simply carries us home to victory. The opening of the first movement always sounds like some movie hero gloriously riding across the Sahara desert with his noble side-kicks! Anyway, Jochum's 6th is spectacular is every department, everybit as good as Klemperer's acclaimed EMI recording.<br /><br />No. 7: A magnificent performance. Jochum's view of the whole work is actually quite spacious as opposed to his performances of the early symphonies. The Adagio clocks in at something like 26 minutes. But his tempi never drag for a second and the momentum is confidentally sustained throughout. The Dresden strings are particularly rich in this performance.<br /><br />No. 8: The only weak link in theset. Neither well played or recorded, with brass sounding crude and out of balance at some points or just plain underpowered at others. Jochum's performance in his earlier cycle conducting the Berlin Philharmonic is much better. Substitute with Karajan, Boulez, Giulini or Wand.<br /><br />No. 9: A performance of great distiction. The first movement is taken at a somewhat fast and flowing tempo and is tremendously exciting at the climaxes. The second is a stunner, with the Dresden brass sounding powerful and actually quite savage(that's a compliment). And the sublime finale is taken at about the broadest possible tempo with superb results.<br /><br />There you have it. Now what are ya waiting for? Pick it up ASAP! Ya never heard Bruckner and wanna a great way to get the symphonies at a rock bottom price? Look no farther.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|For the past two weeks I have been listening non-stop to Dylan's remarkable Love and Theft album.  One thing is perfectly clear already:  it will take only about two more weeks (three at most) for most normal humans like you and me to face up to the astonishing fact that this album is not merely Bob Dylan's best work since Time Out of Mind, or Blood on the Tracks, or Blonde on Blonde, or even Highway 61 Revisited - rather, it is the best since he and some teenage girl named Echo spent long hours together devouring old R&amp;B records in his Hibbing bedroom, which is to say ever.  Maybe I should type this word EVER in capital letters so that there is no mistake.  And not only is Love and Theft the high water mark in Dylan's vast catalogue, it is one of the greatest masterpieces ever recorded - by any artist at any time, any place, working in any genre.  Perhaps now you will take me seriously when I have the unmitigated gall to say that Bob Dylan is a truly great singer and always has been.  You mocked me of course, but once you've heard Love and Theft you will realize how misguided you have been, how much of a sordid lie your life has become.  Oh, but you are sceptical even now.  Well, just to demonstrate that I bear no grudge against you I herewith offer some free advice:  listen to the singing and the playing on this album, and the poetry, and be humbled in the face of greatness.  Some of these songs (for instance, Mississippi and High Water) will be justly famous when all of my grandchildren and yours have made their mark in this world and then gone on to make a large if somehow dispiriting progress towards oblivion.
0060392886|5.0|I felt that this book was very good, one of the best I have read.  It could be the fact that I have been in many rock bands and can see how some of these stories may have taken place while being on the road far away from home.  It kept me reading and focused and entertained throughout the whole book.  Some nights I would keep reading till I had to force myself to put the book down and go to sleep for work the next day.
B000002GJS|2.0|I will firmly admit that I am a Bryan fan, and will no doubt remain so regardless of what he churns out, but I try to forget his material from the 1990s.  Everything from his first album through Reckless just got better and better, and Into the Fire was without doubt the best thing he ever did.  That album, in fact, is one of my top ten favorites by any artist.  But listening to all the Amazon reviews raving about Waking Up the Neighbours, I wonder if any of you have ever listened to his previous work at all. Fans waited four years or so for Adams to come out with this album, and it appears to me that, after having his fallout with Jim Vallance, Adams rummaged around for any co-writer he could find, and the result was this 80-minute-long buckshot spray of unsatisfying garage-band pop (&quot;hey, with 15 tracks, a couple are BOUND to hit the charts&quot;).  For this album, Bryan apparently decided that he needed to reduce both his vocabulary and the range of his subject matter.  In 1987 he wrote songs about the First World War, the surviving pride of the First Nations despite generations of indignities, introspective longing for a distant loved one, and the existential, dark and yet ultimately optimistic title track, &quot;Into the Fire.&quot;  In 1991, however, he churned out a dozen odes to superficiality, running (to vary a quote from a famous film review) the gamut of themes from A to B. Basically, it was this album which made me start listening to people who said that Adams had sold out, and his subsequent efforts (&quot;18 'til I die&quot;, Bryan? Oh, spare me... ) which convinced me that he had.  NOTE TO MR. ADAMS -- you're a good 25 years out of high school now.  That means you no longer have to pretend you're stupid to be cool.  You have already convinced us you're cool.  We like you.  Now please stop writing this drivel and get back to composing some quality.

B00005QATY|3.0|The movie was weird and George Clooney seemed so different in this movie.  It made me laugh though certain parts of the film left me confused.
B000002MUW|5.0|Madonna decided to prove the critics wrong when they said her career was over after the Sex book, the Erotica album, and the movie Body of Evidence all came out around the same time, which got a lot of negative responces. Though this album is not her most popular, it still contains some of her best music, and the one of the biggest singles of her career, Take a Bow. The songs on the record that really stand out include Secret, Forbidden Love, Love Tried To Welcome Me, and the haunting Santuary. Notice, all the songs just mentioned are slow to mid-tempo songs. Not bad for a entertainer who's mostly known for her dance-pop tunes. Human Nature is a entertaining song that tells the audience what she has to go through with the critics who bash her for being sexual, when all she's doing is being herself. Bedtime Story is a very creative song which Bjork helped write and produced. The other three songs, Survival, Don't Stop, and Inside of Me help round out the album, Survival being the opening song, Don't Stop being the usual dance song, and Inside of Me being the song that talks about losing someone truly loved. Over all, this is a must have for Madonna fans. If you are a big fan of her dance songs, this album might not be for you, sense most of it is slow, mid-tempo songs.

B00004XOWM|1.0|this album really sucks. limp bizkit had it goin' with 3 dollar bill y'all which was freakin' bad a**. significant other was pretty good. and then there was chocolate starfish and hotdog flavored water. this album sucks. you HAD to be a limp fan to know why this album is worth jack listenin' to. it wasn't hardcore as the first one. they had to mess it up with this soft crap about bein' hated while they WERE at the top of their game. it really sucks. limp bizkit could've done better.
B000006O7C|5.0|Assuming that I've heard correctly, this CD was compiled and released following Buckley's untimely death and that probably explains why the recordings have a certain rough feel to them at times.  But no matter -- the unpolished production is actually perfect for Buckley's moody style.  Jeff Buckley was one of those all-too rare artists whose power as a musician came not from slick producers but instead from the mournful yet exhilirating sound of his own voice.  Though he died without acheiving the success that he deserved, Buckley had that most elusive of qualities -- a natural born charisma.  He had one of those voices that could automtically posess the mind of the listener and that charisma comes through even in the most unpolished of recordings.  Whenever I hear this unpolished album, its easy to imagine being in some obscure club and discovering, for the first time, a truly great talent with all the promise in the world ahead of him -- its the type of exhilirating feeling that I think everyone hopes to possess whenever they see some unknown band take the stage.<br />This is one of those CDs that to which I find myself continually drawn and its rare that a day goes by that I don't listen to at least one or two songs from it.  Especially when one considers Buckley's eventual fate, the songs on this album have a certain fatalism on them.  As a friend of mine put it, &quot;It has a real drowning quality to it.&quot;  I don't know if I'd go that far but the music is truly haunting as is Buckley's voice, its amazing range thankfully preserved here.  Among the songs themselves, my personal favorites are the three that start off the second disk -- Nightmare by the Sea, New Year's Prayer, and especially Haven't You Heard.  After the mournfully fatalistic feel of that first two songs, Haven't You Heard serves as a powerful remainder that Buckley was more than an obscure, moody folkie.  Haven't You Heard, to me, stands as proof that Jeff Buckley was -- for lack of a less stereotypical term -- a true rock star.  Unfortunately, that was a destiny he wouldn't get to witness for himself.
B00005N9CV|1.0|I did not buy this album, and though it will be the first Diana Krall album missing from my collection, I don't intend to.  I heard it playing last week in the neighborhood music section, and frankly, I wanted to puke.  Aware of the inappropriateness of that response, I opted to leave that area of the store.<br />I have been a fan of Diana's for many years.  I've cheered her in small clubs, at charity events, and at larger venues.  I recently have been dismayed by what I've perceived as her steady slide into the lowest-common-denominator world of the record company marketing geeks.  How else can one interpret the increasingly sappy, lush, and over-produced material?  (I know there's a minor tradition in jazz greats incorporating orchestral accompaniment, e.g., Charlie Parker, Nat Cole, but I hate that stuff, too.)<br />This lady is a monster talent, I believe, not only technically but also as an interpreter of song who GETS IT, who understands the roots of Jazz.  At her best, she can swing with the best of 'em. <br />Diana once signed a napkin for my then-ten year-old daughter saying, \\"H-----: Have FUN with your piano.\\"  It's been my observation in her live performances that Diana isn't having as much fun as she used to.  Diana:  HAVE FUN WITH YOUR PIANO.
6304415346|5.0|Although watching a Star Trek film requires shedding reality for a couple of hours, both the novice and the dedicated &quot;Trekkie&quot; can enjoy this one.  The newcomer may wonder about technical matters:  how fast is &quot;warp ten&quot;?; what's a &quot;temporal vortex&quot;?; why are Federation weapons so ungainly?  Ignore these minor issues for later reflection.  For now, watch this film for the adventure and the people living it.  There's plenty of adventure and some of the people are a treat.<br />The adventure is a chase through time and space to Earth of this century.  The Borg, a triumph of biotechnology, are trying to disrupt history itself.  A mixture of machine and organisms, they are personified as the epitome of evil.  They aspire to assimilate members of any sentient species into their &quot;perfect&quot; collective.  They simply want everybody to be like them: rather like globalization on a galactic scale.  Their leader is rather like a queen bee, a superior among equals .  She's a truly gross character, both physically and morally, the perfect example of the &quot;modern woman&quot; as a corporate manager.  Superbly portrayed by Alice Krige, one can only wish the make-up team who turned this beautiful South African into such a monster roast in the eternal flames.  The scene of her blowing on the android Data's emotion chip will remain etched in the viewer's memory forever.<br />Most of the other Enterprise crew break a little from their traditional TV series roles from time to time.  Picard sheds his lofty role as Captain as he guides the confused Lily Sloane [Alfre Woodard] through a glimpse of her future.  Counselor Deanne Troi, usually so cool and collected, becomes wonderfully sloshed in a Rocky Mountain grog shop.  Worf the Klingon lapses a moment into space sickness.  Jonathan Frakes, as the film's director, has no time for acting, still pompously blustering his way through events just as he does in the TV episodes.<br />The walkaway portrayal in this film is James Cromwell as Zefran Cochrane.  Since faster-than-light travel is a mainstay of Star Trek tales, it was only logical that some means be devised to show us who perfected it.  Cromwell is outstanding in shattering every image we have of the sombre, knowledge-seeking, ivory tower researcher.  A lecherous old lush, practical as only an inventor can be, he seems more human than any other character in the film.  Confronted by Chief Engineer Jordi La Forge's adulatory account of future honours, he bolts, fearing the wealth he dreamed of coming from his invention will evaporate.  Cromwell evokes the common in all of us - how would we react if this mob appeared in our midst?  Cromwell captures the wonder, resentment, fears and ambitions any of us might if confronted by our future.  Calling his role &quot;supportive&quot; is a terrible misnomer - the film is clearly his.<br />In short, this is a speculative fiction film worthy of your consideration.  There's much pathos, the visual effects don't overwhelm unduly, and the combat, which is a bit obtrusive, is still better than many of the type.  The proximity in time to our own day brings an fillip of novelty from other Star Trek movies.  It's worth watching and keeping, if for nothing else than to generate interest in younger viewers to see how close it comes to the reality of the future.ayal in this film is James Cromwell as Zefran Cochrane.

B00005N9CV|4.0|The images of Diana Krall on this CD jacket far surpass any before.  They are evocative.  The music (mostly standards) is good, but chosen to appeal to the masses.  Her earlier works (and I own them all) revealed more of her amazing vocal talent.  Nonetheless, I like this CD and am encouraged to keep buying Diana Krall.
0783113943|3.0|the story is fairly predictable: local girl gets discovered, local girl goes to new york and gets swept up with life in the fast lane, local girl loses sight of who she is or was, local girl goes into visible slide and pays the ultimate price.<br />the only thing that redeems this film (slightly anyway) is the uniqueness of the main character's personality -- at once innocent and cold.  also, angelie jolie is a terrific actress but her face a little too imperfect and her body a little too boxy to be taken seriously as a stick-figured model.

B00005NWRS|5.0|Ryan Adams is only 26, but with &quot;Gold,&quot; he's produced the masterpiece he's threatened to deliver since he was only 21.  I thought Whiskeytown's &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot; was the best album of the 1990s, but was disappointed by &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Pneumonia,&quot; the former being too dour and evidencing an identity crisis -- who am I, he asked, Bob Dylan or Gram Parson? -- the latter being just too fey, with the absence of Mike Daly on guitar taking away a crucial bit of muscle. In &quot;Gold,&quot; Adams has a band with as much punch as early Whiskeytown, and the breadth of his songwriting and singing talent is breathtaking.  Anyone who, in the space of 20 songs -- album, plus the EP -- invokes touches of the Band, the Rolling Stones circa &quot;No Expectations&quot; and &quot;Silver Train,&quot; Van Morrison and Neil Young, and early-'70s era Rod Stewart/Faces (hear the strains of &quot;Gasoline Ally&quot; in &quot;Nowhere Girl,&quot; the Ian McLagan-like organ that pipes in elsewhere) -- is better than eclectic, he's wildly ambitious.  A couple of years ago, it seemed that Adams might be voted most likely to squander his talent.  With &quot;Gold,&quot; it's clear he's got talent to burn, and he's using it wisely.  And, for the first time in his career, maybe he has a bit of strange luck: who knew when the photo was taken of him wrapped in the American flag and they sequenced the album to start with a paean to New York that the album would arrive just in time to salve our wounds?

B00000K28G|5.0|This is one of the most special albuns i have.It is in the same line as &quot;Alternative 4&quot;, but in my opinion it's much better,and i can say that is the best Anathema album.A clearly &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; influenced album.Vincent's voice is at it's best, and Danny's lead guitars really draws emotion in the tracks. My favorite track is &quot;One last goodbye&quot;, that when i heard for the first time  i started crying because it was so beautiful, so deep, and the lyrics... For me is one of the most beautiful song that i ever heard. In matter of fact, the whole album is perfect, and i can assure anyone that this is a great buy.Everyone who apreciates the beauty and sadness of music will love it as i did.

0440219078|5.0|I found this book a very enlightening one.  It was thinking in a different way than normal and I liked that.  The Giver helped me see things in a different perspective.  The way he was selected to be the next \\"receiver\\" was odd to me.  The whole concept of not being an individual not being able to choose anything not being able to see color even made me feel sad for them.  It was wrote in such an interesting manner that I didn't want to put the book down.  I finished it in just a few hours and after I was done I wanted it to be longer so I could find out more about this weird way of living.<BR>E.C.
B00004Z311|5.0|It is amazing to see how in the eighties, special effects were so advanced as to top some of today's high tech pictures.CGI and computer animation have taken over nowadays, but in most films, you can tell right away where these scenes were rendered. If you have viewed this movie however, you will see scenes, (particularly Darkness' layer) were you just have to wonder how this feat was accomplished. Ridley Scott is phenomenal at flawlessly combining the most beautiful of scenes with utterly unbelievable landscapes and characters. This is one of those rare gems, and it is hard to believe anyone would rate it at less than 5 stars. This movie is the pure essence of youth, of dreams, fantasy and light, but along with these also come nightmares, and Darkness.
B00005N919|5.0|I had already seen the Unrated version of this slick, highly entertaining erotic thriller; this DVD edition was well worth the patience. Great features (the &quot;Blonde Poison&quot; documentary is one of the best ever) and commentaries; especially entertained by the storyboards, solidifying just how graphic the film could have been. Worth the money, and the lack of star input aside, a definitive disc for this movie.

B00005JK93|5.0|Though funny on a different level than I expected, which was hardly laugh-out-loud, Hedwig and the Angry Inch stretches the imagination of filmmaking. The writer, actor, musician, drag queen of Hedwig is absolutely incredible. The songs are better than great, the band rocks, and the characters and disjointed plot are intensely original. I can't accurately describe the experience of seeing a movie so bold and magnificent with kick -ss rock music that tells the story, as with Hedwig. After you see this, it's almost irresistible not to buy the soundtrack.
B0000027RL|5.0|OK, I'm not up on history of grunge, comparisons to other Seattle bands, etc. <br />I'm a classical musician geek!<BR> <BR>BUT<br />This CD is, as another reviewer remarked, &quot;an emotional rollar coaster&quot; - it's magic.<br />What is the debate? The fact that there are 305 reviews on this album says one important thing: it has touched people. Fine art provokes response, and is difficult to forget. <br />These songs haunt me long after listening, and not only is every band member a freaking monster on their instrument, but Eddie Vedder is a genius, as far as I'm concerned.<br />His voice has about a million colors and inflections, and is always emotionally connected - it's sincere at a gut level.<br />His lyrics cut  the message down to its prime form - doesn't waste time with any bull. I like that. And his hair was amazing - why did you cut it, Eddie?????  <br />WHY????<br />:--)
B00004XONN|5.0|After the aftermath of OK Computer I'm sure radiohead fans were expecting another monster with new songs similar to No Surprises, Lucky, Paranoid Android, Exit Music, Karma Police etc etc. I'm also sure every RH fan was surprised and shocked initially by the content on KID A, FOR A WHILE THAT IS!!!. Until you realised that RH had unleashed yet another masterpiece. OK they are a lot less guitars, BUT there are still so many masterpieces on this album. 7 out of the 10 I think. These are:<BR>Right Place (Thom on piano what else do u want), National Anthem (horny), Disappear Completly(I think I did...), Optimistic (great song with GUITARS), Idioteque (electro v.cool), Morning Bell (certainly woke me up), Motion Picture (The best on the album). This album after a few good listens( it took me 4 weeks to get into it) takes your soul and cracks it in half. This album has yet again (thanx RH) changed how I think about music. RH have again showed why they are the most creative, innovative and best band ever. Immerse your self in this and you may never return, you may in fact disappear completly.

B00004ZB9D|1.0|Since his last good album &quot;Circus&quot;, Lenny Kravitz looks to me like a musician that cares more about his shows on the MTV and his fashion style (what sun glasses! oh yeah!), then the music he does. So somewhere on the way to the bank, Kravitz lost his music. To make story short - most of the old stuff here is good and the new is bad, especially the horrible cover version to the &quot;GUESS WHO&quot;'s  &quot;American woman&quot;. The problem of the good stuff is, that it seems like it does'nt belong here - it was taken out of great discs and does'nt do anymore. Sorry to tell you - i have the disc but don't listen to it. I prefer to listen to a dbl. bootleg album that was taken live  in Amsterdam, during the &quot;Circus&quot; tour. This is the real Kravitz to me.
0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is a masterpiece of pacing a film.  It moves along so swiftly that you'll be surprised at how long you've been watching it.  <br />There's little plot in Goodfellas.  The film serves as an opportunity to experience the Mafia lifestyle firsthand.  We see the highs and the many lows that come with this dangerous lifestyle.  <br />Henry Hill (played by the underrated Liotta) is an Irish boy who grew up and into the world of gangsters.  As a boy, he has a romanticised view of the world and this doesn't really change as he gets older.  He sees the Mafia as a cool gang.  However, he's smart enough not to cross any of the trigger happy members.  He only comes close once, funny how?<br />Pesci's Oscar winning turn as the disturbed Tommy DeVito is a horror to behold.  While only being a supporting character, we know trouble is around the corner when DeVito is on screen.  De Niro underplays his role.  His character is a shifty one whose paranoia gets the better of him in the end. <br />Bracco is the emotional centre of the movie.  A Jewish girl, she marries Henry, and becomes enamoured with this world of Pauls and Marys.  Her life gets tougher as Henry conducts numerous affairs and yet she knows she can't live without the financial stability that the Mafia brings.<br />Scorsese's direction is always personal.  He likes to make his presence felt.  And so we get to see tricks like comedic narration (&quot;Johnny Two-Times, because he says everything twice - &quot;I'm going to the bathroom the bathroom&quot;);  twisted narrative, the beginning becomes the middle;  and most strangely, a courtroom confession by Henry delivered directly to the camera.  While some directors overuse their tricks, Scorsese only uses them when they're necessary, when they'll work.  <br />He's the best director of his generation and this may well be his masterpiece.
B00005B4GU|5.0|this album was a complete suprise to me...i was 13 when OK computer came out and I loved it since, so I have now bought my 3rd Radiohead album.the songs in this album are to good to be called leftovers from kid A.pakd like a sardine in a crushd tin box sounds like broken down techno soud that has been made into a artistic lull. Pyramid song is just such a beautifull and oddly hypnotizing song it is bound to be a classic radiohead song. push/pulk revolving doors is a surge of evenflowing music that gets halted and starts up again with thoms disstorted voice that makes it sound more of an escaping of something... you and whose army is a great slow and dour song that makes you feel energized with sadness... I might be wrong is a great example of radioheads ability to mix their old style with there unrelenting quest to make their music new and interestng. knives out is the second best song in this album just simply amazing. morning bells is a great remix of the original but just not as good. dollars and cents is the best song on the album.it mixes great background sound of violins with the chantic sound of the bass.thoms voice is just amazingly anxious and perfect. hunting bears is a repeating lulliby that makes you feel paranoid...cool spinning plates is good but not that good. living in a glass house is a very diffrent and well put together ending for the cd, fits perfectly...I recommend this cd deeply!
0805062971|3.0|Don't get me wrong the book is great, but I was disappointed with it for one reason.<br />Whoever did the screenplay for the movie did one hell of a job because the Movie is better than the book! I don't know why, but I like the movie a lot better than the book. Maybe it is because I have seen the movie several times before I read the book. <br />It is a good book and worth reading to see if you agree with me or not!
B000002IHU|3.0|I was twelve when I first listened to te record, at my cousin's basement. I liked it a lot for it was my first heavy metal experience, and I became a big fan of ratt's. I must say that this record it's kinda boring, almost every song sound the same. It has nice riffs, though. Pearcy's voice is great, De Martini plays like he's reading the notes, Blotzer's drummig is always great. But, the thing is, this album has no life in it. It's not like &quot;out of the cellar, dancing undercover or any other&quot;. The lyrics, though are very sexual and &quot;implicit&quot; in a way. But that's all there is to &quot;Invasion&quot;.<BR>I personally like &quot;Lay it down&quot;, &quot;What you give is what you get&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous but worth the risk&quot;.<BR>If you're a big fan of Ratt, buy it and complete your collection.<BR>But if you're just starting in to the 80's heavy metal or want to listen to Ratt, start with any other record.
B000000I0Q|4.0|This album totally blew me away from the first note to the end.  This album was recorded between Genesis albums with Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins.  And the way the album was structured and written and arranged totally dictated what Steve did with every solo album from here on in.<br />Ace of Wands is a very strong opening track, showcasing his guitar playing with effects and sonic booms from Phil's drumming.  It also shows how tight Phil and Mike are as a rhythmic foundation.  There's a huge presence of Mellotron and Moog synthesizer on the entire album.  And some of the songs are pre-empted by sound effects, which make it totally run along very well.<br />The Hermit is the only song on here that didn't really catch me very well.  Steve sings it, but his voice is very monotone throughout the song, very lifeless.  The music however does make up for it, showing how Steve can write very lovely chord changes, almost romantic.  Star of Sirius is another highlight.  Phil sings this one, and shows that this song could have had a home on A Trick of the Tail.<br />The Shadow of the Hierophant is a nice song that ends this collection with vocals by Mike Oldfeld's sister, Sally Oldfeld.  Great drumming on this song at its climax.  Overall, a very interesting experimental album that was a sign for things to come from Steve.  Definitely made me a fan of his solo music.
0790729628|2.0|Won't waste your time with movie analysis, just the DVD complaints:<br />1. No extras, like commentary, outtakes, etc.<br />2. No 5.1 sound<br />3. No DTS<br />4. Doesn't include both versions: with voice over and without.<br />I keep reading a new version is due out. Consensus seems to be wait and see if Warner addresses any of these complaints before buying.

B000021XS0|5.0|Two most important dates in Prog history are: (1) May 3, 1988 and (2) October 26, 1999.  The first is the release date for Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, and the second is for Scenes from a Memory.  <br />Mindcrime was my favorite album for 10 years, and I never thought it would be possible to beat it.  But leave it to a group of super-savvy expert musicians, a la Dream Theater, to beat Mindcrime.  SFAM doesn't have the same raw, passionate sound as Mindcrime, but the album is on a higher musical plain. (Well, despite this credit still goes to Queensryche for having the greatest intro into an album... &quot;I Remember Now&quot; and &quot;Anarychy X&quot; still give me chills when I hear them). I suspect that a lot of non-musicians may not appreciate SFAM for all its worth because the strengths of the album are in the band's musical abilities, but the story is well conceived and the melodies are beautiful so a regular listener should enjoy it.  The one thing I noticed most was that every note on this album sounds deliberate, not just a lot of wasted time shredding.  Hardly any of the riffs in this 78 minute CD are typical recycled pop riffs. Each seemed to be carefully crafted to illustrate technical precision while still maintaining the album's melody... ...<br />THE MELODY!! OH YEAH... Lots of bands, even Prog bands, concentrate on progressive riffs and movements but forget to piece these movements together to form coherent melodies.  Guess what?? You can actually whistle most of the tunes in SFAM--it's a very pleasant experience, especially since melodies string together nicely throughout the CD (it IS a concept album, ya know). It's very intriguing how they bring back certain melodies from song to song, but subtley changed to reflect the mood of the current song.<br />I simply don't know how this album can rate lower than 5 stars.  Some people are not giving this album 5 stars, arguing that &quot;their&quot; respective bands are better.  The point is not torate this CD in respect to other bands (although I don't think there are many bands that can best DT), but to rate it for its merits.  It is a keen display of musical prowess, an explosion of creative talent, and a display of DT's maturity.<br />[Oh, couple comments. <br />1. To the guy who said that &quot;music is about music&quot;--that's retarded.  While music is the central issue here, you must give DT credit for having inspiration to explore a more creative niche.  Let's not be selfish here, but rather let's congratulate DT on going beyond what's required for regular &quot;music.&quot;  If you want music for music's sake, listen to Limp Bizkit--- but that's not really music dude.<br />2. To the guy who said that DT is heartless, unlike Phish... dude, you need to see the DVD &quot;Scenes from New York&quot;.  Just because they don't throw improv jams while high doesn't mean they're heartless.  they have passion for what they do... And anyway, Liquid Tension Experiment was conceived and recorded in 1 week mostly as a result of improv jamming, and Phish could SURELY NEVER put out an album like LTE.]
B00005NWRS|5.0|It has been said by Adams, himself, that he intended to make a sort-of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" with his newest release \\"Gold.\\" He may have felt he was working on a large canvas, and indeed he does with his 16- song, 70+ minute album, but what he created was an intimate story. <br />In \\"Heartbreaker\\" (as well as parts of the magical \\"Pneumonia\\"), Ryan tells the listener of lonely places in the real world and compares them to similar lonely places of the heart. \\"Gold\\", as its title indicates, is a departure from the sadder \\"Heartbreaker.\\" That is not to say, that Ryan forgoes heart-wrenching ballads, \\"When Stars go Blue\\", \\"Sylvia Plath\\", and \\"Wild Flowers\\" are empathetic beauties. Interspersed are great rockin' diddies about the East Coast (\\"New York, New York\\"), girlfriends \\"Firecracker\\"), and even a Stones ramblin' rocker, \\"Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues\\". My favorite is a James Brownish, gospel tinged soul number called \\"Touch, Feel, &amp; Lose\\". All in all, critics' allusions to Dylan may not be completely unfounded; Dylan's seminal \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is an epic detailing rises and falls of people over the course of years, while \\"Gold\\" writes beautiful poetry about moments, sometimes fleeting and meaningless, but never forgotten.
0060934719|1.0|I'm sorry but I fail to see what these five star reviews are about. The book is boring with prose to drive you up the wall.<br />With a heroic effort - hoping that things will get better - I fought my way until about the third of the book. That was the point where I give up.
0345404475|5.0|This book is simply superb. It has meaning and substance, but at the same time provides the reader with action and excitement. You can also read it in two ways - the hillariously funny way or the brooding and dark way. In either case Dick still asks the fundemental questions about reality and whether the reps are being treated right by society. I've read this around seven times, own the directors cut of Bladerunner on video (watched it around five times) and own the game. This is definately one of the most interesting and enduring stories in the whole sphere of Sci-Fi.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|I really don't know what to say about this movie, except that it is the best I've seen in years. Reminicent of Hitchcock, it is unique...I've not seen a movie quite like it. The movie moves backwards, from the end of the story to the beginning, so the object of the viewer is not finding out WHAT happens, but WHY.The basic storyline revolves around Leonard, who has suffered a condition called short term memory loss, or the ability to make new memories. The last real memory he has is of his wife dying, after she was &quot;raped and murdered&quot; in their home. The premise of the story is that the only thing he is living for is revenge;to catch his wife's killer. The actors are fabulous, especially Guy Pearce, who shows that Academy Award acting often goes unnoticed, probably because of lack of publicity for the film.  The movie is definitely worth renting if not BUYING! The DVD, however, leaves some to the imagination. Repeated viewing of the film does leave previous unanswered questions answered, but a cronilogical viewing would be helpful. However, this would take away the beauty of the film, so some director or director/actor commentary would be useful. Regardless, buy the DVD because no matter how many times you watch it, you will almost always find something you have missed before. Much to the director's delight, I presume.
0743216458|4.0|I found this book really great.  It gave me a real feeling of how WWII was and I learned more about the war than I would in history class.  A thing that would make this book better is if Ambrose got more into the characters emotions.  There were many characters in this book, but if he could just get more into Winters's, or Nixon's, or Malarkey's feelings, this would be an awesome book.  That's why I have to say the mini-series based on these men of Easy is in ways better than the book.  It really digs deep into all the guys's emotions.  But the book is better with actually telling the story of these men.  It's really worth reading.
B00005N919|4.0|As a child, future director Paul Verhoven's playground was the recently bombed out homes of his neighbors. The absurd violence in the world seems to be reflected in all his movies. I have been involved with four Verhoven films while on the Rob Bottin effects crew. Verhoven made a name for himself directing the edgy and funny &quot;Robocop&quot; originally receiving an X-Rating for the violence in his director's cut. Total Recall and Starship Troopers are other wild examples of his romance with ultra violence. He has always made films that push limits of acceptable social boundaries. Before he directed Showgirls he tested the public's tolerance for a sex with buckets of blood with his thriller Basic Instinct. <BR>   Basic Instinct is a Hitchcock style murder thriller featuring Sharon Stone who is &quot;dressed to kill&quot; as famous author Catherine Trammel (a dead ringer for Kim Novak in Vertigo) A violent icepick murder seems to have been taken right out of her recent novel. Arrogant and cool, she actually invites the police investigators to wonder if she did it in the now legendary interogation scene where she crosses her legs and shoots Detective Curran (Michael Douglas) an eyeful of her unpantied intimate territory. Curran is investigates her a little too closely and compromises his integrity by getting ensnared in her sexual web. Did she do it or is it the copycat work of a crazed fan? Even intimately close to the suspect Detective Curran doesn't really know for sure. <BR>Even though this is the unrated director's cut you won't find some of the most extremely gory footage. Stone shot a scene in the nude where she straddled a realistic torso of a victim  repeatedly plunging the icepick into the chest and face. Splattered with fake blood and feeling in her arm the sensation of the pick piercing this rubbery body, the illusion was all too real. Sharon became nauseous and had to leave the set. Also missing Gus (George Dzunza) takes a nasty icepick in the cheek. Basic Instinct is a stylish and dark film that can be frustrating and uncomfortable as it never quite fully allows you to know all its secrets. But it is intriguing none-the-less.<BR> Personally I was always uneasy with the boundaries Verhoven likes to push but this is a better film than expected. Verhoven has had several unfulfilled dreams to push even harder but so far has been thwarted. For example &quot;Crusade&quot; Another Arnold movie quashed in negotiations &quot;Crusades&quot; had a scene where Scharzenneger is found with his head sticking out of the backside of a donkey's rear end. Verhoven often joked with Rob Bottin about making a film designed to enrage his critics called Jesus 2000. Rob thinks he would have seriously done it if he was given the money. <BR>   Overall if you are a fan of Basic Instinct there is a lot for you on this disc. Two commentaries. One by Verhoven and the other by a feminist author as well as deleted scenes and some behind the scenes featurettes. The novelty plastic case with plastic ice pick was probably a bad idea as the hinges break very easily. Be careful when opening or you will be pretty ticked off.

0060392886|5.0|First of all, I am not a Motley Crue fan and have never been one. I can't even name a song. But of course, being an avid watcher of VH1 and E!, etc. I know the members and some of their &quot;history&quot;.<br />The book sounded interesting so I bought a copy and sat down one night to read. Wow! I really had a difficult time putting it down. These guys are really, really out of their minds!<br />I can't say how impressed I am by their candor. No matter what they did, they are  more than willing to take responsibility for it. They give a whole new meaning to out-of-control.<br />The writing was humorous, witty, engaging, thoughtful and emotional. So emotional at times that it was heart wrenching  when Vince describes the death of his daughter, Skylar. I got so choked up!<br />These guys get so many kudos for being embarassingly honest about their roots, behavior and image. Most stars would never be so willing to call themselves a nerd or an a--hole.<br />Reading about how they came together and reached the peak, then toppled was truly fascinating. So many stories about celebrity interactions are also mixed in, which was great! I always suspected that Pamela was no good. Also enjoyed the chapters from the managers, former managers, etc. Very interesting to get a different version of the same story recounted in others' chapters.<br />I do admit that I learned some new things about the female anatomy which I could have done without but that just adds to the story. This book really is a celebration of  talent and where it can take you if you are willing to give it your all. <br />It is really a shame that these talented guys got sucked in to a decadent lifestyle of booze, drugs and women that it ultimately affected their talent.<br />They can count me as a fan albeit a late one.
B00004R99L|5.0|Ok, heres the thing, throughout the history of this film, people have been looking at it as a child's film. It is, to a point, but it is enjoyed by older more mature viewers who can understand the pure nonsense of the story and characters. The movie has been described as a dream or a psychedelic trip. The author of the book was known to use LSD and mushrooms giving him the insight needed to create such a masterpiece. Alice in Wonderland is funny and great. It is a distinctive film  that should be appreciated far more than it has been in the past.
B00003CWL6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I like the way that it really took you into these people's lives and exposed you to a level of perversion that you don't get to experience from the outside.  I'll admit that the first time I saw this movie I wasn't quite sure what all the fuss was about but the more I watched it the more enamored I was with the whole concept.  It really makes you want to take a look at your own neighborhood and wonder what is going on out there.  Definitely deserving of all the praise.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome.  <br />Tenacious D Rocks!!<br />Take two great comedians (Jack Black and Kyle Gass), throw in some excellent music, and David Grohl from the Foo Fighters, and you get this album.  <br />The 'D' is great rock, with some very funny humor thrown in.<br />Check out ... for a taste of The D.<br />You'll recognize these guys from several movies.
B00003CXA3|5.0|This is one of my favorite films and probably the best cop movie ever made, in my opinion. Finally, the film is available on DVD, and the &quot;Five Star Collection&quot; gives this classic the treatment it deserves.<br />I've heard complaints that the picture is still a bit on the grainy side, but I feel that's the way it was filmed. Director William Friedkin was going for a gritty, almost documentary-style feel for this film, and it's appropriate. It's certainly watchable and of the highest quality ever for this film.<br />The commentary by William Friedkin is very interesting and insightful, particularly to fans of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the times when he would explain exactly what's happening in a particular scene...it seemed a bit condescending. Yes, William, we KNOW there's a drug deal going down. We want the behind-the-scenes stories and that kind of stuff. Still, a very good commentary overall. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider give interesting commentaries as well, but they don't seem to be &quot;scene specific&quot;...just casually relating stories of how they came to be involved in the picture and stuff like that.<br />The extras are fantastic, including deleted scenes with commentary by Friedkin and TWO documentaries, one produced by the BBC that revisits locales and talks with many of those involved. You'll find out basically everything you want to know about the film, and then some.<br />As far as the film itself...if you haven't seen it yet, rent it and see what the fuss is all about. Gene Hackman fully deserved his Best Actor Oscar portraying narcotics detective Popeye Doyle, whose hunch about some thugs in a local night club lead to he and his buddy Cloudy (the marvelous Roy Scheider) tailing them, leading to a transatlantic drug bust of enormous proportions. The film basically laid the blueprint for the buddy cop movie, but it's never been done so well as it is here.
630463949X|5.0|in the comfort of your living room. Hopefully you have a mind blowing Krell with B&amp;W speakers cause this DVD is fabulous. <br />Technically it's probably one of the best DVD's I have ever bought. It was didgitally mastered of course for WIDE SCREEN TV something that I was hoping all DVD's would have by now, and, the sound tracks are crystal clear and will make your speakers earn their living!<br />Although for hard nosed Fleetwood fans the group may have lost a tiny bit of their youthfull edge, I mean I guess were all getting a little older, the gang pounds it out so well that you have to be basically brain dead not to get that tingly feeling as your mind fills with images of times gone by.<br /> <BR>Mick Fleetwood is so hyped in this performance he looks just like a madman recently released at the end of the opening cut, The Chain. Lindsey Buckingham's double picking solo Big Love is perfection in both sight and sound. Stevie Nicks shows us some of the strength left in her voice with the brassy rendition of <BR>Gypsy, and Christine VcVie's voice has not aged one bit in Say you Love me and her solo, last cut of the disc, Songbird..... <BR>The encore consiting of Tusk and Dont stop is mindblowing .....<br />This DVD a perfect example of super groups that are so multi talented that they just don't exist today and the disc is a fab addition to my collection that I know will get very regular play ....<br />BTW ... the DVD includes 22 cuts while the CD version of this concert only has 17 songs and totally exclude five  SUPER tracks <BR>Over my head / Gold Dust Woman / Go Insane / Gypsy and Songbird
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the very first movie I ever saw in the movie theatre--in the early 1980s when I was just 3 or 4 years old.  I remember then going to DisneyWorld, riding on the Snow White ride and buying books and dwarf figures.<br />There's just so much magic to this movie!  It is a true classic that has a lot of sparkle and character.  What imagination it must have taken for the Disney Studio to come up with the Seven Dwarfs...the fun they  must have had with Dopey!  <br />I can hardly wait until I can buy the DVD...I bought the video when it first came out, in October, several years ago.  Oooo...<br />:)
0792839129|5.0|...Dick Van Dyke and Sally Howe are delightful to watch.  The Sherman Brothers have again worked magic with their movie score.  For all you ballet fans out there, you won't recognize Robert Helpman of the Royal Ballet in England.  And I won't tell what part he plays.  You'll have to see for yourselves.
0446608955|5.0|This book more than any other tore my heart in pieces. I cant bring myself to reflect on the parts of the story that touched me so without tears welling up in my eyes and heart. I have read the cynics complain that this is a story  that was a repeat of &quot;Love Story&quot; thirty years ago. That is plain rubbish!  There is no comparison between the two. the stories are far different from one another. In one the girl is a sweet preachers daughter and the other is a young woman with a very foul mouth. Who uses the &quot;F&quot; word in every sentence! the only part of the story that is has a comparison, is the desease that they both are suffering from. Several thousand people get this desease each and every year. Who's to say that only one of those stories can be told? I for one loved A Walk To Remember. Thank you Mr Sparks for your wonderful story of Love.....
0140288503|5.0|This book is very, very good. I bought it on a recommendation from someone I know via the Internet. Not only did this book easily live up to its billing, it far surpassed anything I could have expected. It took me a few days to gobble this thing up, much to my wife's dismay.<br />The story, as we all know, is about the CNN-reported fire fight in Mogadishu, Somalia. The one where several dead men of the US military were dragged through the streets. That's all I remembered about the incident from 1993. When I piced up this book, I learned much, much more.<br />Bowden spared no expense in writing this book. If I didn't know any better, I would have guessed that not only was here there, but he had 5-6 clones of himself running around the Mog taking notes. He interviewed Delta Force team members and Rangers as well as Somalians and even wives of some of the guys lost in battle to piece his story together. When he finished, the story was an exquisite puzzle of what happened that day, or rather, days.<br />This is a great perspective on what happened and it also explores what went wrong and why the foreign policies of the US sometimes don't take everything into account when action is being made. A great dichotomy of roles is exhibited where the UN feeds people and then the US forces, in an effort to take down a certain clan, angers a large majority of the people there who see the US trying to crush an entity that has been with the people for generations and generations.<br />It's a futile policy conversely executed by a thoroughly copetent bunch of men who actually did the fighting. And it is told through the eyes and words of a very good writer. <br />Highly recommended.
B000003S5H|4.0|If you are a fan of this band or just like instrumental/electronic music-you should purchase this CD.
B000000OF6|4.0|Ya know ya gotta have it!  All the best, all the faves, all the chart-toppers, all the sweetest sides from Queen's long reign.  But for the loss of Freddie Mercury, they'd be cranking out more even today. <br />This is a must-have for the die-hard Queen fan, an education for the casual listener and a fabulous introduction to the newcomer. If your exposure to this world-class band is limited to &quot;Wayne's World&quot; and a Mountain Dew ad, you NEED this album!
B00005NWRS|4.0|...probably even a bit better than HEARTBREAKER.  Ryan does need to learn to separate the wheat from the chaff, though.  It's nice that he's giving us all these songs, but, as with HEARTBREAKER, some of the more mediocre tunes would have been better left off of the CD.  But hey, lotsa music for the money, and CD players can be programmed.
0385335482|5.0|Very funny book, filled with British humor. I read it before I read Bridget Jones (which I am halfway through now) There are more simularities then I can count...not sure which book came first. Bridget Jones seems a little less predictable then this, but this book has a fun can't-put-it-down way of storytelling that made me give it 5 stars. <BR>Predictable-but a good, stylish read!
0140288503|5.0|I first read this book when it first came out several years ago. Exceptionally well written; gripping; page-turner.  A true must read (even if you don't think much of military history).  This book reads more like a Tom Clancy novel than a non-fiction account of an &quot;incident&quot; in a far off land.<br />I plan on re-reading this book over the weekend (yes, it reads that fast!) because it has a lot of parallels for what we are about to get into with Afghanistan.  Some underlying themes: 1) Don't underestimate the 'locals' just because they are dirt poor - they are usually well armed and tough fighters, 2)Don't underestimate the hatred the third-world general population feels twoard the U.S., 3)Be patient and give your intelligence gathering operations time to work, 4)If ground troops are involved, be prepared for casualties.
B00003CXWV|3.0|Movie Summary: George Jung moves to California and discovers drugs. He is an ambitious young man and soon takes to selling pot. He quickly builds a large marijuana business and gets rich. This operation gets broken up when George gets busted and sent to prison. He goes to prison with a bachelors degree in pot and leaves with a PHD in cocaine. Once out of prison George hooks up with his former cell mate and starts building an immense cocaine empire.<br />My Opinion: The music in Blow is awesome. It is what stood out the most for me. It adds depth and excitement to the film. I was tapping my foot more than once while watching the movie. The story was engaging while I was watching it, but didn't stay with me after I was done watching it. It fails to make a stand on what it is saying. It shows George's life and leaves the viewer to make any decision. It leans towards showing him as a good guy who just keeps screwing up. I got the feeling that he saw his only mistakes as getting caught. Johnny Depp is excellent as the main character. He is very cool and likable. I have a feeling he makes George look way better than he actually was. I found Pen&eacute;lope Cruz and her character to be very annoying. Her character was suppose to be a reflection of George's mom, but I still found her lacking. Paul Reubens is great as the California drug connection/hair dresser. This should help his career a little. The story and direction are very stylish and smooth. The scenes that were removed help fill in the plot, but they would have slowed things down. Overall I found the movie lacked punch. The music made it good while I was watching it, but I quickly forgot it when it was over.<br />DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 Excellent video quality. Sound: DD 5.1 Extras: This is an Infinifilm edition. This means that it is packed with extras that are accessible while watching the movie. These extras include: Deleted scenes that help fill out the plot, interview with the real George Yung (man is he ugly!), commentary, documentaries, trailers, character outtakes, and production diary. This is a fully packed DVD release.<br />What You Should Do: Rent it. It's a decent story to see once but it doesn't have repeatability. The extras make it a really great DVD release, but I can't see wanted to watch the real George Jung more than once!<br />Related Movies To Check Out: Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Scarface, CasinoYung (man is he ugly!), commentary, documentaries, trailers, character outtakes, and production diary.

B00005KHJR|4.0|Some movies are so one-of-a-kind that critical review seems superfluous.  I mean, how many times do you get to see modern day pagans represented in a good mystery story?  (Actually, the whole thing is a little reminiscent of Green Acres, with Edward Woodward playing the uptight Oliver Douglas role, constantly abused by the druids of Hooterville Island.)<BR> The good news to longtime fans of this movie is that the extended disc seems to have just about everything that was on the unedited version of the film that eventually came out on tape in the States, including Brit Ekland's memorably unabashed dance scene amongst the general mischief and cavorting.  <BR> If you're a midnight movie fan, check this one out.

B000002TQV|5.0|I've always been kind of afraid of Radiohead's music just from listening to reviews and comments about them.  Well a few weeks ago I was going through some really emotional stuff in my life and my best friend handed me this cd...I figured I wouldn't like it but trusted his taste.  WELL-long boring story short...this cd could not have come at a better time.  I have been listening to it non-stop for weeks and am now a big Radiohead fan.  Each song tells a story that you can relate to--it's great for those depressing days but also amazingly great any other time.  Thom's vocals, his songwriting, the production...all is brilliant. If you're looking for a starter RADIOHEAD CD...this is it. It'll help, I promise :-)
B000000H6D|5.0|The first time I heard this cd, I was hooked. I had never heard anything as dark, foreboding and lustful as Bloody Kisses. If you're into the goth scene, then I think you'll love this little gem.The most interesting track has to be their remake of &quot;Summer Breeze&quot;. It definitely has more depth and soul than the original Seals And Crofts version.Another cool track is &quot;Machine Screw&quot;. No description needed here..just listen to it. heheh
B00004OCRN|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is absolutely my favorite of all time, since back to when I was growing up in London hearing my older brother play the &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; LP over &amp; over as I fell asleep. My love of Springsteen only grew when much later I ended up immigrating to the United States ... &amp; it's continued to grow. If I could have only one artist in my CD collection, it would be the Boss. Having said that, I love this CD, which I recently rediscovered after completely forgetting it for several years. I like &quot;Tougher ...&quot; &amp; &quot;Chimes ...&quot; is OK, but it's &quot;Be True&quot; &amp; the acoustic &quot;Born ...&quot; that just make this CD &amp; make it worth the price &amp; worth having even though only four songs. &quot;Be True&quot; is just a great anthem that hasn't got the acclaim it deserves. It rocks. &amp; it's got this great rhythm to it, this quality that sweeps me up &amp; energizes me &amp; lifts my spirit. As for &quot;Born ...&quot; I think this could be my favorite version ... it really brings out the meaning of the song, stripped of all the pomp. This CD is a gem.
0688170528|5.0|I have read many many books, often I have two going at a time.  This is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult.  I found myself caught up emotionally.  I literally cried at times while reading this.  I read at the stop lights, I read at lunch, I read while standing at the stove cooking supper.  This is the most heart wrenching story I have ever read.  It feels like it has to be a true story, because I can't imagine anyone making up a love and sense of oneness that Emily and Chris shared.  For two days I found myself nervous, on edge, and even sometimes sick to my stomach, waiting to know what happened that night, and what the fate of Chris would be.  This is probably the best story I have ever read.  It is without a doubt the most compelling and emotional one.  You must read this, but be prepared to not want to put it down!!
0446310786|5.0|This book is simple, yet complex.  It is one of the best books I have ever read. You need to read this book, whether you are young or old. It is a very important book to read. Also see the movie with Gregory Peck, possibly the best book-to-movie adaptioon ever done.

B00005OAJ1|5.0|The D have finally cut an album, and while it may be a bit more polished than I would have liked, it's still very very good.  The skits are just plain hilarious, and if you 'get' Tenacious D, the music is equally as funny and rocking.  Whats great about the D is they can really play, write music, and JB can sing damn well.  Both Jack and the D are about to get real big, so pick this one up now- comedy and rock from the greatest band on earth.

B00005OAJ1|3.0|This record has been a long-time-coming and now it's here.   This album is really well produced, but I think the Dust Brothers drowned out most of KG's smokin' guitar playing.  Jack's singing is golden, but what happened to \\"Kyle's Fingers be silver\\"?  Too much electric guitar and drums and, well, production IMHO.  Didn't they kick out Sasquatch 'cuz they were a two-man band?  So go buy the record and support the band, but make sure to check out some of their all-acoustic material as well.
0805062971|3.0|I'll try not to dwell too much on the points others have addressed. One thing I am curious about is whether Palahniuk approved of all the changes made for the movie (although given how these things usually work, there are very few changes). Because I found that almost every single adjustment the screenplay had made was an improvement.<br />Palahniuk is, to me, the definition of &quot;potential.&quot; He has very good ideas, but he doesn't yet have the experience or polish as a writer to pull them off. <br />For instance, this novel has a very intriguing twist at the core of its plot. But reading the novel, it was clear that Palahniuk hadn't yet mastered the skill of building up false leads or suspense for this surprise. Many times, it read as though he seemed to feel that his plot twist was too obvious to bother hiding. Which is sad, because it wasn't, and the movie showed how he could have more effectively built up suspense and driven home the climax with a punch.<br />Also, I agree with those who say that Marla is more developed here. And the goings-on with Project Mayhem are more detailed, although I don't think that there's enough in the novel that  sheds more light upon it; there's just more about it.<br />In addition, while Norton's narration in the movie brings us in tight with the protagonist, Paladniuk keeps too much distance. I wanted to be immersed even more in this fictional world; more detail, more intensity, and a slower pace would have helped immensely. As it is, at times it reads as though Paladniuk is in a hurry to get a good novel over with. <br />Finally, the ending here feels awkward and tacked-on. Had he wanted to keep this ending, he could have taken the time to explore its possibilities more. I strongly disagree with the idea that the movie had a more upbeat ending, though. If you pay attention to the implications of the end of the movie, its ending was much bleaker than the novel's. <br />Despite its shortcomings, I would recommend this novel, especially if you liked the movie, or are generally intrigued by writers trying something different. I'm just hoping that next time, Palahniuk harnesses that potential more.
0767817664|4.0|Even though it was released back in the 80's, Fright Night remains a classic and bone-chilling vampire movie with riveting action sequences that will leave you breathless.<br />While this movie does have a certain cheesiness factor to it, that's what makes it so appealing.  If you read the pamphlet that comes along with the DVD, it mentions that the director's purpose for this movie was to mix the Boy That Cried Wolf formula with the classic vampire mythology.<br />The story itself is very simple.  Charlie, played by William Ragsdale, notices that his new neighbor's aren't quit as normal as they seem.  He begins to see very mysterious happenings involved with them, and when he reports them, nobody seems to believe him.  Soon, the neighbors know that Charlie knows their secret, and Charlie finds himself running to save his own life as well as a few others.<br />Fright Night has a very talented cast, and it's inch above the the typical vampire movie.
0783243499|5.0|I had never heard off this movie or Bale until a friend recommended it as a weekend rental...well, after seeing it, i was awed both by the movie and Bale. Bale literally became Bateman..it's rare to see such fine acting and he is so handsome as well...moreover, the direction was great, the dialogue enteraining and supporting character good as well...moreover, the movie had a powerful message. and to think that the lightweight DeCaprio was originally picked to be Bateman makes be quiver...he doesn't have the Bale drop-dead gorgeous look or the fine acting ability..even if you find the film or book offensive, see it for Bale
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Tenacious D is a very funny CD. I bought it today and I've listened to it 5 times already. If you need a good laugh get this CD, it's worth your money. If you like the Bloodhound Gang, Presidents of the United States of America, or James Kochalka then you'll enjoy this CD. Everyone needs Tenacious D in their CD collection. So go out and buy this sucka today.
B000002H6C|4.0|This album is their last good album I think.<BR>&quot;ONE&quot; and &quot;To live to die&quot; is true classics but the rest is to long and doesn't reach up to the metallica standard.<BR>Buy this and their older albums and the rest  you can forget.
6300247376|5.0|I just saw this movie yesterday on a cable channel.  I had never seen it before, or had I heard of it.  After seeing it I can hardly believe this flick isn't much more popular than it is.  <br />I think it's one of the best &quot;mountain man&quot; type movies around, as well as action packed.  I thought is fairly realistic and didn't contain all that typical B.S. that is usually put in movies like this.   <br />I feel if you liked &quot;First Blood,&quot; &quot;Jeremiah Johnson,&quot; &quot;Abducted,&quot; then you should really love this.  I find it odd that some of Bronson's best films aren't as popular, such as \\"Hard Times, and \\"The Mechanic.\\"<br />Last but not least I love Lee Marvin too, he was good in this.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is one of the best punk cds i have heard in a long time.  All the songs on this cd are great.  These are my favorite songs:<br />Aliens Exist - great song with a great sound i love the concept!<br />Adams song -  this is the 3rd single on this cd-its my favorite song on the entire cd; it shows emotion and is pretty much about the thoughts of a guy thats gonna commit suicide-best song!<br />Dynestry Gary (or something like that)- This is the funniest song on the cd-\\"... this place, i lost the war, i hate you all, your moms a ...!!\\" it is also the most upbeat song on the cd i think its great<br />Overall, i think that this is one of the best punk cds out there, and i think u should buy it
B00005N9CV|5.0|Good looking singer, good sounding singer, sexy on both counts, musically fine singing, what more could you ask about a CD?  This singer is the best to come along in many years, and not since the days of June Christy and the like, have we heard jazz sung this way.  This album is simply the best I have heard in a long while, and being a male, the songs make your toes curl.  Will be buying all her stuff, and listening, and dreaming.
B000003BF4|5.0|Back in the days when recording an album meant assembling ten or fifteen blistering tracks, rather than today's methods of two good singles and twelve mindless fillers, the Stones picked their best live recordings off the 1969 tour and gave us this.<BR>The slide guitar in Love's in Vain alone is worth the price of the CD. Midnight Rambler should come with a health warning not to listen to it while driving. Sympathy for the Devil, Street Fighting Man, Jumping Jack Flash, the Stones whole early catalogue is here, played hard and hot and simply fantastic.
B000000WA4|5.0|I bought &quot;Melon Collie And The Infinite Sadness&quot; the day it came out in 1995 and I remember thinking this was the album of my life.  Of course in the next 6 years I found many other albums I felt the same about, but this one is defiently at the top of my list.  Billy Corgan's sad and depressing vocals immerse you in both discs, which are cleverly titled &quot;Dawn to dusk&quot; (Disc 1) and &quot;Twilight to starlight&quot; (Disc 2).  Very rarely does an album come along like this that has every song being different from the next, plus it is a double disc which makes it a real gem.  My personal favorite songs include &quot;Mellon collie and the infinite sadness&quot;, &quot;Tonight, tonight&quot;, &quot;Bullet with butterfly wings&quot;, &quot;Thirty three&quot;, &quot;In the arms of sleep&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Tales of a scortched earth&quot;, &quot;By starlight&quot;,  this album is absolute genius from the mid 1990's.
B00005LMBK|4.0|this is a great cd, with a great sound-Beware though, that not all songs sound anywhere near &quot;Clint eastwood&quot; becuz that singer (Del the Funky Homosapien) only appears on one more track, &quot;rock the house&quot; anyway, this cd has somew great songs, like double bass or punk. On double bass, though you might wanna listen past the first couple of minutes to see what the song is really like, its not all soft and hard to understand, it does get some major bass in on the end.<BR>in the end, this is a great cd, but only if you like a variety of music (listen to 19-200 to see what im talkin about) and really like some strange sounds
B000050IE6|5.0|At first thought, Mayhem or Immolation may come to the minds of most people when thinkingof death metal. This should not be so. For the past ten years in Sweden, Opeth has been releasing simply the best quality death metal hands down. No other band can make their claim in comparing to the masterful guitar layout, exceptional vocal melodies and frightening growls, all interwoven<BR>seamlessly into each song written by this Swedish band. Still Life is no exception either. Every song carries with it an inherant uniqueness that never faulters and always pleases the listener. Opeth's fourth masterpiece is yet another reason why Opeth remains the metal band all others look up to and fall short of.
B00005NKCM|5.0|If you're reading this you don't need to be convinced as to the quality and worth of this series.  However, you do need to be told that both the picture and sound quality of this new DVD release are EXCELLENT, and a marked improvement over both the previous A&amp;E video release and syndication copies which have aired on various PBS stations over the years.  While a previous review printed here mentions queer &quot;green tints&quot; and audio problems, NOTHING of the sort was in evidence in the copy I viewed. Quite simply, a beautiful job was done in remastering the original video elements for this DVD presentation, and you're likely to see and hear many details that have previously gone unnoticed. Don't hesitate to purchase this fine set for a moment, and let's hope that the remaining four seasons will follow shortly. Ruby would be proud!
B000006U44|4.0|My God, what is this? Those were my words, year ago, the first time I heard Kate Bush singing Wuthering Heights. Now, coming back and listening to it again, the same words come to mind. Even when you're prepared for it, the unholy glissade up to the opening words sets the hair on your neck standing to attention. Some of this CD is hopelessly self-indulgent stuff but Ms Bush was breaking new ground, combining music with theatre. Her videos are some of the most embarrassing short films you are likely to see unless you like to film yourself in uncompromising situations, but it is doubtful that Ms Bush has many regrets. For a while there she was the biggest thing there was and her records sold in their millions. In it's own way this one is a classic. I don't think I could listen to the whole thing but a track here and there still sounds different and exciting.
6300267997|5.0|Two people from different spectrums of the music industry. A Rock and Roller at the end of his career and trying to hang on falls in love with and helps an up and coming Pop Star Diva, who is willing to do anything for the man that she loves. Romantic.<br />Yes, a remake. This was based on a story done in two other versions, however the story line varies in each (Star is Born with Frederic March and Janet Gaynor; the other featuring Judy Garland and James Mason. But, how great that in a wonderful, but CRAZY time of the 70's that someone should remake this story in the view of the music industry (which was changing in all direction), instead of the movie industy as it had been in the past. Kris Kristofferson portraits Norman Main as character close to his own career and life. Barbra Streisand is fantastic with her wonderfully amazing voice that moves an suprises you in so many ways in her portrail of Ester.  Both do a wonderful job.  Barbra's waredrobe from her closet is fantastic. Only, if I had her closet.<br />I remember the first time I saw the movie; that New Years Eve so many years ago. Still enjoying it to this day. A wonderful time the 70's.
0440219078|5.0|Some books seem to focus on just delivering the point the author is trying to make and getting it over with as quickly as possible, but the author of The Giver spends the entire book illustrating her point, and really making a wonderful little novel out of it. I enjoyed the way that Jonas interacted with his parents, and the way that Lois Lowry depicted a socitey without any shared memories. I really think that The Giver is a wonderful balance of great storytelling wrapped around a thought-provoking premise, that will captivate all readers for many years to come.
B00005NWRS|3.0|Ryan Adams seems to be releasing a record every couple months.  He might consider slowing down and weeding out his weaker material before releasing anything else.  While Gold isn't a terrible record, it just doesn't produce many memorable moments.  By the time the end of the record comes, what you once thought was a good song has been replicated 3 more times and you can't remember which version you liked more.  Some of the songs on the album are terrible.  The 9 minute &quot;Nobody Girl&quot; just keeps wandering back and forth going nowhere.  Also the psuedo soul of &quot;Touch, Feel &amp; Loose&quot; feels contrived and the soulless drums just accentuate the unnaturalness of the song.
0452270073|5.0|Barker explores the inner dimensions of World War I -- its effects on soldiers and those who care for them, both physically, psychologically and emotionally, in all senses of the word &quot;care.&quot;  In these times (fall 2001) when the US is heading towards who-knows-what kinds of upheavals, this sensitive portrait of what was supposed to be &quot;the war to end all wars&quot; is an important addition to our understanding.
B000001IPL|5.0|A killer CD. If you thought Americana was good, than you will be shocked to find out that there is a better Offspring CD. You have to get it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Holy Grail is one of the first DVD's I bought. It had no specials, so when I saw this I thought: Aha, they've released it again, but now with commentary, documentaries etc. I must buy it again (that's how good this movie is) for these extras.<BR>But no, there are no extras as far as I can see. So I haven't bought it. Don't let this stop you: you will still be getting one heck of a movie.<BR>Holy Grail with the extras they put on Life of Brian (also get this one while you're at it), would be worth 6 stars (as is Life of Brian).<br />Robert
B00005NWM3|5.0|After listening to this album once, i can't say i was over impressed, probably the greatness of how you remind me overlooked the rest of the album and made it seem quite plain.  four hours later the albums is still going strong on repeat and keeps geting better.<BR>             Each song has its own sound and the pace keeps up with the powerful and energetic sound and theres the voice too match it.<BR>             Labelled as post-grunge or as some are saying alt/nu-grunge, this is impressive and unlike some of the latest 'grunge' efforts all tryin to copy eddie vedder, this sets standards for new grunge bands and also adds some originality to the scene. <BR>         Best five songs have to be how you remind me, [radio friendly, quality and addictive describe this]<BR>        Never again [great vocals, wicked riffs, superb]<BR>        Just For [ Another wicked riff , reminds me of teen spirit abit and the vocals seem a bit staind'ish]<BR>         Hollywood [ some neat vocal effects add to another great song]<BR>        Good Times Gone [ possibly the most balladish song on the album and also the longest, ends the album on a very high note.]<BR>overall some people may say this album is the same because all the songs are in your face rock, no extra fast or slow songs or very heavy stuff..........but the quality is here without a doubt and thats why a high 5 is on order!<br />cya! gonna check out their first album 'state'
B00005OAJ1|5.0|The D are single-handedly the greatest rock ever.  Period.  I had this CD the hour it came out, and have not stopped listening to it.  Everything on it rocks.  Buy it or miss out on the best album of the year.
B0000033P2|4.0|This album is somewhat iffy as to the point were it doesnt have too much direction to it.  but the song trilogy itself is one of the most beautiful complex songs to ever grace my ears. it makes up for the rest of the albums wandering direction with its neo-classical sound. Pure genius is the only real way to describe it
1587990717|1.0|The book is disappointing because of the authors need to prove how intelligent he is compared to the rest of us mental pigmies. Although taleb infers thaty he has a small ego in trading, it seems that in everything else in life he suffers from a massive one (ego). there are some interesting facets in the book ,but these are clouded by the disappintments.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Whoa mama mia! I couldn't believe I was given an advance preview of this fine DVD set (ah, it pays to have mob connections, huh?) And it's safe to say that this collection is truly a must-have if ever there was one. This one has everything we could hope for and should be awarded a prize under the category: NOW THIS IS HOW YOU PACKAGE A DVD! <BR>What hasn't already been said about Godfather 1 and 2 that hasn't already been said. The words \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"brilliant\\" are thrown around too easily but do apply here most definitely. The third part, mama mia, what the hell is this??? Sofia Coppola's acting makes me want to sleep with a horse's head. Ah, but Al Pacino rules and he rules big time in all three movies. And how about that Brando...wondeful!<BR>So pick this one up, it'll be worth the money....I promise you.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I only own 3 Dylan albums, but this is a great piece of work from start to finish.
0684857219|4.0|First off I loved the photos of Arnold and the other body builders with the exception of the over hyped massive steroid popping folks from the late 80's and 90's. Good diagrams and motivation from the king of bodybuilding Arnold. However, more information needed for the natural non-steroid fitness person is sorely needed. Also the workouts are not realistic except for steroid users and the very elite. I do half of what he recommends and thats tough enough to work the muscle. Overall a worthy effort and definitely worth it just for the super cool photos of how to do the exercises and also on the history of the bodybuilding sport.
0783225857|5.0|The art of story telling is rare in film today.  Without a car case or a gun battle, what is the point of making a movie?  But on a rare occasion a timeless film is made that sets the mark of excellence.  To Kill A Mockingbird is one of those films.<br />Filmed in Black and White, although color was available then, the film captures the sleepy town of Macomb where tree lined dirt roads prevail, neighbors know one another and check in on each other, and the only thing a kid has to entertain himself is the endless miles of fields and a vivid imagination.<br />The task of transforming the Harper Lee novel into film is not easy.  How does a writer take a Pulitzer Prize novel and boil it down to a slick 120 minute story.  With just a few exceptions the whole of this novel is kept and is well presented in the film.  <br />Gregory Peck in the lead role of Atticus Finch was key.  But Peck presence is only the glue that holds the film together.  The true triumph of this film is in the casting of Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as the lead characters of  Scout and Jem.  The selection of two unknowns from Birmingham, Alabama made this film.  The naivt'e of the children is apparent and beliveable and gives the film the sense of innocense lost as Jem and Scout learn that the world is not a fair place.<br />This film also marks some early performance of Alice Ghostly and Aunt Stephanie the aunt of Del Harris who is based on the real life childhood of Truman Capote and the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley.  <br />This film is a treat. Take time to read the book and then watch the movie.
B00005MP58|3.0|I am surprised that this important work is presented with no hint of captions or subtitles.  How hard can it be when creating the work for publication to include this worthwhile device, i.e. the track for captions?
0786915749|5.0|After I read this book, I immiediately ansked my dad for the next one, and thus ended up reading the whole series. The main characters, Tanis Half-elven, Goldmoon, Laurana, Tasselhoff Burrfoot, Riverwind, Kitiara, Flint Fireforge,Sturm Brightblade, Caramon and Raistlin Majere, and other unforgettable characters, go on wonderful but haunting adventures together. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes reading big advanced books.  People who read little books like RL Stine and others that small should try this, but this series is for the big readers.  Big books for big readers.
0807288470|5.0|I purchased the audiobook &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; by Lemony Snicket just recently and have already listened to it twice.  It is wonderful.  I have always been a big fan of Tim Curry and his renditions of Count Olaf and the hacking Mr. Poe are right on target.  This is one audiobook worth listening to again, and again, and again.....
B000000WJZ|5.0|Songs like &quot; Soma &quot; and &quot; Today &quot; are what rock music is all<BR>about. Astounding guitars,throbbing bass lines , pounding drums <BR>and of course the inimitable voice of Billy Corgan.<BR>A timeless classic- a brilliant blend of hard ,headbanging music <BR>and soft melodies that can move you to tears.
B00005NB0H|5.0|It's about time!  When the 1995 remastered Live @ Leeds came out, it only made me wish for the whole show.  While 'Amazing Journey/Sparks' &amp; 'See Me/Listening To You' have already been released, there is no substitute for the whole 'Tommy' performance.  These renditions of Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard, I'm Free, etc. border on definitive.  In fact every song, especially on disc 1, destroys the studio versions. Any aspiring drummers out there could learn a lesson or two from the great Keith Moon, who was on fire this Valentine's night!  This has not left my cd player since I bought it.  Absolutely essential addition to any self-respecting rock fan's collection.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Something told me to cop this album as soon as possible.  Maybe it was High Fidelity.  Maybe it was the \\"D\\"'s appearance at the MTV music video awards.  Jack Black's cockiness is alluring, to say the least.  Whatever the reason was, I was compelled to pawn my Movado watch to compensate for being broke, as the release date arrived.  I made my way to the local record store, to purchase Tenacious D, and I do not regret it.<BR>The disc starts with off with \\"Kielbasa\\", chock full of racy lyrics such as, \\"all I can think of/ is dianetics/ your buttcheeks is warm\\".  And the disc's content doesn't let up an inch.  \\"Tribute\\", a song about the greatest song in the world, \\"... her Gently\\" a hilariously raunchy ode to soft love-making, \\"Rock your Socks\\" in which singer Jack Black details the dues that his band has paid, such as \\"waking up at the crack of noon\\", keep your head spinning until the album's closer, \\"City Hall\\" is a tale in which Black and Partner Kyle Gass overthrow city hall and govern the land afterwards until they turn on each other by poisoning one another's wine.  <BR>The record is drop-dead hilarious, and yet, this doesn't compromise the purity of the music.  The band is versatile, creative and original, and this bleeds through every track.  Assistance from Dave Grohl and production from the Dust Brothers helps as well.  Something urged me to purchase this opus (my amazing music sensibility?  most likely), and it was a wise move.  Hopefully this review will do the same for you.
B000003S0I|5.0|Different moods through different pieces: beginning with the peacefull kalimba, violin and growing bells, passing through some songs, and reaching the heavy sound (but compositively complex) in the end. If progressive music looks for something different of what we're bored of, this is probably the most  progressive album in history. Sound experiments are not absent, but submitted to a &quot;decorative&quot; perspective. These five star-musicians have search and found with extreme effort and quality something entirely new (which they'll abandone for a new search in their next extraordinary issue: Starless and Bible Black); each one develops in his own field new resources to construct something unique which couldn't either be imited later. I strongly recommend you to get this album if music is so important in your life to deserve it. Cheers!
B00004Z400|5.0|Few artists have the ability to do what they want and gain acceptance from fans or at least be successful with that album. Most bands change their sound and try something new which is met with poor acceptance(Def Leppard's Slang and Metallica's Load.) While other bands do the same thing every single album with no change which sells lots of copies(every Blink-182, Limp Bizkit, and every pop band out there.) But Deftones manages to combine a more melodic type album with some tracks than can still rock.<br />Back To School: 10/10  - This is the best opener for a CD I've ever seen. Catchy chorus and great mosh song. Awesome video as well.<br />Feiticeira: 8/10 - This is a good song. Sounds like something off Adrenaline(that's a HUGE compliment. That album rules!) Love the ending part at the end with the really low voice.<br />Digital Bath: 15/10 - Sheer words cannot do justice to this song. Cryptic verses, big choruses, Chino's singing, the water and subtleness of the interlude is all in this one amazing song. Chino plays guitar on this one. Favourite song on album.<br />Elite: 10/10 - One of heaviest songs they've done. Songs like 7 Words and a lot of songs off Around The Fur have Chino screaming, singing, screaming, singing. This song is all screaming. Very good mosh song. Some have said if it was shorter, it would've been a lot better. I don't think so. Over 4 minutes, it's still energetic.<br />Rx Queen: 8/10 - Another with Chino on guitar. A love song in a way. Drums beat, some electronics noises but still works good.<br />Street Carp: 8/10 - Shortest track on the album. I like how he forgets his address. Standard track from them but still kicks.<br />Teenager: 11/10 - This one totally caught me off guard. Different territory but works in really REALLY good ways. More soft singing from Chino. <br />Knife Party: 10/10 - This is a really good song. Good chorus and around 3:00 starts like a chant mixed with a woman screaming throughout the rest of the song. Would makea cool video.<br />Korea: 8/10 - Good song. Nothing much we haven't heard before but it's good. Classic Deftones.<br />Passenger: 15/10 - Now this is one badass song. If you didn't know, it features Maynard James Keenan of Tool and both vocalists are the highlight on the one. Eerie in a way. Nice piano sounding harmonics at the end.<br />Change(In The House Of Flies): 13/10 - If you haven't heard this song...where were you for the past year? in my opinion, good choice for a single. Showcasing a more melodic turn this time. Metaphorical lyrics.  Very very good song. The 3rd with Chino on the guitar.<br />Pink Maggit: 11/10 Continuing with Fireal-Fist and MX-Damone, is another long closer. The last one featuring Chino playing guitar. Features a slower Back To School chorus and some guitar playing for the rest of it. Closes with heartbeat.<br />*The Boys Republic: 9/10 - Available on the Limited Edition ones. Shoulda been a secret song like Fist or Damone. Love that main riff. Sounds like Korea or something off Adrenaline.<br />So there you have it. Get this album and crank it up cause this is a big album start to finish.
B0000017CA|1.0|...I think the vocals kill the music. The music is soooo good!It is some of the best metal i have ever heard, and then it sounds like the singer from Creed grabbed the mic and started singing over metal guitar and double bass drums. I personally dont like the combination of clean singing vocals with deathmetal music,I need growling. I think Growly vocals and deathmetal music are like peanut butter and jelly and this album is like peanut butter and mustard. The vocals and music just dont mesh together. If i could erase the vocals and listen to only the music i would rate this album 10 stars!
B00000IIXH|4.0|I'm a relatively new convert to the Bruce Springsteen crazy fan club, but man -- once you start listening to this guy and his fantastic bands it's very hard to stop. You get drawn in and now I absolutely love his stuff. I bought this album early in my obsession, because I wasn't ready to spend all the money on the Tracks album. Now I figure that I'll probably end up buying that too... The song Janey Don't You Lose Heart is AMAZING. I could listen to it over and over again. I recommend this album for beginning Springsteen fans (along with the Greatest Hits album, although some die-hard fans might criticize me for that). But in my opinion, the Live 1975-1985 album is a very good collection of well-known and more rare Springsteen stuff. So as you become more obsessed with him (as I can imagine you probably will) you can buy the Live album. Enjoy!
B000051Y0G|5.0|I first bought the album when it first came out, I loved it. And when we eventually bought a cd player, I bought it on cd. And now I have replaced that cd with this newly remastered edition, mainly because of the three live bonus tracks. And I am not disappointed. The sound quality is great, and the whole album sounds as fresh today as it did then. Cyndi's vocals are infectious, even down to her &quot;Betty Boop&quot; take-off on the 1929 snippet of &quot;He's so Unusual&quot;. All lyrics are included in the booklet, as well as some photos and an essay on Cyndi.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I bought this cd but i havn't recieved it yet i know that it is going to ROCK! WHEN I GET IT so yeah i think that this babys gona go at least gold so hey Jamie check it out bessie mal yeah rick aytay kory jake whats up!!
0316920045|5.0|This is one of the few books of which I think all the reviews from one to five stars are all true. This is because this immense work fluctuates so much, sometimes it is really sharp, funny, brilliant, but all in all I still think it should have been shorter, because there is a lot of boredom in it too. There are too many pages used to make his point about the crazy plastic entertainment America of now and the future. I still give it 5 stars because frequently I read some of the best and funny bits of sharply depicted writing ever put on paper, much better to my opinion than Pynchon, and that is just something you very seldom find.

B000020617|3.0|good all around. waiting to hear new release on 9 - 30 - 01
B00003CXP1|5.0|I've seldom seen a movie that is more faithful to its source material than Requiem for a Dream.  The performances are marvelous throughout; it is a crime that Ellen Burstyn did not receive best actress for her performance, but Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are all great, as well.  The slippery slope to addiction has rarely been portrayed so honestly.  I have heard some complaints that the movie has no subtlety, but really, that is a reflection of the addict - there is nothing subtle about living for the next fix.  That such people exist is no exaggeration - unfortunately, I have met a few myself, otherwise wonderful people who have lost themselves in the dream world of narcotics.  How quickly that dream turns nightmarish! - which is, I think, rather the point of this fine piece of work.  Don't miss the novel if you like the movie - it is extremely well written, and just as powerful, if not more so.  Recommended for all but the squeamish.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie was extremely good. When we watched it I was expecting the usua; blahzay blah, but was I ever wrong. The concept of the movie was different. It starts from the end and goes to the beginning. It'll keep you gripped to you seat saying, &quot;Oh  my God.&quot; I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but believe me it's well worth the buy.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I always enjoyed watching Logan's Run on late night TV.  The story is excellent, about a utopia where you can have everything - save for your thirtieth birthday.  I could watch the film 50 times and not get bored with it.  Logan's Run is even better on DVD in anamorphic widescreen.  The picture can be soft at times, but looks excellent for a 70's film.  The commentary by the director and Michael York is insightful.  This movie is perhaps my favorite guilty pleasure.
B00005NWRS|5.0|this album is all i hoped it would be and more! GOLD boasts sixteen truly great tunes (21 counting the limited edition &quot;side 4&quot; disc) and plays well over an hour without overstaying its welcome. <BR>&quot;new york, new york&quot; is the most obviously likable track, but GOLD is full of gems, including the steady rocker &quot;enemy fire&quot;, the sweetly melancholic piano and strings number &quot;goodnight, hollywood blvd&quot;, and &quot;tina toledo...&quot; which plays like a long-lost rolling stones staple.<BR>with this sophomore solo effort, ryan adams continues to showcase his lyrical talent and luckily, all of GOLD's lyrics are printed in the accompanying booklet.  <BR>i can see this album setting up permanent camp in my disc player. it honestly gets better with every listen. five stars!!
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Already a fan? buy it. click &quot;start&quot; then &quot;shutdown&quot; proceed to your vehicle of choice, pick-up a treat for yourself at the local gas 'n go, and buy it. You have already received sublimal instructions via uhf and microwave transmissions during broadcasts of the D that specifically programmed you to like it. So you can't go wrong holmes! You have to buy it or on the 6th Sunday of the 6th month after the 6th summer equinox you'll explode! <BR>Not down with the D yet? You'll probably like it. It rocks hard, is funny, and has &quot;donkey crap&quot; backwards embedded within its sweet plastic coating. Most cd's only contain about 10% rocking and 10% rolling. That's only about 2 or 3 songs on a 10-12 song album. Well, this album has 21 songs, so logic dictates that that number has nearly DOUBLED! That's right, DOUBLE the rocking and it's only on ONE disc. That's technology for you. If only for it's dazzling display of micro-engineering this album is a winner.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Unfortunately, I've never been lucky enough to catch the D live, but I did see all of the HBO shows they did.  I thought Jack and Kyle were hilarious, so when I heard about this CD, I knew I had to get it.  After a couple listens, I know I'm glad I did.  The disc includes comedy bits, new versions of songs I heard on the shows (Tribute, Lee, Double Team, Karate, Explosivo), and great new (though they've probably played them in concert) songs. Wonderboy and Rock your Socks were both immediate standouts.  I'm also pretty sure that [edited] her Gently is the dirtiest ballad of all time.  (Oh yeah, and there's the added bonus that Friendship Test was written by Mr. Show co-creator Bob Odenkirk).  So if you're a fan of the D, pick this one up.  If you aren't, but like great comedy (and aren't squeamish about \\"explicit lyrics\\") you should give it a shot.
B000002AVF|5.0|Is Mariah Carey an underdog? She has millions of dollars, looks great and sings pretty well, so she can't be much of an underdog... To each his own I guess... If you give Mariah a chance, you might be surprised by her intelligence. For example, \\"Daydream\\" starts off with \\"Fantasy,\\" a fun little pop song that rips off the Tom-Tom Club's \\"Genius of Love\\"... \\"Fantasy\\" is Mariah showing the fun, inner bubble gum pop child in us all. This theme is also in \\"Underneath the Stars\\" and \\"Always Be My Baby\\" which are two excellent pop nuggets that should have elevated Mariah to a higher status. \\"One Sweet Day\\" is OK, but it's derivative of other syrupy ballads that it deflates in its own pretense. \\"Forever\\" and \\"Meltaway\\" are better and exhibit Mariah's emotive power: she can be sexy, frightening and sad at the same time. \\"Forever\\" also sounds like it could have been sung by a girl group in the 60s. Buy this album. You might think of...Carey in a different light.
0790749815|4.0|Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who gets mixed up in espionage when he is mistaken for a secret agent named George Kaplan.  He meets up with the beautiful and mysterious Eva Marie Saint and the two embark on a dangerous game of cat and mouse that culminates in a chase across Mount Rushmore.  <br />This is a suave and intelligently scripted entertainment, although it is quite contrived at times.  After all, could anyone really  cradle a dying man and pluck the knife out of his body by accident the way Grant does at the UN?  And, handsome though he may be, Grant seemed a little old for a hottie like Eva Marie Saint to be throwing herself at him without an ulterior motive.  It seemed odd to me that he never appeared to question that her attraction to him was spontaneous and genuine.  Maybe I'm nit-picking.  James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains!
6305212112|5.0|First of all, I loved this movie when it was in the theatre!  Great characters, great plot, wonderful writing.  Not as good as the novel, but quite good nonetheless.  As for the missing scenes that were added to this DVD, let's put it this way--the question about the &quot;real&quot; relationship Idgie and Ruth is cleared up entirely.  And I mean cleared up.  Very hot stuff.  I can understand why it wasn't released this way in the theatre.  These missing scenes don't so much add to the story plot-wise, but they are worth a look.  Trust me.
B0000025RI|5.0|I was as crazed about this album as any kid could be in 1984.  I loved it and played my vinyl copy over and over and over.  I wanted nothing more, as 4th grader, than to be Michael Jackson.  Looking back, that is a very scary thought of course.  These days Michael's music (the forthcoming Invincible seems to be anything but) isn't what it was.  Thriller (and Off the Wall to an extent) were the height of his musical genius.  Videos and dance moves aside, which are part and parcel of the man I realize, this CD, is pure magic.  The music is one of the best pop albums of all time.  Besides knowing every words to almost every track, you will just smile.  The album works for more than nostaglia though--(for example, Lionel Richie's Can't Slow Down, my #2 album at the time, sounds, well, not so good these days).  Michael's work is timeless.  And yeah, I love that duet with Paul McCartney--The Girl is Mine.  The album is sublime and is getting almost as many turns today as back in '84.  I no longer want to be Wacko Jacko, but still love what his music brings to my heart and my dancing feet.
B00005QB42|5.0|This music is for everyone interested in sacred chant. If you've not experienced yogic chanting this is a great CD to start with,<BR>very assesable. Deva's voice is lovely, each track, or song, is soothing, easy to sing along with, and you come to the last song feeling brighter,and happier. The background music is light, perfect for allowing Deva's beautiful voice and haunting chants to hold center stage. You will want to share this heart healing music with loved ones, it's the best selling CD in my Yoga shop! Her second CD, Love is Space is also highly recommended
B00005J6UP|5.0|i grew up on this film among others. it's great to see it out on DVD finally.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Not a Pearl of a movie.  Very uninteresting.  The action bombing scenes use a lot of gasoline, but little else.  Go get &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;  and see the real thing.
B00000ILDE|5.0|this is james cameron's second best film, next to the terminator (not T2). and the extra 17 minutes are excellent and add a great amount of understanding to the story, especially as to why ripley is so fond of newt, having not had a chance to see her own daughter grow up, she now has a chance with newt. i think that executives should stay out of movie making processes and let the directors, who know what they wanna see, do the work of art they are so talented at doing.
B000056VPD|4.0|I really enjoyed this concert as I am a Benson fan! My only disappointment was with Benson singing his rendishions of &quot;Oldies But Goodies&quot; at the beginning with an orchestra and not concentrating on his own music, which is what his fans purchased this DVD for. But once he began playing with his own group and played his own selections, I felt that I received my money's worth!!! I would still recommend this, but I fast foward the first three songs!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I like this CD much, it is the tops.  I like linkin park they is good people, i like them alot because they are the tops.  They are my most favoritest group in the wolrd because they are the tops.  They are the goodest because they can play instruments and sing and rap and sing.  They also can sing which is always important with a ska band such as these fellars.  Pick this bad boy up for a smashing pumpkin pie of an album.
B000059Z8J|5.0|A wonderful restoration of Superman with never before seen superior restored pristine picture and remixed sound that truly leave all previous released version's for dead in the quality deparment.<br />Story is well-known and retold many times by now however the new addition's are they extra feature's that are many and varied, none disappoint from the (3) behind-the-scenes documentaries to screen-test's, trailer's ect.<br />Richard Donner &amp; Tom Mankiewicz give jovial and funny commentary insight behind the movie which is enjoyable to listen to and fun.<br />John Williams score is the one of the best he's ever done and Key cast member's Christopher Reeve,Margot Kidder,Hackman &amp; Brando in top-form.<br />They don't make Em' like this anymore, magic for all the family a film if ever there was one for all age's.<br />An Epic fantasy telling, a Fan's wish come true!
B00004U8P9|3.0|The movie was okay, a little too odd for my taste.  The music was it's saving grace.
B00003CXX8|4.0|In THE GLASS HOUSE, murder runs rampant amid the scenic backdrop of Malibu.  An accidental dealth leaves two children, Ruby played by Leelee Sobieski and Rhett played by Trevor Morgan, orphans.  They are placed into the custody of their neighbors, Trevor and Erin Glass.<br />Their home has half of its structure made out of glass, a beautiful site, but one where the cold atmosphere clearly shows that life is about to change.  Everything the kids do is monitored as no aspect of their lives is private.  Somehow, Trevor and Erin seem to be everywhere imaginable, yet seemingly never around.  Things really heat up once Ruby finds out about the skeletons in her new guardians' closet.  <br />Although the plotline is fairly predictable, the acting is quite good, and the suspense will give you goosebumps.  Leelee Sobieski is wonderful in her role, and Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgaard play excellent adversaries.  GLASS HOUSE also features cameos by Chris Noth and Rita Wilson, completing the cast quite nicely.<br />Overall, this is a fairly entertaining film that will definately make you flinch in your seat a couple of times.  It won't dissappoint.
0780624890|1.0|What a horrible film! My friend made me watch it simply to see Udo Kier in it. Udo Kier is everywhere and is wonderful of course. But Wesley Snipes is just too much, and Kris Kristofferson is ridiculous. This whole film is ridiculous. I hear they are making a sequel, too, which is even more discouraging. What a waste of resources. Stephen Dorff is probably the only remotely appealing part of this film. The best part, though, was a quote from Snipes (probably attempting to be so wise and witty), \\"Some m----- f----- always has to try to ice skate uphill.\\" Or something positively ridiculous like this. This is campy and weird, and for that reason alone it might be entertaining (but I kept falling asleep).
B00005N9CV|5.0|What a joy to come upon a vocalist/pianist who quite simply is brilliant in both categories! This album with its gentle bossa nova beat is one to put on the player, dim the lights, and with winter coming, light the fire and settle in for some very laid back, romantic music that falls so pleasantly ln the ear. Give us more of this and less of that so-called &quot;music&quot; dubbed &quot;rap.&quot;<BR>Her selections are great old standards to hear and Krall herself is nothing less than superlative.
630562285X|3.0|Catherine Zeta-Jones is her gorgeous self here, ensnaring men on both sides to achieve her aims. She portrays an insurance investigator and goes undercover to catch Sean Connery's aging thief character in the act, but she is really planning to use him in an even bigger heist. Of course you find out in the end that there has been more double crossing going on than meets the naked eye. There is a lot of interesting scenery in the film, a lot of Catherine looking beautiful. But overall the film is quite intelligent and passably believable in the way it is carried out. It has its happy ending, so it is not by any means perfect, but it will be riveting enough to keep you watching until the end.
B00005NWRS|4.0|I read the review in no depression and the editorial piece which said this cd wasn't all that great. Boy am I glad i purchased this cd and didn't listen to those reviews. It arrived last night and i can't take it out of my cd player. I have become a huge ryan adams fan and this cd proves he has the stuff to be one of the best. The varied styles of play make this well worth a listen. Buy it!
0783241542|2.0|Okay I am not big on juvenile humour. But there were parts of this film that were just too funny to ignore or not laugh at. I particularly enjoyed all the parts with Eugene Levy (Jason Biggs's dad in the movie), who is always hilarious. I don't think there is a lot I can say about this film because everyone has already seen it. I can say though that I would not watch this with... my parents (even though I am an adult). The humour, while funny, can be embarrassing. But you will nevertheless laugh unless you are a serious prude and easily offended. Which obviously I am not.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Excellent ~ Diana Does It AGAIN!  Just EXCELLENT!
0800141865|4.0|Woody Harrelson gives a credible and entertaining performance here as porn king Larry Flynt. Ed Norton is also excellent (as usual) as Flynt's busy and much beleaguered lawyer. I have more doubts about the performance of Courtney Love because she has not done enough other acting to compare her performance to. Many people would argue that this performance was not much of a stretch from her everyday life perhaps (not that anyone of us would know). Many would say this was her acting out how her life might have been had she continued spiraling into heroin addiction. But none of this speculation is fair. Her performance within the context of the film was perfect for what the film needed. She played the wife of Flynt, Althea, with convincing and reckless abandon, and her decline and eventual demise is also well played. <BR>The story, well, the story of Flynt is well known, and the film will tell the tale once more if curious. Whether or not you love or hate Flynt, the film is an interesting look at how he got started and how he succeeded against the odds.
B00003CY0U|3.0|This film of course was released in the US a long time ago but was recently released in Iceland. A friend invited me to see it with him, and I went. Two days after the terrorist attacks in the US. It was ironic and almost chilling even to hear all this talk of terrorism in the film-and combating it-and then see flying buses and machinery crashing into skyscrapers. It was all too reminiscent of recent events in the world. Nevertheless, the film was entertaining enough. I expected something more from it than there was. I appreciated John Travolta's monologue at the beginning about movies. However, the film seems to try a bit too hard to be \\"cool\\". Halle Berry cannot act. She is gorgeous but her performance is so hollow it is not even funny. It is a good thing she had her body to showcase through most of the film. Hugh Jackman was probably the best thing about the film (maybe even Vinnie Jones), and I am not a Jackman fan. <BR>Nevertheless I thought that the film was interesting and worth viewing. Interesting cinematography and plot.
6303823351|5.0|&quot;Help&quot; is an amazingly funny comedy of errors in which Ringo Starr accidentally acquires a piece of jewelry that marks him as a human sacrifice for a cult.  The Beatles run amok through Liverpool and London in an attempt to rid Starr of the ring in question.  There is both visual and verbal comedy; for example, The Beatles walk to four different doors on a block, wave goodbye to one another -- and wind up in the same house.  As usual, the music is a high point of the film, including &quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot; and the title track.  This is an amusing, kitschy romp that Beatles fans will surely enjoy.
B00003CX5A|3.0|Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci ride on... Sleepy Hollow is a spooky adaptation of the story of Sleepy Hollow and the headless horseman. Depp plays the skeptical city police inspector who comes to the small town of Sleepy Hollow only to be bewitched by the young Christina Ricci and to fall prey to the spells and superstitions of the town. Positively horrifying is Christopher Walken (you watch it and you will know what I am talking about. The guy is scary when you see him looking normally; this is just abuse for the eyes!) The story is well-told, acting is good, and the cinematography and scenery evokes the kind of imagery that is necessary for this to be believable. Overall a fantastic film (in the sense that it is successful in the realm of fantasy).
B000001DU5|5.0|I just bought this CD and it's great. It's got wonderful lyrics and well arranged melodies that will reach your soul. I strongly recommend that you buy this CD. It's really good music that should be enjoyed for all eternity.
B00004RFDW|3.0|This movie, despite the awesome performance by Al Pacino, could have been better.  I wasn't aware until nearly the end that it was based on a true story.  It had it's good moments - it's good dialogue - but in the end the parts didn't all come together...
B00003CX9E|5.0|What can I say -- I was simply blown away by the DVD!.. There are not one, but two separate feature length commentaries, and Ebert's commentary was especially interesting. <br />Also included on the two disc set is the excellent PBS documentary \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\". Given Citizen Kane's standing, it was only natural that Warner would put a lot of effort into making a good DVD, but this one's truly exceptional...<br />Atul

B00003CY5K|5.0|Legally Blonde is a wonderful comic romp. It is full a great film for all ages alike. There isn't anything about this film that could be considered bad. The film is outstanding, and is funny all the way through. You'll leave the theater with a smile on your face, guarenteed!
B00003CXFU|5.0|This is a great movie - filled with some of the best dialogue in a long while.  Julia Roberts does a wonderful job! There are scenes in this film which stay with you long after the credits roll and it is one of those movies where the good guy wins and you want to cheer.  If you are hedging on whether or not to get this - go ahead.  You'll be delighted!

6300214540|3.0|First of all, nobody is obliged to produce a masterpiece every time one goes behind a camera. No. So, TOP GUN is not a masterpiece, but sure as hell it will give you good moments in a silly script. Cruise is doing what he knows best: false acting.
B0000508U6|4.0|You know what, this is an excellent album, but it is the new cure
B00005AACC|1.0|Cruise surprised me here...never thought he would sell out so clearly in order to make a &quot;summer blockbuster&quot;....My God, this whole thing is a shame.. how can people spend millions of dollars in a mess of a movie like this on? The plot? You musdt be joking, there is any. THe face mask? Dont wanna ever see anyone using a face mask again !!! THe funny part: the bad guy steals a very importan chemical device, after destroying a commercial airlines, and where does he hide? In a beuatiful white house in the heart of Syndey, Australia, at the coast, plain for all to see !!!!!!! But the point is: for me write a review like this, that means Ive already watched the movie (probably paying a ticket in the movie or renting). And thats all that matters for people who are capable to produce an abortion like this: money - our money.... Cruise, you reached the bottom of the barrel here.(And I used to enjoy most of your movies). But now you proved that your great performance in JULY FOURTH was an accident, what you really like to do is &quot;DAYS OF THUNDER&quot;, &quot;TOP GUN&quot;, whatever....
B0000256VK|5.0|This is a sensual, fantastic album.  Amazing that it came out in '82 as well.  Time has not dated this at all - because it is timeless.  <br />Tragic that there hasn't been a follow up except for Bryan Ferry's solo efforts - none of which have quite hit the mark.  <br />Most of the reviews here say what needs to be said - buy this if you've never heard Roxy Music and want an introduction but be forewarned - this will be better than any Bryan Ferry album you've heard, and going back into Roxy's earlier back catalogue will seem rough and starker compared to this stunning soundscape.
B000002GEV|5.0|Dont take me badly, folks, but SUPERTRAMP IS A POP BAND (with the worst characteristics that it means...). But the fact is that all its musicians were great, and SUPERTRAMP managed to get away from pop in CRIME OF THE CENTURY and really deliver a masterpiece. That is the simple truth. BREAKFAST IN AMERICA is also very good, but one can already see the signs of awful thing to come like &quot;Its Raining Again&quot;... As for CRIME OF THE CENTURY, five stars, independently of whom recorded it. Any band that did something like this would have five stars from me. What counts is the music here, not the band.
B00003CXXS|5.0|jurassic park 3 is really good movie it has best effects and the spinosaurus is the bomb and i was glad to sam neill chartecter back in the movie he is a really good actor. I recomend people buy this movie.
B000002G89|4.0|Well, I dont have the original vynil or regular CD to campare with, but, if it is true what some people are saying, that there is one song missing in this remaster, some executive record company man must be arrested, for sure, because that would be trechery for the old fans and for new fans like myself (who dont know the orignial album). Anyway, I give it four stars until I can know the truth...
B00005NWRS|5.0|I, must admit that in recent years have lost faith in music and it's ability to evoke feelings of goodness and well being.  Thank goodness for Ryan Adams.  First with his work with Whiskeytown, and now with his solo work, Ryan Adams has more than restored my faith.  Heartbreaker was great, but Gold is even better.  Keep the good times and music coming Ryan; for if not for people like you what a terrible world it would be.
B000002GEY|2.0|I dontknow why Davies and Hodgson always sung like girls with tiny voices.... Anyway, BREAKFAST is so pop, it almost made me puke... ITs a best seeling album (mere than thirteen million copies sold) but is nowhere closer to CRIME OF THE CENTURY!!! Slip it !!!
B00004S8X5|5.0|Kylie Minogue first hit it big in her home country of Australia before breaking through to the UK, and is still going strong.  Sadly, she was criminally not recognized or received in the same manner in this country.  This, her 1988 album entitled Kylie, is where the saga begins.<br />Her debut was entirely written, produced, and arranged by Stock-Aitken-Waterman, the prime purveyors of bubblegum pop in the late 1980's.  Kylie stands now as the classic epitome of the S-A-W sound.<br />The album bursts into overdrive instantly with the first two singles, &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; and &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, yes, the Little Eva song written by the famous songwriting duo of Carole King and Gerry Goffin.  This version stayed on the top of the Aussie charts for 7 weeks straight.  Personally, it should have gone for 12 weeks, but oh well.<br />&quot;Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi&quot;, qui est francais pour &quot;I don't know why&quot;, is a mid-paced single that provides a good beat.  So is &quot;It's No Secret&quot;.  Then comes &quot;Got To Be Certain&quot;, the third overdrive single on this album.  I've always had trouble deciding which is my favorite single on here:  this, &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, or &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;.  More often than not, it ends up as a four-way tie.<br />As it turned out, the first six songs became singles, so that's three-fifths of the album right there.  &quot;Turn It Into Love&quot; is yet another overdrive single and &quot;I Miss You&quot;, the first non-single on the album, has a nice horn section mixed in with the S-A-W wall of synthesizer keyboards.<br />All ten songs on the entire album is an instant dance-party album, and not a filler among them.  Heck, &quot;I'll Still Be Loving You&quot; and &quot;Look My Way&quot; beat to a somewhat slower, but nevertheless midpaced tempo before finishing off with the rocket-paced &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;.<br />People who are into contemporary techno may consider this dated and pokey, but the upbeat style of Kylie showers the partier or listener with a fuzzy, warm feeling instead of the cold, mechanical prickliness of freeze-dried techno.  It's also a good workout, especially for jogging or on a Revmaster.<br />As for the album cover, there she is, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, wearing a slanting hatbrim with her hair piled atop it.  So, there it is for Kylie, the first of many delightful albums.porary techno may consider this dated and pokey, but the upbeat style of Kylie showers the partier or listener with a fuzzy, warm feeling instead of the cold, mechanical prickliness of freeze-dried techno.

B000002U9E|5.0|Kate Bush's fifth studio album was accused of being more accessible to the general public.  While not as wonderfully bizarre as its predecessor, The Dreaming, Hounds Of Love not only proved she still had what it took, but had her develop a concept album for the latter seven songs.<br />The first half, Hounds Of Love, is basically most of the singles.  &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot; It's that chorus, where's she's &quot;runnin' up that road/runnin' up that hill/with no problem&quot;, which makes me wonder what the angels Damiel and Cassiel from Wings Of Desire would think.  Would Kate accept a compromise trade, where she would trade places and become an angel instead of God?<br />&quot;The Big Sky&quot; is a big yes to all those introspective, inwardly directed &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; cloudgazers who say, &quot;that cloud looks like such and such&quot; instead of literalists who say &quot;that cloud looks like a bunch of suspended rain and ice particles.&quot;  I always liked Kate because she was in her own Bush universe and who cares if no one understood her songs?<br />&quot;Cloudbusting&quot; is my favorite single from here, especially with its regimental rhythms of the synthesizers.<br />It is the Ninth Wave portion of this album that is intriguing.  The series of seven songs portray the saga of a drowning woman.  Now, how she manages the transition from the insomniac state of &quot;And Dream Of Sheep&quot; to &quot;Under Ice&quot;, I'm not sure.

B000002H97|5.0|This album is unique for Metallica. It is arguably the best sounding album, but some of the content just doesn't do it for me anymore. There is no doubt that Enter Sandman is probably responsible for about 25% of Metallica's fans, but they have so much more material that is better on other albums (Sandman is a treat live, but isn't exciting on the record after hearing it 8000000 times.) Nothing Else Matters is probably the most beautiful song the band has ever written, and is the high point of the album. The God That Failed and Wherever I May Roam are top notch as well, but nothing else on the album is as good as previous albums (I know people will argue Sad But True and the Unforgiven, but they have much better material). By no means is this a bad album...it just isn't the same as anything that preceded it.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|The whole thing about greatest hits albums is that somewhere along the line, when an artist who made it big in the past decade or decades becomes irrelevant in the current decade, the best thing to do is for the artist to put out a greatest hits and say, \\"Well, I'm done\\", with maybe a last farewell album somewhere down the line.<br />The problem in trying to put out greatest hits albums is the selection of songs associated with said artist to satisfy the people who grew up with them. Then there's the problem of putting enough songs to fit the 75 to 80 minutes that can fit a single CD. As a result, some songs might be excluded.<br />Case in point: Phil Collins' greatest hits compilation, Hits, does not have \\"I Missed Again\\", \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", and \\"Don't Lose My Number\\". I can excuse the first two, but the third? It made it to Billboard's Top Ten on the singles chart!<br />But seriously,... (album reference intended) that's just a minor quibble. It was the track listing that finally got me to get the ex-Genesis frontman's long-awaited greatest hits album. I grew up with Phil Collins and Genesis during my MTV days and when I actually bothered to listen to the radio. His distinctive voice could be soft and heartfelt on songs like \\"One More Night\\", yet also be ringing with energy on \\"Sussudio\\". Hence his winning a Grammy best album for No Jacket Required, which established a place for him from the mid-80s to early 90's. I enjoy everything on this compilation, even his own take on Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\".<br />Phil Collins had some hit singles from movies, and their inclusion in a greatest hits are a lifesaver for the fan. \\"Against All Odds\\", the eponymous movie hit, \\"Groovy Kind Of Love\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\" from Buster, and \\"Separate Lives\\", his sparkling, bittersweet duet with Marilyn Martin from White Nights, are present here. The presence of \\"Against All Odds\\" alone will more than likely spur the purchase of this compilation.<br />Another gem is his duet with Phil Bailey, \\"Easy Lover\\", a real catchy dance tune, where Phil Bailey's falsetto is a real contrast to Collins' vocal. That song, \\"Against All Odds\\", and \\"Separate Lives\\" is what prompted me to buy this album, by the way.<br />I kind of lost track of Collins in the 90's during my college days, when I got turned on to college and alternative stuff, but \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" is a prime example of the kind of ballads that have placed him in pop's history books. How sad it is that he is no longer relevant in today's music.Phil Bailey, \\"Easy Lover\\", a real catchy dance tune, where Phil Bailey's falsetto is a real contrast to Collins' vocal.

B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera are undeniably one of the leaders of the heavy metal scene today.  All of their 5 studio albums support this claim, and if you want to get started with Pantera, this is the way to go.  VDOP is one of the &quot;must-have&quot; albums of heavy metal.  Though I feel myself that the Great Southern Trendkill was their greatest album, many feel that this is the one, and with good reason.<br />The high spots of this album are found at the beginning and the end (which is the case with most of Pantera's albums).  The first 5 tracks are all classic metal tunes.  Walk is arguably the anthem of heavy metal today.  The last 2 tracks are also really good, especially Hollow, which shows that Phil can sing as well as scream (which he does best on Hostile and This Love).<br />If you are a fan of heavy music and don't own this album, I don't know where you have been.  It is without a doubt one of those albums that will always be remembered as a heavy metal masterpiece.

B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I think this dvd is gonna sell great, everybody should see this film, it's amazing.Even though i'm a guy for this love story, it's kinda weird but i still loved it. All of Michael Bay's movies are just amazing.Great action movies.The action in this movie is just awesomely radiant.I recommend everybody that has a dvd player get this.Me for sure am going to purchase it.
B0000256VK|5.0|Ask anyone with half a brain.... This is the soundtrack for 9 1/2 Weeks! Music for the self-absorbed bachelor, wedding ring in the pocket husband, tormented gigolo or disillusioned yuppie - from beginning to end, Avalon plays out like a fine crafted drama.  <br />In a era of greed, excess and ill-discretion, Roxy Music created an album hip, stylish, wicked and totally reflective of the 80's.
6303039456|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.  It has a little of everything.  It has comedy, romance, sports highlights, friendship, etc...  I recommend it for all ages.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|This cd kicks a**!  The only reason this cd didn't get 5 stars is that they didn't keep it real.  The D went for the full sound of a full band (drums, keyboards, etc...) instead of their signature acoustic jam.  If you are debating whether or not to get this cd GET IT, because it beats whatever you are listening to right now.  Long Live the D!
0688170528|5.0|This is my first Jodi Picoult novel and it was great!  I am going to run out and get some of her other books!  I'm sure I won't be disappointed.

B00005QFHG|4.0|I highly reccomend this movis but bewarned the experience of seeing this film will leave you with a deep need for chocolate so keep somegood stuff handy right afterward.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I think this CD is just OK. Adding string orchestra made her voice more distance. Intimacy is the key of her other album. It's totally lost here. Her singing is bland. Gone are the 'conviction' and playfulness. Her selection of songs are weak. There is no new ground broken here. I won't recommend this album.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Tenacious D is, just as they say, THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD. In 1997, some dude (Lee, probably) posted on his website that \\"Tenacious D is the greatest band in the entire history of whatever the [heck] they are!\\" I couldn't have said it better myself.<br />If you've never heard of the D, you need to catch them live. Their blend of comedic acoustic heavy metal is like nothing you've ever heard. In their own words: \\"Kyle's fingers be silver/Jack's voice, then, be gold.\\" You've probably seen Jack Black in movies such as The Jackal, The Cable Guy, Saving Silverman and Shallow Hal. What you don't know is that he can sing his ... off!!! And Kyle Gass is no slouch on his ax. Their songs are hilarious, yet they really rock.<br />Long-time D fans should expect more than JB & KG on their twin acoustics. This CD boasts full-band versions of faves such as \\"Explosivo\\" and \\"Kyle Quit\\", as well as totally new tracks. \\"Wonderboy\\" must be their first non-X-rated song, but it still rocks. And \\"... Her Gently\\" embodies a lesson that all us guys should learn. I just wish they'd included \\"Jesus Ranch\\" and \\"Warning\\" and \\"The History of Tenacious D\\" on it.<br />WARNING: The Surgeon General of Rock says that, even if you've heard the D before, this CD will still BLOW YOUR ... OUT!
B000002JPA|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful. It's not Dream Theater's best and it's quite light for many metal fans, but musically it is nearly without equal. I personally prefer Scenes From a Memory (incidentally, that whole CD is a sort of continuation of Metropolis Part 1 on this CD) but that's because I'm more heavy-inclined, coming from In Flames and Cradle of Filth roots. Anyone who plays any of the instruments featured on this CD will likely be impressed by these magicians and anyone who doesn't will still probably love this one. A gem.
B0000508U6|4.0|Here we have the winner of the Best British Album at this year's Brit Awards, and a fine album it is. Atmospheric and moody, Coldplay weave a delicate feeling that straddles the fence between melonchaly and desolation. This isn't slit-your-wrists depressing like The Cure, but rather &quot;sit in a quiet place and ponder&quot; music. The arrangements are perfect, stepping up the pace when things threaten to become a little too slow and stripping down at just the right moment for maximum dramatic effect. The first single, &quot;Yellow&quot;, is starting to make some noise here in the United States. It is nicely representative of Parachutes.
B0000029GA|3.0|it aint nothing spectacular.
B000002U8G|5.0|I saw the original tour for this album around 71/72 and let me just<br />say that they were a far better, more completely rounded band in those<br />days. Not that they are bad now, they are still great musicians, but<br />I had the pleasure to witness the band 3 times in concert BEFORE<br />they became huge after Dark Side. I saw them later during the<br />Wish You Were Here tour and Animals tour and felt that they had lost<br />something intimate as they grew richer and more famous. It then<br />became nearly impossible to get tickets for the shows as they<br />would sell out in an instant. If you were lucky enough to get tickets,<br />the shows were generally uncomfortable and packed shoulder to<br />shoulder. I find it much harder to enjoy shows in that capicty.<br />Seeing them perform Meddle, Obscured By Clouds and Dark<br />Side of the Moon had a real magic that I have not experienced<br />since. People would actually sit and listen. Fantastic, wonderful,<br />creative music.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Well now, I've given this movie 4 chances now. And i still hate it. Dont get me wrong, I grew up watching star wars every day. But this movie isnt star wars, It seems to be a 2 hour long comercial for hasbro, And the many other marketing scemes G.L. has come top exploit with his movies. But you cant blame him, After all it's all about the bottom line, eh? <BR>    If the next two movies reflect any similartiy to this one i'll be staying away from them. And if jar jar makes another apearance, Oh please help us all. And for george, Why not focus on a movie instead of money? You had a great thing, And now it just seems tainted. Well kids im almost finished whining. One last thing, Make george put the indiana jones movies on dvd dang it!  Oh yeah, the movie got 2 stars cause even i have to admit the battle shots ruled, May the force be with your wallet, I know it's with georges'.

B0000062GK|5.0|There are two CD's anyone with a passing interest in instrumental rock needs to own. The first is Steve Vai's &quot;Alien Love Secrets.&quot; The second is this. &quot;Crystal Planet&quot; represents a turning point in Satriani's career, where one finds him with one foot firmly planted in the rock world and the other stepping out towards the realm of electronica. Satch still has a live band at his disposal and puts it to good use on such cuts as &quot;House Full of Bullets&quot; and &quot;Secret Prayer.&quot; However, elements of electronica permeate tracks such as the title cut and the standout &quot;Raspberry Jam Delta V&quot; (which incidentally has one of the coolest intro riffs i've heard in any style of music- worth the price of admission for the first 30 seconds of this song alone). And as always, Satch's playing is jaw-dropping; he gets some of the best tones of his career on this album, including an honest-to-god good clean tone on the solo electric &quot;Z.Z.'s song, a rarity in the Satch discography. And the lead breaks on &quot;A Peice of Liquid&quot; and &quot;Secret Prayer&quot; are just beautiful. I know this is a bit of a cliche, but in the week after i bought this CD, the only time it left my CD player was to go into someone else's. If you want an introduction to Satriani, this is the way to do it.

B000002H33|5.0|This is an awesome album it just doesnt get boring.  This is the best album Metallica ever released and it is one of the best metal albums of all time.  If you're new to Metallica and think any of the recent stuff(anything after the black album) is good get this album ASAP! Actually even if you hate the new stuff get this album, you wont regret it. All of the songs are good.  The title track is awesome and the lyrics are great.  But my personal favorite is Damage INC.  It starts out really slow and then explodes into a really fast really good tune.  The guitar solo is wicked.  Welcome home is about a guy in an asylum.  James was a genius with the lyrics.  Metallica should fire Bob Rock and go back to James writing the lyrics.  The new albums wouldn't bite then.  All fans need to have this one in their collection.
B00005NIDK|3.0|Yes has flirted with orchestras on several occasions but 'Magnification' is the first real release of this kind of cooperation. And it's promising... and yet it leaves a lot of room for improvement.<br />The title track opening the album is kind of obligatory mediocre until its rocking orchestral noise turns to Jon Anderson's life-giving voice on 'Spirit Of Survival', a song which develops into a potential James Bond score (sorry).<br />'Give Love Each Day' too, is a good mixture of Jon Anderson's voice, virtous guitar play, filling drums, and classical instruments, especially violins. It's a good piece, followed by 'Can You Imagine' which is a decent attempt that however sadly becomes a lot like the mediocre tracks on 'Open Your Eyes' and 'The Ladder'.<br />One of the best songs on 'Magnification' is the balladic kliché 'We Agree', with the acoustic guitar and Jon Anderson in the foreground. It is followed by the superfluous 'Soft As A Dove' - practically a remake of 'From The Balcony'...!<br />And then, finally, comes the true climax of the album: track #8, the 10.45 mins long 'Dreamtime'. It's a rhapsody, an epic, and yet it is the easiest song to catch. 'Dreamtime' is like a fairytale. A journey into what yes, and especially this classical cooperation should be all about!<br />The other long song is placed directly after this feast, and maybe that is the reason why it is somewhat disappointing. 'In The Presence Of' remains very OK though.<br />After this promising but not quite satisfying kick-off, I do look forward to a more worked-through follow-up to 'Magnification'... Gimme more like 'Dreamtime', gimme epic journeys, gimme Yes!
B0000024SD|4.0|This is a turning point in Dylan's career, when he 'went electric' at the risk of alienating the folk purists who had followed him from the coffee shops.  But he blended his folk roots with rock'n'roll to help push the concept of folk rock, and kept all the fire, passion and songcraft of his earlier work with him.  In fact, the last half of the album is all accoustic, so even if you prefer that side of him, it is well represented with tunes like &quot;Mr. Tamborine Man&quot; and &quot;It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;.  But electric classics like &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; also pop up and show his political nature wasn't dulled (yet).  This doesn't quite rank up with his masterpieces, although it is almost all very strong and memorable, and it contains many essential tunes.
1878424319|5.0|Page 29: &quot;During our domestication, our parents and siblings gave their opinions about us without even thinking.  We believed these opinions and we lived in fear over these opinions, like not being good at swimming, or sports, or writing.  Someone gives an opinion and says, 'Look, this girl is ugly!'  The girl listens, believes she is ugly, and grows up with the idea that she is ugly.  It doesn't matter how beautiful she is; as long as she has that agreement, she will believe that she is ugly.  That is the spell she is under.&quot; <br />There are two perfect examples: one of my friend's nieces is absolutely beautiful.  When her niece was thirteen, one of THE most vulnerable ages, her stepmother told her that she was ugly. <BR>To this day, this girl still thinks that she's only average.<br />Personally, when I was a kid, I was made to fell lousy because I was not the next Babe Ruth.  These circumstances have haunted me for a very long time.  Miguel is right-on with the first agreement!<br />Page 38's analogy of the human mind as a computer and comparing gossip as a computer virus was EXCELLENT !!<br />Pages 56-57: &quot;By taking things personally, you set yourself up to suffer for nothing.&quot;  What a profound statement that Miguel has written.<br />Page 57: &quot;Do not expect people to tell you the truth because they also lie to themselves.&quot;  Many folks live an allusion and as my brother Terry said, &quot;...their fingertips are holding onto the ledge of allusion and any little movement will devastate them and they will fall...&quot;<br />Page 69: &quot;We make the assumption that everyone sees life the way WE do.&quot;  This is another profound statement from Ruiz.<br />Page 82: &quot;You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action.&quot;  A perfect example is Forrest Gump.  Although Gump was a fictional character, he only had an I.Q. of 75, which is WELL below average.  He made the MOST out of what he had.  Heprobably utilized close to 80 to 100% of his brainpower.  Many humans are lucky to utilize 10 to 20% of their brainpower.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|His blood was red.  I did like the scene where he shot the guy.  P.S.  James Cann Smells<br />But that will come clear in future viewings.  I was still confused about the plot.  Even after watching it the second time, His best since LA Confidential.  I hope to see him in other movies.  Guy Pierce gave a good preformace. It made sense the second time around, but like in the Usual Suspects and Citizen Cane.  Time lines were difficult to understand.  I enjoyed it much more, but after the second time.  Memento was a very hard movie to watch the first time.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|This DVD is simply tremendous!!  The Bee Gees have recorded one of their finest performances with awesome DTS audio.  Their sound is better than it has ever been and the brothers' voices are as rich as they ever were.  Many of the melodies are done with few instruments, so the harmonies are crisp like I have never heard them before.  A tremendous collection of their songs along with extras like Celine Dion make the audio alone worth having this concert.  The video show is just as fresh, filmed on location at MGM in Las Vegas, the light show is intricate and dramatic.  Be ready to sing along with this one and yes, even clap your hands.  We were up dancing in our living room!!  If you are old enough to remember the Bee Gees at the height of their careers, they can still inspire. A great home theater pick for the family, the audio is rich and yet not overdone.  Another generation should get turned on the 'Brothers' Gibb' with this DVD.
B00003CXCS|1.0|This movie is really borring.  Don't get me wrong I like Juile Andrews, but I find her more attractive now.  I could watch Princess Diaries over and over and never get bored with her.  But in this movie she looked more like Sandy Dunncen, the women from Hogen Family.  She was the woman that replaced Valerie Harper after there was a problem with production.  I did like Valerie better then Sandy, but I find Sandy more attactive then Valerie, but I like Julie Andrews more then both of them, but I especially like the modern Julie Andrews more now then in this movie.  The only person that did a good job was James Cann.  He was able to provide substance to an otherwise slow moving movie.  You might remember James Cann from Roolerball and the comedy Godfather.  He was good as the comic relief in that movie.  I hope that he can put this movie behind him and get to more productive movies like his part in Back to the Future or Alien Nation.
B00004Z459|5.0|I am embarassed to admit that I discovered this group on MTV during a holiday when I had nothing better to do to waste my time away.  LOVED them, I am a new convert to the rap/rock genre having just been converted to Limp Bizkit recently.  These people hae not changed my mind.  I like their melodies, I like both Bennington's and Shinoda's voices, Shinoda has a clear rap voice which is such a relief as I don't have to endlessly strain an plyback to discover what he is saying.  <br />Maybe the more I discover this genre I will find that they are the MTV face of this genre of music, but right now I love them.
0792844602|2.0|This movie glorifies the evil attempt of the West to suppress the religion and freedom of the Sudanese people led by their great Mahdi. Of course, as a Western film, the Mahdi is presented as a blood-thirsty psychopath, whereas he was in fact a holy and devout man who wanted to free the Islamic World from Western influence. In these days the Western powers didn't have cruise missiles and stealth bombers - they had to do their dirty work with the British bayonet, and more often than not, they paid a high price for their arrogance. This movie, however, presents a rather rosy view of colonial war. The British army effortlessly mows down the Mahdi's army as if Muslims were just so many sheep being slaughtered. When I watch this film, I feel that the West never really ended its crusades againsts the Islamic peoples.
B00005N9CV|3.0|This follow-up to &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; has both its good and bad points. The vocal work is exceptional as usual - hearing Diana's sultry tones on the opening notes of &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; somehow makes all of the tension release. However the arrangements and heavy use of the orchestral background gets a little tired and slow. &quot;Love Letters,&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Dark,&quot; are so slow-moving that they're nearly unendurable. Even though &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; is done with a slightly Latin beat, you really wish she had done it as a straight-up dance-able mambo. &quot;I Remember You,&quot; &quot;Cry Me a River,&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; are certainly the high points of the album, but still on the a-bit-too-mellow side. I enjoy the album, but I'm still looking for a jumpier, jazzier tune (like &quot;Devil May Care&quot; on the previous album,) to kind of break up the flow.
B000021YQV|5.0|There is one thing wrong with this album and that is it made me like their s/t effort less. Although there is no 'Sugar' on this album it is pure quality from start to finish. The only song i don't love is Jet Pilot because I think its a bit too heavy in all the wrong ways but its still a good track. Best songs for me were Chop Suey, Forest and ATWA. <br />I reckon Serj is the main reason that SOAD are a brilliant band rather than just a good band but every member pulls their weight. In short a modern day classic.
B00000AFGM|5.0|But not Mechanical Animals.  I have enjoyed reading the reviewers who hate this album because he does not resort to the same metal cliches that are reminiscent of NIN (only not as good) that infest MM's earlier albums.  See, these people don't want to HEAR MUSIC - they want noise that doesn't truly move them.  They just think the noise moves them and speaks to them because it's loud and discordant. You want loud, discordant, and moving?  Buy a copy of George Crumb's \\"Black Angels\\" (Kronos Quartet performing).<br />This album contains songwriting, creative instrumentation, and well-written lyrics.  Everybody in this band (M Wayne Gacy especially) truly came through in this album.  The actual music takes you to a barren landscape in which you are seemingly all alone, but hear Marilyn Manson's voice singing to you.  Sounds scary?  Oddly enough, it's not.  The lyrics of this song are at times wryly ironic, at other times strangely comforting.  Everybody is down in the dumps at times (others truly depressed), and the lyrics deal with the issues...want an example?  Listen to \\"Speed of Pain\\"...tell me that doesn't express how you felt when your girlfriend cheated on you (it did for me, at any rate).<br />...<br />The album is worth buying.  I think you should do so.
0060975768|5.0|As I began I thought a book written by a General would be one sided.  I was really surprised, this book was written with all the fact that was there.  To look back and see just how the degeneration of the faith,pride,and backing of the American public to this non declared war can make you cry.  Many protesters should bow their heads and ask gods forgiveness for their actions during that period. may god bless each and every man that went and fought for his country, they were true patriots to the man. We should never forget them.
B00005NWM3|1.0|A guy I trust at the record store recommended this album to me.  I have to admit, there are a couple good guitar riffs on the album, but the melodramatic Bon Jovi style lyrics is enough to make anyone with at least a little testosterone want to puke.  If you have any of Julia Roberts' movies on DVD, this album is for you.
0786915749|5.0|This book made fantasy for me. The only other book that comes close is the Lord of the Rings. I can picture Solace and the swamps and Darken Wood and Solace Vale so well that I see it in dreams. The first of the Dragonlance books was the greatest book of all the medievil fantasy tales I have ever read, which is a lot. I have read the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, and many more. This book has made me love fantasy almost as much as reality and even though I have read it five times this year I still can't get enough of it. It is the first book of medievil fantasy that I have read and after many more will be the last one I read before I move on, that is if I move on. Each character is like an old friend to me and I feel as if I am one of the companions myself. I also write fantasy and get in the high 90's with them in grade 10 English so I am not saying this because I am a crased fan. I thououghly enjoyed this book the first time and the last 4 times as much. &quot;EST SULARIS OTH MITHAS&quot;
B00005OAJ1|5.0|Not ONLY is this album really funny, but, like someone stated above...THE MUSIC RULES as well.  Jack Black and Kyle Gass are GREAT songwriters and musicians.  Those dudes can outplay most people in pop music today.  The fact that living legend DAVE GROHL plays drums on the whole album is an added insentive.  I need to see these guys live.<br />Greg xxx
B00004STPT|5.0|All of the cuts on this CD were fabulous!  My favorite is from Lisa Gerrard and would love to know the lyrics!! How do I get a copy of them?<br />I will recommend this soundtrack to all my friends!  A must have in your CD collection!
B0000541AM|5.0|Walter hill's most colorful and energetic film, It's decent transfer with a few overly dark and grainy scenes towards the end, but it didn't really matter to me.  An essential DVD
0375703764|4.0|I agreed with my two best friends that we would read this together as we were intrigued by what we'd heard and wanted someone to hold our hands as we went through it.  Which is a great way to read a book btw!<br />The thing that struck all of us is that the reader takes away from the book what s/he brings to it. Just as the hallway responds differently to each entrant, drawing out their inner frailties, each of us was affected differently by HOL depending on what was going on for us.  So you can imagine reading it in NYC post 9/11 was interesting!<br />We agreed it's superbly written in terms of the delineation of Johnny and Zampano's voices.  A lot of the &quot;scholarly stuff&quot; and gratuitous use of foreign language quotes seem deliberately obscure and immature.  I think it's a truly scary story a little over-dressed.  Skipping between the Easton Ellis type narratives from Johnny and Zampano's detached voice worked really well in disorienting the reader, again creating a labyrinth.<br />I thought the ending of Zampano's section was trite and pat, although Johnny's story by contrast is wonderfully unresolved.<BR>All in all a great book.
B000002KAT|5.0|Ethereal , atmospheric classic. Something to dream and think too....
B000001FY9|5.0|While this may be just a greatest hits album with nothing original, It still captures classic bob marley..........Great Songs like Get up, stand up, no woman, no cry, and Buffalo soldier are timeless
B00000JPH6|5.0|The Production Design, Puppetry and cinematography are all top notch, enough time has passed to be able to say they don't make them like this anymore :)
B000002HRE|1.0|Since the famous ''Black Album'' Metallica has just going down the streets, they've forgoten how to make fast and agressive music as the same goes to how to make brilhiant guitar solos... nowadays Metallica turned to an almost POP band... MTV seems to be signed with Metallica some king of a statement saying they (Metallica) since now will just sell terrible MTV oriented music and forget how to do metal.... It's a shame..., F**k Metallica.

0446310786|5.0|As many other high school students, I had to read  To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee in my English class.  I did not want to read this book one bit.  It looked like the most boring book in the world, but as many people say you cant judge a book by its cover.  This book turned out to be one of my most favorite books ever.  If anyone has read it, they know what Im talking about.  <BR>The book tells a story in the eyes of a child named Scout.  She is brought up in the small community of Maycomb.  She has many adventures with her brother, Jem.  They, like all other children have a wide imagination.  They let their minds wonder with their neighbors.  They believe things about their neighbors that arent really true. One major issue brought up is Boo Radley.  He is presented as a shy, unsociable individual who never comes out of his house, except for at night.  Everyone finds him to be scary, even though they dont really know him.  Throughout the storyline, they find out who the real Boo Radley is.  He turns out to be one of Scouts best friends. <BR>Scout thinks her father, Atticus, is not exciting and just a regular guy.  She changes her mind when he shoots the countys mad dog with one shot.  He becomes a hero, and later Scout learns that his nickname had always been single shot.  She finally looks up to her father and respects who he is.    <BR>Scout learns many lessons throughout the book.  The main idea is that she shouldnt kill a mockingbird ever.  Her father, Atticus, told her its the worst sin anyone could commit.  Mockingbirds are innocent creatures that only play beautiful music.  She realizes what her father was talking about when an African-American man is sent to trial for a crime he didnt commit.  He was accused of raping an American girl, and Atticus is chosen to defend him.  He does everything he can to prove the innocence of this man, but no one will agree with him.  The innocence of a man is taken and he is sentenced to death.  He represents the mockingbird that was killed.  The county had committed the worst sin ever.  <BR>I would recommend this book to anyone.  It has a great moral and I learned a lot from it.
0380796090|5.0|I really cant add anything to the rest of the reviews, but I have to add my praise. When you consider that this was Marian Keyes first novel, its all the more astounding. Funny, poignant, sexy  it has it all. Claire is a likeable heroine  shes not perfect, but shes not a real pain that you have to struggle to like (as is her little sister Rachel in the equally wonderful Rachels Holiday).  Claire stumbles around (and who wouldnt in her place?) but ultimately learns how to deal with life on her own (with her beautiful baby, despite what horrible sister Helen says!) The only marks of first novel are the men  James turns out to be a horrid, pathetic person and we dont really get any insight early on to this. Adam is a bit too, too, too good to be true  but thats OK. Keyes paints a more rounded picture of Claire, her sisters, and her mother. (In Lucy Sullivan and Rachels Holiday Keyes manages to round out all of her characters better, but the humor and romance gets darker than it is in Watermelon). All in all, Keyes turns out magnificent books  full of humor, quirky characters, and lessons about life. I highly recommend this book as a starting place  but dont stop here! I can hardly wait to read Last Chance Saloon.
0679805273|5.0|This was an excellent book.  I mailed it to my son the first week he left for college.  I wasn't sure how he would react. His response was that it was very &quot;touching&quot;.  He really enjoyed receiving it.  I also wrote a sentimental note inside it.  Hopefully, he will keep it to pass down to his own children.  Perfect gift for anyone (young or old) starting something new.
1556154844|5.0|Although I have been a programmer for six years, I have an MBA in finance and lack an educational background in computer or information science.  This book has helped me in numerous areas where my knowledge or experience was insufficient.  I strongly believe that it has made me a better programmer, designer, and architect.<br />Usually I will give three stars to any book, which can introduce one good idea.  I have learned and applied at least ten methods from this book, so far.  The core focus of this book is on programming structure, testing, and implementation.  It also covers design, architecture, and requirements gathering to a lesser extent.  The book definitely lives up to its legend.
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones is the first piece of what definitely will amount to one of the greatest fantasies of all time. Now, when you read that kind of statement you assume that it's just some crazy fan plugging his author, and I wonder because every review I've seen has been similar. However, every reviewer is listing the same reasons why they love it so much, and most of them concur with my own. So my conclusion is that I am actually on to something here, and this really is one of the greatest series' of all time.<br />Game is the tale of the Stark family being hurled from seclusion in their northern realm into the midst of the torrential polital storm that is King's Landing. Against his will Ned Stark must play the game of thrones, and the opponents aren't playing for fun. While all this scheming and counterplotting is going on, a great enemy is preparing to descend upon the land of Westeros. Filled with intesely deep characters, swirling plots and masterful realism and color, A Game of Thrones is in position to claim the fantasy throne.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is a CLASSIC album!!!<BR>SAOD have released the joint best album of the year. Having just read some of the other 1 star &quot;reviews&quot;  i have to say, you guys are fricken idiots. 1 star!!!!!!!!!  Are you lot deaf, do you not appreciate good music. Well, fine.<br /> But what's even more surprising is that you actually managed to write the review in the first place, or read any of the other reviews. This is due to your brain shrinking from listening to to much crap like creed, nickelback &amp; N-Sync. oh' and Limp Cookie. So due to your intelligence (or lack of) i would'nt expect you to understand any of SOAD lyrics or any lyrics. so if you guys do write any more reviews, I will look forward to having another good laugh!!!<br />P.S. In case you were wondering, the other album of the year is Lateralus by Tool &amp; Bizkit (or Biscuit) means cookie in merry old england. just in case you were confused!!!!
B00005OAJ1|5.0|The long awaited CD delivers all it promised.  The comedy between the songs makes the cd well worth the price. Hearing Kage &amp; Jables with a band behind them was great.<br />Long live the 2 Kings!
B00005A46T|5.0|This record was a major step up since the self-titled major label debut. The guitars and drums molded together to make a harsh, brutal, straight up metal album. Corey's vocals can be hipnotic, and the lyrics are better ( i believe) on this that sipknot's previous releases. If you like metal in any form, I suggest you buy this record. ...
B00005NB0H|5.0|Live At Leeds is a seminal album in live rock albums, and one of the only ones (with Live at The Isle Of Wight) that showcases the furious energy and raw power that the who displays on stage and that made them one of the premier rock and rollbands i the world, and one of the best live. <BR>      Finally we have the entire concert (available until now only in the bootleg &quot;Live At Leeds Complete&quot;), with the entire Tommy Section in Disc two. The sound is fantastic and the packaging is very slick too. Buy this one and you will not regret it, there few chances to hear on record the sound of The Who live at top Notch, Entwistle amazing bass lines, Moon crazy drumming, Townshend power guitar and Daltrey Rocking voice. Is simply fantastic.
0684803356|4.0|As a 15-year-old high school student, being reccomended to read one of the longest books for summer reading wasn't all too appealing to me.  Now that I have read the book, I'm glad that I chose to read For Whom the Bell Tolls.  It is a great book if you want to get the perspective of a foreigner in another country fighting a war.  Being very interested in history myself, learning about the Spanish Civil War was quite intriguing.  Hemingway was very good in expressing his feelings about the war in the country which he once lived.  Although the middle of the book can, at times, be quite a drag, the rest of the book was very enjoyable.  The war/action scenes in the story were very well written by Hemingway.  After reading this book, I look forward to reading more Hemingway novels in the future.  If you want to read a war story, I fully reccomend reading For Whom the Bell Tolls.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Great movie. Well thought out plot. A lot of people complain about the fact that the movie portrays a US submarine crew capturing the enigma when it was actually the British that first captured it. A lot of people have put this movie down as a result. Let me point out something. The movie was fictional and dedicated to the memory of those that fought in submarines during WWII. Also, at the end of the movie the makers of the movie DO GIVE CREDIT to the British. If you read the sequence at the end of the movie it lists two HMS submarines as having first captured the enigma. HMS - HER MAJESTY's SERVICE. That's Britain, guys.
B00005BCOL|5.0|i have watched this movie over and over again just to capture and enjoy the rhythm and cadence of the verbiage tossed back and forth.....it's musical ......lycrical...comical......and thoughtful.....these women are catty, political....fight against their feelings and ultimately can't help but show what they're feeling by trying to hold back or in  trying to manipultate others.....i see my mom in these gals...their love for family....wanting to be the showgirl of the times for their love...and yearning for what it means to just be while being the ultimate &quot;woman&quot;........cukor is a genious......and the woman in this film deserve a standing ovation......roses.....and many hugs from anyone who can appreciate their strength and honesty in the feelings they offered us in this film.........
1577311523|5.0|This work will become a true Spiritual Classic. Eckhart states that none of these core concepts are new. They have been re-stated in a crisp clean no-nonsense fashion. Here is the easiest and clearest light upon the path to spiritual peace and freedom I have ever read or listened to. I have the book and audiobook. I like both, but enjoy the audio version read by the author best; because the sense of deep peace conveyed in the authors voice.<br />After reading and re-reading the book I felt compelled to go and listen for myself to Eckhart in person. I was curious if his presence would be what was conveyed through the book. I flew to New York shortly after the awful incidents in Manhattan and D.C. and participated in a Meditation Retreat at the Omega Institute. Eckhart conducted a five day workshop that was amazing. 'Life-changing' is the best description for it. He exudes PEACE through his serenity! It was a God-send after the horrible upsetting incidents of the previous week. We didn't retreat from the world, but Eckhart addressed the terrorist attacks from his spiritual frame of reference. Those words healed the hurt and anger, with love. He didn't excuse the terrorists but made clear the insanity that grips the entire human family. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with a yearning for a more spiritual life. An open heart is all that's required to begin down a path to enlightenment. Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, Krishna, and others pointed to this same path. But many of their words became obscured with the egoistic mind of mankind. You needn't change religions, but rather re-read your scriptures with wide open eyes. For the first time I realized what many of Jesus' words were really about.<br />There's nothing hard here. It's quite simple and almost obvious after hearing from Eckhart's un-obscured view of life. Enjoy!...
B00005KHJR|5.0|Long on plot and characters, short on gore and shock tactics. This is like a finely crafted novella, and executed almost flawlessly. My only complaint is the almost cheesy music-video-like scene of the inn-keepers daughter tempting the doomed officer. The ending is superb. I can't recommend this film enough. Ignore the 87 vs 100 min debate, even the short version is good.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty, an artist just slightly behind his time (he only missed the late 60's rock scene by about ten years), has always been a master of pop songs that mean something-- when you think about them, they're really quite deep and thoughtful, but just the same, they're so damn groovy to listen to! FULL MOON FEVER is a classic example-- here's Tom, out there breakin hearts by himself (yuk yuk), old enough to think about some stuff but still not too old to simply have a great time. This is arguably Petty's most commercial album (certainly Jeff Lynne had a big influence), and also arguably his most fun. It is the PERFECT Summer album-- just picture putting it on, and cruising down the interstate to &quot;Free Fallin&quot; or &quot;Running Down A Dream.&quot; It will put you in an instant good mood-- this is sunny Southern California music with a little detour down Abbey Road. In addition to the hit singles (which continue to recieve a lot of airplay on classic rock stations), there's also a teriffic Byrds cover (&quot;Feel A Whole Lot Better&quot;), a beautifully touching lullaby (&quot;All Right For Now&quot;), a Dylanesque Wilbury romp (&quot;A Mind With A Heart Of Its Own&quot;), a teriffic rock n' roll number with a slight nod to Buddy Holly (&quot;The Apartment Song&quot;-- check out the bridge), and a pure novelty tune, &quot;Zombie Zoo&quot; (which will ALWAYS bring a smile to me face). There's also &quot;Yer So Bad,&quot; which sort of points towards his later 90's work with Rick Rubin. It would be hard to find a sunnier album from Tom Petty than this-- you can just tell he was having a blast. I'm really more of a fan of his later work, like WILDFLOWERS and ECHO, but there's no denying this is a wonderful album, probably the one I'd reccommend besides Greatest Hits to anyone just mildly interested in Petty's work. Whaddaya waiting for? Go Get It!! (And vote for the review too, hee hee!)
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm sure this has been already said, but I think this album has changed for me since 9/11.  The lyrics have all new meaning. This is my favorite Dylan album, now.  I got this a week before the 11th and was blown away by it. But, now that thing's have changed.... listen to the album again, and you can't help but wonder what Bob knows that we don't.  This album took on a completely new meaning afterward. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. As for the album, In my opinion its way better than time out of mind's heavy handed production. This reminds me more of the slash and burn feeling of the sixties albums like highway 61 revisited and such... Its his best in twenty or so years. If you've never bought a dylan album don't hesitate this is a great place to start. If you can't stand his voice, then you really can't stand yourself either, so don't bother. Listen to tweedle dee and tweedle dum and tell me if Bob isn't a genius..
B00005OAIE|5.0|So pop rock might not be an accurate description of JM. I like to call it a little bit of Sting, Dave Matthews, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and some honey thrown in the pot to make what he does. John's music might be ambigious, but the emotion in his voice explains all the convictions that he sings about, and then some. Although the re-mixing on this album leaves a bit to be desired (I was somewhat disappointed by the changes in Wonderland), the addition of 3X5 was very much welcomed. From beginning to end, RFS helps bring out all types of emotions; No Such Thing, the opening track, Love Song For No One, and 3X5 invoking a need to dance, and the sweet but sad St. Patrick's Day instilling a feeling of sadness and sorrow, yet hope for a better day. This is one cd that you would like to have in your collection if you are a big acoustic fan, like DMB or Sting, or just want to find something a little different. Also, for the bit superstitious, try and figure out why there is no #13 track on the cd.
B00003CXXI|4.0|Shrek is a film I enjoyed watching just as much as my 11 year old and 9 year old children did. The main character in this computer animated fairy tale is an ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers). He's not handsome, he's not friendly and he's not happy. But his life changes when he sets off to rescue a princess from the mean and conceited Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow). Accompanied by a witty donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), he outsmarts a fire-breathing dragon and tolerates a strong-willed princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz). When he falls in love with the princess he faces his greatest challenge and that is to feel worthy of her love. There's a transformation after they kiss which is the big surprise in this movie. From its &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; beginning to its &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; ending, Shrek will warm your heart, tickle your funny bone and remind us all of the true meaning of beauty. Keep in mind that Shrek is rated PG and there are scenes that might be scary for young children.
6300246787|5.0|Contrary to what people say about this movie and that is including Barbra herself. Hello Dolly! is one entertaining, wonderfully choreographed with gorgeous costumes and beautiful music musical. In my opinion this is one of Barbra's best. Yes, she was young for this role but her acting, singing and costumes make this fan very happy, this movie is Barbra being who she really is BARBRA STREISAND, anything this woman touches is gold. The music is fun, the actors are great including Walter Matthau and Michael Crawford who in my opinion carry off their roles very well. This movie is for any Barbra Streisand fan who enjoy's great performances and wants to feel great afterwards. Love this movie, I wish it were on DVD.<br />Randi Grogan
B00004U8JU|5.0|This movie may not have been Oscar material, but it is a great movie.  I'm a big Sam Neill fan, and his performance as Dr. Alan Grant is wonderful!  The dinosuars are breath taking, and the story is rather concrete in comparison to its successor, The Lost World.  This is the best of the Jurassic Trilogy, followed far behind by JP3 and Lost World.  Buy it, rent it, and if you see it on DVD watch the documentary to see the CGI people pretending to be dinosaurs!
B00000J7SO|5.0|Bob Dylan's Street Legal was savaged by critics upon release and mysteriously most Dylan fans simply listened to the critics apparently in lieu of actually listening to this remarkable record. Dylan was reportedly going for the sound of his own Blonde on Blonde rather than appropriating Neil Diamond's stage act as some critics have charged(this was explored on Live at Budokan admittedly with essentially the same band heard here). How Dylanophiles got it so wrong about such a great record is beyond this listener. Changing of the Guards and Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)'s inclusions alone make Street Legal a must own for anyone interested in the art of songwriting. The material on this album is among Dylan's most obtuse, yet most rewarding upon investigation. These are fables and parables of a man at a spiritual crossroads along with the usual couple of uncanny blues. I find Street Legal to be among this great artist's most fascinating and thought provoking works. Annoying sax solos and all.
0743216458|4.0|Like just about everybody else who read this book, I did it in anticipation of the HBO miniseries, and was not dissappointed. Ambrose is a wonderful writer, capable of conveying his meaning in a terse, informative style, and his use of multiple perspectives and points of view from the various surviving men of Company E is wonderful.  <br />However, the book is not as good as it could have been. His research is sometimes sloppy. The lack of decent maps is appalling and really is my biggest complaint. If SLA Marshall (rather heavily criticized in the book, by Winters, at least) had written it would have contained dozens of illustrations and maps. The book has three, and they're not all that useful. Since the author only cites a half dozen books (not even the official history - Cross-Channel Attack) and relies largely on oral history, the book sometimes reads like a long college term paper. For example, he says that some captured German soldiers claimed they were really Polish, but did not bother to find out whether they were or not. Anyway, this is a good book about WWII and should be read by everybody interested in the subject, but not perfect.
B00005LMBK|4.0|When I heard the Gorillaz for the first time, it was, of course, their single \\"Clint Eastwood\\".  Judging by the single, I assumed the CD was rap.  I am not much of a rap fan, but it was unique enough to warrant a purchase.  Imagine my surprise when I found the CD was not rap but, I'm not sure what to call it, so I'll say techno-pop w/rap-style beats.  Anyway, on a first listen, I thought it 'bit.'  After a few times, however, I realized it was actually a cool CD, with interesing vocal styles, cool beats, and very unique music.  While there are a few songs I don't like, all in all it's a pretty good CD.  I highly recommend it, mainly because it is unlike anything else I have heard before, but don't expect \\"Clint Eastwood\\".  The rest of the CD is like the single, minus the rapper.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Although fans seem split over the issue of the Enterprise crew coming upon a 20th Century piece of space hardware, this first foray to the silver screen marks one of the best Star Trek's ever.  Leonard Maltin's review is on the mark.
0131103628|5.0|This book is really a classic. The brevity of the text, reflects just how simple the language actually is. Do not get me wrong C programming can be difficult, but name any new language where you can almost store all of it's basic constructs inside your head. Anyway this book is a great place to begin with std C.
B00005NWRS|5.0|This is the first Ryan Adams album I have ever bought.  I bought it because I am a hugh Counting Crows fan and Adam Duritz not only plugged this album during recent concerts; but also sings on &quot;Rosalie Come and Go&quot;.  All I can say is WOW!!!! The lyrics are wonderful.  When a song makes me examine my own emotions and actions, I know it is a keeper.  There are too many on this album that do that to even count.  The music is absolutely beautiful.  Don't let the fact that Ryan and Whiskeytown have been classified as Country Rock.  I think this album transcends into all types of musical genre.  This will not be the last Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown album I ever buy.  I can't wait to sample more Ryan Adams.
B00003CX7L|5.0|this probably goes without saying. My 3 yr old son and I think Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were one of the greatest movies. We watch it over and over again and enjoy it every time!
0312263511|5.0|As a diehard Apollo fan,  I will read anything on the subject and enjoy it; however, I realise that some books' technical information would maybe make it a boring read for someone only faintly curious. NOT THIS BOOK!  I would recommend this to anyone who wished to know more about Apollo.  Cernan tells the story in a rivetting and enlightening way, yet thoroughly entertaining too.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Truly well done movie. Warm, funny, and extremely entertaining!<BR>Both me and my 3 yr. old son were able to enjoy this together. Although, he didn't get some of the jokes, he still loved the movie and sat for the entire time just totally amused! I'd highly recommend this one.
0812548094|5.0|After I read Wizard's First Rule, I was addicted, but I didn't think it could get any better.  However, Stone of Tears surpassed my expectations.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It's a great story and it has deeper value as well.  I really care about the characters, and everything that happens to them is just so engrossing and complex.  I had a hard time putting it down and lost sleep over it.  My mind has been miles away, in the Midlands and the Old World, not in middle class suburbia where it belongs.  I think that the author is a genious.
6302250269|4.0|This is a must for every woman on the planet. Susan Sarandons performance is A+ as usual and geena Davis does an excellant job playing the ditzy Thelma. These girls put new meaning into the word friendship. Great movie to watch with your best girlfriend.
0062502182|5.0|I am 17 years old. Needless to say, I have not read as many good books as most people. I do know however that the Alchemist is something special. I can safely say it has changed the way I think about myself and the way I think. This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful and powerful books I have ever read. It is enriching, and can literally improve your mental health. I recommend it to anyone willing to get lost in its journey. One of the, if not the best book I have ever read.
B0000035E7|4.0|this is Nirvana's debut album and most people heard it AFTER the media targeting of NEVERMIND, or incesticide, or even their best album, IN UTERO, that is why a large group do not like this album. You have to keep in mind that this is an album of a growing Nirvana...a more experimental Kurt Cobain, a diffrent sound of drums by chad channing, and an extra guitar.  though it is not the Nirvana everyone is use to hearing, it is the begining for one of the best bands of all time, and it is a great sample of their future music with their grunge powered, anxious determination to set a course for themselves to be raw and to the point with musical drama only they can produce...
B00004Z459|1.0|I don't know how this boy band got signed right out of High School.  These guys are the Kriss Kross of the new Millenium.  They have commercialized the last strong genre of rock.  These [guys] are sellouts so if you still buy clearasil and eminem you'll love this piece of schlock.
B0000013GT|5.0|Never heard a better Album. It's simply the best CD I got.<BR>Just listen to &quot;E.T.&quot; &amp; &quot;Growing Old&quot; and you'll understand me.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is ground-breaking film-making at it's finest.  Full of revelations, this movie is a complex study of the human psyche.  Paul Thomas Anderson gives you a variety of characters whom, from all logical standpoints, you should despise.  A self proclaimed womanizer, a gold-digging cheating wife, a drug addict etc.  But you don't hate the characters you would think you would.  Instead you see into their innermost souls.  You can understand and empathize with their lives.  It allows you to understand what compels people to make the choices they do, while taking little pity on them.  It gives you a behind the facade look at characters that film rarely portrays.      It is intensely smart. PTA juggles these seemingly unrelated characters flawlessly, and not in an \\"in your face\\" manner either.  PTA does not insult his audiences intelligence.  He lets you make your own associations at your own pace.  Three times in the movie he links all of the characters together.  He does this simply.  1) Through watching a popular television show.  2) Through singing a popular song.  3) Through an unexplainable act of nature.  All of us are connected through such things.  On a deeper level it reminds us that we are all connected just by being humans on the earth. Many did not understand the meaning of the frogs. The reference is partly biblical as other reviews say, though I also have a personal opinion on them.  All of these characters were so absorbed in their own lives, their own problems.  They could not see outside of their issues into the real world.  Then you have a freak of nature in which frogs start to fall from the sky, thereby putting all of these peoples \\"huge problems\\" into comparative perspective.  It brings them back into reality, reminds them we live in an unsure world and you don't always know what is going to happen next.  It also bonds the people for having witnessed this \\"act of god\\".    You can watch this movie time and time again each time taking away a new meaning and a new level of understanding.  At three hours it is not for the thrill seeking movie goer.  Rather it's for those who enjoy thought provoking, ground-breaking, intriguing movie making.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Since &quot;Good As I Been To You&quot; Bob Dylan has been consciously revisiting and re-exploring the folk/blues roots from which he first sprang, some 40 years ago. In &quot;Love and Theft&quot; he presents a continuing synthesis of much that he has learnt from this rich musical tradition. From tunes that swing like a '40s jazz band, to the pared back blues of &quot;High Water&quot;, the gentle country flavour of &quot;Po' Boy&quot; (an ironic reposte to Johnny Cash's idyllic &quot;Country Boy&quot;?), or the honky tonk undercurrent that rumbles rhythmically beneath many of the songs, Dylan shows that his knowledge and mastery of musical Americana is vast and timeless. In &quot;High Water&quot; alone references to Elmore James, Johnny Cash, the folk standard &quot;Cuckoo is a Pretty Bird&quot;, all presented above a Pete Seegar-style banjo riff, swirl effortlessly within a compound collection of one hundred years of blues history. In the bonus disk with which &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is packaged Dylan provides a deliberate artifact of his musical heritage, and a glimpse of the circular journey which his career has enacted (albeit a journey that has offered more than its fair share of dramatic diversions and enigmatic revelations). &quot;I Was Young When I Left Home&quot; shows Dylan in his earliest incarnation, a pseudo-Woody Guthrie newly arrived in New York and proclaiming his own history of &quot;hard-travellin'&quot;. In &quot;Love and Theft&quot; Dylan shows that he no longer needs to invent such a posture. He has done his own &quot;hard-travellin'&quot; and in so doing arrived at an album that presents his own, sometimes painfully acquired, wealth of personal and musical experience.
B00004WGAA|5.0|If this is the DIAMOND version of this film, together with HORROR HOTEL, I can only recommend it, as for the mere 7 dollars you get superb picture-sound quality and two good flicks! Thanks, Diamond!
B00000IREA|4.0|BARBARELLA is one of a few cult films that can be called a &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of cultdom.  Jane Fonda's titillating sci-fi adventure is an endless, trippy delight.<br />Barbarella is a futuristic girl from Earth who is called on to retrieve Duran-Duran, a noted scientist, from the evil planet of SoGo.  On her perilous (and quite sexy) journey she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Phillip Law), and battles the Black Queen (Anita Pallenberg) along with various sexual torture devices.<br />The film is hilarious, from the Black Queen's catch-cry of &quot;pretty pretty pretty&quot; to the hoard of evil children with what look like rabid Cabbage Patch dolls.  Barbarella's anti-gravity striptease during the opening credits is a hoot, too.<br />BARBARELLA was directed by Roger Vadim (then the husband of Jane Fonda), and is full of vintage 60's retro influence.<br />The DVD also includes the trailer.
B00004W199|5.0|DIAMOND has currently produced a DVD of this film, coupled with another good flick, HORROR HOTEL. The picture-sound quality of this release was absolutely superb,and it was a mere 7 dollars. You might want to check it out!
B0000060NF|5.0|I remember hearing the title track of &quot;What's Going On&quot; while in junior high school; I thought it was a really good song. Over the years, it's become - to me - the greatest R&amp;B single ever cut. And this album - again, to me - is the finest moment that Motown ever had. That's interesting because this is the album that literally broke the motown mold and went off in its own direction. Marvin had had enough of the sweet, cute, lovey songs that motown had produced over the years. With all due respect, many of those songs are wonderful and remain hugely successful today.<br />But this was different. This album spoke to real people going through real-life situations in a real world that seemed to be moving in the wrong direction. It gave us all perspective, and it spoke from the heart.<br />Musically, I can't think of a more beautiful melody than the title cut, and you've just got to listen over and over and over again to the literal crying of the opening sax solo. The whole album blends together wonderfully; it simply cannot be played out.<br />For those interested in a fabulous article that traces the making of this fabulous recording in great detail, find a copy of MOJO Magazine #64. The magazine is published in England, and they have a website that might help. This article is well-written, and will provide the perfect companion to those who want to learn more about one of the greatest recordings of all time.
1559409002|5.0|I have currently purchased a DIAMOND DVD double feature Carnival of Souls / Horror Hotel, and I can recommend it heartily, because you pay only about 7 dollars and get two good flicks, The picture-sound quality of Carnival is especially good. There are no extras, so if you are interested in these, you better take the 35 dollar package.
B000053V7Q|5.0|I've been hearing a lot about how they've butchered the original movie with this bastardised version but I must say that there's really not that much of difference and, in fact, is in many ways a better movie as a result. The intro has been recut along with a lot of the boring crowd reactions but lets face facts here folks what we want to see and hear is the man singing and clowning around both on and off the stage and that's exactly what you get here.<br />I'll admit that I wasn't exactly a huge Elvis fan before I invested in this dvd, (I'm more of a Metallica / Alice in Chains man myself) and my memories of the King were mostly of the god-awful movies he made in the late 60s and 70's. However as soon as the movie intro kicked in I knew I was about to experience something very special indeed. I'm lucky in that I have a pretty decent home cinema setup with a widescreen t.v., DD amp and 6 speakers and to be honest listening to this movie with anything less in almost criminal. The sound, while it doesn't quite reach the peaks of more recent releases like Metallica's S&amp;M, is simply superb especially when you consider it was shot and recorded over 30 years ago - I was 1 year old then. I noticed a few reviews were complaining about the sound quality and I'm afraid those people are either talking out of their arses or they were listening to it through a single speaker 12inch black and white portable t.v. set. Trust me, the sound is more than adequate. Kudos must also go to the restoration team on the excellent image quality of the movie - the correctly matted anamorphic transfer, while not 100% perfect, looks like it might have been shot last week.<br />As for Elvis' performance: well I can't say in this short review about the range of emotions experienced while watching it. I have to say that I was completely in awe of the man as he strutted his stuff, acted the clown, sang like a God, danced like a demon and made out with the entire female audience. If you are in any way unsure about getting this disc I urge you to just go and get it - you most definitely won't regret it. And make sure you TURN IT UP.
B000002UKS|5.0|The Foo Fighters are the best band ever.  This is their best CD.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Having been a big AIC fan for some time I was looking forward to this compilation and must say that I wasn't disappointed. If you own a decent home cinema setup with a DD5.1 amp and 6 speakers you are in for a real treat. Most of their classic songs are included here and all have been remixed into sexy DD 5.1 (there's also a PCM stereo track). All sound superb though a couple of the remixes aren't as good as they might have been. The majority of the videos are excellent and have stood the test of time very well, although some are now a bit long in the tooth yet still retain a certain novelty value. The addition of about 15 minutes worth of the band's own home movies are excellent and provide a genuine and hilarious insight behind the scenes. <br />Overall this a very worthy purchase and comes highly recommended - especially if you like your 5.1 music turned up loud. Now if only Foo Fighters and Aerosmith would get their acts together and bring out the same sort of compilation.

B000020617|5.0|Another excellent album from Dave and the Foo Fighters
B00005NWRS|4.0|Are we all expecting a bit too much from the much-heralded and hyped Ryan Adams? Reading some of the press reviews, not to mention the editorial review above, you'd think this was a big disappointment, a blasphemy on the revered Ryan Adams/Whiskeytown catalogue. Heck, forget he's 'the new Gram Parsons', 'the saviour of alt.country' or a messenger from God. He's a guy with a knack for writing some incredibly good songs. <br />'Gold' is a different kettle of fish to 'Heartbreaker', which was in turn a progression from the purer country templates of Whiskeytown's 'Stranger's Almanac' and 'Faithless Street'. It's a progression which leaves me wondering if Ryan's music can be called alt.country anymore. I'm sure he'd probably call it Cosmic American Music if forced to come up with a label.. Whatever it is, it's a glorious sound. And one which is similar in style to the posthumous Whiskeytown album, 'Pneumonia'. Except luckily, this time we get no such unwlecome intruders as 'Paper Moon'.<br />Elton John recently said that Ryan could break hearts singing a telephone directory, something I can't disagree with upon listening to 'Gold'. There are some great tracks on 'Gold', but even on the less outstanding tunes, Ryan brings them upto scratch with his resonating virtuouso vocals. There are though a couple of cuts which I think could've been omitted given it's a flabby 16 tracks and 70mins long, (like 'Enemy Fire' and 'Sylvia Plath') but overall, it all hangs together pretty well. The opening 7 songs are as good as any album introduction. The rootsy, rollicking 'New York..' is a fine uptempo cut, 'Somehow, Someday' sounds like the most classic pop song ever, and 'La Cienega..' is just a thing of pure beauty. Further in, 'Gonna Make You Love Me' is reminiscent of the bluesy opener on 'Heartbreaker', and is similarly invigorating. 'Harder now That It's Over' and 'Wild Flowers' press all the right buttons in a heartbreaking ballad kind of way, and will no doubt have audiences in floods of tears at Ryan's live shows. <br />Whether 'Gold' leaves some of us feeling slightly disappointed or not, in my mind Ryan Adams is the only guy around who can write songs like the ones on show here. I have never felt so in love with music. He's pretty much one of a kind. Maybe a living legend even.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I'm not sold on the idea that this is &quot;the greatest American film&quot;. Even if it's true, if giving it that label discourages someone from seeing this movie, that's a shame. It's great, but it's also completely accessible, and terrific fun. If you haven't seen it, rent it some night.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I began collecting Diana Krall a few years ago because she was a shining example of a newfound jazz recording artist, blessed with a great voice and outstanding piano skills. And we'd get these showcased talents before a small trio or quartet of jazz musicians. But lately her artistry is buried playing love songs with an orchestra. If anyone is looking for watered down easy-listening stuff, go for it. But this is NOT jazz. I guess I'll have to catch her on the way down.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I've been waiting for this cd since I heard the D early this year. From Keilbasa to City Hall, this cd wil Rock Your Socks Off. I was concerned that the D wouldn't have the same effect on me seeing that it was more that JB and KG, but it just makes it that much better. The extra funky grooves in Double Team (sex Supreme) are so awesome. The cd has a play time of 50+ minutes and it's well worth the money. If you like tasty grooves, killer vocals and nice guitar, then this cd is for you. Taking over the world, one D-ciple at a time.
B00003CY3W|5.0|If you are looking for an intelligent,hilarious film, this is the one.  Steve Bucemi is his regular quirky self and Thora Birch is as good if not better than her role in American Beauty. It is worth seeing for the mini-mart scenes with acid washed jean man. Stay til after the credits...you won't be disappointed.  the movie is set to an amazing soundtrack (think Oh brother where out thou) and there are glimspes of some very fun artistic pieces. Can't wait to own on DVD!
B00005N9CV|2.0|I've long been of the opinion that Ms. Krall is a victim of her own publicity and of the hype that says anyone who looks as good as she does must sound good too.<BR>Sorry but she doesn't hold a candle to any real singer of jazz and she should stick to playing the piano where she's at least competent.  Compared to Ella, Sassy or Dinah Washington, the blonde bombshell from Nanaimo, B.C. is more of a bomb.  Even as a pianist she can't match Marian McPartland or Jeri Southern.  In fact she could learn a thing or two about singing from Jeri and a whole lot about piano-playing from Marian.<BR>This album is overproduced and the talents of Claus Ogermann are wasted.  Krall needs to learn breath control, phrasing and timing.  I suggest she spend some time listening to Sinatra, Bennett or same-sex singers like Nancy and Cassandra Wilson, Diane Schuur and Lena Horne.  They don't break lyrics in the wrong places or scoop notes to compensate for missing them on the first try.  The album might better have been titled, &quot;The ballad is my undoing.&quot;<BR>She should stick to what she does best, rhythmic and swingy  numbers like &quot;Frim Fram Sauce,&quot; &quot;I'm an errand girl for rhythm&quot; and &quot;Popsicle toes.&quot;  Better yet, she should sing no more often than every second time she sits down at the piano.
0451191153|1.0|This is certainly and most definitely the most boring book i have read in my whole life.<br />There is a lot of hype created around this book and that is why i think a lot of them thinks that if the book is not liked by them then they are not literally normal...

B00005LC4B|5.0|Only Scorsese(and DeNiro)could take a masterpeice from 1962,and remake it into a more curent(29 yrs later)terrifying, claustrophobic white knuckle ride, that keeeps you wondering about the outcome, EVEN though you know the outcome!<BR> While the plot has been changed enough to keep up with the times,Scorsese's complete love &amp; his &quot;awe&quot; for the original, shine through, &amp; while it's unfortunate that the original composer of this film's music, Berhnard Herrman was not alive to score this film(he died right after finishing Taxi Driver)the 1991 score is treated with such reverence, it could be thought to have been done by Herrman...what compelling music!<BR> Some critics originally thought DeNiro's performance of Max Cady was a bit over the top, I feel it is one of his finest performances...completely believeable, &amp; staggering in it's horrifiying deranged nature. His Southern accent was perfected by another of DeNiro's &quot;method acting&quot;, time consumming approach, which he recently used in the fine, &quot;Men of Honor&quot;. How could such a brilliant actor EVER be considered to be &quot;over the top&quot; in any of his performances?<BR> While I 1st veiwed this film in a theater, the way it must somehow be veiwed, Scorsese's use of the camera's in many close-up's,(to make the viewer feel like the actor's are made to feel)&amp; the total claustrophobic feeling that the viewer is meant to experience is &quot;almost&quot; accomplished in the DVD.<BR> This Special edition DVD, is very similar to the fantastic, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; Collector's Edition, in the regard that the Capr Fear documentary, and actor's &amp; director's commentaries are superb and enough of a reason to buy this DVD.If you feel as I do about Scorsese's directorial abilities(no-one is better)then we can only hope he will also release &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD's of his other incredible work!!(Mean Street's-Raging Bull-Goodfella's-Casino-King of Comedy-NY,NY-ect.)PleaseMr. Scorsese, give us faithful more...you MUST do a Special ED. of &quot;Raging Bull&quot;<BR> Summing it up, there is not a medicore performance in this film, in fact every actor's role here was Oscar worthy, and it was the breakthrough for young Julia's career.(Much Like Jodie Foster's was in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;!!)<BR> Let's face it, while most critics feel Speilberg is the greatest director of the last 30 year's(possibly he IS the HOLLYWOOD version of our finest director)it is Martin Scorsese's shorter body of work that will historically hold him as our most talented movie artist.<BR> DeNiro is without a question the finest actor we have ever seen...Buy this DVD.
B00003CX9E|4.0|Now is your best chance to overcome your dislike for Citizen Kane. And if you already love the film you should be in hog Heaven. <br /> Citizen Kane is the story of a man taken out of his childhood at a young age who rises to greatness by creating a great newspaper empire to become one of the most powerful and influential men in the United States. He has friends, money love and an extravagant palatial estate called Xanadu high in the hills and above the world. Eventually all the treasures of his life become corrupted and lost by his own folly, jealousy and manipulations. This once powerful man lies in solitude longing for the things he lost in his life. He dies with one final word on his lips. &quot;Rosebud&quot; A reporter eager to make a story of the great man and decides his angle will be to decipher the meaning of this final word that is a mystery even to Kane's closest friends. It is through this reporter's investigation we learn the life of Charles Foster Kane. <BR> Very few people watching the film today have any personal recollection of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul and yellow journalist upon whom the film is based. Nor are we much aware of the films being made at that time to give us a perspective on the many new innovations introduced by this film.<BR>But most of us are familiar and comfortable with Roger Ebert who gives you a walkthrough on the film in one of the two commentary tracks. And there is a two hour documentary as well as scads of interviews and extras to make you expert enough at the film to pose at any Hollywood party as the boorish film snob you have always longed to be. And maybe if you are lucky you may even decide you like the film. If not there is still one bit of drama on the DVD you are sure to enjoy and that is the original Halloween broadcast of Orson Welles &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. The radio broadcast that scared America and almost drove one woman to suicide. <BR> This DVD truly is a filmschool in a box and from what I can see, a pretty reasonable price for a double disc set. This film can help fans, non-fans and new viewers to appreciate this acclaimed film on new levels in a way never before available.
1559408855|1.0|Why should I have any respect for a film that is as pointless as watching a dog chew a bone?People who have seen the film tell me that Pasolini made the film to show the true ways of our human nature and how bad people can be.What a bunch of crock!This is the most violating and sickest film I have seen.Hey,I like watching graphic films but I have my limits and this film goes way over that limit.\\"Salo,or the 120 Days of Sodom\\" is worthless,pointless,violating and the most trashiest,sleaziest sickest film ever made.Who cares if Pasolini was an artist.I have no respect for this film or Pasolini.How can I after what I have seen.I rather be strapped to a chair and be forced to watch \\"Battlefield Earth\\" repeatly.Another film that I didn't like.[...]God,I hate this film.
B000055XMF|4.0|I have been a big fan of the who for a long time.  I was really excited for this DVD release, and just watched the whole thing cover to cover.  <br />I think Rhino did a great job putting this DVD together, except for perhaps the packaging, which should have had more reading material, pictures etc.  Obviously these things are on the DVD itself (pictures, reading) but for those of us who like printed stuff, it is a drag.  They could have put a poster in there or something. <br />The Vespa \\"mini-doc\\" is actually just an ADVERTISEMENT, but it is still cool.  I would have prefered more information about Vespas and Vespa History. <br />Other than those two little gripes, the whole thing looks spectacular and sounds fantastic.  Rhino did a great job cleaning up the picture, sound and creating great menus.  Being a techie, I especially liked the restoration section where they compare the old to the new.  Great idea.<br />Anyway, as Sting says, this movie is still relevant today, and the music is still ROCKS!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I am 27 years old.  I grew up with metal like Black Sabbath, Napalm Death, Megadeth, (early)Metallica, TOOL, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden.  I avoided Linkin Park like the plague thinking that their all too friendly MTV image would not satisfy my most primal metal urges.  I was wrong.  It is indeed rare to find a debut album of such complexity and richness.  Hybrid Theory plays as a complete album, there are no throw away tracks here.  I wasn't sure I liked Chester Bennington's voice at first but after hearing &quot;Crawling&quot; a few times I came to realize that he's got a great voice.  He's no Rob Halford or Bruce Dickinson but he's up there amongst today's vocalists (except for Serj from System of a Down).  This cd is a true &quot;hybrid&quot; of metal and hip-hop influences.  Linkin Park uses two vocalists, one singing and one rapping along with a dj and the results are spectacular.  The best two tracks are A Place for My Head and Forgotten but all of the other tracks are way above average.  So if you've shown slight interest into this band but have shyed away because of their link to commercial interests, I say take the plunge it's well worth it.  Hybrid Theory will be the first of many important releases from this band.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

0140186409|5.0|This is easily one of the best books that I have ever read.  I was one of the few in my 12th grade english/history class that read the entire thing from cover to cover.  It tells the story of the Joad family during the great depression and the dust bowl.  They make their way from their desolate farm land in the mid-west to california to find work in the many orchards and farms.  This is an american epic that no one should skip reading.  The only one complaint that I and many other people have with the book is the last line or two.  It does not ruin the book but really hurts it's quality.
B000002KDO|5.0|Not only is this the best album by Black Sabbath, it's the best album ever. This has everything you want in a heavy metal band. Doomy lyrics, powerful guitars, pounding bass, and teriffic drums. Ozzy sings on his trademark wail on this song. Every song is great, and it's only a half hour! After Forever and Lord Of This World are the best unknown classics. The entire album is great. Much better than Paranoid. The solo on &quot;Into The Void&quot; made me play metal. Such a great album. Tony Iommi is the master of riffing. And listen to those instrumentals. Wow! Not very complex, but still beatiful. And Solitude is a great balld with nice flute. GET IT NOW!

B00005NP04|5.0|Possessed of one of the most compelling voices in the genre of country music, Martina McBride is also one of the few artists in that particular genre to give us a steady output of consistently excellent material, as this compilation attests to.  She's also that rare breed that can gravitate successfully between serious subject matter('Independence Day', 'Love's The Only House') and more lightweight fare('I Love You', 'My Baby Loves Me')with relative ease.  Though she does latch on to an occasional clunker--the sappy 'Wrong Again' ranks among her absolute worst, despite being a #1 single--for the most part she's spot-on. The four new tracks continue that trend.  'When God-Fearin' Women Get The Blues' is somewhat atypical for McBride in comparison to her recent, more pop-oriented material, but the honky-tonker is a welcome respite from the pop fluff saturating country radio.<br />'Where Would You Be' is a sterling ballad, featuring a typically first-rate vocal performance.  'Blessed' is the least essential of the new tracks, though it's still a solid uptempo number.  Which brings us to 'Concrete Angel', a stark ballad focusing on<br />child abuse that continues McBride's crusade to convey relevant social messages through song. Though not as subtle as, say Suzanne Vega's 'Luka', it's still a stunning work that may be far too sophisticated and adult for the narrow boundaries of country radio.  As good a collection of songs as you'll find anywhere, from an artist who continues to astonish.
0140386335|5.0|When I was younger my brother, sister and I would watch this movie all of the time.  When I was 17 years old I went on a book reading spree and read all of the classic fantasy books that I so much loved as movies.  This was a great movie but it is an amazing book.  I suggest reading this book if you have seen the movie or not.  If you have not seen the movie please read the book first so you are able to make an informed comparison later on.  I highly recommend parents read this to their children especially befors they have a chance to watch the movie.

B00005NZBN|5.0|Since &quot;Good As I Been To You&quot; Bob Dylan has been consciously revisiting and re-exploring the folk/blues roots from which he first sprang, some 40 years ago. In &quot;Love and Theft&quot; he presents a continuing synthesis of much that he has learnt from this rich musical tradition. From tunes that swing like a '40s jazz band, to the pared back blues of &quot;High Water&quot;, the gentle country flavour of &quot;Po' Boy&quot; (an ironic reposte to Johnny Cash's idyllic &quot;Country Boy&quot;?), or the honky tonk undercurrent that rumbles rhythmically beneath many of the songs, Dylan shows that his knowledge and mastery of musical Americana is vast and timeless. In &quot;High Water&quot; alone references to Elmore James, Johnny Cash, the folk standard &quot;Cuckoo is a Pretty Bird&quot;, all presented above a Pete Seegar-style banjo riff, swirl effortlessly within a compound collection of one hundred years of blues history. In the bonus disk with which &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is packaged Dylan provides a deliberate artifact of his musical heritage, and a glimpse of the circular journey which his career has enacted (albeit a journey that has offered more than its fair share of dramatic diversions and enigmatic revelations). &quot;I Was Young When I Left Home&quot; shows Dylan in his earliest incarnation, a pseudo-Woody Guthrie newly arrived in New York and proclaiming his own history of &quot;hard-travellin'&quot;. In &quot;Love and Theft&quot; Dylan shows that he no longer needs to invent such a posture. He has done his own &quot;hard-travellin'&quot; and in so doing arrived at an album that presents his own, sometimes painfully acquired, wealth of personal and musical experience.
B0000541AM|4.0|This movie is not for sissies.<BR>Excellent action sequences.<BR>A classic Walter Hill action/adventure movie.<BR>Violent? Yes!<BR>But its about comradrey and, it is also a thinly veiled coming of age movie where at least one of the street gang members slowly begin to realize that the live they live may not be worth much.<BR>This is the clearest definition of what a &quot;guy&quot; movie is.<BR>The fight scene at Union Square Station is on of the best, if not the best group fight scenes in American cinema.<br />Probably the one movie to erroniously scare tourists away from New York City.<BR>Trust me, the city was never that bad<BR>but, this movie is pretty good!
B00000IPGT|5.0|I have been hooked on Monty Python since I was young.  It seems that eveyone knows of the mainstream movie &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; but very few people know that Monty Python used to be a popular british television series.  The Life of Brian is a great movie.  Being the Python troops second movie it is more complete and edited a lot better than the sketch type format of &quot;Holy Grail&quot;.  Some may not find this movie as slapstick hilarious as &quot;Holy Grail&quot; but instead one must pay more attention to the suddle comedy and satirity that it presents.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Unlike his earlier solo work and his work with WhiskeyTown, the songs on the album don't seem to have a common sound or pace. Usually each album has a distinct sound. This album has many.  It goes from typical slow, tangy Adams to some pretty upbeat stuff. Overall not as many suicidal depressing songs as his earlier stuff. Only one song has anything to do with Alcohol in the title. <BR> When the Stars Go Blue is great. Nobody Girl is pretty cool. Its a nine minute song that starts all twangy and continues to get more rock like and upbeat until the end where it sounds like a totally different song. Gonna Make You Love Me has a cool sound. Touch, Feel, Blues is kind cool, tough to describe but a nice sound. Unlike anything I've ever heard from him. Street Walking Blues also dosen't sound remotely like any Adams work I've ever heard, its way to fast paced for that. It works well though. <br />        On the Limited Edition Disc. Sweet Black Magic is awesome. The picking in the background has a great rural North Carolina feel. Cannonball Days is pretty good as well. It's sound is kind like his first album, but its more fast paced. The Fools We Are As Men has a cool melody mixed in, but is kinda slow and dosent have much instramentals. Sounds kinda like a couple songs from his first album.<br />         Their are a couple misses but overall this album is real good. The jury is still out on whether or not its better than the first solo album however. More commercially viable? Yes. Better? I haven't listened to it long enough to tell. His stuff kinda grows on you. That said, it'll take a lot for this to replace Pneumonia as my favorite album. I don't know how the man keeps churning out the great music but he does.
B00003CY5K|3.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; actually puts forward this bizarre proposition. Of course by definition social organizations are cliques. There's nothing wrong with that, but it wouldn't hurt to at least give passing acknowledgment to this fact, instead of idealizing sororities as some sort of babe-filled Welcome Wagon.<br />But the movie is well-meaning, has a good spirit and makes a nice point about adapting to new environments while still being yourself. It also has a lot of funny moments.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This is far and away the greatest live rock'n'roll album ever made and is a clear blueprint for the punk explosion that followed in the 70s.  It is punk in both spirit and execution-from the slashing power chords of Pete Townshend to the maniacal drumming of Keith Moon.  Throughout you can hear Moon in the background shout in ecstasy as he plays the drums like a lead instrument.  Bassist John Entwistle doesn't just rely on tired blues figures but challenges and prods lead guitarist Pete Townshend by virtually soloing (on bass!) on each song.  Singer Roger Daltrey shouts and sings with a street-opera grandeur that he had not previously displayed to this time in The Who's career.<br />The Who's playing is a virtual primer in the use of feedback, soloing and improvision-all done with unbridled passion, power, and an absolute assurance.  The start-and-stop dynamics of \\"Fortune Teller,\\" \\"Young Man Blues,\\" \\"Summertime Blues,\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over\\" are unparalleled for rock excitement.  In the midst of these musical explosions, are interspersed inspired moments of quiet, echo, and the superb harmony singing of Daltrey and Townshend.<br />Furthermore, the extended jamming during \\"My Generation\\" (which clocks in at 15:24) and \\"Magic Bus\\" are perfect examples of how long, improvised soloing can be positively riveting. <br />The more pop-oriented material (\\"I'm a Boy,\\" \\"Tattoo,\\" \\"Substitute and \\"Happy Jack\\") are played with just the right mixture of deftness, grit, and humor. <br />This deluxe version expands the1995 re-mastered, \\"expanded\\" version of \\"Live at Leeds\\" to two discs. Here the second disc contains the Who's entire touring performance of \\"Tommy\\".  As the extensive liner notes point out, the entire series of songs that comprise the rock opera are played back to back without a break!  The booklet contains extensive notes of each song, a partial re-print of a review of the original Leeds concert and great black and white photographs of the concert. Underneath the plastic, see-through CD holders are reproductions of the posters and documents from the original LP (which was a mock bootleg record). The booklet even explains the original running order of the songs if you want to program the CDs to run in the exact order of the original Leeds concert!<br />The charged, dynamic playing on \\"Live at Leeds\\" is simply breathtaking.  If this doesn't move you, you don't have a heart beating in you or you don't like rock'n'roll.
0451450523|5.0|My sister and I grew up watching this movie all of the time at my aunt's house.  We used to have it on old CED disks.  It is a great animated movie but like 90% of all movies the book is 100 times better.  I finally got to read it when I was about 18 years old and should have been too old for booke of the sort but I loved it.  I recommend this book to any avid or casual fantasy book lover.  I am very surprised that there are not more reviews on it here.
B00005O3VC|5.0|My goodness.  I grew up with Monty Python, and I've seen this movie probably one hundred times.  Doubtless many of you have seen it more.  <br />Is this THE funniest movie ever made?  I wouldn't waste one second arguing the contrary.  Consider this - only two comedy &quot;acts&quot; are considered so seminal and influential that their names have entered into our descriptive lexicon: Chaplinesque and Pythonesque.  Monty Python and the Holy Grail is arguably the finest and most accessible example of all things Pythonesque.  Literary wit, scathing satire, religious irreverence, word-play, song and dance, political humor, slapstick, animation, a plethora of gore, men in drag, rabbits, coconuts and yelping cats - what else could anyone hope for in a movie?  (OK, there is no gratuitous sex, but the Castle Anthrax maidens sure tried!)<br />You do not have to be a Monty Python fan to love this movie. You will be once you've seen it.  (And the many times thereafter.)
B00005LMBK|5.0|Just buy it ... definately a pleasant suprise!  Who woulda though cartoon singers could be so good ?????
0449227545|3.0|Ken Follett's novel &quot;The Hammer of Eden&quot; is a good novel about terrorism, love and suspense. Follett has also written some great stories, his &quot;The Pillars of The Earth&quot;, &quot;The Man From St. Petersburg&quot;, and &quot;Eye Of The Needle&quot; are all generally regarded as excellent. It could be that this story does not measure up to his earlier works but &quot;The Hammer of Eden&quot; is fun to read and fast paced. It took me 2 days to read the entire story.<br />The plot is pretty straight forward; members of a commune in California's wine country try to prevent construction of a power plant near their property. Lead by a brilliant but illiterate criminal called Priest they devise a plan to create earthquakes. The FBI is called in to stop the eco-terrorism and story takes-off. Overall the characters are standard fare and they react pretty straight forward to very unusual set of circumstances.<br />What I enjoyed the most while reading this story is the writing. Follett is a master and the novel is very well written. The action is crisp, situations and descriptions are well illustrated.<br />If you are looking for a well written fun novel, look no further.
B000035P7X|5.0|I started listening to Bob Dylan when I was in 11th grade.  I was instantly hooked on how poetic he was.  I have attended two of his concerts and will be going to my third in Nov. of 2001.  As soon as I heard about this dvd I bought it.  It has given me a chance to be able to look back at Dylan in his younger years when he was first starting out as a musician.  He was cocky and loud at times but at others very quiet and solemn as he wrote his lyrics and practiced his music.  I recommend this dvd to all fans of Bob Dylan.  Don't let the grainy black and white film turn you off, it only turns this movie into the vintage masterpiece that it is.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Again Stevie Nicks has out done herself.A MUST HAVE for Stevie Nicks fans. It has a great mix of her own passions and tears.Exellent CD...
B00005MP58|4.0|Alright, I already wrote a review asking people to refrain from criticizing the dvd features of this &quot;special edition&quot; because, at the time, the only version available was a not-so-great, out of print edition with absolutely NO special features whatsoever(heck, the original version even lacked basic features like closed captioning and seamless episodes).  I finally received the Special Edition dvd yesterday and reviewed it excitedly.  It is, after all, the best movie ever made. :-) Anyhow, maybe it was all the anticipation.  Maybe I had set my hopes too high...or maybe this new special edition just plain sucked.  I don't know.  Let's just say I'm not impressed.  On the contrary, I'm pretty disappointed.  <br />But let's not start out negatively.  Let me first say that some things are improved for this edition.  First, there is closed captioning, which is great for those of us who want to know every word of this movie.  Second, the episodes are seamless, which is a nice change from the original.  Third, there is a behind the scenes &quot;making of&quot; featurette that is pretty interesting (but where neither Firth or Ehle are interviewed).  Fourth, it's the widescreen version.  And that's about it.  There's some biographies or whatever, but for the most part, that's all the &quot;special&quot; you're going to get.  No director commentaries, no cast interviews with the major stars, nothin'.<br />As for the picture quality, I can't quite put my finger on it, but I actually find myself disappointed by it.  The picture, although much crisper, was paler than the original version.  Everyone looked so pale.  I found myself readjusting my tv quite a bit.  Often times, Elizabeth seemed to blend into the background the coloring was that bad.  The original version had much warmer tones, which I enjoyed.  Everyone looks so sickly in this new version.  <br />In balancing, if I could only have one version, I'd probably stick to the first one.  The coloring on this special edition is really awful.  Of course, when all is said and done, this is still my favorite movie of all time and, I think, one that everybody should own, despite it's flaws.  That's why four stars--five stars for the content of this movie, but (-1) for its flawed presentation.
0792838068|2.0|I understand this movie is about &quot;unconditional love&quot;. I also realize there are some great performances here - that's why I gave it two stars. But it is so depressing! It's O.K. for movies to be dark, somber, and even depressing if they have some kind of social statement to make. But what does this movie say? That if a loved one is engaging in self-destructive behaviour, you shouldn't try to get them help? That you can't love someone and still refuse to condone what they are doing? Sorry, they missed the boat on this one.
B0000027RL|5.0|Yes, i know that this song isn't on the album but...<br />EDDIE VEDDER! what a voice!!  that's all i have to say!
B000055XMF|5.0|I had been waiting for this new transfer for years and I was not disappointed on arrival, this DVD is cram packed with features and a real enjoyment, there is a nice touch with a split screen of the old and new transfer of the film which is good to compare, the only problem was two scenes are ommitted from the movie, there is one seen where Phil Daniels says to Leslie Ash &quot;what do you mean am I gonna be one of the faces, I AM one of the faces&quot; now that was a line I used to shout round the school yard, we all did, the other is Phil Davis where they ridicule him and call him Chalky the ponce.. NOt essential but still I was left wondering why.. Overall this will not spoil the enjoyment of this excellent film and it was about time somebody did it justice and updated the print... Very Recommended..
B000056K04|2.0|FOR ME BEING AN VERY DIVERSE MUSIC FAN[AND LONG TIME DMB FAN],<BR>I was very disapointed with EVERYDAY.Where's the rawness and<BR>jazzy vibe of BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS? And what's up with<BR>the synthizers,pop sappiness,and blandness.Glen Ballard[EVERYDAY's mastermind] may work well with average-sounding<BR>artists like Alanis Morrisette.But Dave Matthews' moan,Tinsley's<BR>voilin,and Carter Beauford's precise drums are all the &quot;production&quot; they need.&quot;The Space Between&quot; is bland and<BR>pop but it is pretty and grows on you.My favorites on this album<BR>are &quot;Mother Father&quot; and the title track.That's when I actually<BR>heard the real Dave Matthews Band become the Dave Matthews Band<BR>again.EVERYDAY isn't horrid but it is a disapointment to a lot of<BR>DMB's fans!
B00003CY5K|3.0|Reese Witherspoon is very winning in the role of a &quot;Malibu Barbie&quot; who goes to Harvard, but, as The New Yorker puts it, the movie quickly &quot;declines into low-grade farce.&quot; Several so-called jokes aren't funny at all, but simply crude, a point parents may want to keep in mind. &quot;Clueless&quot; is a MUCH stronger film.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I don't know what some of these people were smoking when they wrote their reviews but they are flat out WRONG.  How can you have too much orchestra?  Ridiculous.  This is her best work to date.  Grammy award winner for sure.
B000059WOD|5.0|ITS A VERY GOOD CD I BOUGHT IT WHEN CRAWLING CAME OUT ON RADIO WHEN EVERY ONE HEARD ALL THE GOOD SONGS IT HAS THEY WANTED TO BARROW IT ALOT! ITS BEEN USED AND ABUSED ALOT (poor linkin park cd) MY FAVORITE SONG IS......POINTS OF AUTHORITY.........OTHER GOOD SONGS ARE........ PAPERCUT... ONE STEP CLOSER.....WELL ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ITS A GOOD CD.TWO WORDS (BUY IT) BEFORE IT GET KINDA OLD '.'
B000002X2B|5.0|As far as 1971 goes, it was the best of times and the worst of times.  This album was a personal departure point for me into the<BR>realm of the Revolution (that Never Happened)for America.  Great all around performances and solid vocals.  Lyrics that made you sit up and think.  Just a solid work by all involved--and there were a lot of people involved.
0553106635|5.0|A Storm Of Swords, is a great book, although it does have it slow points, but most books do. I dont usually start series books because I read pretty fast, and then have to wait a really long time for the next book to come out. But these books are worth it.  I cant wait for the 4th to come out, to bad it wont be till fall 2002.
0452282152|5.0|&quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is a heartbreakingly beautiful tale of a time and place few people know much about. Based on historical fact, what little of it there is anyway (the painting is real, the history behind it imagined, but well researched), this story of a young maid/muse in the house of legendary Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is a beautiful tale of love, jealousy and human nature. The characters are richly drawn and young girl, Griet, from whose perspective the story is told is a compelling and believable protagonist. <br />As interesting as the book's gentle plot (there are no big &quot;events,&quot; per se, but the book still manages to move along at a brisk pace), is the look at a culture little known to most Americans. &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; reminds me of other sweet, detail-oriented books I've read, such as &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; Both transported me to another time and place which, before reading these novels, I knew little about but have learned to love, thanks to the author's writing prowess.
B00005A46T|5.0|If you enjoyed Slipknot's awesome first cd, you will LOVE this one- It's just as heavy, just as intense, just as AWESOME! All songs are good, I can't pick a favorite. What I especially love about Slipknot's music is that their angry, negative sound is the perfect music after a bad day where I just feel like breaking everything in my path- Nothing gets my angry emotions out better. And if you like this, check out System of a Down's latest cd &quot;Toxicity&quot;- very similar &amp; just as good. Also check out Mudvayne's debut album &quot;L.D. 50&quot;
B000059MEK|4.0|Daft Punk knows what the audience wants. We don't want to be baffled with obscure avant-garde technological junk, nor do we want repetitious samples played over and over. We just wanna have fun...and Daft Punk delivers on &quot;Discovery&quot;.<br />Of course, you have &quot;One More Time&quot;, one of the most feel-good electronica songs ever. It's got great vocals and a bouncy beat that you can't help dancing to. It's followed by another awesome song, the instrumental &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;. Also worth mentioning are the love songs &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Something About Us&quot;. I also can't get enough of &quot;Face to Face&quot;, it's just a fun song! Unlike Amazon.com's editorial, I thought &quot;Short Circuit&quot; was pretty cool. It's like hearing a computer slowly break down until it fades into oblivion.<br />There are a couple of missteps that make me, regretfully, take the album down to four stars. Songs like &quot;Crescendolls&quot; and &quot;High Life&quot; should've been shortened and &quot;Nightvision&quot;, that oh-so-beautiful interlude, should be a lot longer. Maybe an extended mix of it will be offerered soon at the Daft Club. Oh, and the 10:00 closer, &quot;Too Long&quot;, is too long. Don't get me wrong; it's a fun song. But I can only take so much repetition.<br />The Daft Club is a neat little bonus, but don't expect another whole album of cool stuff. The Special Edition of &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; is just &quot;One More Time&quot; lyrics put in front of the melodies of &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;. It's kinda cool, but they could've done better. What's really weird is the unplugged version of &quot;One More Time&quot;, in which Romanthony and his guitar are the only ones performing. It's more of an R&amp;B love song than what it turns out to be, a celebration of dancing.<br />All in all, &quot;Discovery&quot; is worth the $. It's fun, bouncy techno, and the Daft Club is a nice extra.
B00000G6H1|5.0|It was such a pleasure for me to hear again this album I originally bought when I was 11 !<BR>I only had the old videotape with poor stereo sound quality and my scratchy vinyl, I gave them up long ago on the shelf !<BR>For two years, I've been buying the complete re-released collection of Olivia's original albums, and it was a thrill to hear them with this sound quality. Thanks to FESTIVAL RECORDS AUSTRALIA !<BR>They did a real good job on &quot;Physical&quot;. I remember now why I used to love this album 20 years ago !<BR>The only regrets are the lyrics missing which were on the LP and there was different art work of Olivia making exercises!<BR>So, if you're fan, don't hesitate , buy it, it's really worth it !
B00005AQGH|5.0|I label this as one of his best, but how do you decide which one is his best cause almost all the stuff he released was great. This is I think the most angry album he put out. Although it has the calmer songs like &quot;To Live and Die In L.A&quot; and &quot;Krazy&quot;. He has the songs where spits angry like &quot;Bomb First&quot; &quot;Me and My Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;Life Of An Outlaw&quot; This album you can listen to the whole way except the only two songs i dont care for very much are the last two. I like all the other ones a lot. My favorites and &quot;Bomb First&quot;, &quot;Me and My Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Toss It Up&quot;, &quot;Blasphemy&quot; and &quot;White Manz World&quot;. Although if you like 2pac this is a great cd. You got to listen to his lyrics cause he has a lot to say in any subject. This are also some of the best beats 2pac has worked with. This beats are right up there with All Eyez On Me. I think everyone should have this cd it is a great cd.
B00003CXTG|4.0|December 7th, 1941. A day our nation will never forget. A day that is brilliantly captured in this movie. As the credits rolled on the screen after the show, I sat in my seat, amazed at what I had just witnessed. Pearl Harbor is oen of those movies that doesn't come along that often. A drama that touches the heart of a historical event. <BR> The casting in this movie was superb. Ben Affleck plays his character almost as well as in \\"Good Will Hunting\\". Newcomers Josh Harnett and Kate Beckinsale turn in wonderful performances that hold the viewer throughout the entire picture. However, the entire picture is the only problem I had with this film. The overall length of the film was just too long, although the ending was nothing like I was expecting. I was pleased to see this type of ending on such a sobering film.<BR> This film should be expecting a few Oscar nominations, most likely in the way of Best Visual Effects. The only thing holding this movie back, in my mind, is the length. But then again, Titanic was over 3 hours long, and it won almost everything, so we'll see what happens. <BR> All in all, I thought this movie was fantastic. As someone in the entertainment field, I can appreciate the hard work and dedication it takes to make a movie as powerful as this one.<BR>December 7th, 1941 is a day that will live in infamy. It will be remembered not just in our minds and history books, but in this motion picture as well.
B00000IONU|5.0|5 star meaning they are very smart,  you can't play like that and sound like that without have knowing or been through a lot of things. Not to mention the consistancy with the red / white is over the top good.<br />This is a band I would listen to their albums for years to come.  They're  tops in my book.<br />Loy Lake
B00005OCMR|5.0|At last, Tron is getting decent treatment in DVD. The previous Tron DVD had no extras on it, which really made no sense considering that a Laser Disc edition was released a few years ago with plenty of goodies on it that they could have just recycled.<br />The &quot;Edition Details&quot; ... are misleading. Below is a short list of features in this edition:<br /> - Deleted scenes with new intros by the writer/director and visual effects supervisor.<br /> - A new 75 minutes documentary called &quot;The Making of Tron&quot;<br /> - Audio commentary<br /> - Original soundtrack music deleted from the film<br /> - Lots of other items that give insight into the design effort that went into making Tron<br />All in all, two discs worth of stuff. Sounds pretty sweet to me.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Godfather 1 and Godfather 2 are among the ten greatest films ever made.  Godfather 2 is probably the finest sequel ever made.  Place these two with The Conversation and Apocalypse Now and Mr.  Coppola definitely takes his place, along with Capra, Ford, Lean, Hitchcock, Spielberg (to name a few), as one of the finest directors ever.  The extras on this DVD look outstanding.  The only problem is Godfather 3.  This movie is quite forgettable and was made for the cash,not because the story needed to be continued.  Coppola was asked why he felt Godfather 3 needed to be made (on a Bravo program), and he stated FOR THE MONEY!!  The movie is long, slow, and contrived.  It adds very little to the saga.  Although the collection looks great on features, I'll wait until Godfather 1 and 2 are released individually.  For those who plan to buy it, I can see why.  It may be worth the price just to get the first two installments!  I'll bet after a few months the dvd for the individual movies will be released and I'll buy the first two at that time.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Big ego?  Yes.  A good reason to have a big ego?  Yes.  Freaking love this disc!  It's all over the place, but in a good way.
B000000I3O|5.0|If you hate green day, blink 182, sum 41, get-up kids, no motiv, and h2o, then buy this album.  it's like a breath of fresh air after listening to manufactured [music] for too long.
B00000JNO1|4.0|For Skynyrd's first two albums, they had a portfolio of 20 songs honed to perfection during the eight years before they got a recording contract. But for their third<br />album, they had just two songs ready: the magnificent 'Saturday Night Special', already in the can for a Burt Reynold's movie, and 'On the Hunt'. Exhausted after<br />their first European tour, they had just three weeks to rest before MCA forced them into the studio to record the follow-up to the unexpectedly successful<br />SECOND HELPING.<br />All this comes from the wonderfully honest sleevenotes. &quot;It was a real rush job,&quot; confessed Van Zant. 'Tellingly [the album] had no staying power and quickly exited<br />[the album charts] after a mere twenty weeks,' continue the sleevenotes. At my school, the album was on the secondhand sales rack within a term of its release.<br />In Skynyrd's case, preparation definitely counts. 'Saturday Night Special' and 'On the Hunt' are much the best tracks on the album. Elsewhere they get the inspiration<br />for their compositions from the likes of Free, and their guitar licks and riffs from as varied a bunch as Black Sabbath, the Doobie Brothers and Jimmy Page.<br />This was the first album with the great Artimus Pyle on drums and the last featuring the bassist-turned-third-lead-guitar Ed King. King was a great composer -- the<br />near-perfect 'Saturday Night Special ' was his -- and they clearly missed him on GIMME BACK MY BULLETS.<br />The album is well remastered and the two extra tracks are live versions recorded (not particularly clearly) in San Francisco within four months of the studio versions.<br />The album is moderately important, but frankly the band had said it all, studio-wise, with their first two albums. The live jewel was yet to come.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I know this to be a superb movie. But this isn't a review of the movie. It's a review of the packaging.<br />I'm sure there are at least one or two other collectors out there that are as obsessive as I am about their collection looking neat and uniform on the shelf. I was hoping that the deluxe wooden boxed set would have a proper case with the dvds inside of it. I scoured lots of reviews on this box hoping for confirmation on this point but couldn't find any information related to the packaging inside the wooden box.<br />I went out and bought the set anyways and risked it.<br />The set doesn't contain a proper dvd case. The 2 dvds are in a case similar to what you would buy a CD in.<br />However, the set does come with 2 cardboard sheets that work perfectly as covers for the set if you go out and buy a blank dvd case.<br />I hope this helps any other collectors obsessive about the appearance of their DVD shelf.
B00005OAJ1|2.0|When I first say the D back in the mid-90s on their own HBO series it was the simple acoustic guitars and perverted heavy metal lyrics that got my attention. The contrast between those two elements worked to build a great joke about two guys who were the [illigitimate] children of \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Dio\\". There was just something that made you fall over at the site of Jack Black and KG working over a coffee shope with songs like \\"Double Team.\\"<BR>But, now a few years after the D has faded a little and Jack Black is the toast of Hollywood out comes a full-length CD which compiles the great majority of songs and sketches from the short-lived HBO series. But, instead of leaving a good thing alone, the boys recruited a heavy metal backing band complete with Dave Grohl on drums to spice things up.<BR>The result is overproduced muck where the main joke is hidden beneath layers and layers of overdubbed distorted guitars and bass. When I saw the HBO series the D sold the joke a lot better. This recording seems like they are trying way too hard. They even took out the funniest part of \\"Tribute\\" where Kyle and Jack break into a few bars of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and replaced it with some more wanky guitar solos.<BR>If you really want to experience the D in its true essense, seek out the HBO series.
0451450523|2.0|What can you say when a book does nothing for you but seems to be a classic for so many.  All I can say is, there are much better fantasy books out there.
0440219078|4.0|... The giver, a very mysterious and new kind of book, did not sounded interesting because of its simple title.  Instead of boring, I found it to be very interesting.  I did like it more than the books I have read in school like A Separate Peace or Great Expectation.  This book was different from the others; it was a mysterious and fantasized book.  I love books that are out of the ordinary. For instance, the part where they said that people were being release.  I did not know where they were going. That made me want to read it and find out. Another part was when the 12th years got their job assigned to them. It was intense because Jonas number was skipped.  The other part that got me going was what was the name of the girl before Jonas that was Receiver. All this and more in this exciting novel. I do not want to give away the ending, but anyone who picks up this book cannot stop reading it.<BR>I give this book a 4 because it is the best of the books I have read for an English class.
B00005N9CV|4.0|This is a wonderful album of songs. Diana is one of the best of the new crop of jazz singers. Tommy LaPuma deserves credit for putting together a winning team. Claus Ogerman is a true giant of arranging, remember the Sinatra-Jobim album of the late sixtes? Ogerman helped to make that a work of art.Diana sings nice, but put her back in time with all the gaints, Sinatra, Cole, Ella. I doubt if she would have gotten past the local Holiday Inn. This said, this is a lovely album worth listening to.
B00005NWRS|2.0|As a huge Whiskeytown fan, I ran to the record store to pick up<BR>a copy of &quot;Gold.&quot; If only it had been worth it.<br />Gone are the country influences which made Whiskeytown stand <BR>out, and in their place is a weak, uninspired folk-rock record.<BR>My only hope is that this record will be an anomaly in Adams's<BR>career, and he will get the hell out of LA, away from Adam<BR>Duritz, and back to the music that he does best.
0920668364|1.0|I understand how adults may be touched by the message of unconditional love, but this book is just plain creepy.  We received it as a gift, and i have never thrown away a book before, but this one has got to go. The relationship of the mother and son is not healthy. The mother has no husband, the adult son has no wife but eventually has a child. The mother creeps into the sons room while hes asleep to hold, rock and sing to him. With so many wonderful books out there, skip this one.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Blow is an amazing film about George Jung a drug deal who just can't seem to stay away from jail. Despite his efforts, he always seems to go back. Blow is an excellent film about one man's fight with reality and the harsh punishments of crime.
B00004Z459|5.0|I regularly buy new releases of music I like, especially from bands or groups I already know are good. Occasionally I buy a new band or artist because I get a good feeling about the first single they release. Often I am disappointed to find that some but not many of the tracks are good. Linkin Park is an exception. Not only is it excellent for a first release, when I listen to this I don't skip any of the tracks, which is unusual. They have a unique understanding of their style of music, and while it is not breakthrough style, they have an excellent handle on it. They mix some excellent techno dance tracks with some heavy hitting chord work, and a nice rap/rock combo on the lyrics, the new wave of this genre of music.<br />The lyrics are well written, hard, yet introspective. &quot;Crawling&quot; the first single was excellent when it debuted, but of course has paled with incessent play on the radio. Tracks that are as good that are under played are &quot;Papercut&quot; the first track, and &quot;With You&quot;  these are going to be more for the Linkin Park fans than the casual listener, but will appeal to anyone.  I am secretly patting myself on the back to have predicted the second hit from the cd..&quot;One Step Closer&quot; I also predicted &quot;In The End&quot; would get heavy play and I have been hearing it regularly on the alternative stations. <br />I don't think many of the tracks will hit the top 40 stations, but &quot;Crawling&quot; seems to have crossed over as the pop stations have realized the value in trying to pull in the tried and true rockers like myself. They however don't showcase new bands like Linkin Park enough to satisfy my tastes. Every track on this one is great, those who end up into Linkin Park, like I was from the first listen, will also appreciate the groove of &quot;Points Of Authority&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot;. A fantastic intro to &quot;Place For My Head&quot; is worth a trip to the official website just for a listen. Buy the CD..sit back, or better yet stand up and get ready to enjoy.
B00005N9CV|2.0|We've all waited a long time - and for what ?<BR>Music quality is not good - orchestra with vocal is very difficult to have them both on the same cd track.<BR>Maybe next time Diana.....
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The timeless &quot;Snow White&quot; story springs to life as never before on this fantastic DVD. The traditional fairytale looks fabulous on this high quality DVD. A great purchase for young children at Christmastime.
B000008M54|4.0|First heard of this group on the soundtrack of Waking Ned Devine.Got this album and &quot;Bang On The Ear&quot; has become one of my favorites of all time, Fishermn's Blues, and Strange Boat. The rest i found so-so.<BR>But you gotta hear &quot;Bang On The Ear&quot;<BR>Thanks fellas for a grand time!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Her previous CD has been played THE MOST of all my dozens of favorite CDs. And now I'll be playing this one over and over again for years. Granted I'm a big fan, and was fortunate to see her perform live at the Hollywood Bowl in July (where she gave us a taste of this album with a gorgeous &quot;Look of Love&quot; with a full orchestra). It's a departure from her previous offerings, but very welcome. I just love her voice and variety of songs, some soft with little instrumentation, and some with well-produced lush orchestration. Best listened when I play 3-4 together on &quot;random&quot; for that element of surprise. Loving it!
0440219078|4.0|It was a wonderful book.  I found it very enjoyable but also very suprising.  To chose Sameness over Diversity and black and white over color.  What a world to live in.  Reading this book makes you look at the world you see everyday in a new light and think of what it might be like without color or hills or real emotions.
B000000OAH|5.0|This release is Queen at thier best. Hitting on all cylinders of thier signatures sounds. There is blistering rock classics (&quot;Dead on Time&quot;, &quot;More of That Jazz&quot;), Melodic pop-rock (&quot;If you Can't Beat Em&quot;, &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot;), and two of the funnest singles ever released the swaggering &quot;Fat Bottommed Girls&quot; and the quirky &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;. What more can you ask for!
B000002OX7|5.0|The Re-mastering job of &quot;Who's Next&quot; is fantastic. I have the original CD release and there's no comparison. What comes through on the re-mastering is several revelations. One of the things I found on listening to this is what a fantastic rock drummer Keith Moon was (he really shines on this). Keith Moon was really the glue that cemented the Who's sound. His energy and power cuts through this album like a knife. <br />Another revelation is the brilliant Nicky Hopkins on piano. Nicky Hopkins was one of the greatest session musicians in rock music in the 1960's and 1970's (he worked with the Rolling Stone and the Jefferson Airplane among many others).<br />I was lucky to see the Who right before &quot;Who's Next&quot; came out at the original Flushing Tennis Stadium over 30 years ago (they played songs from the album before they were released).<br />The music they were playing was so different and radical for the time; I didn't know what to make of it. Their use of synths (I think they had to use a tape, since it was impossible at the time to play this type of music live) was brilliant, and didn't go to excess like Yes, and Emerson, Lake and Palmer did later on.<BR> <BR>I just turned 48 a few weeks ago. Listening to album again makes me feel 17 again. This is timeless music, and still stands as one of the greatest rock albums ever made. <br />I find it sad that songs like &quot;Bargain&quot; and &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; are now being used for car commercials on television. Shame on you Pete, do you really need money that badly?
B000001FMX|5.0|The Dolls.... As a man of few words, I could go on for quite a long while about 'em. Young or old come gather and listen to how rock still is.  The stuff that rocked then still rocks now. May Johnny Thunders rest in peace!<BR>                                              I am done!
B00005N9CV|2.0|These days when Bossa Nova is making quite a comeback, I don't really mind if old artists want to join in and fine tune their creative musings to the sound of sexy cool music.<br />Unfortunately for Diana Krall, this does not look like one of her strengths. The orchestra dramatizes every song with sweeping intros and what-not whereas the heart of Bossa Nova is a Bongo and accompanied with classical guitar strings and the tempo is supposedly medium-slow as opposed to her downright slow and boring.<br />In my old favourites like 'Besame Mucho' she sung like she did not take Spanish in one of her foreign language classes whereas in 'The Look of Love' like she has just lost love instead of found it.<br />The thing here is slow, sweeping orchestration and a husky voice does not always equate sexy. I know she has talent but Diana needs to let it all come out and not 'try' that much.
0394806220|5.0|This very short book is a total winner for reading to the very young. Throughout the book, the rhyming is fantastic. This book is also great for helping your children to learn about onomatopoeia, and how neat it is to imitate the sounds around us. Because this book is so brief, it is easy to learn all the words. Knowing the book by heart is extremely useful for keeping your rhythm while your child chews on the pages.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best album I've ever heard. Every song has great beats and sweet lyrics. I mean, every song is good. As I said, theres no need for a skip button. I could listen to this cd for hours upon hours and never get a bit bored of it. I give it five stars.
B000002UKS|5.0|I love this album, it is very dear to me.  The best song  ever is &quot;Everlong&quot;!! It rocks! So does the whole album! Buy it!
B000021YQV|4.0|When I first bought this album, I was a bit afraid that it would be just screaming and very redundant. Instead, it turned out to be a high quality and musically diverse album. I love Serji's voice in all aspects, whether it be his screaming or his singing. Also, there is hardly any cussing on the album which I think is something rare and great for are day and age. After buying this album, I have become a big System of a Down fan, and hope that you will go out and buy this great cd so you can experience this musical masterpiece!
B00005N9CV|2.0|The booklet to Diana Krall's best CD 'All for you' described two Nat King Cole's - one the jazzman, one the pop singer, and described the King Cole trio as the summit of the two. Similarly, Krall's tribute to Cole was the best expression of Diana Krall as a jazz pianist and jazz singer.<br />On this new record, Diana the pianist goes AWOL, along with her sidemen, guitarist Russell Malone and her scores of fantastic bass players, notably Christian McBride and Paul Keller. I got into straight ahead jazz through her albums with their marriage of accessible and intimate vocals, which buffered the then foreign jazz improvisations - which I later discovered to be sharp, concise, tight and swinging. Since then I've discovered many more complex players, but I can always go back to 'All for you' for the sincere and honest feeling it evokes. <br />This new CD feels like money. Her last CD 'When I look in your eyes' dabbled with the orchestra, but saved itself with enough sharp small combo tunes to compensate. Here, all the tracks have orchestral backing, and five of them throw in a bossa nova beat for good measure. This results in a depressing sameness about all the tracks. Diana is in a very precarious position here - jazz listeners will deride her for losing her roots, and cynical pop listeners can equally write her off as 'mushy elevator ...'.<br />Come back Diana, and bring Russell and Christian back with you. Leave the money men at home.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Why do jazz singers think they need to record with strings?  Chris Connor couldn't pull it off.  Shirley Horn couldn't pull it off.  And neither can Diana Krall - although she does it better than most.  After a disappointing rendition of I Remember You (one of my all time favorite ballads), she comes back with one of the best recordings I've heard (including Ella's) of Cry Me a River; and possibly outdoes even Nat Cole on Besame Mucho.  Diana Krall is the best thing that's happened to Jazz in thirty years, and it's sad to see her tainting perfection with orchestral accompaniements.  Her best is intimate, with just Russell Malone, Christian McBride, Jeff Hamilton, and the outstanding piano style of Diana herself.  All those violins just get in the way.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|First, I'd like to express that ALL OF THESE SONGS, ALL OF THEM, are featured on their red and blue double albums; this is just a cheaper version of the collection. The good part is that, this album is up to date and the sound has somewhat improved. If you put this in today's CD players, you may notice a difference.<br />Second, there is NOT A SINGLE SONG FROM SGT. PEPPERS NOR THE WHITE ALBUM. &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; hit #1, so why isn't it on this album?<br />Third, this is overall a great collection with massive #1's, but you can find the original mono mixes of some of these masterpieces on Past Masters 1. If you are a hard-core Beatles fan, you may want to get some of their best-known albums instead.<br />Finally, this lyric &quot;Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.&quot; is very true and clear to me, and should be to you all too. Life is not about fighting over wealth and fame. Life is about love and peace. Life is about praising the Lord, too.<br />This whole world must know sooner or later.
B00005NWRS|3.0|I have been a huge fan of Ryan's ever since I heard his heartbreaking rendition of Gram Parsons, &quot;A Song For You&quot; on a tribute album a few years ago. Even though he was covering someone else's song, the passion and sorrow in his voice could bring you to tears as if he was speaking directly from his soul.  His masterpiece, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was a constant staple in my cd player for over a year, and it was one of those rare albums that you could never get tired of listening to.  Each song just got better and better each time you heard it.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same &quot;Gold&quot;. Sure it has some teriffic songs, like the now-empowering &quot;New York, New York&quot;, and the hauntingly beautiful &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;, but these types of songs are few and far between.  A lot of his songs are corny and just plain dull, missing that magic that made Ryan such a unique talent. I think Ryan needs to get out of LA, where style is valued over substance...it has obviously affected this album.  And I agree, the LA shout-outs were enough to make us all roll our eyes.  I hope Ryan comes back down to earth soon, and will realize that his true fans like him a little less &quot;Cool&quot;.
0425098478|4.0|I thought the one minute manager was a good book and always will be.  It tells you everything you need to know aobut managing your employees.
B000002B49|5.0|If you're thinking of buying this piece of music, let me qualify my generous rating by stating that I have owned and enjoyed their first album for several years now. This second work of theirs has much of what made me a fan of their debut effort: great melodies, lush orchestrations via synthesizers, groovy rhythms, and really cool use of sampled vocals. While the first recording primarily used samples of jungle peoples' folk tunes and chants, Boheme gathers voices from a variety of places: Hungarian folk tunes, Totowa Indian songs, a choir from China, even a (gasp!) live Eastern European female vocalist. The result is richer than their first CD, with more variety in terms of tempo, timbre (i.e., the sonic choices), and mood.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Perhaps the only true criticism being offered out there that may have some merit is how this 5 disk set is in the original form, versus the Godfather Epic, which combined 1&amp;2, allowing for a sense of chronological order. In all honesty, I don't mind or care. A person can make a case either way about how the Epic was worked out nicely, featuring De Niro as Young Vicente, then Brando, then Pacino takes over the Family business. But in arguing the notion of preservation director's intent, or the original way the film was made, this is a nice way to see the trilogy. It is also the first way I ever witnessed the films.<br />I am very pleased to see all of the bonuses that have been added to compliment such a great piece of cinematic achievemnt. The deleted scenes, Oscar acceptances (Brando's non-acceptance, rather), commentaries and the others, it will add to the old fan and new fan's knowledge of one of the great films of all time.<br />I must admit, Godfather III was never high on my list, but the first one was always a work to be cherished, the second another to be remembered. If you like these, I also highly recommend Goodfellas (which would be nice if Scorsese offered some commentary).
B000002KHH|5.0|Not much I can say that hasn't been said. The lyrics (especially on War Pigs) are good, with strong political messages. Iron Man is THE classic Black Sabbath song that even people who know nothing of Black Sabbath have heard... but I like War Pigs, Electric Funeral and, of course, Faries Wear Boots a bit better. I whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting to see what (or more accurately, who) inspired the several generations of metal that followed this record.
1568497369|5.0|I have always heard that this was a great book so I went down to my school's library and checked it out. The librarian confirmed the reports I had heard about the book being good. I sat down and read and read and read and it was great! I have always loved mystery novels. I began reading mystery novels with The Cat Who... series by Lillian Jackson Braun (yes even big, tough, male, 17 year old, high-school seniors can love books about mystery solving felines) and I used to only read mysteries. This book reminds me of why I love mysteries so much. I couldn't figure out whodunnit!
B00003CXX8|5.0|This is a very effective and entertaining thriller. The 2 hours just fly by and there are several 'jump' scenes and I and many others were glued to their seats throughout. The cast is very, very good for this kind of film. DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd) is very effective as the villainess, and STELLAN SKARSGAARD (who I'm not familiar with) was also very creepy. LEELEE SOBIESKI (Deep Impact, Eyes Wide Shut) also shines as the heroine. The film also has a great soundtrack and a 'blue filtered' eerie appearence. Highly recommended for those who like good entertainment and good suspense. Check it out!
B000021Y74|5.0|I thought it was good, I was considering on wether or not I should rate it a 5 or a 4. A 5 because I thought it was cool, different, and interesting, but possibly a 4 because once or twice in the movie I said I was bored, but it was only at the scenes where it was repeating itself and nothing new happened. Besides that I thought the changes were interesting, the way of filming was cool (and the music), and different because I haven't seen one of these different scenario ending type movies since Clue where the killer would change at the end. It got me mad because some people were giving it 1s and it definately doesn't deserve a 1, at least a 2, even if you didn't like it because the I can understand why some don't like it, but it's not a 1. So I would at least rent this before buying because people have different like and dislikes, but you should definately rent it, you'd be surprised at how bad the preview for this movie looked... but after I saw it I liked it. So don't judge this movie on the preview which just had a bunch of running, screaming, and shooting scenes.
0553573403|4.0|At last a good book! I was looking for a new great series after Jordan's Wheel of time and now I've found it. I tried Goodkind but wasn't satisfied with it. Now Martin's series is really enjoyable, though I don't put it at the same level as Jordan's.<br />All the postive things you can read in the other reviews are true, but I like too much magic, and this book lacks of it.<br />In truth, when you get used to the (almost total) absence of magic, you really appreciate tha characters (great), the plot(wonderful), the world (the idea of the Wall and the year-lasting seasons are marvelous and splendidly developed), but just a bit more magic would make it PERFECT.<br />The continuos shift of point of views during the narration is one of the most powerful peculiarities of the book, but it can also become a disadvantage, because the story is too much fragmented. You get involved in one character's adventures and in a few page you have to abandon it for another and another...<br />Anyway, I suggest you to read it, it's worthwhile! I didn't list all the qualities of the book only because all the other reviewers did it in my place!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|The following review is specifically about this latest DVD rerelease of Pride and Prejudice, not of the film itself (which, as anyone can see by reading all the reviews here and everywhere else, is a GREAT movie).<br />This NEW and improved DVD release of Pride and Prejudice is excellent.  The picture quality is great - ten times better than the old DVD release (which many people complained about).  I have seen both DVDs and there is definitely a noticeable difference. Also, included in this version is a 30 minute \\"making of\\" featurette that was not on the previous American DVD.  Of course it isn't long enough for everyone who is obsessed with this film, but it is still pretty good.<br />And lastly, this DVD is CHEAPER than the old one and a downright bargain for $...!  By this one today and watch it over and over and over and over...<br />(Also, check out \\"Wives and Daughters\\" which was made by the same folks).
B000002MY3|5.0|Having started with teenagers' pop-dance music, Alanis Morrissette has gradually grown up, and her music has become a little bit more gloomy. She doesn't remind me her colleagues -Tracy Bonham, Joan Osborne, Sheryl Crow and other female rockers. <BR>Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is one of the best rock albums has ever released and I consider it to be the sound of '95-96. Five years passed, since I bought it, and today I have got a rich CD collection. But \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is still among my favorites and I've never heard something like that. Alanis's mouth-organ play and energetic vocal, like in \\"Head Over Feet\\", \\"You Learn\\", and, of course, in the famous \\"Ironic\\" shakes us. Her songs are very autobiographic, and this fact makes everybody share her heroine's sorrows. And her ballads, delicate and sensitive, for example, a capella \\"Your House\\", will never leave the lovers of guitar music and good female vocal disappointed.
0393307050|5.0|If you want to be picked up and plopped down on a British Navy Sloop during the Napoleon wars, then pick this book up and get ready!  O'Brian writes and convincing and detailed novel about Captain Aubrey and his friend, the physician, Stephen Maturin.  This was a superbly crafted introduction to what I expect will be a long and enjoyable series.  You don't need to know anything about boats or sailing (I sure don't!) to enjoy this book.  Stephen Maturin knows as little as anyone, and through his experience we are educated about the workings of the ship, from the topsails down to the lowest holds.  <br />There is a very good story here about the maturing of the Captain and the relationships that are tested when thrown together in tight confines for lengths of time.  I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to move on to Post Captain.
B00004SU5J|3.0|The music St. Germain created here actually sounds remarkably like a '96 CD called THE NEW GROOVE: THE BLUE NOTE REMIX PROJECT, VOL. 1, on which various hip-hop/club artists remixed classic Blue Note cuts. If you like TOURIST, you should definitely get that CD as well. This record is good, but I think it might appeal more to fans of club music who like some jazz, rather than the other way around. I say that because there isn't much rhythmic complexity within each track, the kind you'll hear from a great jazz drummer (although St. Germain does alter the beat from track to track, I'll give him that). Generally he sets up a simple, steady club beat with each cut, and then the musicians create some jazzy solos on top. If you're used to the more complex rhythms of jazz, you may get bored with these beats.<br />I think Amon Tobin mines a similar vein much more creatively; his atmospheres are more evocative, his forms more flexible, his music more suprising. I like this St. Germain CD for what it is, an update on '70s jazz-fusion, like a HEADHUNTERS for this decade; but with all the critical bouqets tossed its way, I just expected something really groundbreaking. In my opinion, THE NEW GROOVE was a groundbreaking record; this is just retracing some of the tracks that album left behind.
0812550757|5.0|a good book...just missing something that the game had, but still a very good read and any science fiction fan needs to visit the nearset book store and pick this up!
0394720288|5.0|As with most Wodehouse books, this has enough plot twists and turns to keep the impossible situations running for as long as possible. Which is not to say that they are difficult to see coming, but even when you know that Gussie is about to pop up again with bad news, it's still fun to read. Jeeves' solutions are always fascinating, as is his &quot;sang froid&quot;, as Bertie would say. I must strongly suggest to the first-time reader, read the introduction LAST. Alexander Cockburn does a decentish job of analyzing the story, but not without doing some major spoiling of plots. Lastly, I would argue my own opinion that the Wodehousian plots are not the strongest point of the book, but the breezy, conversational narrative style of the main protaginist, Bertram Wilberforce Wooster. This (funny in and of itself) is hilarious agaisnt the backdrop of his hyper-intelligent valet (or &quot;gentleman's personal gentleman&quot;, as Jeeves refers to himself), strong-willed women, clutzy or (dare I use the word to describe a character of the 30's) nerdy friends, and comical villains. If you like British comedy in the least, you should read Wodehouse as he is a giant of the genre.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I thought this was a great album by Jennifer.L! I know she's also an actress and I have the movie \\"JACK\\" she acted in... with Robin Williams, and i've seen the movie she also acted in which calls \\"Selena\\". She did a great job in acting in both movies, but i like her singing better than acting! Anyways this is a great album like i said... some of my favorite songs are>> \\"Feelin' So Good\\",\\"If You Had My Love\\", and ,\\"Waiting For Tonight\\"!!=)!!All I have to say is go out and buy this CD , coz that's how good it is!
0440219078|5.0|As I was reading this book, I was utterly amazed at the setting in which it took place.  I could never imagine such a world where no one sees colors or feels any emotions.  If I would have been in Jonas's shoes, I think I would have gone crazy.  I also feel the book was well written, the imagery and the plot of the story go so well together.  Perhaps my favorite part was when Jonas decided to keep giving Gabriel memories so he could sleep well at night, I admire Jonas's character, and I am even trying to be like him in some ways.  Overall, this is excellent reading material!
0393314804|5.0|Definately worth a read, if you are into reading about Heroin addiction.  It is written in Scottish dialect, so you may need to read it twice to actually get what's going on in the beginning.
0060278234|5.0|Wow. That pretty much sums up this book and its prequel, Sabriel. I must have read Sabriel at least a few hundred times from the first time I read it, almost FIVE YEARS AGO!!! I had no idea then that there was to be a sequel and no one could have understood how surprised and delighted I was when Amazon &quot;advised&quot; me to read it, almost a month after it was released. Normally, if I had known I would have pre-ordered it years ago.<BR>Anyway, this book (and its prequel) are for anyone who enjoys fantasy, adventure, or just a good story. Both books have incredible characters, settings, and wonderful writing. But it is definately the plot and creativity that sets these storys above other fantasys, you will be amazed at how quickly you become entranced by these novels and how much, once you have read them, you will anticipate the final conclusion to a story began a long time ago. <BR>Worth the full five stars, and a million more!
B00000IAU3|4.0|No Angel is a very fine CD that is best in its more introverted moments.  The singles Here With Me and Thank You are very representative of the whole CD and are a good indicator of whether you'll like this album or not. The more melancholy songs such as My Lover's Gone and Isobel are the emotionally low but artistically high points of the CD. The closing track, Take My Hand provides great up-tempo relief in the shape of a terrific dance track that deserves to get the remix treatment and become a floor filler. There are more ordinary songs that don't measure up to the standard of those previously mentioned, such as Hunter and Don't Think of Me, and in particular Slide, which I could do without. Instead of these rather ordinary numbers it would be nice to see Dido try a more accoustic approach on a few more songs. Overall, a very solid and listenable CD.
B00005LC3Y|4.0|I read the main reviewer's assesment of this film, and I couldn't<br />disagree more. This film was not difficult to follow, it had an<br />excellent cast, highly quotable, and very entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the beginning where it starts off in<br />basic training with a classic portrayal of a drill sergeant,<br />as he berates his newly initiated soldiers. It's a very realistic<br />look at basic training, then it moves into more actual Vietnam<br />campaigns. Let me say that I'm not a huge Kubrick fan, and I<br />do agree that some of his films are way, way out there, and<br />very boring. This one was one of the few that was not. Matthew<br />Modine is excellent, as well as an overweight Vincent D'nofrio,<br />of 'The Cell' fame. The Drill Sergeant was brilliant and I<br />apologize, but his name escapes me. This film is a must buy for<br />any Vietnam film enthusiast!
B000056JYB|5.0|Another fine release in the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; series brings us the mother of all supergroups, Blind Faith. Bringing in 2 members of the first supergroup, Cream, in Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker and combining with Traffic's Steve Winwood, this band was met with high hopes in the music community. Unfortunately, that is where the industry stepped in and rushed them and pretty much destroyed what could have become a band together for more than 1 album. Luckily, the 1 album turned out quite well. All the classics are here: &quot;Can't Find My Way Home,&quot; &quot;Presence of the Lord,&quot; &quot;Sea of Joy,&quot;... well pretty much the whole original album. The extras aren't anything too precious. The electric version of &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; is superb, but the jams should have been replaced with some live recordings that would have much better represented the band. The jams can't take away from the album though so this is still an essential in any collection.
B0000025RI|5.0|I was one of the few people on this earth who didn't own a copy of &quot;Thriller&quot; when it first came out, mainly because he wasn't my favorite artist in the world.  I did buy it when it was released on CD though, and I was very impressed.  Every one of the songs is excellent, and none have gone out of style.  I think if they were released today they would still do well on the charts.  Even if you're not a huge Michael Jackson fan, you should still buy it, especially if you're into R &amp; B, disco, hip-hop, etc.  There'll be a 99.9 percent chance you'll love it.  It's very original and has a little bit of every kind of music.
B000059XUP|2.0|Well,as Brandon Lee's THE CROW is one of my favourite films of all time, I wonderded if anything could ever live up to my expectations when I first saw this film.As soon as it started,I knew it was impossible that this film could.The film has the wonderful Gothic look of the fist movie,and Vincent Perez looks the part too,but as soon as he is transformed into the crow his performance just did not work for me.When Brandon becomes the crow he has the menacing gracefulness,the moments of insanity and his softer side shows through when he is reunited with his friends from his former life,and he got the balance just right,sadly as perez weeps and gibbers and goes round banging on  steel drums etc it just sort of looks like a bad parody of Brandon Lees great performance.To top that we have IGGY POP as a bad guy and some other dodgy Mad Max 2 rejects with crazy haircuts running around gibbering as well,allthough the lead bad guy Judda almost hits the mark.Iggy may play the ageing hellraiser well,but he looks out of place here.The showdown with the aforementioned cheif bad guy also adds to insult as where we had a stunning shootout followed by a stunning dislay of martial arts skills inherited from his legendary father Bruce that then leads to a tense showdown in a dark gothic church in the first movie,perez climbs a tower (or tries too)and then ends up firing a flock of crows out of his chest (or something).I really do feel I could of made a better job of directing this film to make it more satisfying for fans of the first film and I have no experience in that field at all obviously else I would not be sitting here moaning about it!The only reason I would by this is to look in disbelief and say how did this happen,IT COULD OF BEEN SO MUCH BETTER!The third instalment of the franchise&quot;Salvation&quot; is still no way as good as the orignal but worth more of a go than this.It's a reminder of the waste of Brandon lees talent,as I think I read he was so confident he could play the part well he had signed for the two sequels already.And how right he was.Thanks for reading this if you have.
B00003CXSM|1.0|Somebody pass me a blanket.  This movie bit the dust.  Someone had the audacity to call this movie, &quot;charming,&quot; and &quot;light-hearted&quot;.  Puh-leeze.  I was sooo disappointed when I rented this from BB, that I walked it over the same night and returned it.  J.Lo disappoints in this one-majorly.  She gets by on her looks and &quot;talent.&quot;  Will someone call a real actress to do a movie and tell JLo to stop making these airhead flicks? Nighty-night.
0440219078|5.0|I first read &quot;The Giver&quot; when I was in the 6th grade (I'm now a senior in High School) and the book only gets better every time I read it.  I have read many other books concerning the issue of ideal and Utopian societies.  These books are very deep and often disturbing.  &quot;The Giver&quot; touches on these issues but in a very chilish and delicate manner which makes it perfect for young children to read.  It mildly exposes them to the idea that society cannot be perfect and that the more perfection a government strives for, the less privelaged its citizens become.  I can personally say that &quot;The Giver&quot; gave me my first real sense of pride in my country and the rights and liberties it grants me simply for living on its grounds.  The story also provoked my first thoughts of appreciation of life in general.  Although my senses of pride and appreciation have grown much more since the 6th grade, &quot;The Giver&quot; was a thought-provoking and inspirational introduction to the adult world I was soon to face.  It is, by far, one of my favorite novellas ever (and I have read many). I would highly reccommend it to anyone.
B00005A1PR|4.0|&quot;Brown Skin&quot; is the jam, a refreshing tribute to those of us blessed with &quot;dark&quot; skintones.  A fresh musical cousin of Badu, Scott, Maxwell, but all in all Arie creates her own unique sound.<br />&quot;Video&quot; is another song, describing her individuality and not all of womenfolk are blessed to look like those half-naked rump-shaking hoochies we see gyrating around in most videos.  All hail the Queen!  Some new music for a change.  India Arie has arrived!!
0375704027|3.0|&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is the story of a young man growing up in Tokyo in the late 60s.  We see the evolution of the boy into a man, we see his relationships with others.  <br />The story starts out with the older Toru reminded of this time as he hears the Beatles song &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; on an aircraft.  However, we never revisit this older Toru.  He is simply left by the wayside.  It seems odd to open the book with him, but to never have him come back into play.  <br />Murakami almost weaves the story with amazing alacrity.  But, in the end, he falls short.  Toru's dances with the other characters in the story (ranging from his Storm Trooper roommate to the elusive Naoko) ring not-quite-true.  <br />If you're a Murakami fan, this is a reasonably good book to read, if only to be reminded of how fabulous his other work is.  If you've never read Murakami before, start with one of his other works.  My favourite to date is &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot;, but that may change as I read more of his books.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob is now 60 years on this earth, and his music continues to grow and improve.  Anyone who has seen Bob in concert recently can attest to this fact.  He is the consumate musician and performer...you know that music is his true love.  Love and Theft is simply entertaining and amusing.  His words are fun, full of insight, and a delight to hear.  Bob continues to make us think and feel about how we are connected to the human race. If you enjoy Bob or would like to learn to appreciate his work, Love and Theft is as good a starting point as any.  It'll make you want to explore Bob's entire body of work.  I just hope Bob goes on and on.....
B00005ASOI|4.0|One of Argento's better films along with Phenomena and Inferno.  Not for squemish though, some of it literally makes your hair stand up on end :)
0812550706|4.0|This book was totally AWESOME!  Not only does it have a very interesting and unique stting and story line, but Orson Scott Card is able to reflect the feelings inside poor little Ender very well.  It is my favorite science fiction bood, BUT,    it had the stupidest ending about how the buggers were killed!
B00003RQNJ|4.0|No it's not as great as the Wild Bunch or Once Upon a time in the West, 2 other westerns from 1969, but fans of this film will be pleased with all the extras and presentaion of this hugely entertaining film....
B0000024ZT|5.0|when i bought this album, i DID NOT want to let myself believe it was as good as i heard.  this is suppose to be a second=rate boss album.   critics everywhere label it as &quot;ambitous&quot; but suggest it fails to connect as an album.  However, no matter how hard i tried to agree, i foudn myself utterly amazed at this album.  I think song for song this album is as good as any the boss has ever put out.  and is the ONLY album the boss has where i LOVE EVERY SONG.   sure there is no classic like &quot;born to run&quot;  or &quot;thunder road&quot;   butthere is no denying the brilliance of every song on this album.  what sets it apart from other boss albums is its intesity and its energy.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This great film has been marvelously restored and transferred to DVD, it's the best of the recent transfers from warner of Kubrick films, the wordt being The Shining, even that wasn't too bad but suffered from some artifacing problems.  not Barry Lyndon though the Transfer is Flawless :)
B00005B4GU|4.0|I like this album better than \\"Kid A.\\" The latter was just unlistenable and pusedo-intelligent. This is interesting. Both albums both sound like reactions to the fame and fortune Radiohead found with the success of \\"O.K. Computer.\\" \\"Kid A\\" was just the anonymous shock treatment found after finding out people actually LIKED the album, \\"Amnesiac\\" gives a name to the sickness and tries to cope with it.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Where to begin? As a non-Brit, I had to watch this movie thrice just to get all the dialogue down. That's okay, because if you like comedies of errors, you'll want to watch Snatch thrice. <BR>One of my only gripes is I was disappointed with Benicio Del Toro's small amount of screen time. The commercials and reviews give the impression that he's one of the leading characters. Brad Pitt was funnier than I was expecting; his portrayal of Mickey seemed very accurate. Turkish's wry narration kept me chuckling throughout, and the introduction of Bullet Tooth Tony towards the end made up for Del Toro's small screen time. <BR>All in all, very entertaining quality film. What pleased me the most was the lack of romantic sub-plot, which is now becoming almost a strict formula in films. I thought the plot moved nicely, with an appropriate ending.
B00000JCB3|5.0|SIFNIFIGANT OTHER(EDIT)IS THE BEST ALBUM YOU CAN FIND. WITH HITS SUCH AS &quot;BREAK STUFF,&quot; &quot;NOOKIE,&quot; AND &quot;N 2GETHER NOW,&quot; IT ROCKS THE HOUSE. AND IS OK FOR KIDS!
B00003CX5A|5.0|The classic tale of Sleepy Hollow is brought blazingly alive in the competitive film year of 1999 and it has a lot to qualify for to be one of the year's best movies. Well, this movie has all these qualifications and more too! It is truly one of the modern greats and one of the year's best films. The film has awesome mystery, horror, comedy, romance and fantasy balled into a great and amazingly intelligent script by Andrew Kevin Walker. In fact, this is one of the most well written and clever horror films of all time. Some critics have dissed this movie's script but I really thought it was fabulous. To act out this wonderful script they cast Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, and they couldn't have made a better choice. Depp is in almost every scene, and he steals every one with his wit, great accent and great enthusiasm for the film. Christina Ricci is also very beautiful and mysterious, although a little out of her depth. I enjoyed Miranda Richardson's performance, and she has a surprising waiting in the end. The cinematography for the film is lush and stunning, the art and sets are fantastically Sleepy Hollow-ish, and the visuals are truly breathtaking. So much effort went into this film, and a lot of people brought the unforgettable story alive. But most of the credit must go to the visionary and endlessly plausible director Tim Burton, who, with his great ideas, vision, abilities and past credibility's, has the right stuff to make this movie the perfect horror-fantasy. This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and one of the creepiest too. Sometimes I can still hear the headless horseman's stallion thundering along the forest, in search for heads to decapitate. I love this flick, and it kicks major butt, so if you're a Tim Burton fan, a person who enjoys the tale of Sleepy Hollow, a horror movie fan or just a movie fan in general, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed by this pitch-perfect masterpiece that is Tim Burton'sSleepy Hollow!
B000002LMM|5.0|In times when we are listening pop, rock, heavy metal, jazz and classic too, we find this. This is diamond in music culture to me. Something so original and different from everything else I never heard before. I was 10 or 11 years old when i was watching Twin Peaks. I love that serial and I think it's also best serial ever. And this music is also reason for so big success of movie. If you don't like love songs, you will like them here. If you don't like jazz, you will like it here. There isn't any song better than other. I like every song from begining to the end, especially songs with Julie Cruise. She really has voice like angel. Music is dark and unforgettable. There is really strong mood about this album. You can't compare it with Glenn Miller or Vangelis. It's different and it's just great.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is going to be the best DVD!  All the special features, and not only that but you have hosts to guide you through the selection.  You can actually enter the lands of Snow White.  Not to mention the film itself has been completely restored.  Like all the other reviews of this DVD have been saying, pre-order the movie today!
0006531407|5.0|I bought this book after the attack in NY.  I am not an outdoors type person but after reading this I feel that I could survive if the need arose.  I think it's a great resource for everyone for any type disaster, natural or man-made.
B00000IGGA|5.0|If Bob Dylan could be said to have set the world aflame in the early sixties, then you can think of Tom Waits as gleefully playing in the ashes. Soot-faced and clackling, and waving to The Eyeball Kid whenever he happens past.<BR>But to start at the beginning...when he first arrived, Tom Waits was like most musicians in that he believed of the myth that Dylan is untouchable and better than anybody else could ever be. Bob Dylan had become more myth than man, and the frenzy of worship directed at him meant that no other artist would ever get the respect they really deserved. Tom willfully played the roll of aftershock, which sadly is becoming more and more common as time passes, and stuck to his hipster routine. That was fine, because he did it really really well.<BR>But by the early 80's, Tom was starting seeing the world a different way. A horrible, horrible way, something like siamese twins dueling to the death. It became his obsession, his passion. And by 1985, he didn't seem to remember that the real world even existed, or that he had ever been part of it. Whoever carried the name Tom Waits in the late 70's is forever gone, dead these many years.<BR>He soldiered on, kicking his feet free whenever his musical landscape threatened to suck him under, and in the early 90's Tom offered some of his most disturbing work to date. He was no longer making music so much as offering packaged cancer, aural decay. It was sickening, horrifying, and it was brilliant. <BR>And at the end of that decade, after several years of silence, he delivered unto the believers Mule Variations. A direct descendant of Bone Machine, it offers all of the eclectic sounds that Tom Waits keeps in the jars that line his shed. Piano ballads, crunchy guitars, Eyeball Kids, and that patented folk-music-from-hell sound all line the album's edges, none of them really trying to take over. It's got a alcoholic-mutant-on-the-farm theme that it occasionally returns to, which gives it some of it's best works.And I don't know exactly what a Fillipino Boxspring Hog is, but should one ever be presented to me, I fully intend to run like hell. <BR>As it stands now, Tom Waits is a twisted and deformed old car that runs even though it should by all stretches of the imagination be scrapmetal. But he can take solace in the knowledge that in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, he will be the only one who makes any sense.
6304711905|4.0|Before Laserdisc became an endangered species, I had this movie on the now extinct format, the laserdisc version had an interview with director George P. Comatose, in it he showed the viewer scenes that he said the studio wanted cut, you could tell that he wanted them in there, there were at least 7 or 8 scenes cut from the theatrical version, these scenes add important elements to this film, questions the viewer might have are answered with these scenes and they make the movie more complete in a sense that you understand other scenes that are the result of these missing scenes,for instance we learn what happened to Doc Holliday's woman, we learn why Holliday is nowhere to be found when Morgan is killed &amp; Virgil is shot, we see more of Johnny Ringo's nastiness which leads to the scene in which Michael Rooker's character is found dead as a warning to Earp, we even see Jason Preistley apologize to Wyatt for not siding with him in the first place, we even see a scene where Wyatt &amp; Dana Delaney's character(can't remember her name)is in a heated moment of passion. DVD is a format that is popular for deleted or missing scenes, Tombstone like other films has its share of them that were shown on Laserdisc, but are missing on DVD, even George P. Cosmatose interview is missing,there seems to be nothing in the way of extras which is dissappointing to say the least, I hope Disney/Hollywood will rerelease this soon, there is no reason not to.
B000002HMH|5.0|Although a majority of Metallica's fanbase from the Kill Em' All<BR>days found this album and its follow up a disappointment, its actually a great, moody album. There are exceptions, Ain't My Bitch, King Nothing, and Wasting My Hate are upbeat compared to the somber mood setting tone of most of the album. And this is a good thing! Metallica matured and changed with time, and although they wrote the songs for Load and ReLoad in the same time period, they stuck to thier guns, and released them reguardless of the &quot;sellout&quot; status some fans and media gave them. Metallica didnt sell out. The quality of This album is proof enough. Give it a spin.ly good. This is as much Metallica as Puppets, Lightning and Justice ever was. Sure, the songs are slower, and they don't sound like Metallica in 'the old days', but they're still as powerful, and the lyrics are as great as ever, much deeper and more depressed than before, I think.<br /> I recommend this album to every true Metallica fan out there. 'The house jack built' and 'The outlaw torn' are my personal favourites, but I like almost all the songs just as much. So don't be afraid of all the bad stuff you've heard about this record, listen to it and get your own opinion.
6305696071|4.0|Of all the films I have seen with Julia Roberts, this one is my favorite, I don't know why, I can't shake why I like this film, I have never been crazy about the premise of this film, not many or should I say no prostitute looks as good as Roberts, but somthing about this film stays with me &amp; I think I have figured it out, for starters we learn that Vivian(Roberts' character) is not happy in her profession, she even makes references that she wants out,then she meets Edward(Gere's character)&amp; everything begins to change for her,we learn that he is a unsympathetic corporate raider who buys companies in a financial bind &amp; has little regard for its employees(typical corporate behavior)this behavior is futher supported by his accountant/attorney Stucky(Jason Alexander in a sleazy,but memorable role) when Vivian &amp; Edward meet they begin to teach each other a little of life's lessons, he shows her that there is more to life than the streets &amp;that she has a special gift to be better,she in turn teaches him that life should not be all about money, they both begin to see each others life, he sees firsthand what it must be like to be unfortunate, &amp; that what he is doing to companies is morally wrong, they fall in love on this journey of self-discovery &amp; Vivian realizes that she has potential to be better, one might argue that a multimillonarie such as Edward would find someone as fortunate as him, but what makes this love story different is the fact that Vivian does not care about his money, which would i'm sure make any millionaire happy, the special edition gives a more realistic look at Vivian's dangerous world with a scene at the club removed from the theatrical version, in it Edward is approached by the pimp Carlos seen at the beginning, soon Edward is surrounded by others, but Vivian soon comes to his aid, another deleted scene shows Edward going to close the deal on Morris &amp; along the way encounters a man with his son, a scene designed toshow that his business dealing can &amp; do affects others, it strikes a chord in Edward which makes his change of heart at the end more believable, this is a good film that shows Gere's range as an actor, just watch INTERNAL AFFAIRS which he did the same year, you won't believe he is the same character.
B00005QB9A|5.0|This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The writing is beautiful. The cinematics are beautiful. The music is beautiful. Tim Roth is one of the most brillant actors, and his performance in this is astounding. I bought this movie the first day of its availiblity. I highly reckemend you see this film.
B00005N9CV|5.0|So smooth, so mellow, these incredibly romantic songs will warm your heart, put you in a sentimental mood, and make you think of the one you love...<br />Diana Krall's smoky voice and terrific interpretations, her jazz piano, and the incredible musicians that back her are all superb. There are also beautiful, lush strings arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman and played either by the London Symphony Orchesta or a L.A. session orchestra (a.k.a. the best musicians in town).<br /><br />The songs ! What a great and incredibly tasteful collection of classics...a delight to hear the Julie London hit \\"Cry Me a River\\" again...always adored \\"Love Letters\\"...my favorite Burt Bacharach song, \\"The Look of Love\\"...the delectable \\"Besame Mucho\\", and on and on...every track a pleasure to hear.<br />Each song is taken at a slightly slower tempo than is perhaps usually heard...the better to dream by ! This is truly the most relaxing CD I've ever heard.<br />Total playing time is 50:36.
6304712936|5.0|It's one of the &quot;Classics&quot; but not really noted as one.  Tom Hulce did not get the recommendation that he deserved.  Although F. Murray Abraham did an excellent job in this movie, so did Tom as &quot;Mozart.&quot;  He is so good in this role that once you see the movie.......... you never forget how truly bleak his life was.  Unfortunately, he wasn't recognized!  This movie will take you back to the beginning of classical music and help you understand just how important it was and IS to our culture today!
6305897786|3.0|Hah, I thought that review title would get your attention! Actually this movie review is about the Ninth Gate, and has nothing to do with porn. There are 2 schools of thought on this film, that its a masterpiece or its a bomb. Which is the truth? Well, as far as the masterpiece goes, I dont see it. I see this as a mildy entertaining film that is best watched on a saturday afternoon when you have nothing to do. Its a quirky little mystery about some books that may or may not have some sort of supernatural ability encoded in them. Watching it a second time does reveal a bit of spooky clues, but there are no revelations that are buried deep within it or anything like that.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Syd Barrett's contribution to this album may have been minimal but listen to it and you can tell that the band was still guided by his vision of the band. The songs are all very much in his vein. I love the cartoonish psychedelia of &quot;See-Saw&quot;. The title track is overall brilliant. &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; is sort of like King Crimson-ish mythology. This album is Pink Floyd when they were still young and having fun in the 60's, before they became so damn ponderous.
B000002ACR|5.0|During the sessions for the Byrds fourth LP, YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY.  Tensions grew between the band and David Crosby.  The band seemed to be falling apart and rumours of their splitting up were evident.  However on February, 6, 1967 the Byrds released their fourth record.  Although the album charted at a disappointing #24 on the Billboard charts it took on a life of it's own and became a sign of clarity, maturity and overall unity despite the internal strife.<br />Although it may not be considered better than the Byrds early albums to some.  The album has aged very well and stands better than most of their other records do now.  <br />On this album Chris Hillman becomes an addition to the creative force of Roger McGuinn and David Crosby from the previous album.  Hillman's songs prove that he is a stellar songwriter with tunes such as HAVE YOU SEEN HER FACE, TIME BETWEEN, THOUGHTS AND WORDS and THE GIRL WITH NO NAME are all excellent.  <br />Roger McGuinn still acts as the undisputed leader of the band but he shows that the Byrds are still able to work together as he co-wrote the excellent WHY with Crosby and the hit SO YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK 'N ROLL STAR with Hillman. He also composes the catchy novelty tune C.T.A 102. <br />The real star on the album is David Crosby his song writing had improved greatly since FIFTH DIMENSION with songs like the awesome RENAISSANCE FAIR (one of my faves), The excellent EVERBODY'S BEEN BURNED and the trippy MIND GARDENS which everbody seems to hate but I don't mind it at all.<br />The group also proves that they can still do awesome Bob Dylan covers with a song MY BACK PAGES one of their greatest tunes ever!<br />The bonus material is an excellent addition to this reissue.<BR>It kicks off ith the pretty IT HAPPENS EACH DAY followed by the weak novelty tune DON'T MAKE WAVES. Next are two very good alternate version of MY BACK PAGES featuring an organ and MIND GARDENS which I think is better than the original.  After that is the groundbreaking Crosby tune LADY FRIEND which should have made the album!  I could never understand why this song was passed up!  Finally the cd reissue closes with the single version of OLD JOHN ROBERTSON which has a bizarre flavour to it.  Then it all wraps up with a trippy MIND GARDENS instrumental to complete this awesome remastered cd of YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY. <br />In retrospect YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY was very underrated and is probably more popular now then back in 1967.  It was a huge transitional album for a band going through turmoil and they pulled it off beautifully! <br />In conclusion YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY is an essential <BR>excellent addition to anyone's cd collection.  The album still sounds fresh today and has stood the test of time very well.  If you have not heard this cd yet, get it! Trust me you will not be disappointed.  This album delivers a beautiful message and if you have not heard it I suggest you do!  Highly recommended!
B000002UA0|5.0|This album is test of intelligence. If you are stupid, you probably prefer Waters-era Pink Floyd. Only the chosen few are bright enough to appreciate the esotericism and sophistication of this brilliant piece of art. Syd Barrett was the one who inspired David Bowie and Marc Bolan. So please, if you have a low IQ, stay away from this album. It's too good for you.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|i'd never heard much of whiskeytown or ryan adams until i heard an advance copy of this cd....wow!!  this album is very soulful...beautifully crafted with different timbres and different song styles.  one of the best albums of the year....
B000024D4R|2.0|I firmly agree with the previous poster who called this album &quot;mediocre&quot;. Perfect choice of words- this album is, indeed, quite mediocre. Of course, the post-Waters albums are worse than this, but that's not saying much. This album is total crap. CRAPOLA. The vocals are wooden and uninteresting, with warmed-over 70's heavy metal. Obviously, &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; 1 &amp; 2 is nice, but as has been pointed out, can be obtained on the Internet in combined form. Of the three central compositions, &quot;Pigs&quot; is the only very listenable track, but like the others, it suffers from its needless length. &quot;Dogs&quot; is absurdly turgid, and &quot;Sheep&quot; is unconvincing and ill-concieved. When you come down to it, this album is nothing more than three insanely bloated compositions that would've been better as five-minute songs each. Avoid.
0517548232|5.0|This is the best book I have seen for beginning an understanding of economics.  Hazlitt presents each subject in easy language, giving good examples at every point.<br />My only criticism is that some sections are much too short, leaving the reader with some unanswered questions.  Still, this is a wonderful and clear work.
B000002J09|5.0|Encompassing heavy metal, folk, pure rock &amp; roll, and blues Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album is a monolithic record, defining not only Led Zeppelin but the sound and style of '70s hard rock. Expanding on the breakthroughs of III. Zeppelin fuse their majestic hard rock with a mystical, rural English folk that gives the record an epic scope. Even at its most basic - the muscular, traditionalist &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; - the album has a grand sense of drama, which is only deepened by Plant's burgeoning obsession with mythology, religion, and the occult. Plant's mysticism comes to a head on the eerie folk ballad &quot;The Ballad of Evermore,&quot; a mandolin-driven song with haunting vocals and on the epic &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; Of all of Zeppelin's songs, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is the most famous, and not unjustly. Building from a simple fingerpicked acoustic guitar to a storming torrent of guitar riffs and solos, it encapsulates the entire album in one song. Which, of course, isn't discounting the rest of the album. &quot;Going to California&quot; is the group's best folk song, and the rockers are endlessly inventive, whether it's the complex, multi-layered &quot;Black Dog,&quot; the pounding hippie satire &quot;Misty Mountain Hop,&quot; or the funky riffs of &quot;Four Sticks.&quot; But the closer, &quot;When the Levee Breaks,&quot; is the one song truly equal to &quot;Stairway,&quot; helping give IV the feeling of an epic. An apocalyptic slice of urban blues, &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; is as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.
B00003CXSP|4.0|The moment he signed on to film Hannibal, Ridley Scott must have known he would be thrown out of the window and left to dangle like a Pazzi. It was utterly unavoidable that Hannibal would be held up against Jonathan Demme's rendition of Silence of the Lambs, and inevitable it would come off second best. Silence of the Lambs is not just any old potboiler, after all.<br /><br />So, instead of going head-to-head with Demme in the serial thriller stakes, Scott has done what any sensible director would do - made a different sort of film altogether. In some ways, he didn't have a choice - it's a different sort of book altogether. Inevitable though they may be, comparisons with Silence of the Lambs are pointless - you may as well compare Hannibal with The Remains of the Day - they both star Anthony Hopkins, after all.<br /><br />Where Demme concentrated on the suspense and narrative, Scott explores Harris' characterisation and the deeper thematic content of Harris' writing. The scenes in Florence especially, dealing with avarice and betrayal and Dante's inferno - all of which manifest themselves in poor Pazzi's undoing - are beautifully shot and constructed. This isn't to say the pulse doesn't quicken from time to time along the way, of course. But this time Hopkins tends to play it for laughs and not chills.<br /><br />The American half of the film is much less interesting, and departs more radically from Harris' novel. Sure, certain themes are reinforced - Starling repeatedly crosses bridges, (the Rubicon? the Styx?) and the steaming gates and \\"sulphurous\\" lakes of Mason Verger's estate are certainly equated with Dante's vision of hell from the earlier part of the film - but I think in this section Scott capitulates a little on his mission to avoid the cheap thriller, and inevitably it pales. Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling in a far more one-dimensional fashion than Jodie Foster did, when, given Scott's ambition, you'd expect quite the reverse. The contrast between Moore's uneasy performance and Hopkins' assured one is marked. The old boy is clearly having a whale of a time.<br /><br />The ending, which departs completely from Harris' original, seems to me to sell out the film's artistic pretenses in favour of commercial appeal (by the way, the \\"alternate ending\\" isn't very alternative at all, and is even less like the novel). Granted, the novel's ending wasn't popular, but it was courageous. The film's conclusion is neither, and the cynic in me wonders whether Scott wasn't leaving the way open for a sequel. Not, I should think, that Harris will write one.<br /><br />So, no fifth star, but a fascinating movie - in parts - all the same.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonmance and Hopkins' assured one is marked.

B00005N9CV|3.0|&quot;The Look of Love&quot; is Diana Krall's long-awaited followup to her 1999 Grammy-winning &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot;.  It probably isn't the followup myself (or other Krall fans)anticipated.  For me, the songs themselves reminded me of the music my father listened too when I was a kid.  Understandably so- its largely covers of those same songs (gasp!).<br />&quot;The Look of Love&quot; has its moments and, when listened in the right mood and setting, does well.  In other words, this isn't &quot;cruising&quot; music- its made up of &quot;laid back&quot; piano bar tunes you listen to in the dark driving home after a long day, or (better yet) that CD you put on after a fun night out on the town with your honey...that quiet romantic dinner...anyway, you get the idea.<br />&quot;The Look of Love&quot; doesn't measure up to the jazzy combo music Krall has done previously, but glimpses of those better times come out ocassionally- witness the soulful &quot;Cry Me A River&quot;, the amourous &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, or the well-done title track.  The best song to me, however, is the closer- &quot;Maybe You'll Be There&quot;- it easily could have fit into her 1999 triumph without a problem. <br />Unfortunately, &quot;S'Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;, and various other overstringed covers would not.  Overall, it's an OK CD, but falls short of her previous efforts.  The idea of combining Diana Krall with the London Symphony Orchestra sounded good, but let's hope she returns to her jazz excellence in the next album.
B00005ASOI|4.0|An excellent transfer of a long awaited release.  But while the original Italian soundtrack is included, there are no sub-titles!  That would have made it truly definitive in my opinion, compare Deep Red w/subtitles, why short change us non-Italian speaking Italian movie affectionados.  I mean, who do they think is buying this title?
6302797586|5.0|This is one of the earliest TV Miniseries.  I was 15-years old when I saw its premier on TV back in 1973 or 1974 and I truly couldn't stop sobbing at the end of this movie.  Not crying, SOBBING!  As a Jewish woman, I was GREATLY affected and upset by this film, therefore, if you are a sensitive person, please watch with caution.  It's not gory, but it will upset you.  I rate it amongst the greatest mini-series ever produced for television.  In my book this filmed version of Leon Uris' novel &quot;QB VII&quot; is right up there with other remarkable TV Miniseries undertakings such as &quot;The Awakening Land&quot;, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, &quot;Centennial&quot;, &quot;Captains &amp; The Kings&quot;, &quot;East Of Eden&quot; and &quot;Testimony Of Two Men&quot;.  Truly excellent.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor is a story of two young pilots' friendship and their love for the same woman, paralleled with the attack on Pearl Harbor. As spectacular as the special effects are, this film has some character flaws. Kate Beckinsale (Evelyn) is a real beauty and is well-cast as her character from that perspective, but her acting isn't believable or moving. She doesn't make us feel her love or her sorrow. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character (Dorie Miller) lacks character development in the screenplay, which is a pity since he plays a real-life hero. Josh Hartnett (Danny) is the real surprise in the cast. He gave the most believable performance, and with his onscreen charisma and boyish good looks, Pearl Harbor will be this heartthrob's big break into stardom. I expected Pearl Harbor's love story to be a real tear-jerker, yet I barely shed a tear. Even though it's sad, it lacks what it takes to drain us of our emotions or make our heart skip a beat. On the other hand, this film gives us a historical look at the devasting attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the sinking of the U. S. S. Arizona and the roll-over of the U. S. S. Oklahoma and from that perspective, it will leave you breathless and break your heart.

B00000ILGB|4.0|&quot;Auf einem Telegrafenpfahl ein Meuchelmörder seine Seele dressiert - abgeschlossen in einem eingebildeten Raum - nicht weit vom Ende der Welt - (Hallucination Guillotine)<br />&quot;Menschen mit dem Auftrag Angst zu verbreiten - schlafen in dem schmelzenden Haus aus Wachs - Tausende von Fenstern zerspringen - und die Alarmglocken hörst Du nicht mehr&quot; <BR>Gehe in den Turm des Schlafes - er erzählt Dir eine Geschichte - die Dich das Fürchten lehrt - Das Echo Deiner Schreie Fällt so tief ...<br />/&quot;Archangels Thunderbird&quot;<br />Um 1970 waren das sehr seltsame und neue  Klänge. Es klang so experimentell, sakral und far out, daß Gruppen wie Pink Floyd dagegen kommerziell klangen. Den Sound kann man schwer mit Worten beschreiben noch schwieriger duplizieren. Die Konzerte in München mit ihren monotonen Schwelltönen und einem ähnlichen Sound, daran werden sich noch heute etliche erinnern. Selbst nach 3 langen Jahrzehnten mit unzähligen neuen Stilrichtungen in der modernen Musik wie Gothic etc. klingt Yeti noch originell. Mir gefällt am besten die Seiten 3 und 4 mit den Improvisationen. Von den kürzeren Tracks &quot;Archangels Thunderbird&quot; (glaubte die Kommune wirklich mit diesem verrückten Heavy-Track einen Hit zu landen? vielleicht in den Beatschuppen der langhaarigen Progressivhörer damals), das unheimliche &quot;Pale Gallery&quot; und eine ruhige melodische Akustiknummer. Irgendwie meint man auch kurze dramatische Momente der deutschen Kulturjahrhunderte auftauchen zu hören. Lob verdient wieder einmal die Covergestaltung. Ich wünsche mir in heutiger Zeit mehr Gestaltungen wie &quot;Phallus Dei&quot;, &quot;Tanz der Lemminge&quot; oder &quot;Yeti&quot;, die sehr phantasievoll sind, keine Analysen der Musik textlich vorankündigen (auch keine Lebensläufe der Musiker). Die seltsam mystische Gestaltung macht alleine schon neugierig und jeder kann seine eigenen Vorstellungen in die Musik mit hineinspielen lassen. <BR>Der Sensenmann soll einer Legende nach (wahr oder nicht?) das Gruppenmitlgied/Gast Krischke gewesen sein, der zu dieser Zeit in Kronwinkel bei der Kommune wohnte. (Auf Drogenaeinfluß?) ging er  in den benachbarten großen Wald spazieren und erfror im winterlichen Schnee in der Kälte. Kurz vorher wurde von ihm das unheimliche Foto mit der Sense gemacht, das vorne auf dem Cover ist ... Dieser Gruppe hatte es die Todessymbolik angetan. Wann gab es jemals solche seltsamen unheimlichen und scheinbar zusammenhanglosen Lyriken? Mir fällt nur Marc Bolan ein, dessen Poesie aber etwas freundlicher ist.

0451167716|5.0|Here is a rarity - a book and film of the same name that both equal a powerful and passionate mix of family, loyalty, murder, corruption, and rich characters! THE GODFATHER, written in 1969 by Italian novelist and Mafia afficionado Mario Puzo, who also wrote the screenplay to the 1972 film with Francis Ford Coppola. <br />The movie draws you in like no other film can do. But I admit that I watched the movie MANY times before even reading this book. And you know what? I think that's better. Because I can see who's who in the parts without having to take up my time in picturing what the characters look like due to Puzo's epic description of each character! (That is my only complaint of the book; although Puzo tends to keep calling the characters Don Corleone instead of just The Don, or Sonny Corleone instead of just Sonny, or even Tom Hagen instead of just Tom, the book usually calls him Hagen, that tends to get very frustrating!)<br />The book has nine parts. Most of them deal with certain scenes from the film, others have been altered. (Honestly, the film version is better suited than some of the book's scenes. I guess that's because I'm used to the film.) We learn more about the characters who grace the screen for five minutes before disappearing forever. We get to know more of Johnny Fontane (who, in my opinion, was obviously based on Frank Sinatra), Carlo Rizzi, Clemenza, Tessio, Lucy Mancini, Luca Brasi and his dangerous past, the Five Families, Amerigo Bonasera (the first face we see in PART I), and others who appeared in THE GODFATHER, PART II (i.e. Rocco Lampone, Al Neri, etc.) All stories told with detail and backstory as to where they came from and what made these people tick.<br />All I can say is that this is excellent! Mario Puzo, though his only schpiel Mafia and gangsters, is very literate when it comes to storytelling; though, he needs to spell his words better. (You'll notice there are many misspelled words in the book.) Even though Puzo is gone, theheart and spirit of THE GODFATHER will forever be felt. As long as we have the book and the films, even PART III, we will never forget the Corleones.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Rita Hayworth has to be the most under appreciated actor of all time! She made two amazing films that truly showed what she could do with a few lines of dialogue and facial expressions that could a room ablaze. &quot;Gilda&quot; and its equal &quot;The Lady From Shanghai&quot; show off her talent in top form! In this Noir Hayworth is Gilda a smart, sexy and devlish woman who marries for money but seduces for kicks. The plot is a love triangle at its best due to the fact that the main characters Haywoth, Ford and Mundson all want lust and money! When the unlucky Farrell played to perfection by Glenn Ford is saved in a sedy alley by a sinister and scarred Mundson (Macready as the devil himself) Farrell soon learns that Mudson owns the hottest night club in town and the hottest woman - Gilda! But thing are not as they seem and when the film goes into Noit overdrive the viewer is rewarded with master shots of kissing, over the shoulder slaps and just plain shoot outs! Gilda is the ultimate film about greed and how it controls not you bu the people around you. The films dialouge is so slick that you might want to bring some of the slang into your everyday venacular! If &quot;The Lady From Shanghai&quot; turned Hayworth into the ultimate ice queen then Gilda paints her as the utlimate piece of ice sculpture! Beautiful, clear but not clear enough that the you can see clearly through it but as with ice and as with the film's heroin Gilda and its chracters have the ultimate meltdown and just our luck its for our own pleasure to watch it happen!

B00000G3AZ|4.0|Being a die-hard Austen fan, I couldn't resist watching this movie. Emma Woodhouse's story has always been my favorite of<br />Austen's efforts, and I am always glad to see her work brought to the screen. I was VERY pleased with this film.<br />Casting was well done.  Northam provides a sturdy, but not overly-stern, Knightley, and Paltrow does an amazing job of convincing us that she is, indeed, British in her portrayal of Emma.  Her accent is nearly flawless, and I felt that she truly captured the personality of Austen's most spoiled heroine.  The sets and lighting are bright, airy, and perfectly suited to the comedic approach taken by this particular director.  The scenes are edited just brilliantly.  Each scene flows seamlessly from one to another, and the pace of the plot runs along just perfectly.  It moves fast enough to keep everyone interested and slowly enough to make sure that everyone has enough time to absorb what's going on.<br />The criticism I've heard most often is that the film really only touches on the Jane Fairfax/Frank Churchill subplot for the briefest of moments.  I did not find that to be injurious to the film.  It's plain, while watching this version, that the director wanted to keep the story light and funny.  Adding Jane and Frank's saga would have done two things:  First, it would have seriously darkened and dramatized the bouncy and bright atmosphere of the entire film.  Second, it would have taken the spotlight off of Emma Woodhouse as the focus of the story.  I felt that, given the abbreviated length of time that a movie has in which to communicate a story...the omission of Frank &amp; Jane's affair was a wise choice.<br />The second criticism I've heard of the film is that it's just too clean and &quot;pretty&quot; to be accurately representative of Regency England.  Again...this didn't bother me.  The focus of this film is NOT to be true to history.  It is not a Regency documentary.  It is a fun and aesthetically pleasing depiction of Emma Woodhouse and her friends.  It's romantic, funny, charming, and very very pretty to look at.<br />I loved it.Emma Woodhouse and her friends.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|A great film for the parents and the kids to watch.  Funny, cute and adoriable are the first 3 words that come to my mind thinking about this movie.  It also sends a good message.  People shouldn't judge you by what you look like; they should judge you from the inside.  I think that is a good message to send along.  Try it!  Buy it rent.  Oh.. and make sure you don't laugh to many times from watchign this funny movie.
B00003CXV4|2.0|I have actually watched this film 6 straight times! Because the storyline and performances were so great? NO WAY!! Just the opposite!  I watched it so many times so I could see the music credits at the end!  I knew that Enia sang a number that the lyrics contained the title of this review. I guess I'll have to stop this review and watch the movie a SEVENTH time, because I still haven't nailed down the title of the song. One thing that Sweet November did accomplish though was that it preempted a 2005 remake of Love Story.

B00005N9CV|5.0|What can we say about Diana Krall that hasn't been said? She's beautiful and talented and has a way with a song. \\"The Look of Love\\" only further adds to the opinion that she is one of the more accomplished artists of our time. Her new CD shows her growth as an artist by venturing where she has not gone before.<br />Rather than stick with studio musicians, Diana enlists the help of the London Symphony Orchestra. Her voice blends pertectly with the muscianship and gives this CD a classical feel. Diana shows her ability to handle all kinds of music, from the Latin-tinged \\"Besame Mucho\\" (remember when the Beatles did this one?), to the more traditonal \\"S'Wonderful.\\". Other symphony-influenced pieces are are \\"The Night We Called It a Day\\", \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Dancing in the Dark\\".<br />Diana has always been a big fan of the great composers and she offers us the work of a wide variety. Bachrach and David's title track, Hoagy Carmichael's \\"I Get Along Very Well Without You\\", Johnny Mercer's \\"I Remember You\\" are all standouts.<br />Diana's voice has also remarkably improved (not that it was bad before!.) It's much softer and smoother, which fits in beautifully with the tone of this CD.<br />\\"The Look of Love\\" is a must buy for Krallaniacs everywhere. But now that you discovered Diana Krall, check out some other great artists like Jane Monheit, Tierney Sutton, and the late great Susannah McCorkle.

There's little I can add to a book averaging 4 1/2 stars in 300 plus reviews, but I will toss in my two cents anyway.<BR>For those interested in the writing and &quot;how to&quot; aspects, the biographical information is revealing. One gets a glimpse at how a person who chooses to express themselves through writing often makes such decisions early on in life and creates an inextricable bond between themself and their chosen mode of expression.<br />For those interested only in the memoir it's still well worth while.  You get a glimpse behind the scenes at the processes behind many of his works, as well as the tools used in creating them.  Plus you get an easy to digest writing primer free of charge.<BR>I haven't read a Stephen King novel in over ten years but I inhaled this one almost greedily!

There is little else to say about this excellent album.<br />While Dylan's early albums were little more than him, a guitar, a microphone, and a tape deck -- the recent Dylan offerings have actually been produced. (Imagine if Phil Spector had gotten his wish and actually produced a Dylan album.)<br />Even if you have been away from Dylan for a number of years or were turned off by the return to the folk/blues tradition, come back -- this album's worth the effort. Wonderful listening pleasure.

B00004Z459|5.0|In the last review I wrote for this, i just said that they aren't like Limp Bizkit or Papa Roach. This time, I'll tell you what they are. Their music, while at first listen it may sound shallow, is actually deeply layered. Often, more than one person will sing/rap/shout/whisper at once, creating an awesome effect which really works incredibly well. On Crawling, for example, whispering voices echo some of the lyrics, while on In The End (the best song on the album), the verses are rapped but the start of every other line is sung too. The group can actually sing well, rap well and whisper/shout with emotion. The music is nicely complex too. One Step Closer is the only simplistic song on the album, and really is different from Linkin Park's usual intelligent music, though still a rocking track. The guitar work is excellent, most obviously at the start of A Place For My Head, and Joseph Hahn is easily the best DJ any band, rock, dance or whatever has ever seen. The album has an incredible atmosphere, excellent music and brilliant vocals - I have had it for about six months, and I still listen to it regularly - which, since I have over 20 albums I listen to is quite a feat.
B00005NKCM|5.0|This British series is in a &quot;class&quot; by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s. The story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family &quot;Upstairs&quot; and their servants &quot;Downstairs,&quot; but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen. The characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath. This unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging saga is not to be missed. I genuinely rejoice that such a remarkable treasure is finally available on DVD. Originally broadcast on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre.

The plot is creatively unfolded, revealing the tragic past of a rugged woman gun-slinger, with a fast hand and attitude for sale. The cast gives an outstanding performance that draws you into the rough-and-tumble wild, wild, west. Not only does this movie give you 105 minutes of non-stop action, it also has a catchy soundtrack that makes you snap your fingers! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, especially at the end! &quot;The Quick And The Dead&quot; is a must-see movie that will captivate the audience almost immediately, and in the end keeps you begging for more.
B0000024TQ|5.0|Well, this very well might be Simon and Garfunkel's finest hour. Or in this case, I guess I should say half-hour. Still no great album ever wore out it's welcome, and S&amp;G use their time very well. Sure the first half has been called conceptual, ranging from childhood to old age, yet the folk melodies stand quite well on their own. I love pretty much every tune, even &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot; which certain skeptics have written off. The second is very upbeat and contains many classics like &quot;Fakin' it&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot;, and the fitting closer &quot;At the Zoo&quot;, which ends perfectly with a fade-out of yet another classic shared vocal by the duo. &quot;Bookends theme&quot; is such a classic opener as well, with it's reoccuring position solidifying one of S&amp;G's most profound statements about life (one after &quot;Old Friends&quot;). Preserve the few S&amp;G albums we were given, they're all that's left you.

Take away her name and vocals and no one within a million miles would touch this sappy mess. For Pete's sake get rid of that orchestra! Yikes! It simply does not work this time, plain and simple. Even the record store where I go people were asking the manager to turn that thing off! How sad. I own all of her other cd's and this is by far her worst. Dress her up as a sex kitten and forget about what got her here. Now she's famous, so the powers that be are running the show, no matter what she says. This cd blows, I'm sorry I bought it, but for those of you who think Diana is god and can do no wrong, then this sap is for you.
0800139151|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies, and let me just say that this one will always remain my all-time favorite! The plot is creatively unfolded, revealing the tragic past of a rugged woman gun-slinger, with a fast hand and attitude for sale. The cast gives an outstanding performance that draws you into the rough-and-tumble wild, wild, west. Not only does this movie give you 105 minutes of non-stop action, it also has a catchy soundtrack that makes you snap your fingers! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, especially at the end! &quot;The Quick And The Dead&quot; is a must-see movie that will captivate the audience almost immediately, and in the end keeps you begging for more.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I got this album after hearing &quot;Svefn g englar&quot;, which is a beautiful song. The singer reminds me a lot of Kent's singer (for example track 4), and musically this album reminds me of across between Kent's &quot;Isola&quot; and Bowery Electric.
B00005NWRS|3.0|Can you blame someone for cleaning up their sound and going for the big time?  \\"Gold\\" doesn't sound like past Adams work, which by no means is a bad thing.  He should be pushing himself to make different music, but \\"Gold\\" is just so mid tempo, slick, \\"I wanna get played on VH1\\" stuff.  Sure their are the typical flashes of brilliance one would expect form such a potentially great artist.  \\"New York New York\\" works a hell of a groove, and \\"La Cienga Just Smiled\\" is quite lovely.  But much of the rest is so blah blah blah.  He beats the \\"my girlfriend dumped me and I'm going to give you 16 different versions of the same depressing song\\" into the ground.  Gone is the poignancy of songs like \\"Houses on the Hill\\" and \\"In My Time Of Need\\", and the intensity of \\"Ballad Of Carol Lynn\\" and \\"Waiting to Derail\\" and the sheer beauty of \\"Avenues\\" and \\"Tennessee Square\\".  \\"Gold\\" sounds like he is trying to put a candy coating on his best moments from the past and become the next big thing.  That being said \\"Gold\\" is more Mellancamp than Dylan, more Counting Crows than Replacements, more Son Volt than Wilco.  He needs to start coming up with original things to say, and original ways to say them.  Until then he'll be praised by regular people wanting their regular music...  But his music loving fans who've been with him since Whiskeytown will dwindle one by one.
B00005NWM3|5.0|If u like all the rock out there right now u will like this cd.  This cd rocks, songs #1,2,4,6 are the rockin ones.  the voice,drums,guitars and etc. go so well together.  if u like creed, tantric, collective soul, music like that, you will like this new nickelback CD!!!!!!!!!!!!! go buy it.  thank you
B00005N83M|5.0|I thought this CD was great, there was a great mix of songs and I loved the latin flavor she added to a lot of the songs.  I originally wasn't a fan of Jennifer Lopez when she first came out singing, none of her songs impressed me, but I liked &quot;My Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; so I bought this.  I was surprised to find I liked the majority of the songs on the CD.  I listen to it all the time.  Its fun to listen to all the time.
B00004U30D|4.0|American Beauty is not an easily viewed movie. It's depressing and tragic. It has a nice touch of dark comedy that is quite good, but, there's just something that makes this movie viewable more than once. Kevin Spacey plays a middle aged suburban dad who goes through one hell of a midlife crisis. He quits his job and starts to fall for his daughter's cheerleader girlfriend. Annette Bening plays his harried wife. The actors are all really, really good. Spacey is phenomenal. But, the ending, I don't want to go there. This is a movie that a lot of people are not going to get or will want to watch at all. They should see it at least once. This might not be their cup of coffee or views on how life is, but it's interesting nonetheless.
B000056K04|1.0|The only reason i'm rating this is bacuase i want to bring down the average rating. Basically, this cd really sucks. i just started liking dmb during last summer. I bought this cd and at first it was ok. but then i listened to all the other cds and learned how wonderful they really are, and when i played this cd i realized it isn't the same at all. dmb is the best music ever, so if you like music go buy another cd, but if you like the whole pop music stuff, then you should look into this. Dave is amazing, and even in everyday although, you can barely tell it is dave. If you liked this all i have to say is go listen to the other stuff because it is the most wonderful stuff ever. Also go find a big dmb fan and get them to give you the lillywhite sessions, because that is really good.
0812550706|5.0|How do I begin? It's increadibly hard to talk about Ender's Game (and the rest of the series) to someone who hasn't read it. The story is about an 8-year-old boy, Ender, who is tormented by his peers and by his older brother. He is an embarasment to his parents, as he is their third child, and the only reason he was born was for the milatary. He is a genius and the milatary wants his mind for its ability to understand his enemy and still be cunning.<BR>But the story isn't all that the book is about. Character depth and development is a big part of the book. Also, Card explores the child's mind, especially gifted ones. Most other books with children as characters potray the children as faceless, lifeless cardboard cutouts. This is not the case in any of the Ender books.<BR>Overall, Ender's game must be read to be valued. I have finished the sequel, Speaker for the Dead, and am currently reading Xenocide, the third book in the series.
B00004U2NX|5.0|It's widescreen, but that usually never matters to me.  This movie is the best since F.W. Marnau's older version of the film.  Although a few things have changed, the wives of Harker and Westenra were switched around and the vampire's name is Dracula instead of Graf Orlock.  But I don't care, it's the same vampire that has the black cloak, long fingers, bald head, and pointed ears.  That's probably the scariest version of Dracula that there will ever be.  I just started reading the novel by Bram Stoker, and I'm so far impressed.  One day I hope to find this video in a non-widescreen format, as it gets a little irritating after a while.  This movie should actually get a difinate PG-13 for the scenes at the beginning that included all those desmembered corpses and victims of the vampire, heck, I'd even give it an R if I had to.  But oh well.  Klaus Kinski does a very good job of playing Nosferatu, he's very scary.  I don't recommend this film for young children, I'd suggest ages 9 and up.
B000002KB8|5.0|This album is a good example of Black Sabbath's best work. It includes such classics as NIB and Black Sabbath, but also includes less know song like The Wasp and Wicked World that are equally noteworthy. For anyone who likes Black Sabbath or anyone who just likes metal, this album is a must buy.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|Cast Away is something rare and special in Hollywood. It's an epic Hollywood blockbuster type with a name actor and director that is actually brilliant, classy, and worth all of it. Usually, those types of films are hollow and eye candy. That's okay too, you know. This film shows that they can also be the exact opposite. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a fed-ex worker who goes on a flight for a delivery and the plane crashes into the sea. Chuck drifts(on an inflatible boat)to a remote island. Chuck ends up spending four years on that island. His only companion is a volleyball named Wilson. Chuck wonders about his girlfriend back home, who's played by Helen Hunt. Hanks' performance is a one man showstopper. He proves again why he is such a loved and respected performer. He deserves all of the attention and respect. He deserved the Oscar instead of Russell Crowe. Crowe wasn't anything stand-outish. If Hanks hadn't of won twice already, he would've won this too. Helen Hunt is usually good, but she is given way less to do here to really review. Her end scenes with Hanks are pretty good tho. This movie defied all odds. It was one man on a deserted island for the majority of the film. Tons of film were without dialogue and music. Very risky and brave. Director Robert Zemeckis pulled it off brilliantly. He always does. This is a great, up-lifting, spiritual film that would make anybody feel better about themselves for seeing this. This is a Hollywood classic. Do yourself a favor and forget about &quot;Survivor&quot;. This film is the way it should be. A must see.
0553278398|5.0|I read this a very long time ago when I was in my early teens. This book sets the stage for the Foundation series.... Young Hari Seldon journeys around the technotronic planet Trantor and unravels the future of the empire... This book was written after Foundation and the other novels... but is sequenced as the first in the series. It is frequently skipped, but I consider it among the best novels in the series. It really sets the background for anyone jumping into the Foundation series.
B00005BF9Z|3.0|Manu Chao looks like the bright schoolboy who hasnt done his<BR>homework and improvises it quickly just before the class starts.<BR>Thats more or less the impression I get after listening to <BR>this album.

6305014140|4.0|I am sure that I am not alone in acclaiming Ninja Scroll to be one of the foremost achievements in the field of anime since Akira.  The construction of the heroic archetype in Jubei, the not-quite-helpless and thoroughly paradoxical figure of Kagero, the cunningly wise Dakuan, each takes us back to a time not of fairy tale, but of myth, where supernatural powers were to be feared.  The Devils of Kimon provide a worthy balance to the heroic elements.  If this were all, it would still be a solid tale, but the Devils are more than just villains.  In fact, it is debatable whether or not one of them, Utsutsu Mujuro, is more strictly &quot;honorable&quot; than the hero himself, and because of this, we are constantly called on to reassess the place of the hero within the story.  The film is violent, and occasionally is a little excessive in that.  It is not overly nor gratuitously sexualized, however: the scenes involving Kagero are all necessary for moving the plot forward.<BR>This movie was one of my first experiences with serious anime, and it opened up an entire level of interpretation whereby &quot;cartoons&quot; suddenly were not solely within the demesne of children.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is a film which actually means something.  Not your run-of-the-mill love story with some teen idol and some teeny bopping girl, no.  It's about the reality of drug usage, mainly speed and heroin to be exact.  When you watch this film, you will see how all four of their lives slowly deteriorate into nothing as they become addicted to the drugs and make it their lives.  It starts off with Harry (Jared Leto) taking his mothers TV for drug money, starting off the journey to sadness.  Then they come up with a master plan to sell the drugs to gain a profit and have it easy for the rest of their lives.  But while they do this, Harry's mother Mary, gets a call saying she's going to be on television.  So she takes out a red dress inwhich she wore to Harry's graduation, and noticed she has gained some wait.  So she decides to go on a diet.  She tries everything, and nothing worked, so she calls a doctor who prescribes her &quot;uppers&quot;, or speed, if you will.  Then as they start to wear off, she takes more and more at one time to keep the buzz, causing her to have frightening halucinations.  On the other story, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), a buddy of Harry's, gets busted after talking to his business connections and a shootout takes place.  So Harry needs to spend all his money bailing out Tyrone, using up most of the drug profits and the rest of his money, causing his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to get extremely angered.  You should see the rest to find the results of this mind-tingling and fairly-harsh movie, because you will enjoy it for its entertainment and its meaning.  I cried at the end, which shows you I thought it was a very fine film.  Have fun.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|When Ray died I figured I had heard the last of Badlands. I couldn't believe it when I found this album. Its by far my favorite album because much of the recording is very raw. <BR>It took a while to be released but was definately worth the wait.
B00001OH7U|5.0|If a classic album is defined as being appreciated immediately<BR>after not listening to it for a long time then Station to Station <BR>is  certainly a classic album.<BR>All songs coherent with each other. <BR>Inspired by Elvis Presley(Golden Years,Wild is the wind)<BR>this is David Bowie at his best moments.<br />A record you want to play while drinking a glass of champagne<BR>with the beautiful wife of your best friend....<BR>Highly recommended.
6304618344|2.0|My favorite scene in this whole very bad movie was when all of John Travoltas cop buddies were killed and all he says is &quot;Not Tito?&quot; Who was Tito anyway? If for some strange reason that make a Face Off 2, I do beleive they should call it &quot;Not Tito 2&quot;. <br />The other big thing that annoyed me about this film, was how John Travoltas family touched each others faces. At first I would imagine it would be sweet, but after a while I would just have to say &quot;Stop Touching my face&quot;.
6305511055|4.0|Wire-rimmed glasses and a slight stubble of beard isn't enough to make Robert Redford completely convincing as a bookish CIA researcher, though he gives a terrific &quot;movie star&quot; performance (partially the result of co screenwriter David Rayfiel being brought in to customize some of Redford's dialouge).<br />Also, Director Sydney Pollack (&quot;Tootsie&quot;) doesn't seem to have the feel for suspense-thriller pulp (the way someone like Peckinpah had), so &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; is a little too monotone and flat at times to be a completely successful representative of the genre.<br />No matter.<br />&quot;Three Days of The Condor&quot; had all the timing in the world going for it.<br />Released in 1975, just on the heels of Watergate and in the midst of the Church Committee hearings on CIA excesses, &quot;Condor&quot; became the only box office success of Paramount Pictures &quot;Conspiracy Trilogy&quot; (the others being &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Parallax View&quot;).<br />It's also worth noting the cinematography (done by the great Owen Roizman) is spectacular...the rainy Manhattan streets never looked so beautifully moody....and the score by Dave Grusin avoids all the usual thriller movie stabs and sting.<br />The transfer quality of the DVD is superb, but the special features are non existent (all that's included is the original theatrical trailer--hardly a &quot;special feature&quot; in today's DVD world).<br />&quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; remains essentially a stylish artifact of mid-70's paranoia, and viewed today, in light of recent events, contains some really bizarre echoes.
6305014140|5.0|This was a good animation but I thought it lacked in violence. They could have put more blood, more killing, more nudity, more rape scenes, and more demons. If they did it would have been a perfect movie. If you're religious, and this movie offends, rent Bambi. Really this movie is not that violent.
B00003CXRM|3.0|I just watched this film and can say that I enjoyed it upon first viewing. It left me entertained and was very inventive and original, like most Coen brothers films. However, a rental might be the ideal way to go before buying to get a taste of the film or else it may leave a little to be desired. Those expecting &quot;Fargo 2&quot; just because this is by the Coens should go elsewhere.<br />Purportedly based on The Odyssey, the film can be enjoyed without any prior knowledge of that book. There are plenty of moments where the film left me confused, but you tend to overlook these things in a film like this. It can be enjoyed on two levels: as a story about 3 chain-gang escapees and there adventures, or as that coupled with the symbolic references to The Odyssey. Though some of the references aren't too difficult to associate with some basic knowledge of that work (the sirens, the cyclops), it would be pretty neat to have read the book and deduce the references to it.<br />The actors give good performances, although the characters are somewhat overshadowe by the humorous southern accents and odd situations they're put in. My main problems with the film is its characters as they don't seem to have much depth, especially John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson's characters. The main characters seem only to serve as mechanisms to further the plot by getting into sticky situations and then getting out of them again. Not a problem in a comedy, but I don't know if you can say this film fits completely under the comedy genre.  <br />The DVD is pretty well done. The Painting with Pixels extra discusses how the filmmakers achieved the film's dry, burnt coloration and it's pretty cool; the look of the film is fabulous and really takes you to the Depression-era.  Also, the multi-angle feature comparing the film to its storyboards is well done (although your standard storyboard comparison), and the music video &quot;I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is a good addition as well.<br />I only gave this film 3 stars because I can't justify giving it a better rating (maybe 3 1/2). It is enjoyable in an old-fashioned slapstick adventure way, and if you're a Coen brothers fan, this will probably be up your alley.  However, his film may be lost on a lot of people. Even if you're a fan of the Coens, it might be to your distaste. It's not a bad film, but if you often find yourself going &quot;What? What happened just then?&quot; a lot during a movie, you might want to skip this one.
B00003CX8I|2.0|There are two ways of watching &quot;X-Men&quot;: either as a bad sci-fi flik, or as a worse film version of the comic book/animated series. As a sci-fi flik, &quot;X-Men&quot; isn't as bad as it is silly. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine has an overmoussed 'do, Patrick Stewart never comes off the screen as anyone but himself, and the fight sequences are so heavily computerized that the characters are almost continuously in the air.<br />If watched as a film version of the classic comic book series, things get infinitely worse. &quot;Humanized&quot; in the best Hollywood traditions, the X-men act like sulky teenagers: they push and curse and &quot;claim their girls.&quot; The last is especially ridiculous, since reducing the cast of X-men to three essentially ensures that there's a love triangle. The conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine for the affections of Jean Grey is ludicrous in the extreme. Storm, the only other &quot;official&quot; team member in the movie, is a non-entity. Where are Beast, Gambit, and Nightcrawler?<br />Continuing efforts of making the movie more &quot;mature&quot; lead to very few improvements. The movie makes the leap from cartoon violence to real violence: in the cartoon, we would have never seen Wolverine run his claws through Mystique. We would have never seen Senator Kelly, the mutant-hating McKarthy clone (R-Kansas), agonizingly dissolve into water.<br />The plot is a miracle of compression: the impression is that the writers tried to squeeze in every last bit of X-men lore and then tossed out or changed whatever they didn't like. Thus, the central storyline is a retelling of the first episode of the cartoon series, only with Rogue (her sheepish character has nothing at all to do with brash but competent woman from the cartoon) in place of Jubilee (the only other change is that Wolverine is not yet an X-man, which makes very little difference). When the movie tires of this thread, it switches to Magneto's evil plot to change everyone intomutants, if only to allow for more floaty fight sequences.<br />A lot of the original's entertainment value came from the intrinsic exoticism of the X-Men's allies and foes. Thus, Cyclops and his team fought Apocalypse in ancient Mayan temples, Magneto in the Lost Land, and even Deathbird in outer space. Here, there are three villains besides Magneto: Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad - all of them with zero backstory. The writers forgot that Mystique is Nightcrawler's mother, and that her power is shape-changing, not acrobatics. Isn't Sabretooth supposed to have resulted from the same cruel experiments that created Wolverine?<br />Magneto (Ian McKellen) is really the only sympathetic character in the film, probably unintentionally. I could identify with his cynical view of mankind. He was a significant character in a crowd of cardboard cutouts.<br />&quot;X-Men&quot; ends on a happy note: I was happy that it was over. I'd much rather watch the cartoon.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback's Silver Side Up has got to be the coolest cd i own. i love all the songs and they are great live. Buy It Now!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forest gump is a great movie, with a great story. It made me laugh from the beginning to the end. How can you not laugh, watching that goofy bastage go through life and getting into situations only an ice ole would get into. That subana bish Gump had me cracking up. Especially when he teamed up with Bubba, an even goofier shrimp eating bastage. Those two fargain ice oles are a dynamic duo in comedy. Like Gumps mother said, &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates. You never now what you're gonna get, because you're sofa king we Todd did Forest.
B00005A46T|4.0|Death metal is pretty much dead. Slipknot is something new. It's pretty good too. This CD basically reminds me of a cross between Korn and Fear Factory. They're not afraid to use a death metal voice, technology, drum machines and synths (like Fear Factory); and for a heavy band, the sound is fairly approachable (like Korn).<br />I would not put Slipknot in the same league as Death, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, or Sepultura (the only one of those bands surviving); but they're not really as light as Korn either. I like the fact that Slipknot does not seem to take themselves too seriously, and have a Marilyn Manson/Gwar sense of showmanship about them. There's nothing really new here, but it's sounds good, and there are no other really good new bands trying to take on the hard core metal edge these days (aside from, believe it or not, Kittie. Those girls kick!).<br />If you want some good death metal, get \\"Scum\\" by Napalm Death, \\"Human\\" by Death, \\"Butured at Birth\\" by Cannibal Corpse, and Anything by Sepultura.
B00005ATQE|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is the best war movie ever. Full Metal Jacket shows us how army can destroy people's minds. It starts in a military base where men are trained to become marines for the Viet-Nam war. One man, who is a bit fat, is hated by the colonel, who beats him and who discovers a donut in his box. He makes the others hate the guy and one night, the others (including Joker, his friend)beat him up. He is sad and then decides to get better in the marine training...and it works, but he then kills the colonel and himself...Then they go to the war and many things happen...this is a psychological film, more human than The Thin Red Line, and more dramatic than Saving Private Ryan. The actors were excellent too, but it seemed like the film was incomplete. Kubrick is the master, a god!!! See this film at all costs!
0141000198|5.0|A gift from my aunt, she chose the perfect thing!<br />I loved it, I plan on reading it again. It was so<br />funny, and there were lots of little things about<br />Bridget that I could identify with!! I could hardly<br />put the thing down, and I found myself wanting to<br />say British phrases and talk with a British accent!<br />Very funny, very good for single girls of any age.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I am not a huge anime fan.  I've only seen the ones that come recommended by others because i enjoy this totally new style of animation.  I've seen about 8 of them and Akira clearly stands out among the rest.  It's strongest point is a great story line, even though anime story lines take a little getting used to.  For an animation it is very long, but it kept me hooked the whole time and the new dvd format provides crisp sound and picture.  A definite must have!
6303407188|5.0|Ed Wood, was Tim Burton's best for sure. I enjoyed it from the beginning, which is an introduction like they made in cheap scary movies of these years to the great ending where they tell us everything that happened to the characters after the Plan 9 From Outer Space Premiere. it was funny and touching and I'll never see Edward D. Wood Jr. the same way. He was not stupid at all, he simply had no talent. He was nice and positive and happy most of the time, and he enjoyed his movies, he really thought his films were great. He is just the opposite of Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane, the best American film. Ed Wood made the worst. Martin Landau was EXCELLENT in the role of Bela Lugosi, and his arms were disgusting (because of all the stitches he had) and he won the oscar for best supporting actor, but I thought Johnny Depp gave an AWESOME performance too. It represents the story of Edward D. Wood Jr. the best way we could imagine. The fact that the film was in black and white was another good point too...we were more in the atmosphere of old films. It was funny, smart, and it was not laughing at anyone, even with the main character (the worst director of all time) and that was a good surprise. The kind of film you have to watch over and over again...don't rent it, BUY IT. It is great! Not the best film I've seen, but quite a good piece of entertainment. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this, who was in my mind a bad actor...but I realized he played in good films and in this one he did a very good job. When I'll see Ed Wood films, I'll remember how he was feeling and how he liked them, and I'm sure I'm gonna like them too, if I watch them with this idea in my head. Watch it at all costs...I didn't find it in the three first videos I went to, but I finally found it and enjoyed it.
0316777722|5.0|Im only halfway through this book, but already, I can't<br />wait to finish it and read his others. I am very<br />excited to learn Mr Sedaris had several other books!<br />Very funny, love it.
B000002C1W|5.0|This is Pink Floyd's first Water-less release, and it's not bad as some Waters fanatics are trying to show it. This album has that indisputable Floydian charm that the previous PF releases had. This is even more melancholy, more spacey and emotional. Definitely better than &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, it doesn't only compromise the three PF members, it has a whole army of musicians (about twenty!). What a difference from their previous albums!<br />One might wonders if that's any good, and without a doubt i can tell you it's not only good it's fantastic. Helped by the amazing production of Bob Ezrin, Gilmour, Mason and Wright made another great crowd - pleaser.<br />Maybe &quot;AMLOR&quot; has just a bit too much influence from the eighties than it should, but none the less, it gives this album a lot of charm, the way a PF could never sound with Waters. A lot of people didn't like that, but a don't give a damn about it. This was the album i played over and over for weeks when i first got it. Just listen to &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; (a true Pink Floyd anthem), &quot;One Slip&quot;, &quot;On The Turning Away&quot;, that has one of Gilmour's best guitar solos &amp; &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;, the best Floydian instrumental ever. Listening to &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; &amp; &quot;Sorrow&quot;, the two best songs that have Gilmour's best lyrics will give you chills and i guarantee will make you love this masterpiece. Highly recommended!
0800141326|1.0|Yeah, Godzilla is a cheese pie the director throws in our faces...The special effects were not that good(and even before seeing the movie, I knew it would be the only interest in this one)and the girl who plays Matthew Broderick's wife is even worse than Rose McGowan and all the stupid ''actresses'' in Jawbreaker. She didn't have a lot of things to say and she got nominated for the worst actress at the Rizzies' fest. And what about Matthew Broderick? He played in ''MASTERPIECES''like Inspector Gadget and Godzilla...what an annoying career! I am kidding when I am saying he had a good career. Jean Reno deceived me a lot, even when I think about the fact that he had not a big role. But when I think about the fact that the biggest role in this film was the dinosaur made by computer, I tell myself; let's skip this one in Jean Reno's career. He was excellent in The Professional and in other movies...The film is completely ridiculous, and doesn't follow the steps of the old Japanese series, in which he was fighting other monsters to save the city. In this thing, he is the big enemy...and the last twenty minutes were supposed to be the most suspenseful part of the movie...nobody saw it, because everyone was asleep after the FIRST twenty minutes. Even The Lost World was better than this all the way(and The Lost World was a BIG FAT HUGE disapointment)! I just want to imagine what directors as good as Martin Scorcese, Stanley Kubrick(he was alive when Godzilla released)could have done with a near budget...this was a nightmare from the awful beginning to the awful ending...I don't think any other mistakes like this one should be done in the future...well....I hope so!
B000000OAN|5.0|This was Queen's first great album, and not surprisingly their breakthrough one. The string arrangements are amazing, and the whole production flows seemingly with the whole album. This is a rock symphony in the true sense of the word.<br />Every time i hear &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; i just keep wondering how fresh it sounds even today, twenty - six years after its release. There's a lot of satire in here, the way only Freddie could do. Just listen to &quot;Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot; and you'll get the picture. This is a great album to listen to after a hard day. Freddie's voice is fantastic (was there a time it wasn't?) and that's the first thing that you'll notice.<br />As i said, the string arrangements are amazing. I don't think there's any one out there who doesn't know &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, a song that Mercury transforms in a mini - opera that you wish it will go on and on. Landmark song that definitely marked Queen's carrier. Really great video for this one too. Maybe even better sounding is &quot;The Prophets Song&quot;, eight - minutes of delight, capable of making you believe like you're really listening to an opera, not a rock album. Maybe that's what Freddie wanted us to believe. Well, he did it!
6305909326|4.0|The Ninth Gate isn't Polansky's best (his best being Chinatown) but it's still a very good film. The settings are wonderful, the atmosphere is so strong that I could almost feel an old book smell. Johnny Depp is a talented actor (in Tim Burton's Ed Wood, especially), and he plays his role very well. Everything is mysterious in this film, especially ''The Girl'' (that's how she is credited), whose name is never revealed. The ending was the only deception in this film, and partly because it was the end of this very good film. The story reminds me many other movies, but it's not clear in my head which ones...A rare book dealer named Corso is paid by a collector to prove that his copy of The Nine Gates book is the original one. There are only three copies of this book in the whole world. One of them is in the United states, another one in France and the last one in Spain. But Corso (played by Johnny Depp, by the way) discovers that three parts of each copy are written by the devil himself...and three parts in three books make nine gates...and the ninth gate is the key to see the devil...A good film, especially for the settings...pretty enjoyable...
B000002H33|5.0|Oh man, this is something i need to listen to at least once a week or i won't be able to live! This is so hard, so intense, so fast that is a real cooling - out album, at a time you feel like you need to just blow every thing around you! Turn the volume up, lock the door and go crazy.<br />This is the album that is considered to be the best trash album ever. True! But it's more than that. It focuses on melody more than \\"Ride The Lightning\\", it has a more complex structure than their first two albums. Unfortunately, this is their last with Cliff Burton. His playing is fantastic. Just listen to \\"Master Of Puppets\\", the song that in my opinion has the most powerful riff that Hetfield ever came upon or \\"Orion\\", and this one is the best ever Metallica instrumental track (i still don't believe how good it is). <br />Hammett plays with such speed that it's hard to keep up with him (listen to the solo from \\"Master Of Puppets\\", probably his most emotional). What really amazes me is the drumming of Lars Ulrich. It's unbelievable! And so is the whole album. Not a weak spot anywhere. Fifteen years past since it was released and it's still respected and acclaimed as one of the hardest albums to come out of the eighties.
B00005ATQC|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut was the last Kubrick masterpiece (his last film, in other words). We can say his carreer (and life) ended in a nice way (without being mean). This film is amazing, mysterious, very well acted and extremely well directed! I can't understand why it is not nominated for last year's best movie! I thought this one was better than American Beauty, which was my favorite of last year before seeing Eyes Wide Shut (but I didn't see Man On The Moon). I guess the Academy couldn't nominate it because it was ''too hot for Oscar''. This is not the best Kubrick film (with films like 2001:A Space Odyssey, Dr.Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Clockwork Orange, it's pretty hard to do better than all of these!!!!!) but it worth watching! When I told people I wanted to see Eyes Wide shut, they said ''I wonder why!'' but they were wrong...when you watch this film, go further than watching the nudity and fast-forwarding the rest of the film...if you do so, you won't like the film. I am a big fan of Kubrick movies and I was very interested in the whole film. It was mysterious, the atmosphere was very enjoyable. Kubrick made a kind of mix of his films (Lolita, Clockwork Orange and even The Shining!!!). A must-see! the ending was like the ending of the other Kubrick films, surprising, intelligent and appropriate. I loved it.
630505116X|3.0|Deep Rising is not an under estimated film, I would feel guilty saying that...but it is not THAT bad...the scenario was common with many cheap macho horror movies, but the whole thing was entertaining, or at least watchable. The actors were not fantastic (Treat Williams is Treat Williams...) but the atmosphere was creepy...sometimes. And somepeople liked the awful Virus with Jamie Lee Curtis better than this one...listen, Virus was a cheap and boring rip-off of this film (and this film was not a miracle at all) and I enjoyed this one a lot more than Virus. The special effects were plain cheap, and the blood seemed to be of a dark pink, but I don't know why, I didn't hate this film...maybe it's because I just saw End Of Days before, but for a cheap action/horror film, this one is the best. The ending was stupid and pathetic, but the rest of the film is almost okay...it's scaring me..! The film is about the crew of a small boat who discover that something killed the whole crew of another ship, a cruise ship. But now, they are attacked by these creatures from the deep ocean. Not THAT bad, but still stupid...
630575067X|4.0|well all i have too say is that the movie was good <BR>the lightsaber battles were awesome but the jar jar binks thing<BR>was pretty stipid george lucas must of been picking his nose and getting drunk when he thought of jar jar<BR>but it was a good movie and i hope you star wars fans will give it a try because come on its star wars
B000059XY5|4.0|Batman Returns was very good. The backgrounds made an nice-looking atmosphere going perfectly with the story and the different moments in the film. The story was basicly simple, but became better when Penguin and Catwoman met each other to ally up against Batman. There are things I did'nt understand, like when Celina Kael dies and cats bite her and then she gets back to life and has a weird cat influence. But this phenomenon was there to add some mystery to this dark movie. Batman is again fighting the bad guys, and living as Bruce Wayne, the nice billionaire. But there is one detail that everyone should forget to say the movie was at least a bit intelligent;forget that people don't recognize his voice when he has his Batman costume! But still this film was a lot of fun. This is a superhero movie, like the first Batman (not the other two things they called Batman Forever and Batman and Robin!!!!), these were the best superheroes movies of these years! But when you think about it, Batman is not really a superhero;he's just a man wearing a cape and a mask and who has a car named The Batmobile and a weird gun! BUT STILL THIS FILM, LIKE THE OTHER BATMAN WAS A LOT OF FUN AND HAD A TIM BURTON'S DARK ATMOSPHERE!!!
6304779356|4.0|First of all, this movies is GREAT for what it IS... It is directed to be a vampire flick with a teenage-comic twist... To cast a negative review on it by citing things such as &quot;bad acting by Fieldman and Haim&quot; is ridiculous... These two talented actors were simply playing a role... That's a key part of acting.<br />Secondly, the film deserves props because it is very entertaining, and the casting was excellent... Patric is good as always... and Sutherland is just unbelievable... No one will ever be as cool as Kiefer Sutherland was in the Mid-Eighties... He is just the man... <br />If you haven't seen the movie, and you think you might enjoy this kind of flick - give it a shot, it's worth it...<BR>To those looking to bash it - get a life, and consider what the film was intended to be before you go off on a tirade...<br />The Lost Boys Rocks
B00000IMCU|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is not just another zombie flick...it's a diagnostic on materialism that was growing up in the eighties (and that is always growing up!). The film sets in a world that is being invaded with zombies...They are everywhere, and the only way to destroy them is to shoot them in the head. Some humans even have fun killing the zombies and play stupid games involving money for the one who takes the less bullets to kill a zombie. Maybe you think it's stupid, but I'm sure a lot of people would do that in a near situation. Two guys from the SWAT team fly away with two lovers who worked for a TV station. They don't accept to live with zombies. So, the perfect place they find is a shopping mall. But the shopping mall is full of zombies too, and they'll have to get rid of them if they want to live in peace in the mall. It's weird, because, when I was young, I dreamed of becoming a movie director...I'm still dreaming about that, by the way...and I thought about the scenario of a horror movie where the heroes are prisonners of a shopping center...and I didn't know that Dawn of The Dead did it...So, when I watched it, it was like watching a movie I made...and you don't know how much fun I had watching this. We all dreamed one day of living in a mall, where we can take everything we want for free...Well, this film is the closest thing to our dream...The music is very good, it's made by The Goblins, an Italian band who worked a couple of times with Dario Argento...The special effects from Tom Savini are pretty amazing too, even though they are not as good as the ones in Day of The Dead. The acting is not fantastic but not bad at all, let's even say good. Dawn of the Dead is definitely one of the films that anyone would enjoy for sure...It's far away from being my favorite film, but it's one of my favorites for the pleasure aspect. You can't fall asleep in this film, and you don't want to. It is not terrifying at all, not funny in the way that you won't laugh, but you'll really enjoy it. One other thing, try to get the 156 minutes version, there's also the remastered version which lasts only 128 minutes and where the blood is pink, but where the colors and the sound are much better. I loved it...
B00005B36H|2.0|I must say, I'm baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews this album has received on this site.  Aenima is perhaps the best album I have ever heard, so I had high expectations for Lateralus...I bought it the day it was released, and was immediately disappointed.<br />I listened to it many times, forcing myself to give it a chance even though I had to constantly fight the urge to turn it off.  It never did grow on me.<br />Dull.  Boring.  Songs that stretch on mindlessly...just length for the sake of length.  What has happened to my favorite band?!?!  Aenima, Undertow, Opiate...all are far superior to Lateralus.<br />I just don't understand all the praise.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|Cast Away is good, that's true. I knew exactly what it would be all about even before seeing it. But I still had fun. And the plane crash is awesome...freaky to death. The moments spent on the island were purely great, but the rest suffered of the Spielberg-like pathetic ending. Tom Hanks played his usual role, but who cares? He plays it well. Maybe a change wouldn't be so bad...Anyways, his character was pretty intelligent and he reacted just like I would have reacted...except for the swear words...he didn't even say one F-word. And Zemeckis really convinced me that Tom Hanks' Volley ball was his friend...I even felt stupid after the movie because of that. The backgrounds made me feel like I was in paradise. And this film is an exception to his genre, and it's a very good thing; He was always alone on his island, there were no stupid cannibal tribes or anything. It's like Robinson Crusoe, but with its own advantages, and its own weak points. This is surely a good movie, and I'm sure it will get some Academy Award Nominations, because it's exactly the kind of films that will touch the heart of the judges and please to their &quot;Right to Censorship&quot; mind. Most of it was a good moment, but the other parts suffered of the pathetic syndrome. And, by the way, this is not a very touching movie, it won't make you cry or anything, but it's very agreeable to watch. And you can also interpret it as a critic to materialism. Good film.
0441003257|4.0|The book was a very good read...excellent subway material. I really hate to make the comparison between the book and Douglas Adams, as, aside from both being tongue-in-cheek, it's really like comparing apples and oranges...somewhat similiar, but completely different texture and taste. Mixing it together with Gaimen provides a book with the cheeky comments commonly experienced in Pratchett books with the odd characters common to Gaimen's tales...but - I must say - Pratchett retains the largest portion of flavor in the mix, in my opinion.<br />The main thesis of the book seems to be that through it all, it's the journey and the challenge that means something - the rest is just a label...and doesn't mean anything. It provides a nice context and reflections on western religon - providing an eastern take within the western framework...something more and more common. But it provides something different, and worth a read.
630024797X|5.0|Wim Wenders' most recent film was Buena Vista Social Club, which was more a documentary than a film, was very good...even though this one is totally different, I thought this one was even better. Harry Dean Stanton delivered a very good performance as a man who doesn't even know who he is, Dean Stockwell and Aurore Clment as a couple who want to keep Travis' son...but the one who impressed me the most in this film was Nastassja Kinski, who played a prostitute that still loves the man she left. She was amazing and beautiful. The mystery is kept for a long time, and that's only one of the things that keeps your attention on the film. The weird thing is that you wait a long time before seeing any evolution, and suddenly POW! it starts and by the time you realize it, the evolution is done...the last thirty minutes are awesome...you see the whole thing you were waiting for. Overall, I must say that it's a very good film...
B000050XEI|4.0|I bought this CD for 'Only Time' which is a beautiful song.  Then as I was watching CNN and a clip of the terrorist attack in NY, the background music was 'Fallen Embers' from this CD.  It's taken a new meaning for me...and I'll forever remember 9/11/01 when I listen to this CD.
B000059XVS|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia was surely one of the best films that exist and one of the best I've seen. It is pretty long, but you can't fall asleep watching this. It looks like Braveheart in many ways and it's even better. The acting of Peter O'Toole was unbelievable and the other actors did an excellent job too. The backgrounds looked good and there were so much good messages and influences in this film. It is considered as an important film in the history of movies...and it is!!! The whole thing is simply stunning, brilliant!!! I think everybody should spend a couple of hours of his life to watch it. If you liked Braveheart, The Ten Commandments, it is for you.<br />Most people who have a real interest in films have watched it, but if you want to introduce yourself to great cinema, maybe you should start with this...or with the AWESOME The Shining. Watch Lawrence of Arabia ...AWESOME FILM!
0812548094|5.0|Soul of Tears - Terry Goodkind (Review)<br />Wow.  I remember, after I had started getting into Wheel of Time (by Robert Jordan), but before I had started the Sword of Truth novels, I thought that the Sword of Truth series was a WoT ripoff.  I read the first book in the SoT series (Wizard's First Rule), and my opinon was significantly changed.  I thought it was a great book, with inventive and original concepts and ideas.  I found it strange, though, that all the plot developments and problems were wrapped up by the end of the book.  What more could the series be about?  Well, from just reading Stone of Tears, the second book, I know that there is much to advance on in the SoT series.   Here is a summary of what the series is about:<br />   It's about two characters, Richard Cypher and Kahlan Amnell, and their emotional struggles and hardships to be together.  That's all. But that, in itself, is alot.  <br />So, in that aspect, in might fit in the \\"romance\\" genre, since their love for each other is incredibly strong, and unbelievably realistic.  One, when reading any of the books in the series (save the first one, perhaps.  The two's love doesn't develop till the end of that book!) must frequently remind themselves that it is simply a book, and that Richard and Kahlan are not real.<br />   I shall delve further on what the SoT series is like.   It's fast-paced and more provocative and shameless than most other fantasy series/books.  Indeed, that is true.  There is sexuality in the series that borders on eroticism, although there, (as far as I've read, at least, which is only up to this book!) is no actual sexual content, something that, annoyingly and stereotypically, is anonamously forbidden in the fantasy genre.    The emotions of the characters are frighteningly realistic, and, because of that, the books are unusually intense.<BR>      Aside from the fact that the characters most certainly do not die \\"unexpectedly and brutally\\", the commentary describes SoT novels perfectly.  <br />    So what can I say about this book?  I was reading it constantly, it was so good, and nearly had me excluding all other activities save those I cannot skip.  When I say that this series is excellent, I'm not exaggerating.  Some prefer Robert Jordan over Goodkind, because they find that Goodking isn't very experienced as an author, and this is mildly true, but Terry actually writes with a somewhat casual style that some may be more comfortable with.  <br />   Hands-down, this is the most intense fantasy I've ever read.  (And I've read alot, Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Goodkind, Raymond E. Feist, David Eddings, etc.)   Alot of people like the SoT series more than WoT, and, although I can't really decide myself, I finalize my review by stating that Terry Goodkind is just as good as a writer as Robert Jordan is, if not better.  Despite being a somewhat inexperienced writer (at least when he first started out the series),  and having \\"Mary Sue\\"-ish kind of characters, Terry Goodkind proves in Stone of Tears that, without a doubt, he is one of the best fantasy writers around today.
B00005K9OX|5.0|Die Hard is one of my favorite action films. They made two sequels, but this one, the first one, is the best. Bruce Willis is an underestimated actor, even though he played in some pretty bad movies. Die Hard is THE perfect mix of INTENSE action, very funny jokes and one-liners and entertainment at its best. And there's even more; the acting is very good. This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen for sure, and it's the perfect one to watch when you don't want to think a lot and when your brain is tired and doesn't want to work. All I can say about this film is positive. It is long enough, there are no weak moments, and you're staying on the edge of your seat during the two big hours of fun that this film brings you. The story is conventional, but there are details that make this film more intelligent than the average action flick. And I was very surprised by how violent Die Hard was. It's pretty bloody and there are a lot of gun shots. Fun fun fun. I loved it.
B00003CWTI|1.0|It was with a shudder of apprehension that I picked up this movie after noticing that it was the same director who did &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. But my research revealed mostly positive ratings by reviewers. So I decided to spend the three hours and see what all the fuss was about.<br />&quot;Boogie&quot; was interesting and effective in some ways, but way overlong and downright obtuse in making its sociological points.<br />This movie has none of &quot;Boogie's&quot; good points and all of its bad points, plus some others. How about a hackneyed theme--could you select one &quot;better&quot; than dysfunctional families? Lack of communication? Manipulation in relationships, whether parent-child or lover to lover? These tired themes are handled so badly in dialogue and character portrayal that I found myself shaking my head in disbelief.<br />And what about feeling and passion in a film that would seem to be all about intensity? Even with stellar actors, you won't find it here. The roles played by Robards, Cruise and others are caricatures. The dialogue is lame almost beyond belief.<br />If you need to be reminded that parents, friends, and lovers should be more caring, kind, communicative, and attentive, I would suggest that almost any self-help book, Ann Landers column, or Hallmark card would be better than this heavy-handed<br />and overwrought movie.<br />If you want a positive look at some of the same types of problems, with fine performances and useful insights, try Lawrence Kasdan's &quot;Mumford&quot; or &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;. The closest this movie comes to a coherent message is when, after almost three hours, a young boy complains to his manipulative father, &quot;You need to be nicer to me&quot;.<br />This director needs to be nicer to his audiences, and some editor or artistic advisor needs to rein him in, suggest that sublety and sensitivity are a better mix than smarminess and special effects.
B000050XEI|5.0|I just got this today on my 16th birthday and I love it. I first heard Enya's voice on the commercials for Sweet November and loved it. I didn't hear about her until the Mtv awards when she preformed Only Time. It was so soothing. I love her music, voice, style, and talent. I am a little bias and like Only Time the most, but all the other songs come to a close shared 2nd place.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is an insightful moving tale of the emergence of genetic perfection within society and how it impacts its members.  The obvious story, which is compelling enough, is the struggle of Vincent to succeed against the odds of being a &quot;God-child&quot; and not being engineered.  The love interest is also good but Uma Thurman comes off a little flat.  Maybe that's intended, but I didn't care for that portrayal.  The sub-plot, however, is very subtle until the end and in my opinion is one of the best parts of the movie.  Vincent uses another man's genetic traces to qualify in society.  This is no spoiler as this is eastablished early.  What is interesting to watch is the character of Jerome (played outstandingly by Jude Law).  I won't mention it here but if you chose to observe Jerome closely you will find an interesting counterpoint to the &quot;perfect society&quot; as displayed by Jerome's issues surrounding his, what most of us would call, success.  The movie elegantly has this as a background point. While the viewer is busy sympathizing with Vincent and hoping the best for Vincent and Irene, you tend to miss some of the best contextual commentary from Jerome.  The symbolism in the movie is also very-well done.  Notice the stair-case and the fact that Jerome is now at the bottom and that only after collecting Jerome's materials can Vincent then climb the genetic ladder of social acceptance.  I have seen this movie many times and I can say there are no fluff scenes, no filler.  Every scene has something important to convey regarding the society that has sprung from the widespread use of genetic engineering.  In my opinion, this film is no less than outstanding.  A great (and first, I might add) effort from Andrew Niccol, a former cologne ad director.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane, in my opinion and in the eyes of just about every legitamite film critic in America is one of, if not, THE greatest movie of all time. After viewing it I was so blown away I had to sit down for awhile and collect my thoughts. At no point in the movie is it boring unless you are one of those ignorant fools who thinks all black and white films are boring. Albeit, there isn't much action in Citizen Kane, but the characters make up for it ten fold with their realism. The ending of Citizen Kane is definatly one of the biggest surprizes in the history of filmmaking and makes watching the movie worthwhile. The plot was so important that forms of it are being used in big name Hollywood movies to this day. The film was extremely naive in its undertaking as it writes a biography of one of the richest and most influential people in American history ever and showed how imperfect the life of a supposedly \\"perfect\\" person is. This movie truly plays out like a dream. Don't listen to (people) who tell you elsewise.

0380715430|4.0|To me, The Mother Tongue (English &amp; How it Got that Way), rates 4 stars simply because it is a very quick and funny read.  Bill Bryson is better-known as a travel writer than a linguist because, logically enough, he is not a professional linguist.  As many others in this forum have attested, you should not take this book as an example of up-to-date scholarship on the subject of the evolution of English or any other language.  And I don't think Bryson intended it to be taken that way.  If Bryson is a bit of an overenthusiastic fan of English and language in general, that does not mean that you cannot profit from this work and I think you would have to be a rather narrow-minded purist to find it unenjoyable.<br />The book is less of a history of English than a hodge-podge of interesting and sometimes funny facts and anecdotes about various elements of English and wordplay in it.  He addresses the prevalence of English around the world and how it is changed by each culture to address their own needs, some theories on how language began, the infinite and provincial varieties of the pronunciation of English and some other languages, the institution of standardized spelling, the differences between American and King's English, the history of cataloguing words, swearing, and word-games.<br />He misses some good anecdotes along the way, such as President Andrew Jackson's line &quot;What kind of moron can think of only one way to spell a word.&quot; (more or less) and, contra Bryson, I think the closest America has come to the clerihew is the double dactyl invented by John Hollander and Anthony Hecht, as in:<br />&quot;Higgeldy-piggeldy,<BR>Benjamin Harrison,<BR>Twenty-third president,<BR>Was, and, as such,<br />Served between Clevelands, and<BR>Save for this trivial<BR>Idiosyncracy,<BR>Didn't do much.&quot;<br />But on the whole, I learned quite a bit, like that the court language in London was a provincial French, which had many differences from the Parisian French which modern French descends from.  Logical though it seems upon reflection, I had never noticed that Chinese, having a non-phonetic alphabet, has no simple way to order their dictionaries.  This also means that they don't have the pleasure of crossword puzzles although they have word games we could never replicate in English.  I had never considered that there was any possibility to try and intelligently guess at how languages were pronounced before audio recordings.  Bryson tells us how the professionals go about making those guesses -- and it doesn't seem as unreasonable as I had previously thought.<br />On the other hand, there are some factual errors you should be aware of.  These include the lack of thesauri in other languages (I believe they were invented in English and writers in other languages don't make much use of them, but all the same), the myth that the Eskimos have 50 words for snow, that Finnish has no swear words, and you might take a look at the other reviews in this forum to check for other errors that Bryson makes or repeats.  I would add that although Bryson points out that languages without phonetic alphabets have no ways of ordering dictionaries, he includes Japanese as such a language, although he later notes that Japanese has an ancient phonetic alphabet, kanji.  Well, this leaves you wondering whether they had alphabetic dictionaries or thesauri earlier and, if not, when and why, exactly, were they introduced?<br />These shortcomings notwithstanding, The Mother Tongue is a very fun book and I believe non-specialists would profit handsomely from giving it a read -- I certainly feel as if I have.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic is one of the most engaging movies that I have seen in a long time.  Set in present day America and Mexico it addresses some of the current problems society is having with drug cartels.  Focusing on five sets of characters whose paths are intertwined together the movie weaves an incredible story of honor, naivety, courage, deceit and tragedy.  I was incredibly surprised and happy to find that USA pictures is responsible for such a fine piece of cinematic material.
B000002LMK|4.0|One night many years ago, I saw Kris Kristopherson, Lou Reed, and Neil Young perform within the span of a single week. I had an epiphany, towards the end of Reed's show, while watching him gamely try to make it through &quot;Heroin&quot; for what I calculated must have been his 10,000th public performance of the song. Like Kristopherson, on &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot; (also public performance number 10,000), he was trying to do something with the song to fight off the ennui and boredom, but just didn't have the chops to quite pull it off.<br />A few days later I saw Young. Roughly the same age as the other two, he came off as a complete natural. It was like bounding around the stage like he was 17. He confounded his band by launching into an extended feedback drenched solo mid-way through &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; (quick check, public performance 10,000), who all looked at each other with these &quot;what is going on here?&quot; expressions and on their faces and tried to keep up while Neil jerked around the stage like an epileptic on speed. I turned to a friend and said &quot;he's going to be doing this when he's 70.&quot;<br />&quot;Ragged Glory&quot; from 1990 is one of Young's stronger outings of the last 15 years or so. As one of the other reviewers noted, the songs are pretty simple frameworks through which Young and Crazy Horse bash away with reckless abandon. He's go that same technically-limited-but-hear-me-wail solo style that he's had since &quot;Everyone Knows This is Nowhere,&quot; but he's got better equipment and a fuller sound. Personal favorite is &quot;Love and Only Love,&quot; (too bad you can't hear the excerpt of that one) but there are a bunch of good'uns on this one. Definitely a guitar player's record.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator has been hailed as a modern version of Spartacus.  I agree with that but it is so much more.  We have the honor to follow the life of Maximus as he directs soldiers in country conquerings to his unjust imprisonment and his role as a gladiator in Rome.  This movie is great for couples to see together.  It is not just a movie fit for guys who love blood and guts but instead it is also very poetic and moving.  I believe in some respects women would like this movie just as much if not more than guys would.
B000001GPX|5.0|What follows is a description of Carlos Kleiber's stress on rhythm in Beethoven's 7th symphony, and how he so successfully attains it.<br />Beethoven has always been said to highlight his personal preference of his Op. 92, in A Major Symphony over a group he thought of as his best compositions. (A feeling Kleiber probably shares). Wagner's famous comment on the 7th as being the &quot;Apotheosis of dance&quot;, means nothing if taken to the letter; but as a poet's symbol it proves , to the best of my judgment, admirably accurate and deep. In effect, the 7th exclusively sets rhythm into action; very simple rhythms, very attractive rhythms, which, in due time engender a number of themes, which are bound together by this rhytmical community. <br />After the long introduction, Poco sostenuto, a jumping rhythm is gradually taking the upper hand; opens up the first tempo (6/8 Vivace), in which rhythm features an undisputed leading role among the orchestra instruments, under every musical form, under every imaginable aspect. So much so, that it proves hard distinctly to tease apart a first and a second theme -as the rest of his symphonies clearly deploy: one might even be tempted to say it makes no matter, one or dozens of motifs are dealt with, all of which join in the tireless gallop. <br />The second movement, Allegretto, in A minor features the succession, repeated ad infinitum of one crotchet, 2 quavers, 2 crotchets, wherefrom the most beautiful melodies spring, keeping the initial rhythm imperturbably throughout. <br />It is hard to think of another work that subordinates every other musical element so forcibly to rhythm as the Seventh Symphony. For example, almost all of the main third movements material, Scherzo (Presto, in F Major) is linked by a single rhythmic unit in which the weak beats blur before the supremacy of the strong beats, before the finale (Allegro con brio) takes the symphonys overwhelming rhythmic impulse to a dizzying bacchanalian culmination. All this masterfully interpreted by Carlos Kleiber.
630438551X|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it in the theatres. I think that many of the reviewers are forgetting that in some instances the director is having a sense of humor in the film <BR>as well. THIS IS A PARODY OF A TRAGEDY. Everyone knows what happens. The director is trying to give a new edge to this old classic. Maybe even to offend those die hard Shakespeare fans. However, I am not offended. I am able to see the humor. I believe that this film is brilliant for its time and what it has to live up to. If you didn't like it the first time, watch it again, then you may see what I mean.
B00004XQJX|5.0|Pollini's greatest achievement in this recording is to let Beethoven flow in all its complexity to show us how deeply he has studied this masterpiece and how it was concocted: In 1819, the Viennese music publisher Anton Diabelli circulated a waltz of his own invention to 50 composers, each of whom was requested to contribute a variation to the collective project. Beethoven at first disdained the theme as a &quot;cobbler's patch&quot; on account of its mechanical sequences, and then overreacted to Diabelli's invitation, conceiving not one, but 23 variations, 10 fewer than the final number. Recent study of Beethoven's musical manuscripts from 1819 has cast a revealing light on the structure and import of this great work, his longest and one of his most cognitively and emotionally demanding pieces for piano. After having set the composition aside for several years, Beethoven expanded his draft from within in 1823, adding variations 1-2, 15, 23-26, 28-29, and 31 to the pre-established order, while greatly elaborating on the conclusion. <br />No other work by Beethoven is so rich in allusion, humour, and parody. Trivial or repetitious features of the waltz, such as the C major chords repeated ten-fold in the right hand in the opening bars, can be mercilessly exaggerated, as in variation 21, or dissolved into silence, as in variation 13. Inconspicuous elements of the theme, such as the ornamental turn heard at the outset, can assume astonishing importance, as in variations 9 and 11, which are based throughout on the turn. Several variations allude to Mozart, Bach, and other composers. The most obvious of these is the reference, in the unison octaves of variation 22, to &quot;Notte e giorno faticar&quot; from the beginning of Mozart's Don Giovanni. This allusion is brilliant not only through the musical affinity of the themes -which share, e.g., the same descending fourth and fifth- but through the reference to Mozart's Leporello. Beethoven's relationship to his theme, like Leporello's relationship to his master, is critical but faithful. And like Leporello, the variations after this point gain the capacity for disguise. Variation 23 is an étude-like parody of pianistic virtuosity alluding to the Pianoforte-Method by J.B.Cramer, whereas variation 24, the Fughetta, shows an affinity in its intensely sublimated atmosphere to some organ pieces from the third part of the Clavierübung by Bach. <br />The work as a whole consists of one large form with three distinct regions. The opening variations remain close to basic parameters of the theme (such as its metre) and show gradually increasing freeedom, which at last turns into dissociation in the contrasting canonic variations Nos. 19 and 20, and in No. 21, in which the structural parts of each variation half are themselves placed into opposition. In performance time, these variations represent the midpoint. A sense of larger formal coherence is created through unusually direct reference to the melodic shape of the original waltz in three variations inserted in 1823 -Nos. 1, 15, and 25. In No. 25 the waltz is reincarnated as a humorous German dance, but this image is gradually obliterated in the interconnected series of fast variations culminating in No. 28, in which harsh dissonances dominate every strong beat throughout. <br />After Variation 28, we enter a transfigured realm, in which Diabelli's waltz, and the world it represents, seem to be left behind. A group of three slow variations in the minor culminates in Variation 31, an elaborate aria reminiscent of the decorated minor variation of Bach's Goldberg set, while also foreshadowing the style of Chopin. The energetic fugue on E flat that follows is initially Handelian in character; its second part builds to a tremendous climax with three subjects combined simultaneously before the fugue dissipates into a powerful dissonant chord. An impressive transition leads to C major, and to the final and most subtle variation of all: a Mozartian minuet whose working-through through rhythmic means leads, in the coda, to an ethereal texture, strongly reminiscent of the famous Arietta movement of Beethoven's own last sonata, Op 111, composed in 1822. Herein lies the final surprise: the Arietta movement, itself influenced by the Diabelli project, became in turn Beethoven's model for the last of the Diabelli Variations. The end of the series of allusions thus became a self-reference and final point of orientation within an artwork whose vast scope ranges from the ironic caricature to sublime transformation of the commonplace waltz.
6305265488|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and loved it.  I liked Drew Barrymore before, but I adore her now. (and after &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;)  She truly performs with her heart.  I liked flick because it didn't have all of the hocus pocus stuff.  &quot;Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo.&quot;  This would be a story that could have happened.  There is still parts that are quite humerous, not all serious lovee-dovee stuff.  I just really enjoy watching this movie over and over again!
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks is a very entertaining film from writer-director Kevin Smith(Mallrats,Chasing Amy).It was originally made for around $27,000 if I'm not mistaken,and(in the tradition of El Mariachi and other very low budget films)it outshines numerous other movies made for many,many times more money.<br />The plot is very simple.It's one crazy day in the life of convenience store clerk Dante Hicks(Brian O'Halloran),and all the interesting characters he has to deal with.The film costars Jeff Anderson as Dante's best friend Randal,who works(allegedly anyway) in the video store next door and loves to torment the customers.Marilyn Ghigliotti plays Dante's girlfriend Veronica,and Lisa Spoonhauer plays Dante's ex Caitlin Bree(who has somewhat of a breakdown towards the end of the film,but I won't say why here!).Numerous other wacky characters find their way in and out of the store during the course of the day as well.<BR>The movie also introduces the world to the characters of Jay and Silent Bob,played by Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith.<br />The DVD is great-sound and picture aren't exactly fantastic(but hey it's a very low budget film)-but the special features are very cool,including deleted scenes,alternate ending,and an interesting commentary by Kevin Smith and other members of the cast and crew(including Jason Mewes,who was obviously very intoxicated at the time!).<br />Overall a very entertaining film,although because of some of the subject matter and foul language younger viewers shouldn't watch.
B00005LKIM|1.0|i think that they relied too much on shock value(but did it have allot!) and wasted a truely tallented cast in what is whithout a doubt one of the sorriest excuses of a film i have ever seen. when i saw this in the theatre, i spent more time looking at the innocent filmgoers facial expressions of digust than watching the movie so i rented it just cause my friends wanted to see it. needless to say the movie was a laugh riot(especialy in the end on the plane...hoo hoo ha!!!). This movie just ads to the list of movies lacking any inner depth but allot of gore.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is the DVD set that Kane (and most great films) deserve -- an excellent quality print with a very clear recording of its soundtrack. The DVD comes with about 30 index points, so it is very easy to find a particular scene.<br />If you haven't seen it, don't let the fact that Kane is considered to be a \\"Great Film\\" put you off.  Sure it is famous for all its innovations and clever techniques, but it really is a tremendous amount of fun to watch on its own.  The DVD lets you see a great print of the film, and its extra features (below) let you understand the interesting history behind the film and also some of the technical things that help to make it a \\"Great Film.\\"<br />For me, the best extra feature of the DVD is a newly recorded running commentary by Roger Ebert who plainly loves Kane and really talks us through its many neat visual and sound effects.  Ebert gives us a lot of \\"Now watch this...\\" that really add to the enjoyment of the film.  There is also a second commentary by the director Peter Bogdanovich who was a good friend of Welles that gives of some sense of what Welles may have been thinking when he made different parts of the film.  Both sets of commentaries have the nice feature that you can hear the original movie underneath them so you know what the commentators are referring to.<br />In addition to the a disk of the film itself, this set has a second DVD that is a really good 2-hour 1996 documentary (seen on PBS) called \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane.\\"  The documentary presents the lives of Welles and newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst whose life is the thinly disguised subject for the film.  Both men led interesting lives, filled with ego and extragence.  The battle kept Kane from being shown widely and basically ruined the film career of Welles who became the \\"youngest has been who ever was\\" after Kane premiered (he was 26! or so).  There is lots of interesting file footage of Hearst and Welles, and interviews with those who knew them or have written about them.  For me, one of the engaging moments of the documentary come in an interview with the old Welles saying that he basically wasted his life after Kane -- he should have left films rather than spending 98 percent of his time hustling (his word) to try to get money for his film projects, many of which flopped.<br />This is a great set to have and is a definite buy.  Finally, at [this price], it is a real deal, especially given that the set contains the documentary as a second disk.them or have written about them.

6304493681|4.0|Fantastic cyberpunk anime. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I read the manga, which is much more complex. But for approximately 90 minutes, this is a wonderful movie.
B000003TAW|5.0|The long and short of it is that this is one of the greatest albums of all time.  The songwriting is excellent, the performance is breathtaking, and the songs are just catchy...every single one of them.  From My Name is Jonas to Buddy Holly to Say It Ain't So to Only In Dreams, Weezer rocks. Just go buy it now, ok...you won't be disappointed...
B000002LCI|4.0|Sure, the name of Depeche Mode was known before this album came out in 1987, but had been known for intermittently quirky numbers like &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Shake the Disease&quot;.  When this album was released, however, the boys of DM were discovered as craftmen of the much more elusive title of ALBUM ARTISTS.<BR>This album is very coherent throughout,and the songs all distinctively tie-in well with each other in thought and sound.  The album has an eastern, almost Oriental type sound motif weaved throughout it (most noted in the track &quot;Sacred&quot;), and the segue-ways which occur between songs are well thought out.  <BR>Standout works which still get huge responses in their stadium shows include the album opener, &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot;.  For the recent EXCITER tour, this was the closer encore song.  That in itself speaks volumes.  To know the band is using a song from 1987 to close its shows, and to know people still ache to hear this song from 14 years ago lets you know this band is known for longtime fans and staying power.  Still a perennial favorite is the huge hit, &quot;Strangelove&quot;, with its twisted chorus:  &quot;Pain/Will you return it?/I'll say it again/Pain&quot;.  Never has dysfunction and co-dependency ever sounded this good.  Songwriter Martin Gore lets his voice be heard on the very moving &quot;Things You Said&quot; and &quot;I Want You Now&quot;.  Gifted with a tremendously sweet voice, his sound provides a deep contrast to usual lead singer, Dave Gahan.  Dave's best outting on this album is the wildly suggestive and amazingly layered &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot;.  Filled with marvelous double-entendres, the song is snazzily delivered to perfection by an almost sneering Dave.  Cleverly, the song IS and ISN'T about driving a car!  HA!  The British boys of dance-pop were sneaky about this one.  <BR>All in all, you won't be disappointed with the album.  I would suggest to not listen to the remixes...getthe singles instead.
B000000WZ4|4.0|The boys have become men, but there is still classic Mode at work here.  Depravity, obsession, and darkness still reign supreme, and their sound is lush with loops, synths, and great beats.  There is little else to say here, other than if you know DM's sound, this is still it, just with facial hair and a deeper voice.  <BR>&quot;Sister of Night&quot; exemplifies this maturity, and the bankable hit, &quot;It's No Good&quot; still show they haven't lost their ability to make great songs in spite of Alan Wilder's departure from the band. &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; starts the album with a whomping punch and echoes back to the days of SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION.  &quot;Home&quot; has got to be the best vocal performance Martin Gore has ever done in his entire career.  Dave Gahan sounds clearer and better in his new &quot;clean&quot; state, and the album is not a disappointer.  Add this to your collection.  It ranks up there with the best of their catalog.
0800116917|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid and hated it. This July in the $%&amp;$#! desert at 115 degrees outside, I watched it three times in one week. My husband thought I was nuts. There are no women in this movie, save a few chador-clothed wives/concubines and there might have been one dancer. Despite that, I think it's terrific. I have decided I am entirely in love with Omar Sharif. I wanted to crawl into his tent and never leave. My husband really likes the motorcycle scene at the beginning. The movie is endlessly fascinating, full of hand-to-hand combat, water struggles, Anthony Quinn, and Alec Guiness as smooth Prince Faisal. I saw the restored footage VHS edition from our city library and want to buy it. It is fully about men living as men.  I have to pity the Turks, though.  They are so demonized and that prison scene is gruesome. Another reviewer caught that one as well.
B000002MJC|4.0|What a departure!  From their breakthrough hit, &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot;, the DM boys were known for cute, catchy synth riffs.  This couldn't be more of a juxtaposition if you tried to think of another one.  Some would call it rock, others would say grunge, others would use gothic as their descriptor, and some would dismiss it as &quot;Depeche Mode discovered guitars and stopped banging on trees.&quot;  Whatever.  This is unlike any other DM album you've ever heard.  People either love this album, or wish they'd never bought it.<BR>Sonically, yes, the sound is heavier, and yes, there is much more guitar involved.  There are heavier drum beats and moodier basslines, too.  However, aside from that, the dark lyrics are still in play, and the usual themes songwriter Martin Gore loves to mention (redemption, obsession, depravity, and more depravity) are still there, just darker (if you can imagine DARKER).  The regular DM fan will appreciate this familiarity, however, the heaviness of the music itself may be initially off-putting.<BR>My first impression of the album when I heard it upon its release back in 1993 was, &quot;What on earth is this?&quot;  Honestly, this in not an album most people can get into upon the first couple of listenings.  This one takes time to get into your brain and make you realize it is good. Also, the album seems to be all over the place--gospel (&quot;Condemnation&quot;), bagpipes (&quot;Judas&quot;), and bluesy rock (&quot;I Feel You&quot;).   <BR>Some of my all-time favorite DM songs spawned from this album, and I know I'm not alone when I say &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot;, &quot;I Feel You&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot; are great songs.  For me, however, the album highlight is &quot;In Your Room&quot;.  Regular DM fans know there is usually one track on every DM album which is completely wicked, twisted, wanton, and full of desire.  &quot;In Your Room&quot; is THAT song.  The version which appears here is much darker (is that possible?) and moodier than the version known to owners of the greatest hits collection (1986-1997--the double album collection). Listen to it and compare. The lyrics, which plead to be slave to an unspoken master, are powerful in their helplessness:  &quot;I'm hanging on your words/ Living on your breath/ Feeling with your skin/ Will I always be here?&quot;<BR>In a relatively lighter mood, the album ends with &quot;One Caress&quot; and &quot;Higher Love&quot;, both lush in sound and atmosphere.  They help bring closure to the wild wreck the album puts you through, then ease you into the light.  <BR>If you are a casual fan, this recording may not be for you as you know DM as something else.  If you have an open mind and are ready for something very different, however, give this one a try--you may just like it!
0380973650|4.0|First: Neil Gaiman on his worst day is still a good ten times better than almost every other writer I've ever encountered.  This book was riveting and a delight to read.  Gaiman is the type of wordsmith you're willing to follow even before you've quite figured out where he's going.<br />That said, there was a niggling dissatisfaction for me in this book.  One of the things I've always admired most about his novels, both graphic and print, is the way that every detail, no matter how seemingly arbitrary, always winds up being not only relevant to the ultimate conclusion but absolutely integral.  To watch the way everything just falls exactly into place is to witness a genius in action, and makes his work intensely enjoyable.  I missed that here, that attention -- there *are* details that are dropped, elements that are rushed, characters who are just the slightest bit unessential.  It's a good book, a beautifully written and imaginatively plotted read, but I'm *spoiled* by Gaiman's gifts -- I'm not seeing that greatness.<br />Despite the title and despite what the plot is obviously trying to do, this is still a very English novel -- which is not a bad thing at all, unless you're overtly trying to write one about the *American* character/spirit.  It's a quality to the novel that's hard to put your finger on. Maybe the way subtle Briticisms creep in, like supposed Midwesterners going &quot;I'll stop a minute,&quot; instead of &quot;I'll stay a minute&quot; or &quot;I'll stick around.&quot; A slight &quot;stiff-upper-lip,&quot; reserved quality to the main character, Shadow -- which might keep some readers from fully engaging with him.  Or, how certain characters speak in a way that doesn't quite match the background they're assigned.<br />There's something that never quite gels -- America is a place where people who left a world behind came (and come) together and (over generations) turned (and turn) into an entirely new thing (and not always a pretty thing, but this is not the place to debate whether that new thing is good or bad).  AMERICAN GODS seems to capture the spirit of journey without ever arriving at or analyzing the end result. While the &quot;Coming to America&quot; segments were all beautifully and powerfully written, the effect is still one of stranger-in-a-strange-land, an aspect of Americanness, true, but only one aspect. Gaiman sets out to illuminate &quot;the soul of America&quot; -- but only non-Americans would think that he's succeeded here, or would find familiarity.  Perhaps the subject was simply too large for a single novel. (Although I'll say Julian Barnes did a phenomenal job fitting a similar theme into one book -- though a different genre -- in the allegory &quot;ENGLAND, ENGLAND.&quot;)<br />It's an esoteric point. It would be fun to explore further but I'm running out of space.  And I feel a little guilty even picking these nits!  He's GAIMAN after all -- he can do no wrong... it's only that when he's a little bit less right than usual, you really notice.  Four stars for loyalty...not the place to debate whether that new thing is good or bad).  AMERICAN GODS seems to capture the spirit of journey without ever arriving at or analyzing the end result.

B000002LK1|5.0|I couldn't think of more appropriate words for the album known as VIOLATOR.  To no surprise whatsoever, when SPIN magazine rated the 90 most influential albums of the 1990s, this album was number 2 on the list (beaten only by Nirvana's NEVERMIND album).  To realize a band like DM, who is normally categorized as being techno or pop or dance, had an album ranked that high on the scale, you have to realize they aren't your average songsters.  VIOLATOR sealed that reputation.<BR>Sure, there were the huge hits which sold a gazillion singles.  The twangy, stompable &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is still played at high school dances, and &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; still expresses everything a sad, potent love song should.  &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; and &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; made lots of money for the boys, too.  Beyond these singles, however, are five other great songs which are still up there with the best DM has ever done.  <BR>The song of perfection, sonically speaking, is &quot;Halo&quot;.  It has a driving beat, an anthem-quality chorus, and a melodic bassline to keep you going.  Why this song was not chosen as a single is beyond me.  I suppose, as they already had four singles, they didn't need another one.<BR>&quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; is hypnotic and soothing--a nice breather in between &quot;Jesus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot;.  The outro wails of Martin Gore are mesmerizing.  I can feel myself transported to some ethereal plane as his voice wafts higher and stronger.<BR>Once again, being full of suggestion and depravity, fetishism becomes the Mode in &quot;Blue Dress&quot;.  Any knowledgable DM fan knows they love to mention lovely little peccadilloes...for the album, this one is the sexy song.<BR>In a wild turn, &quot;Clean&quot; is Dave's addiction through Martin's words.  The lyrics are confessional, as is much of the album, and neatly closes the ablum.  Along the same dark tone is &quot;The Sweetest Perfection&quot; which sounds almost unfinished, yet great in its stark state.  <BR>If you have always wanted to get into DM, but didn't know where to start in their huge catalog, START HERE!  YOU WON'T BE SORRY!  This album may be 11 years old now, but it is still a landmark achievement.
B00000BKDV|5.0|Iron Maiden Do it again with their Breakthrough Album &quot;Peice of Mind&quot;. Songs like &quot;Revelations&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; and &quot;To Tame a Land&quot; are instant Maiden Classics! This could be one of the best metal albums of the 80's!<br />Its a must-have metal album! Buy or Die!
B000002L9M|3.0|Depeche Mode emblazoned the &quot;Space Age&quot; comment on their album, yet I don't think anyone understood what they meant by it.  I take it as a reference to the industrial and futuristic music they were making...industrial by means of using sounds such as car engines, fireworks, and just the simple banging on things, to make their synth music, as versus more traditionally accepted instrumentation.<BR>The album, to our current ears, sounds a little dated, but classic works are throughout.  &quot;Stripped&quot; is particularly good, as well as the cult classic &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot;.  The pair of &quot;question&quot; songs--&quot;A Question of Time&quot; and &quot;A Question of Lust&quot;--are both on this album, and provide sharp contrasts between each other.  &quot;Time&quot; is a dancey, bouncy, relentless study in pop, while &quot;Lust&quot; is dreamy and somewhat remniscent of the early work of the Thompson Twins.<BR>According the songwriter Martin Gore, most DM fans cite this album as their favorite.  I would perhaps disagree with that (my vote would go to VIOLATOR), but nonetheless, the album was a moderately well received recording for its time.  This was the album which really began to open up the American audience to the music of DM, and paved the way for the more popular follow-up, MUSIC FOR THE MASSES.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|In Maidens Experimental years 1986-1988 two albums were released. &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; which was an instant Maiden masterpeice with synthesizers, progressivness and melodies! and &quot;Seventh son of a Seventh Son&quot;, the concept album that showed Maidens Finest hour! The songs are just exceptional in this album with many key-elements that make this album one of Maidens best! The melodies are great, the riffs are awesome and the keyboards give a great backbone for the music!<BR>In conclusion 7th son of a 7th son is truly Maidens 7th Masterpeice!
B00004U45G|5.0|Who would believe that this CD was recorded in 1999? Who would guess that in this age of teen pop, rap-metal and lame alternative rock that excellent vintage style rock and roll like this was still being made. Leave it to the Black Crowes, one of the finest &quot;real&quot; rock and roll bands around. <br />Fans of Led Zeppelin should definitely check this out, and fans of the Crowes as well. The Zep tunes sounds so much like the originals that I occasionally forgot that I wasn't listening to Zeppelin. Chris Robinson fills in wonderfully for Robert Plant, Rich Robinson and Audley Freed back up Page exquisitely.<br />This is a great CD for those who are growing weary of today's &quot;rock&quot; scene and dying for a blast from the past.
6305013578|3.0|Yes, the transfer ..., but since the Criterion Collection seems not to want to bother, it's probably the best we've got.  The bad reviews are exaggerating; I've seen worse transfers, both of this film and in general.<br />Also, this DVD has a longer cut than most, and anything's better than the butchering Moroder gave it in the 80s.  Definitely not a respectful version of this film, but at ... bucks, you know what you're getting into.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is not a review of the movie &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  I would not be so presumptuous to review or analyze a film about which volumes have been written and about which almost 250 viewers have already expressed their opinions on these pages.  Included with the DVD edition is a PBS documentary prepared about 4 years ago &quot;The Battle over Citizen Kane.&quot;  It is on Disc 2.  It is only one on many documentaries that have been prepared about this film, but it, like many PBS documentaries, was very well done.  Unlike some other documentaries about Citizen Kane, it concentrates more on the two main protagonists - William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.  It provides excellent biographies on both of these men, then discusses the battle to make this movie and the battle to prevent this movie from ever being seen.  There is very little information about the technical aspects of the movie -- the camera angles, sets, editing and sound.  It focuses on two of the biggest egos in the late 19th century and early 20th century America, thereby providing the viewer with a very compelling and thorough understanding of the controversy surrounding this movie. The documentary suggests what &quot;rosebud&quot; means (there have been mnany interpretations) and argues that Citizen Kane is as much an autobiography of Orson Welles as it ostensibly is a biography of Hearst.<br />If you have not seen this movie, or if you have already seen this film, or are seeing it again for the first time on DVD, or if, as some reviewers have opined, believe there was no plot to this movie or fell asleep while watching it (UNBELIEVABLE!!!), I strongly recommend that you watch the documentary first. This will provide you with a much better appreciation for Citizen Kane and also make the viewing much more enjoyable.
B000059MEK|5.0|I like all types of music so I wasn't afraid to venture into the field of techno with &quot;Discovery&quot;. I wasn't disappointed. The first song that drew me to Daft Punk is the Stardust song &quot;The Music Sounds Better With You&quot;. And then I saw an extended anime video on Cartoon Network containing the first 4 &quot;Discovery&quot; tracks. I mean, I loved &quot;One More Time&quot;, but those videos made me wanna run out and get the album. I never heard or owned &quot;Homework&quot;, so I can't make value judgements. Maybe that's a good thing, cuz this album made a fan outta me. Of course it's a throw-back to the 80's (&quot;Short Circuit&quot;) and the 70's (&quot;High Life&quot;) [two annoying tracks that are still pretty good], but you have to admit that this album is so varied, that you can't a slap a category on it if you tried. It may be cheesy, but it's infectious. You have your dance numbers and even some slow ones (&quot;Nightvision&quot; is short, but trancy.  I wish they would've extended it and added a beat to it). My top 5 are &quot;One More Time&quot; (the horns and Romanthony's &quot;ah!&quot; got me), &quot;H.B.F.S.&quot; (this is a funky, robotic number), &quot;Crescendolls&quot; (a party number with the clich&eacute;d &quot;Hey!&quot;), &quot;Superheroes&quot; (a valiant comic book-esque number where they could've restrained overusing the sample!), and &quot;Voyager&quot; (My favorite track. It's dark, yet dancy.  I still think it could've used a bridge.).  An honarable mention to &quot;Something About You&quot; (the song that Jamiroquai never made) and &quot;Face To Face&quot; (the song that the 80's wished they could call their own).  The only complaints I have is the repetitiveness, the fact that &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Digital Love&quot; evoke pointless commercials in my head (Think &quot;Victoria's Secret&quot; &amp; &quot;The Gap&quot;!), and the last track &quot;Too Long&quot; is, well... TOO LONG! It should've been 4:30 rather than 10:00. That would've been perfect because it still is a rather catchy song. Oh, yah, and that vocal sample in &quot;High Life&quot;.  They could've did without that.  WAIT, I'm not done complaining... &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; could've been shorter and used more instruments.  Okay, I'm done.  All in all, you'll either like or loathe these guys.  They may be weird, but they keep it fresh (for a couple of French guys).than 10:00. That would've been perfect because it still is a rather catchy song. Oh, yah, and that vocal sample in &quot;High Life&quot;.  They could've did without that.

B00003CXA6|5.0|I have read many of the reviews about this movie on this site, and most people are not very bright obviously. They dont understand that, this is a hollywood movie and not a documentary, and expect it to be exactly true and they dont understand that things need to be changed to make it more entertaining, that is done with most movies like glory, patriot,peral harbor, and many more. If they made it with nothing but complete historical accuracy's it would not be as entertaining, and these people need to do what they can to make it entertaining or they dont money and noone watches it.I watched this movie as what it is.. a form of entertainment and not a historical documentary, and I loved it. I have studied much on the actual battle and and have a large collection of documentary's I would love to share the titles names with whoever asks, but remeber always this is for entertainment. Next time you see one of these period pieces remeber that and dont go looking for historical inaccuracy's. It ruins the point of the film, have fun!!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|&quot;Without a mirror, we all forget who we are,&quot; says Guy Pearce's character in &quot;Memento,&quot; a fantastic movie, with the lead as a superb actor whose facial expressions, mannerisms, and desire to find his wife's &quot;killer&quot; is so passionate that you feel sorry for him. The plot is so simple, it is complicated. Told backwards, in little &quot;acts&quot;, you have got to pay attention to this movie.  And be intent in your attention; no interruptions, as I had to rewind the DVD at least 5 times to catch up what was being said, or who was doing what.  Each detail of the movie is important. The story unfolds--remember, the movie moves backwards--as Guy's character is looking for the man who he thinks has raped and killed his wife.  The only problem with Guy's existence is that he has a &quot;condition&quot;...he doesn't process or remember short term memory.  He remembers details by taking Polariods. Couple this with the fact that there are some dubious characters taking advantage of him so that he can carry out their dirty work and you've got a beautifully shot, cleverly acted story.  I highly recommend it, as it truly one of the best movies I've seen.
0553277472|4.0|This book taught me to &quot;pay attention when life goes awry.&quot; In some ways, this is a mysterious book because it is not so much fiction as it is the author's life. Not your average sort of book - it's wise, honest and solid. I also highly recommend &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold.  Excellent.
B00005176F|5.0|I am a new blur fan and there great.  With great songs like song 2 and coffe anf tv i definaetly recommend this cd.  If you are a weezer fan get it defentitly.  It is like weezer, but more eletronic.  I don't know why people say they are like R.E.M., but they are not.  It would be better to buy this cd (Best of Blur) then all there other cd's and cheaper.  Demon form blur is now in the Gorillaz and there great too.  I dont know if blur is still together.
B00005JKES|2.0|I can tell you right now that if this set included all 29 (?) episodes along with the pilot, I would give it a 6. But what are they trying to pull here? Do your research, get the rights, and make this a set worth owning - for under $300. It would have sold like mad. All this does is twart other TP productions by showing bad profit to other companies who may have been interested in producing something TP or Lynch related. If you buy this, you are a fool. My advice: buy the VHS set, wait a year or two til you've got yourself a DVD burner, and convert them yourself. Concidering how long it took them to put out this subpar set, you have nothing to lose. You'll have the set on DVD sooner than 2020 and, burner included, it will cost you less. It may even be better quality and on fewer discs. I don't know what I was expecting here. Wait, yes, I do. I was expecting this. I was hoping for a lot more.
0517122707|3.0|I found this book to be quite a let-down given the Pulitzer Prize and a scan of the reviews here.  The army of rabid fans would apparently decry me as not 'getting it' and of being some bland personage unable to appreciate the genius of Toole.  On the contrary, I did find it very funny in parts, even laughing out loud.  I am certain that some of the characters and situations will stand out vividly in my mind for some time to come.  For me, this was not sufficient to make it great literature, nor did I even find it nearly as funny as, say, Catch-22 or White Noise.  There is really only one note here, one tone and one basic set of jokes played out again and again.  The characters are caricatures given the same types of lines, observations, and actions again and again - Jones' smoke clouds, Miss Trixie's 'snarls' once she gets her new teeth - and the only one I really cared about that much was Jones.  The lack of a strong plot didn't help me care any more, either.  The book doesn't build to anything.  I felt no different upon finishing it than I would at the end of a Seinfeld re-run.  And I'd like a little something more out of my time investment...
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mocking Bird is by far the best book I've ever read.  The innocence of the nararation and depth of the plot made for a real page turner.  When you finish this book you'll wish it never ended.  I would definately reread it.
B00005N9CV|1.0|I have been a fan for some years but I had to find someone to give this wretched CD to{who wouldt be offended{.The production swamps the players in  a sea of sugar.It could be Mantavoni for slow learners.<BR>I will still go to see her live...as long as she leaves the string section at home.
6305531374|5.0|Halloween h20 is one of my favorite movies.  The DVD is good.<br />I't doesn't have too many features but so what?!  It's a good movie.  The cast is great.  Mike is creepier than ever.  it's an updated sequel that lives up to the origional.
0446677450|5.0|Robert T Kiyosaki is one of the finest financial teachers I have every seen. The way he teaches the basics of financing is amazing. The book though looks very different and appealing but it talks about the same old principals that every financial expert talked about.<br />The wisdom Robert gave us through this book is that teaching the technical financial literacy to even a person who hates the topic could be so easy and simple. It is just the way you see things that they look to you. <br />The concept of passive / portfolio income and the fundamentals of diversification are explained in such simple terms that even a child can understand them, in fact Robert understood them as a child. And if you have the right sources you can guide your children in the right directions and teach them the basics of financial literacy through the help of this book. <br />He has touched all the sensitive topics one requires for success so beautifully that you wont even realize when they came and went. And the best part is you will understand everything just as perfectly as a technical financial expert would. He spoke about diversifying, broadening, systems, marketing, selling, financial understanding, education system, and many other including the most powerful income known as Passive / Portfolio / Residual income. The bottom line is - There is only one shortcut to success, Get Educated!<br />Education is not what you gain in school or college, because that's become a necessity of the society and everyone is doing that. Education is how you groom yourself in your own way, which no one else in your college or school is doing. What is your USP? If you are studying medicine, everyone in your class or even in your industry is doing that. Are you taking a step further and getting yourself educated in the field of management, psychology, engineering, travel industry, state consultancy, economics, etc. To one, this might sound absurd, but this is what Robert talks about - we should know what's happening in and around us, we should be open to new ideas, teachings, and new subjects. By studying medicine you are doing the same thing that hundred other classmates are doing, if you want to be different then do something more than just studying medicine. It is only the knowledge that can take you further. <br />Always remember: Leaders are Readers!<br />And there is Only One Shortcut to Success: Get Educated!<br />All the best and enjoy the book to its fullest. The book contains age-old wisdom modified in a manner that even your 7-year old child can understand what one means by financial literacy and financial independence.<br />Good Luck and All The Best!<br />Happy Reading!
B000056K04|4.0|This is an excellent CD, by an excellent group of musicians. It isn't their best work or anything but it [isn't bad], like some may say. My personal favorites are I Did It, When The World Ends, The Space Between, Dreams Of Our Fathers, If I Had It All, Angel, and Fool To Think. All of the songs are good but those are my favs. I think that if this is their worst work, then they must be one of the greatest bands of all time because this isn't too bad.
B00005LOUS|5.0|Last year my mom and I went to see THE GRINCH. About three weeks before, I did something - I can't remember what - and so in<BR>exchange my mom promised we'd go see The Grinch, on at least the<BR>second day it was out.<BR>  Well, I waited and waited, and the second day came. Mom couldn't take me. Nor the next day, or the next, or the next. But<BR>about two weeks later Mom FINALLY took me, and I LOVED it! Humor,<BR>sad parts, slapstick scenes, and a good moral. I was twelve, at<BR>the time, and so people didn't think I wouldn't understand the few adult parts, but I did. <BR>  My favorite Christmas movies ever are THE GRINCH, HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS, A CHRISTMAS STORY, A CHRISTMAS CAROL,<BR>It's a WoNDERFUL LIFE, RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER, and that<BR>one Garfield movie. I also love THE SANTA CLAUS, JINGLE ALL THE<BR>WAY, SANTA WHO?, and THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER.<BR> Take it from me; this movie is great. I'm gonna buy it the day<BR>it comes out!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall has got to be one of the best jazz singers to come our way. This CD is superb, Diana sings right from her soul into yours. Her rendition of &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; is the best I've ever heard since Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66. Her almost breathy, soft deep clear voice with exquisite timing is something no one should miss.
B00000D9TK|4.0|This really is a wonderful CD by Celine Dion.  The blend of her voice with the beautiful language of French is just poetry to my ears.  I'm not fluent in French, however I have taken enough to understand most of what she is saying and it is just absolutely exquisite.  The real joy behind this album is that you do not need to understand the language to thoroughly enjoy her masterpieces.  My favorite would be &quot;Je Crois Toi,&quot; but I put my recommendation behind the whole album.  It is absolutely a joy to listen to, not to mention ideal for studying because there is less temptation to sing along with something you don't quite understand.:)  It provides superb background music for any occasion.
B00001NFCY|3.0|A little disappointing after the great &quot;Human Clay&quot; in 1997. &quot;Higher&quot; and &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; are great and originial. Then there's the other nine songs --- they all sound the same. They're even all in the same key!! That doesn't mean the general style is bad -- it would be good if they had done 2 or 3 songs like that rather than the entire album except the singles. &quot;Are You Ready&quot; sounds way too much like Stone Temple Pilots' &quot;Vasoline.&quot; &quot;What If?&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot; are nearly identical. What happened? My Own Prison was full of different-sounding songs that were almost all great. Hopefully Weathered will go back to the My Own Prison style.
B00002Z88D|5.0|First of all, let me say that i'm a big metallica fan ever since I listenend to this album. It is truyly a great album....let me just say buy this record, it's great and original and actualy takes chances unlike other metal bands.
079073382X|5.0|I have to agree with roadrunnerish, this film has the most romantic kiss ever filmed - on a ferris wheel no less! How I got sucked into this movie is another story. I was alone on business travel somewhere, thumbing through the pay-per-view channels. It looked awful in theory. I mean a movie where two people meet and talk and absolutely NO action happens whatsoever! I kept waiting for something exciting or dangerous. I still liked the movie though, but what's real interesting is that this movie stayed with me for DAYS! It made such an impact on me. I kept reliving certain scenes. A truly romantic story that even &quot;real guys&quot; can like. And wow, what a kiss!
B00002Z88D|5.0|First of all, let me say that i'm a big metallica fan ever since I listenend to this album. It is truyly a great album, but the fact is that a lot of people criticize Metallica for &quot;selling out.&quot; Now , I can kinda see why people may see that in relation to Load or Re-load, but the fact is there not. There showing signs of a great band that likes to experiment, NOT SELL OUT!All the greats did it, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep purple, but some people just can't seem to handle the fact that Metallica is greater then Slayer or Exodus. Even Metallica's alter ego ,Megadeth, experimented with risk,&quot; (They're new album is great by the way.) Anyway, i'm rambling, let me just say buy this record, it's great and original and actualy takes chances unlike other metal bands.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|The ghosts of Hank Williams, Blind Willie McTell, and Charley Patton haunt this stunning addition to the legacy of Bob Dylan.  I won't try to add to the accolades already noted in this site and numerous publications, but to me the real story of &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is that it was produced by Dylan (aka Jack Frost).  Stone cold Dylan fans know all to well that his previous attempts at self production ranged from shoddy to mediocre. The fact that he pulls off this 5 star mix of lyrics and instrumentation is nothing short of a revelation.  We can only hope that he actually promotes a new album by playing a bunch of these tracks in the upcoming leg of the Never Ending Tour. Since it was recorded with his crack road band the prospects should be very good.
0064471837|5.0|I have to say, as an avid reader, that out of all the fantasy books I've read, Sabriel is my favorite.  The world that Nix has created is truly stunning.  The rich detail in the plot makes it so that new things are discovered with every re-reading.  (And I've read it enough times to know!)  The characters are very well done, with just enough mystery behind them to leave you guessing.  Lirael, the next book in the trilogy, is almost as satisfying, but Sabriel is definately the one you need to read to get the best of Garth Nix's skills as a fantasy novelist.  An absolute must-read.
B00000373U|4.0|I don't know if it's his best.  I don't think it is, but I like the CD, and it's one that I will be playing for awhile when I drive.  I will be getting the two CDs after this one to see if he has grown.  He has a good musical sensibility.  Although it's a lo-fi album, he has written songs with complexity.  This tells me that he has a lot more in mind than what he has done on this CD.  I hope that he has gotten out of the solipsism in the work that follows this.
B00005NEZ3|5.0|If your parents watch what u listen to this is puurfect cd        it does swear but not to much it only clears some words<BR>clint eastwood is the best song on the track[nothing to do with a <BR>guy named clint]the music tecno rap/pop its good the singers a cartoons [lol]the cds very nice i want to get some of their other cds
B0000029LG|4.0|You'll love this set. Michael's descent into madness/plastic surgery mania/weird stuff with children has put a huge blot on his career entirely of his own making. But the quality of his work puts fellow pop acts to shame. Is there a more flat-out dance tune to define the 80s than Beat It? How many Britney or NSYNC songs reach the emotional complexity of &quot;Billie Jean is not my lover, she's just a girl who says that I am the one, but the kid is not my son&quot;? (Answer: None.)<br />Okay, so it's not THAT complex. This is pop, after all. But Jackson's post-Thriller work also has some undeniable gems. Man in the Mirror is my favorite Jackson song of all time, and I'm not afraid to say it (although I'm sure I will get ridiculed at the office). It's a great song with a great message.<br />Disc 1 is clearly the star of this two-disc opus, with most of the really big hits. But Disc 2 has some interesting songs dealing with Jackson's isolation and tabloidization. It's less poppy disc with harder edges &quot;They don't really care about us.&quot;<br />Two questions: Where are &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;? Maybe he's saving that for History Part II when it comes out in, oh 2009.
B00005LMBK|1.0|There is only one song on the CD that is worth listening to.. The rest of the CD, is not worth a thing. The entire CD has 1 good song and is not worth the rest.
B000002TPS|4.0|Let me state first that I like Megadeth's previous works, from &quot;Killing&quot;, to &quot;Countdown&quot;, but this sounds completely different than their other recordings. But this difference is a good difference.  All the songs are heavy and the solos are still there by Mustaine and Marty.  My favorite songs are Family Tree, Addicted to Chaos, The Killing Road and A Tout Le Monde. In all the songs the chorus parts are really good.  Of their catalog, I would rate this on par with &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; but a little below &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, which I think is their best piece.
B000002HGD|5.0|One of the top 10 electronic albums of all time, and probably Moby's best, Everything is wrong is excellent. It is his most diverse album. Sometimes you fill find yourself groovin to a techno beat (&quot;Feeling So Real&quot;) and sometimes you will be deeply moved (&quot;God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters&quot;). Some electronic artists that try to fuse those stylings don't pull it off, but Moby does and with style. Buy this album, it's incredible.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This is a knock your socks off Must have album.  Like a fine wine his voice and writing have improved with age.  Download Summer Days to get an inkling of what you will hear on the album<BR>This redeems his album of covers of yore.  His side men do a bang<BR>up job. Get it you will not be displeased.  THe man seems to be having fun and it's infectious.
B00003CXSP|1.0|I recommend that you don't buy this movie.  It is exremely gross and isn't worthy of being a sequal to &quot;Silence of the Lambs!&quot;
B00003Q438|5.0|If you want a movie involving WATER, then JAMES CAMERON certainly delivers!  From the director who brought you not only PIRANAH II: THE SPAWNING but a little film called TITANIC, here is the thrilling story of a hard bunch of underwater oil rig workers who are recruited for a search and rescue mission after a NUCLEAR SUBMARINE sinks!  But you will be AMAZED and ASTOUNDED when our heroes discover they are not alone underneath the waves!  Starring ED HARRIS as the head honcho on the rig, MARY ELIZABETH MASTRANTONIO as his tempetuous ex-wife, and MICHAEL BIEHN as the leader of the SEAL team!  You will CRY your eyes out when the unhappy couple discover there is only one way to escape the deathtrap in which they find themselves!

You can see BOTH versions of the film, the ORIGINAL and the special DIRECTOR's CUT!  Check out the DOCUEMENTARY!  And would you believe a interactive DVD-ROM involving the SCREENPLAY and STORYBOARDS!  When you see this baby there is just one question left to ask!  When do we expect our TITANIC-SPECIAL EDITION DVD, Jimbo?
B000000JO3|5.0|This is the best CD I've ever bought! It's harder faster and has the most meaningful lyrics than anything else! If your looking for hardcore stuff then GET MINOR THREAT!
B000006NPY|5.0|This album feals much more relaxed than most of the other Smashing Pumpkins albums.It doesn't rock like Machina or Gish,but it has beautiful melodies and lyrics that keep the listener captivated.<BR>The lyrics in this album seem more personal and easier to understand.Billy Corgan also seems to have improved on his singing so his voice sounds more soothing.The album opens with the soft &quot;To Sheila&quot; and then plunges into electronica with &quot;Ava Adore&quot;.This albun is really diverse.It features elements of soft rock,electronic,and piano ballads.<BR>Two of my personal favorites on this album are &quot;Annie-Dog&quot; and &quot;For Martha&quot;.<BR>This is real Smashing Pumpkins music without the brainless MTV following.I'd reccomend this album to anyone who has fallen in love.
B00004RFFI|5.0|This is one of those movies I could never get tired of from watching it millions of times. The cast was put together perfectly, Helen Hunt as Jo, who puts in a marvelous performance, along with Bill Paxton as Bill, who easily turns in a great performance. The supporting crew is great as well, but the dialogue was written a bit poorly. Although the entire crew does their best to sharpen it up, the dialogue and the plot still seems a bit dull. However, the great special effects make up for that completely, like the amazing sound and looks of the tornados. The flying cow is probably the most amusing effect. Overall, as a dvd, the movie is great as well, with special little additions like a music video, and a filmography of both Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. I bought this dvd mainly for Helen Hunt's amazing performance, but the entire dvd is spectacular. Overall, Twister is one dvd no collector should miss in their collection.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This album is mediocre garbage. I can now say that Limp Bizkit [stinks]. Yeah, that's right. You may be asking yourself \\"Wait, but didn't this guy say this was their best album?\\". Well, yes I did. But that was a long time ago and my musical taste and knowledge have matured greatly since then. Anyway, back to this album. It [stinks]. The only Limp Bizkit album I still enjoy is their first one. It was much heavier, more complex, and it was back when Fred Durst wrote meaningful lyrics. Please don't buy this or the even worse \\"Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water\\". Buy Three Dollar Bill Yall$ if you have to buy a Limp Bizkit record. Fred Durst has said that for their fourth album, they will go back to their heavy roots. Lets hope so because I don't know how much more of this I can stand.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|If you want to see a good musical, do not hesitate and watch Moulin Rouge!
B000002BUY|5.0|Yeah, you heard me. This is their best. On this album, the songs are much heavier than the newer ones and they have a lot of funk influence mixed in with the metal influence. Don't get me wrong, Make Yourself is a great album and I still love the slower Incubus songs but this is just their best album. I was glad to hear that their upcoming tour's setlist will be made up of mostly songs from SCIENCE. This is just an all around great record along with anything else Incubus has ever done. This is the album that showcases their talent and creativity the most.
0060392886|5.0|This book will be as shocking and trashy as you expect, well worth the money ! <br />The author was obviously not afraid to edit what the Crue wanted to say !
0316776963|4.0|When my friend lent me this book, I really needed some light reading.  Returning from a week long trip of taking care of a terminally ill family member, getting bronchitis, and the trade center bombing, I needed some humor on my plane ride back home.  Being sick, extremely tired, and nervous, I found myself laughing out loud on the plane, to the point where I thought the people around me might think I was going nuts...I finally had to confess the book was so funny.  <br />David Sedaris has a great way of picking out the small things in our lives and making them very funny.  They are endearing, I very much enjoyed this book.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Miss Krall is an extraordinary vocalist, pianist, and jazz stylist.  Unfortunately, these traits are not as apparent in this album as in the prior ones.  While she effectively and beautifully used an orchestra to act as an aura around her vocals and piano work in &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes,&quot; her voice and keyboarding show relatively little passion in this album (indeed they sound tired and rambling), and are overwhelmed by the orchestra.  While other reviewers have blasted the orchestra, the concept can be done successfully in torch jazz, not only as Miss Krall did in the previous album, but also as was done by Linda Ronstadt, Ella Fitzgerald, and others; the difference lies in the energetically emotional vocals.<br />Any disappointment construed by this reviewer and others should be taken in the context of our high expectations, fueled by amazing past performances.  We all want to enjoy more of Miss Krall's talents.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This album is amazingly original. At times sounding like Beck's album Midnight Vultures, at other times sounding like a highly creative rap-funk version of Smashmouth, this cartoon band is serious. With the talent of Damon Albarn from Blur backing the project, this album is not merely a gimmick. It is a stoner album in the classic sense of the world, meaning that it appeals to those who like funky music and can expand their perception to accept something that may not quite fit the norm. This is one of the best albums to come out this year, and this year has been heavy on good albums. It is easy to find yourself listening to this album over and over again, trying to figure out how something so good became so popular.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I give this compilation 5 stars because of the greatness of Godfather I and II, and despite the mediocre Godfather III.  For me, there is no deeper study and portrayal of corruption in the form of Michael Corleone's transformation from idealist to the spiritually dead mafia don.  The opening line &quot;I believe in America&quot; is haunting because these films depict a fine line - and sometime none - between the &quot;legitimate&quot; corporate captain  and the criminal, and they show what results from a narrow, single-minded, relentless thirst for power and material gain.
B000002LFU|3.0|I love REM.  Most songs on Green are great, pop song 89, stand, hairshirt etc but world leader pretend is very, very depressing and the wrong child is the most harrowing song I have ever heard.  It actually scares me!  Anyhow.  Most songs apart from these two are great.  Especially the last track 'untitled' which is one of my fave REM songs ever.  Get this if you want a good pop record but don't be surprised if you have to skip a few tracks...

B00003CXBK|5.0|I've been getting a strange feeling lately that sometimes the obviously unreal world of animation can seem almost more real. Sure you won't find two tailed wolf-gods and giant talking pigs in this world, such as exist in Princess Mononoke's world, but seldom have I felt more emotion that ring as true as this in those real actors movies. This is a movie very much in the mindset of when we believed that animals were gods and everything had a mystery and spirit. Its a world of living breathing mythology. At first the story seems a little odd. But if you just free your mind and go with it...it really grows on you. <BR>This is a bigger movie...this maybe is what the pioneers and visionaries of the early days of films, would have thought of were movies would go. This is not a Disney movie. It doesn't at first appear to be obsessed with Disneys detailed fluidness. But it is very detailed and leaps and bounds above most movies in maturity, drama and vision. This movie dreams its own dream. There just aren't many movies like this out there. The second time I watched this I got it...and I just can't let go of it. You must experience this movie.
B000002KHH|5.0|When, at 12 yrs old, I first heard Black Sabbath, I was instantly introduced to some of life's realities, and, part of it's &quot;darker side&quot;... as experienced through real, emotionally honest, raw, hard hitting rock 'n' roll music. The pure power of Paranoid's thick, rich, layered, and textured &quot;gut-wrenching&quot; musical grasp... combined with thought-provoking, emotionaly stirring, and down-right entertaining lyrics... will &quot;ROCK&quot; you like very few bands, or their &quot;works&quot; can... more so than most any you're likely to encounter. Enjoy!
0783230702|5.0|great movie! everyone knows the plot line or at least they will once they read some of the other reviews. the only bad thing i have to say is that buying this disc is a catch 22. you can either buy the dts version with mind-numbing sound quality or you can buy the special edition with all the great special features but you cant have both unless you purchase both. this dts version should have been a super-dooper special edition with all the extra doo-dads added onto a second disc. on a lighter note, i cant stress how good the sound is if you have home theatre. the beginning scene makes me feel like i am in the shower with willis  and most of the rest of the movie is like that too.
0393317552|5.0|I read this book before taking the History of Western Civilzation, and before taking US History. I have quoted it no less than a dozen times in various papers I have written. And I am certain I will continue to use it as a reference for many years to come.  If you're not really interested in History as a discipline, this might be tedious for you. But if you are interested in how we got here, repeating themes throughout the ages, and very plausible explanations and deductions about why the world is the way it is, this study is a great place to start.<BR>There is only one possible assumption made in this book that could eventually prove wrong.  Just as every other historian that I know of has claimed, Diamond buys into the population of the Americas by East Asians who crossed Beringia and eventually migrated south. Certainly, this is a plausible assumption.  But just as I finished this book, word came out of South America of discoveries at some archeological dig that provided evidence that ancient Amerinds might have a different origin..which is the one assumption I kept questioning as I was reading the book. If this turns into solid proof, it means that humans might have spontaneously evolved in the Americas at about the same time they spontaneously evolved in the Fertile Crescent. It will be interesting to follow these new archealogical clues as we learn of them. But even if this turns out to be true, it won't, in my opinion, have much effect on the major points that Diamond makes in this book.  The Europeans still came over with the Guns, Germs, and the Steel -- so much for the mass of Native Americans.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This 10-tune CD, featuring Diana Krall in her first effort with strings and a large orchestra, shows still another dimension for the singer-pianist.  I like it and look forward to her next CD, which may well venture into another format or return to the small-combo format.  Either way, this lady is outstanding.
B00005NWRS|3.0|If Ryan Adams could ever develop some self-discipline in his creativity, he could be remembered as one of the best rock and rollers of all time.  This amazing thing is that as Adams grows more versitile, he is also getting sloppier.  On &quot;Gold,&quot; virtually all traces of Adams's original incarnation as &quot;Alternative Country&quot; troubador, which he established with the band Whiskeytown, is gone.  Instead Adams has become the guy who seems to want to singlehandedly maintain and expand the legacy of the great rock artists on the late 60s and early seventies, particularly Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones.  The style of the individual songs, and even his own vocals vary widely from track to track.<br />The album starts off in chilling fashion, with the song &quot;New York, New York&quot; and the refrain, &quot;I still love you, New York.&quot;  Recorded before 9/11/01, it now has an additional meaning Adams never intended.  Other excellent cuts include &quot;The Rescue Blues,&quot; the nine minute Neil Young-esque epic &quot;Nobody Girl,&quot; &quot;Somehow Someday&quot; and &quot;Harder Now that its Over.&quot;  The &quot;Side 4&quot; bonus disc includes &quot;The Bar is a Beautiful Place,&quot; which could be a Lou Reed tribute, particularly with the horn flavored instrumental at the end.<br />The problem is that there is WAY too much filler material in between the good stuff.  Including the bonus disc, Adams includes 21 songs here; close to an hour and a half of music.  Pair it down to the best dozen, and you've got a very strong album on your hands.  If you're a fan of Adams, this album is worth it because of the good songs.  If you're just getting to know him, start with his superior debut, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; instead.
6304806426|2.0|The movie is well done and nicely acted. But as for me, it lacks the main ingredient of a story: I did not care about the characters at all. Why would I, anyway? Why should I sympathize with two adulterers? And if the viewer does not care about the characters, this movie becomes excruciatingly long and boring. I found myself fast forwarding many a scene.
B00005K9LM|4.0|Here it is.  Defenders Of The Faith.  With tracks like 'Freewheel Burning', 'Rock Hard Ride Free', 'The Sentinel', and 'Love Bites', this is quite possibly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  I don't agree at all that it's a &quot;sell-out&quot; as a reviewer below put it.  The instramentation is all perfect, with it's melodic crunching guitars, thumping heavy drum beats, and Halford's easily distinguishible screaming vocals.<br />However, it's the remastering itself that I can't help but notice problems.  It doesn't sound as crystal clear as it used to, and the hissing is still ever present.  Although it's a bit muddy sounding, at least they had the decency to crank up the volume a bit so that it can be played louder.<br />When it comes to the extra tracks, this album is the worst of the four.  The live version of &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith' is great, but there are other better songs that they could have done instead that haven't been played on a live album.  I would've liked to hear a live 'Rock Hard Ride Free' instead.  The Studio track 'Turn On Your Light' is also the worst of the four new songs.  Here's how my evaluation of the four current remasters is:<br />     My Favorite Album-&gt; Defenders Of The Faith<BR>     My Least Favorite Album-&gt;  Point Of Entry<br />     Best Remaster Extra Tracks-&gt; Point Of Entry<BR>     Worst Remaster Extra Tracks-&gt; Defenders Of The Faith<br />Go Figure.  Still, it's an excellent album that everyone should check out.  No metal head should be without this fine piece of history.
B00005QFHG|3.0|This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.<br />Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever. Though the mayor has vowed to drive Vianne's business into the ground and run her out of town, Vianne hangs on, determined to stay until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town. What happens in this town, however, ultimately changes the lives of its mayor, the villagers, and even Vianne, forever.<br />This is a lovely, well acted, and moderately entertaining film, that thematically deals with the mystical, sensual, and palliative properties of chocolate. It is a frothy, pleasant confection. If you want a film, dealing with a similar theme, that will fully satisfy an appetite, however, one need look no further than the superb film, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;.e North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town.

B000002UAX|5.0|This album has been given every accolade imaginable over time. But I want to take that a step further. Not only is this the greatest Beatles album ever, the greatest album of all-time, the greatest musical acheivement ever, but this album is the greatest single work in the history of art. It tops everything from the Mona Lisa to Citizen Kane, the Great Wall of China to the Holy Grail. There is no need to go over the songs. Just listen to it about 20 times and email me at nathanbiller@hotmail.com is there is any doubt in your mind that it is at least the greatest album of all time. Forget that #9 exists and you see something that is more diverse and emotionally charged than anything else. It is truly God's musical gift to the world.

B00003CXXI|4.0|When a good lady friend insisted that I watch a movie-length animation featuring the party responsible for unleashing the nauseating Austin Powers oeuvre on the world, I cringed inside. For agonizing minutes, I honestly suspected that this friend had lost the critical faculties I'd admired (no, let's face it, fell in love with) in her since we were both in high school, but the film was only a couple of hours... and the friend's company was worth so very much more than a trivial period of discomfort, so I went with her. I needn't have worried.<br />Mike Myers and Steven Spielberg labored, like the proverbial elephant, for two years and brought forth - ahh, the heck with that metaphor, they made a fine movie.  Much finer than I expected, or given Myers' dismal track record after the first &quot;Wayne's World&quot; movie, had any reason to expect.<br />The movie Shrek both inhabits the fairy tale genre and sends it up without a trace of self-consciousness. Myers is wonderful as the gruff, unapologetically gross ogre with a Scots brogue (imagine Sean Connery in his latter, one-accent-fits-all-acting, decrepit digestive system days, dealing with the aftermath of too much haggis and McEwan's) and Eddie Murphy turns in a solid supporting performance as his wise-cracking donkey sidekick.<BR> <BR>John Lithgow reprises his self-absorbed egotist persona which has served him so well in his other recent work and bends it adroitly to the needs of his current role as the nasty autarch of the fairy-tale kingdom, and Cameron Diaz is refreshing as the much-besought fairy-tale princess imbued with a healthy dollop of 21st century gurl attitude.<br />The other supporting characters, down to the wind-up singing musicbox dolls which greet visitors to the kingdom, duchy, whatever with an insanely funny recitation of its laws, are also well-crafted and hugely entertaining. I came away from the film with sidestitches from laughing. I shouldn't really have been surprised - when Spielberg sets himself a task, even as seemingly trivial a job as an animated feature, he almost always delivers a benchmark product, and this is no exception.<br />And the ending... well, the ending is something special, and quite unexpected.  You may have to watch the show a few times to totally appreciate the ending, but I won't spoil it for you. It's just a great ending, trust me.<br />So why did I hold back the fifth star?  Because the plot did seem to drag (Steven, Steeeeeveeeennn, you of all people!);  because parodies, even masterful ones, necessarily have a degree of triteness to them (I'm waiting to be proven wrong on that), and because it wasn't enough for Mike Myers to not be as bad as he was in the Austin Powers films... he could have turned in a better job of acting than he did, but I can't give him better than solid &quot;B&quot; grades for his job in &quot;Shrek&quot; (even though I was relieved that he chose to climb out of the sewer his spy parodies inhabit).<br />I owe my friend many thanks (over the many I already owe her) for insisting we see this film... her judgment in these matters  remains unvarnished.  Thanks, Fiona.<br />Watch &quot;Shrek.&quot; Take the kids. Buy the DVD, as it's unlikely that mere videotape will suffice to reproduce the whole computer-generated viewing experience that is &quot;Shrek.&quot; <br />In &quot;Shrek,&quot; Steven Spielberg has finally produced the &quot;killer app&quot; for DVD technology, the movie that makes it worth the hundred dollars or so for most people to buy a DVD player if they don't already have one.
B000003S0P|5.0|. When this album came out it was a staple of my friends and myself. I lost touch with it for 25 years, loved it in my head but did not play it. I have recently gotten reaquainted with it and it still holds it's incredible power. We all thought it sounded like the devil's badass music. I still believe it was and is amazingly structured but wonderfully free improv. My drum hero will always be Bruford.
0671024256|3.0|Stephen King is nearly a great writer. There are two things he does, both of which are found in this book, that keep him from greatness. <br />The first is his continuing overuse of foul language. I mean, even in this book on WRITING he can't restrain himself. It seems like a holdover from his geek days in high school, when smoking and swearing were easy ways for a dweeb to increase the masculinity level. But King is a middle aged guy now. Get over it. It just seems silly and off-putting.<br />The other thing is his advice on endings. He tells writers just to write and not worry how the story will end, trusting that a way will be found.<br />Well, that's his weakness as a novelist. His endings. Especially in the biggies, like It and The Stand. The build up is great, but then he finds he's in a corner and the ending seems like a bolt from the blue (what they call deus ex machina in literature classes). <br />As good as King is, and there are few better, a little more pre-planning of plot, and a lot less coarse language, would have elevated him into a higher rank. <br />Still, this book has a few insights for aspiring writers. It does not have a lot of the nuts and bolts found in, say, a Writers Digest book. But it's worth looking at for a little insight into the mind of near great writer.
B00003CX5A|5.0|The artwork in Sleepy Hollow is simply masterful.  I am a sucker for American Folklore, and Sleepy Hollow really hits the spot.  The dreary, late-fall atmosphere complements the &quot;Halloween Feel.&quot;  Definitely see this around Halloween!
B00005N919|5.0|Basic Instinct is certainly a film that has not only aged well with time, it makes you wish they could still make a sexy erotic thriller this good today.  With so much political correctness going on these days, a film like Basic Instinct would never be made quite the same way, had it been made today.  Attacked while it was being filmed for it's quote &quot;negative depictions of the Gay community&quot; as well as a so called &quot;date rape&quot; scene, the film became controversial practically the day it became green lit.  <br />Sharon Stone became an overnight sensation portraying the rich, seductive &amp; powerful Catherine Tramell, a role that seemed tailor made for the actress.  But in fact director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers) had to fight hard to prove to both Carolco Pictures and actor Michael Douglas that she was in fact the only person suited for the role.  Having worked with Stone on his last picture, Total Recall (1990), Verhoeven knew that Stone had something special to give to the part and he finally got that message through to all those mentioned.  I'd go so far to say that with the exception of her Oscar nominated performance in Martin Scorsese's Casino, Catherine Tramell is still Sharon Stone's best performance.<br />So what's the big deal between the R-rated &amp; Unrated versions of Basic Instinct?  Basically a little more violence and a little more sex.  There's more stabs with the ice pick in the Unrated version (about 3 or 4), more shots of the victim actually being stabbed (courtesy of a man made puppet designed by Rob Bottin) and that's about it for the violence.  The added sex has mainly to do with the first encounter between Michael Douglas's Nick Curran, and Sharon Stone's Catherine Tramell.  The added scenes are hot &amp; very well done, but overall, the result is still the same.  The only other difference is the Unrated version includes an audio commentary with director Paul Verhoeven and director of photography Jan De Bont.  This commentary is not available on the R-rated version.  But both versions do include the 2nd commentary by Feminist critic, Camille Paglia, who praises the film as one of her all time favorite movies.  Her commentary is quite informative and really gave me a lot of insight into the film that I never noticed before.  Those of you who own the Special Edition Laserdisc that came out a few years back should be urged not to get rid of it.  It's special features are quite different from those on these DVD versions.  Even the Paul Verhoevan Commentary is different from the one on the DVD.  Plus the DVD doesn't give you the option of viewing the final shot of the film with the alternate scoring conducted by Jerry Goldmith, although it is shown during the making of documentary.  Still worth keeping.  <br />I personally love how much the movie feels like an Alfred Hitchcock film.  The dress Sharon wheres for the interrogation scene is very similar to the one Kim Novak wore in Vertigo.  There are many references to Vertigo in the film, as well as The Birds, North By Northwest, Rear Window and a few others.  This adds a lot of class to the picture that only enhances its creativeness.  It may be a long time before another picture comes close to matching it.<br />Basic Instinct..destined to become a classic!<br />&quot;I hate rugrats&quot;. - Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell

B000002H97|5.0|First of all I would say to all those who say METALLICA has sold out now, that they have NOT at ALL. Now on to the review. The Black Album is an awesome album, slower than their previous albums, but a more inspired album. It's more of the older METALLICA than the new. For those of you who haven't heard the old METALLICA albums, than what are you waiting for? The Black Album has some great songs on it, I actually don't have a favorite song. On the top of my list would be: Though the Never, The Unforgiven, Sad but True, Enter Sandman. Some songs do seem to be more complex and others don't. James Hetfield seems to tone his voice down somewhat, but Lars Ulrich's drumming is great, in fact all the members seem to play better. The recording is incredible the album sounds very clear. The album is heavy and yet has some slow and intelligent songs. The Black Album balances a good deal of really heavy songs and lighter to create what I think is one if not their best albums. This is an album that all METALLICA fans new and old should have.

B000051VWW|1.0|The jazzy, mesmerizing quality of Sade's voice that made her a major force in the music world was sorely missing on her latest offering. Each new song sounded pretty much the same as one previous to it.  Her back up band, Sweetback lacked its usual drive and the tunes were recorded with annoying scratchy sounds of fingers sliding over guitar strings.  After having waited eagerly for years for some new material, I hope she goes back to the drawing board to recapture what made her so terrific.
0876855575|5.0|If you know nothing about Bukowski this is a good place to start.  You'll have a MUCH clearer picture long before you finish.  This book is somewhat biographical though it claims to be fiction.  With Bukowski anything is plausible and if it didn't happen to him as told in the book it probably could have.  Sometimes I think he's a genius and other times he seems to me as just a drunk misogynist with some writing skills.  You decide.<BR>If you do enjoy this you might consider renting &quot;Barfly.&quot;  This movie, starring Mickey Rourke, came out around 1987.

B00001MXWX|3.0|&quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; is, in my opinion, the weakest in the long-running series of feature films based on Gene Roddenberry's &quot;Star Trek&quot; mythos. (For anyone who has lived in seclusion for the last 35 years, the &quot;Trek&quot; films and TV series chronicle science fiction adventures in a future of starships and deep space exploration.) In this installment, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew from the &quot;Next Generation&quot; TV series attempt to save the Baku, a pastoral people who inhabit a small colony, from sinister plans by a race known as the Sona.<br />There are a lot of good elements in &quot;Insurrection,&quot; but the film is severely hampered by a weak script, among other flaws. The plot is basically a collage of elements &quot;ripped off&quot; from past episodes of the &quot;Next Generation&quot; TV series (most notably, &quot;Homeward,&quot; a later episode guest-starring Paul Sorvino). The plot is also filled with too many weak contrivances and unexplained elements; it just doesn't make sense in retrospect.<br />The Sona and Baku are probably the two most poorly conceived alien races in the entire history of the &quot;Trek&quot; mythos. The Sona seem to primarily be a bunch of beauty parlor addicts (ooh! There's a frightening motivation!). The Baku, about whose fate we are supposed to care, come across as an arrogant bunch of technophobes who like to spout New Age-y platitudes.<br />A central element of &quot;Insurrection&quot; is a romantic attraction between Picard (played by Patrick Stewart, who also shares associate producer credit) and Anij (Donna Murphy), a Baku woman. But I find this attraction totally unconvincing. This relationship is quite a disappointment after seeing the dynamic chemistry between Stewart and Alfre Woodard in the previous &quot;Trek&quot; film (&quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;).<br />Despite the film's shortcomings, &quot;Insurrection&quot; does contain elements that make it worth seeing. There are some superb action sequences (most notably the opening sequence, which blends some great science fiction elements with more conventional hand-to-hand combat). The make-up designs of two minor races, the Sarlac and the Ellora, are quite striking (although underutilized by the camera). The &quot;Next Generation&quot; cast is as great as ever, and have wonderful chemistry in their scenes together.

B00005QATY|3.0|I have two problems with this movie.  The first is that I found it relatively boring.  The only parts where I felt really involved with the movie were when there was music playing, so you might as well just get the soundtrack (which I've done).  George Clooney was kind of nice to look at, but I didn't care about the characters.  What a waste of John Turturro!  Not to mention Holly Hunter.<br />My second problem is more complicated.  As someone from New England who has grown to love the South, I was annoyed by the way accents seemed, in this movie, to be used to show the intelligence of the characters, with the smarter characters having less accent, the less smart ones more, and the downright stupid characters combining their thick thick accents with stuttering, gulping, and bugged-out, rolling eyes.  I should say that my friends in the South don't mind any of this, but that's probably because they don't live with this kind of charicature of the South on a daily basis as I do.  Maybe I'm being overly sensitive here, and maybe if I'd loved the movie otherwise I wouldn't have noticed it, but for me it cut too close to all the other times I've heard people use southern accents to indicate that someone is stupid, even if that person is actually from New England.
6305350205|1.0|Hopefully, this will remain as the one bust in the ST movie catalog. William Shatner directs an ST movie about religion, fate and the search for God. Whoa! Talk about a recipe for disaster!<br />First of all, letting Shatner sit in the director's chair is about as swell an idea as hiring Roseanne Bar sing the national anthem. Not only is the plot of this movie ridiculous, but it is one of the most sloppy films I have ever seen. It appears to have been edited with a chain-saw. This whole dream of William Shatner directs William Shatner in William Shatner's first feature film &quot;The Final Frontier,&quot; co-written by William Shatner, with creative input by William Shatner.........well, all of this nonsense turned into what you could expect: a farce.<br />Besides the terrible direction, it seemed like the rest of our beloved Enterprise crew was only half-hearted about being involved with this debacle. The usually reliable Leonard Nimoy seemed that he could not wait for the film to end so that he could return to Vulcan (and hide his ears in shame?). The humor in the film, something which was pulled off with such natural continuity in ST IV, was nothing but slap-stick one-liners more befitting a poor man's &quot;Airplane!&quot;. Even the special effects, which are usually more than noteworthy in ST endeavors, are very poor &amp; look like they are out of the 1960s.<br />There is a grand total of one scene that is worth seeing. When Kirk approaches his ship, he recites a few lines from John Masefield's &quot;Sea Fever&quot; (a great poem, if you ever get the chance to read it).<br />Other than that, I wish the Klingons would have given this movie the photon-torpedo treatment long before it ever made it to the big screen.
B000002U9W|5.0|To all of you who wrote this album is a bad example of what Pink Floyd is:<br />1) Pink Floyd doesn't start with &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Pink Floyd doesn't end with &quot;The Wall&quot;.<br />2) Although the greatest album of them all might be DSOTM, there were earlier works, like &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. You should give it a listen.<br />3) There cannot be a way to judge a 1970's symphonic rock album using the same standards you use in 2001. In which you think Cristina Aguilera and Britney Spears are tops.<br />Sarcasm aside, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; is a transitional album, between the highly psychedelic Floyd of Barret to the angst-ridden Floyd of Waters. Highly experimental, the album starts with a rousing piece: the &quot;Atom Heart Mother Suite&quot;. Full orchestra, a psychedelic theme, and engineering by Alan Parsons combine to create what can only be described as a true masterpiece, the prelude to PF's most beautiful theme ever: the 22 minute &quot;Echoes&quot; (to be found in the &quot;Meddle&quot; LP, another highly recommended album). The rest of the album is a series of melancholical, bluesy themes, with no particular concept tying them all. Finally, &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;. The most misunderstood piece of them all. Either you love this one or hate its guts.<br />The gold is in the cow, indeed. Especially if you get the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs remastered edition (silly of MoFi to remaster the &quot;worst&quot; Floyd album out there, wouldn't you believe?). <br />And actually, the band stated that their worst album ever was UmmaGumma, not Atom Heart Mother.
B00005JKHP|5.0|At last! STTMP on DVD! Great details added to Klingon ships, new Enterprise and Persis Khambatta as Ilia. The newly refit Enterprise goes on a voyage to intercept a powerful cloud field to see if there is a entity within the cloud. Great score by Jerry Goldsmith with new additions. Added special effects, new sound effects, a great overhaul. I LOVE the new stuff they added.
B00005A46T|5.0|I must say, this cd is complete in ever aspect of what a death metal album should be.  I thought the first album was excellent, it's nothing compared to Iowa.  Iowa is superb, from the low tuned guitars, to the scratching of records in the backround, and then the anger driven voice of Corey makes a orgasmic expierience.

6304806418|5.0|This Movie Is My New Favorite - I Thought It was -much- Better Than The Stage Production - Though that May Have Just Been Me.  I Disagree With Most Critics, And I Believe that The Emotional Bonds with the Characters Become very Strong, If You Listen to all the words. My Favorite Character, Personally, Was Che [Something to Be Gushed on In A Moment], But I Felt a Link With all of the Characters - I felt Their Moods Through their Music, <BR>Heard Their Words Through the wonderously Poetic Lyrics. It's a beautiful, Beautiful Movie - The Musically Adept Don't need No Stinkin Lines. :D<br />Among My favorite Scenes Are &quot;Goodnight And Thank You&quot;, Which I Thought was Utterly hillarious, &quot;Waltz For Eva And Che&quot; Which is commended For Not only it's Content, But It's Cinematography, And that Absolutely divine Scene At The end Where Che Kisses Eva's Coffin. I Can Almost Feel His Respect And Unexpressed Desire In that One - The scene 'Lament', Is Not Only Consisting of Eva Lamenting Her Shortened Life, But Che, Lamenting what Could Have Been Between the two, If it only werent for their sharp contrast Of Lives And Opinions.<br />And Che - Antonio Banderas Is the Best Che I Have Seen to date. He Took the Role And Made it his Own, Guiding Us through What would Have been an otherwise incoherent, 2 hour music Video, While Still keeping with character. On Hearing that he Had the Role, I Was Wary To the quality of Music - But the Man Can sing. God, he Can sing. Not Only could he sing the role, But he Kept it Light, Unforced, and In A Bitterly Cynical Tone that Che Had To Have. His accent was never a Problem for me - I Thought it added to the Role. And, Damn, He Looked the part. He Looked perfect for the part.<br />*cough* Madonna And Johnathan Pryce Were also Awesome - the entire Movie was perfectly cast, From Che To Magaldi To Peron's Mistress. I Watch this Movie 20 times A Day, No Joke, And I Love it more each time. My Only Problem Now, As A Newly Prescribed EvaAnd Che Shipper, Is Where to find some fanfic. &gt;.&lt;
B00004YW6I|5.0|....because it's not a review. All the people before me said enough about this record. I just want to cry out that I THINK THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS GENIUS!! I went to PJ's concert- her voice and skills live are just as masterful as they are on a record. She's a true sparkly diamond in a sea of music wannabes the music industry tries to sell to us lately...I want to give 100 stars....Also, I think there are a lot of people who disregard artists after listening their music only once.  You'll discover more and more newer layers, new melodic complexities every time you listen to this album. There are albums that you don't like no matter how many times you give them a try; this one is NOT like them...it's a masterpiece!
B000056HE9|5.0|This often-overlooked Christmas gem is one of the true classics of the season. Cary Grant, Loretta Young &amp; David Niven all deliver wonderful performances in this wonderfully inspiring movie.
B00004RF98|5.0|Even if you're the type who despises musicals, Singin' in the Rain is impossible to resist. The title sequence is truly one of the greatest scenes in movie history, and the chemistry between Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor is a joy to watch. This is one of the few musicals I would not walk away from when my mom was trying to force us to watch them as kids.
0425180638|5.0|I thought this book was the most clever one that Patricia Cornwell wrote. I have read the majority of her books except two of them. I was able to follow all Scarpetta's adventures throughout this book. I thought Patricia did a great job of tying all her other books into this one book. Explaining what happen to Benton, the Carrie Gretchen story and she brought up some new villians. I thought the book was wrote very well and as always Patricia is great with details. I can't wait for the next Scarpetta saga.
6305079811|5.0|While many have panned this over the years, this campy 1980 send-up of the Flash  Gordon story is a fun, enjoyable adventure. The acting, plot, and special effects may not be the best, but put them together and you're in for a good time. The Queen score/soundtrack is great, although it'd be unfair to try to compare it to the incomparable job they did on Highlander.<br />The DVD delivers a high-quality picture, but is totally devoid of extras. Hopefully a special edition DVD will someday see release, and do this classic justice.
B0000508U6|4.0|I will define this album as soothing and easy to play repeatedly. I am a fan of a group called The Church which had success in the early 1990's. Many of the songs on this album remind me of The Church, especially track one. Enjoy! If you like it, try The Church as well.
B000053GTK|4.0|In the lyric-inclusive liner notes of this long-awaited CD re-release, Geir Hasnes writes that he considers &quot;In A Glass House&quot; the &quot;primary gemstone of the progressive rock era&quot;.  I guess that means he likes it.<br />Looking more at the big picture of this remarkable and grossly under-appreciated ensemble, one would be hard pressed to decide which album, if any, were their best.  &quot;Glass House&quot; certainly appeared during a peak era of the group, immediately preceded by the amazing &quot;Octopus&quot; and followed by the equally wonderful &quot;Power &amp; the Glory&quot; and &quot;Free Hand&quot; releases.  If anything, &quot;Glass House&quot; is a great example of GG's creative audacity, though maybe not the most focussed work of their output.<br />The album consists of four longer, high-energy, varied works punctuated by two shorter, arrangementally spare pieces.  &quot;An Inmates Lullabye&quot; is probably the most eccentric composition this group has recorded, a truly schizoid lullabye performed entirely on percussive instruments.  In contrast, &quot;A Reunion&quot; is a gentle ballad done on strings (multi-track violin and bass all done by Ray Shulman), tenderly vocalized by keyboardist Kerry Minnear.  The rest of the pieces showcase lead singer Derek Shulman and the band's trademark medieval/funk hybrid style which involves richly textured, developmental, deliriously syncopated and edgy rock.<br />Overall production is very clean, a quality appreciably noticable in digitally remastered form.  Aside from the slight presence of some tape hiss from the effects-sparing original, this is the clean, crisp release that this collection was intended to be heard as.  My vinyl release was not only riddled with pops and rumbles from day one, it was also slighly off center; hearing the sustained organ sections on &quot;Way of Life&quot; is virtually revelatory, almost takes getting used to the purity of it.  Highest praise to the remastering crew for bringing the brilliance of the orginal to sparkling life today, something that unfortunately can't be said about some other CD re-releases (early Genesis, for example).  These guys even cared enough to add two bonus live tracks (GG's albums were always a bit on the short side, a fan's common criticism) and resurrect the original packaging, right down to the cellophane &quot;window&quot; and the black jacket texturing!  If only all deserving recorded archives could get this kind of treatment.<br />A great listen to one of the more ambtious, hard-working and just plain fun prog groups to emerge from Europe from the early 70s, though probably for a more exclusive audience.  As their Giant mascot observed, from the first album: &quot;the gentlest music ..... apart from thunderstorms.&quot;rew for bringing the brilliance of the orginal to sparkling life today, something that unfortunately can't be said about some other CD re-releases (early Genesis, for example).

B00000IL1K|5.0|Are you and your special person looking to get in the mood for romance? PUT THIS ON!!!!<br />My girlfriend turned me on to EDEN and to Sara Brightman. I was skeptical at first thinking it was fluffy new age music. Boy I was mistaken! This is the sound of angels! It will take your breath away. If you only know Sara from her Broadway work then you only know half the story.<br />EDEN is a mixture of many styles - classical, opera, new age, rock. Many of the songs are in Italian or Latin and I have no idea what she is saying!!! But it doesn't matter, it is beautiful. I really can't think of the proper words to do this wondeful body of music it's proper justice.<br />You'd think a ballad with Richard Marx would be the cheeziest. Wrong again. Quite a moving experience!<br />You'd think a cover of Kansas's DUST IN THE WIND wouldn't meet the greatness of the orignal track. Well it surpasses it!<br />And thank god for a decent version of the THEME FROM THE TITANIC. I can't stand hearing that wench Celeine Dion. Sara KNOWS how to sing the song and does it with class and elegance.<br />Try this CD. If you like it I definately suggest you also purchase LA LUNA. Enjoy!
B000002H33|4.0|This album has in common with Led Zeppelin IV, in that while the first four songs blow you away, the next four are kind of a let down.<br />Loaded with riffs, Puppets is a must buy. Out of all the Metallica albums I currently have (Puppets, Justice and Re-Load), gotta say that Puppets is definitely the best.
B00003CXRM|5.0|...i think this is just about the best movie i've seen.  it's just a fun thing to watch and listen to.  it's based very loosely on the book &quot;the odyssey&quot;...i havent read that since like the 8th grade, so now i've gotta go back and check it out again so i can catch more of the references to it.<BR>i've owned this dvd for about 3 weeks now, and i've watched it at least 14 times...i'm starting to hum these tunes in my sleep!!
0517122707|5.0|Ignatius P. Reilly is an arrogant, overweight, flatulent bachelor who lives with his mother in New Orleans.  Ignatius and the various wacky characters who people these pages spring to life as they wind their way through this delightful adventure.  Ignatius is the type of person one usually avoids after making his acquaintance.  However, after reading this wonderful book, it's difficult not to have a soft spot in one's heart for him. It's paradoxical, and indicative of the greatness of this work, that it can make such a motley crew of misfits and their antics so compelling.<br /><br />The hallmark of this book, which won a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, is sparkling dialogue, unrestrained wit, unbridled humor, and engaging characters who come to life. The musings of Ignatius both mortify and amuse, and his antics are at once repellant and hilarious. What a terrible shame that this author committed suicide at the age of 32, and this one book was published after his death.  Highly recommended!
B00003CXS4|5.0|...i cant get enough of this and it's starting to creep me out.<BR>i had to watch this the first time with the subtitles on so i could keep up with the story line...but ever since then, i'm good to go!<BR>the only time i'm not watching this is when i'm watching &quot;o brother where art thou&quot;....<BR>i enjoy this more than i did &quot;pulp fiction&quot;...this is just a good movie.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|I heard of these guys before from friends, but never really got into them until now.  I picked up the CD after reading some very positive reviews and I really like the album.  It has great skits and the songs aren't bad either.  I'd give it a 5 except that Jack Black swears more than the kids from The Blair Witch Project which isn't a bad thing, though it does grow tiresome after the tenth or eleventh listening.  Pick this one up if you want something that's funny and fun to listen to.
B000007R1E|4.0|The DTS version of SEVENTH SOJOURN replicates, once again, the quadraphonic, four-channel version of the album issued in the mid'1970's in the USA on quad 8-track tape only(aaggh!!!)<BR>The center channel has been upgraded a bit, but otherwise it <BR>sounds just like I remember it, but a lot less hissy(all 8-track<BR>tapes were hissy as hell--a really lousy medium for music, since the tape spooled twice for quad, four times for stereo--hence the built-in self-destruction of the configuration)and a lot more detailed.  In other words, lotsa fun.<BR>   (More info on this when I get around to comparing the stereo CD and DTS audio discs, which I haven't had a chance to do just yet)<BR>   Bottom line: a must for Moodies fans, who, if they haven't already, should upgrade to a serious multichannel sound system to truly enjoy this multilayered, intricate and sometimes deliciously delicate music.  Not very filling, but very enjoyable on its own teerms.
B00003CX9E|5.0|The gorgeous new transfer of CITIZEN KANE on this DVD is much improved over that for the Criterion laserdisc version in 1991.  The picture is much cleaner; scratches, splices, and other blemishes have been cleaned up considerably.  Details in darker areas are much clearer.  For instance, in the scene where Charlie writes his declaration of principles while his head is in a shadow, on all previous transfers of the film that I saw, his head is in near total darkness; but on this DVD, his facial features are still clearly visible.  Another example is the scene where Charlie orders Susan to continue singing and his shadow totally engulfs her face.  On this DVD, you can distinctly see her facial expression in the shadow, while on older transfers, you cannot.  The improved details within shadows are crucial since much of Greg Toland's innovative photography makes elaborate uses of light and shadows -- shadows that are not just invisible black spaces, but with details, textures, and significance just like lit spaces.  Observant viewers will also notice on the improved DVD picture that, during the projection room scene, one of the people in the shadow is Joseph Cotten.  He is barely noticeable on old transfers, but very much so on this DVD.  (CITIZEN KANE is a rare film in which the actor who plays a main character also plays a cameo role in it!)  Also welcomed is that certain frames in the movie are displayed in &quot;windowboxed&quot; format (such as the huge headline &quot;Kane Marries 'Singer'&quot;), ensuring that they can seen in full on certain monitors.<br />The audio transfer has not been neglected.  The mono sound is clear, sharp, and smooth.  Loud sounds are bright but not harsh.  Soft sounds are always audible.    The softest sound in the movie is probably the moment when Charlie says to Bernstein, &quot;Close the door,&quot; right after Susan's opera debut.  On old transfers it is barely audible, but much more so on this DVD.<br />There are 2 audio commentaries, one by Roger Ebert, who has done many shot-by-shot analyses of CITIZEN KANE and has deep knowledge about the film, and another one by Peter Bogdanovich, who knew Orson Welles personally and has deep knowledge about Welles's life and career.  Ebert's narration is livelier and covers more grounds.  He analyzes some of the themes in the story, and explains many innovative techniques used by the filmmakers, emphasizing that KANE is largely a &quot;special-effects&quot; picture.   Bogdanovich speaks subduedly and sparingly throughout (at one point he says there are other Welles pictures he likes more than KANE), but he makes many keen observations about Welles that can only come from someone who knew him well.  He says he once asked Welles why he did things so differently from other filmmakers.  Welles replied, &quot;I was like the guy who felt sick, and the doctor asked him what he did very morning.  And he said, &quot;Every morning I get up, then vomit...&quot;.  The doctor asked, &quot;You VOMIT every morning?&quot;  And the guy said, &quot;Doesn't EVERYONE?&quot;  The guy thought what he did was normal.  And so did I.&quot;<br />Other extras on the DVD include a one-minute newsreel footage of the film's New York premiere, the wonderfully-edited original theatrical trailer, and about 100 stills from the film's storyboards, production photos, press kit, and posters.  In the &quot;Still Gallery&quot; section, Roger Ebert speaks again on an 11-minute audio track about the significance of Welles' achievements in KANE.  There are two &quot;easter eggs&quot; (undocumented features) on the DVD as well.  One is on the main menu -- select the &quot;sled&quot; symbol and you will see a 6-minute interview of Ruth Warrick, who recalls her experience working with Welles.  Another &quot;sled&quot; symbol can be found in the &quot;Production Notes -- On the Set&quot; section where Robert Wise is mentioned.  Selecting it will take you to a 3-minute interview of Wise, who recounts afew anecdotes about KANE.<br />The second disc contains the excellent 2-hour documentary THE BATTLE OVER CITIZEN KANE, from 1996.  The disc is identical in content to an earlier DVD released by WGBH Boston Video.  The documentary provides vivid portrayals of Hearst and Welles, detail accounts of their rise to power, and fascinating details about the making of KANE and, of course, Hearst's attempts to destroy it.  The makers of the documentary went on to make the equally brilliant HBO movie RKO 281.
B000002GQE|4.0|When the DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED album was issued in early 1968,<BR>its sonics bore no resemblance to the CD{or DTS audio)versions<BR>you buy today(a few of the original mixes can, however, be found<BR>on the band's box set). It was a murkier, bassy mix, punchy and<BR>without the more delicate, detailed sound of the later remixes.<BR>This was not necessarily a bad thing--the original stereo mix had<BR>a unique flavor--but given that the album was an amalgam of sweeping, full-bodied orchestra and mellotron-driven<BR>pop/rock band, the mix really didn't make much sense, not least<BR>because the album was aimed at both the pop/rock and classical audience of the late '60s.  <BR>   The 'current'(as in late '70s)remix, which has been used on the regular CD release of the album all along, is, heresy as it<BR>might sound to some diehard Moody fanatics, a far superior mix in all respects, from clarity and dynamic range to the smallest of details in vocal timbre.  True, the overmodulated, thundering<br />bass of &quot;Peak Hour&quot; is muted, but all else about the recording is closer to the 'classical' intent of the original concept and production.  Which is to say, you can buy the newly remastered,<BR>regular CD reissue with confidence--it sounds fantastic, if not<BR>1968 authentic.<BR>   Which brings me to the DTS audio version, which is a remaster<BR>of the 1974 quadraphonic four-channel remix(adjusted slightly for 5.1 audio, mainly to give the front center channel equal volume with the rest).  In a word, phenomenal, though listeners<BR>used to the occasional use of the rear channels(as in most film<BR>soundtracks)may be disconcerted by the equal volume and activity of the rear(as usual, you have to adjust subwoofer volume on a disc by disc basis).  <BR>   Another aspect novice listeners will notice--beyond the obvious differences in mix and separation--is how the orchestra and band were very obviously recorded separately.  Some tracks blend the two together, but, by and large, what you hear is the orchestra fading away to the group, or vice versa.  Another fascinating truth--Mike Pinder's superb use of the Mellotron(and any other keyboards he was playing)has fooled millions into thinking the orchestra is heard when in fact it is not!(Compare the single version of &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot; from VOICES IN THE SKY, where the orchestra is mixed out, to the longer album version, where the orchestra is sprinkled about in places until the song is over, at which point the orchestra takes over the rest of the way.    There are also later fades, a few alternate edits,<BR>and even a missing instrument or two during certain passages.  <BR>Of course, quad sound--and by extension, DTS and DVD-Audio--wasn't always meant to replicate the original recording with two more channels of separation.  As anyone who has heard the DVD-A of Fleetwood Mac's RUMOURS is well aware, the engineer and/or producer can(and often does)get playful, sometimes to the point of driving you crazy(how much sonic radicalism is too much?  Who knows?)  <BR>   Bottom line: great regular stereo CD reissue, outstanding DTS audio edition.  More of the same, please.
B00003CY5H|3.0|I have to admit that when i was watching The Score i was more or less entertained, not only by the consistently superb acting of two of the greatest actors of all time- Robert De Niro and Edward Norton, but also by the mesmerizing soundtrack that shaped the movie in an ambience teeming with delicious jazz music. up till this point, this reads as a positive review from all perspectives i know... hence it begs the question &quot;what exactly is it about the film that makes me feel like it's a loser?&quot; my answer: The film blatantly lacks a plot, which, of course i'm not going to give away here, but i can almost assure you that the flick will leave you somewhere far from satisfied after the first viewing; and hopefully, one shot at this movie will be all it takes for you to realize that. IF (and this is a big &quot;if&quot;) The Score makes you want to scream out &quot;that's it???&quot; (please notice the three question marks, instead of one) then you are on the same page with this semi-confused reviewer.
B000002GQH|3.0|As much of a fan as I am of the Moodies, On The Threshold Of A Dream lacked the newly found sweeping flourishes and richness of Days Of Future Passed, and isn't redeemed by the strong melodies<BR>and  hippie psychedelia of In Search Of The Lost Chord.  Some<BR>fine moments--&quot;Never Comes The Day&quot; was what soft rock was all <BR>about, while &quot;Lovely To See You&quot; displayed a rocking side the <BR>band offered not quite often enough--but the pretentious and<BR>ponderous nature of this incarnation of the band(a far cry from<BR>the &quot;Go Now! days of roughhouse passion) often drowned out their talent(which is, perhaps, why they're not even close to Rock'n'<BR>Roll Hall of Fame induction, despite fair if not spectacular<BR>credentials).  Plenty of filler here, I'm afraid, even if it is<BR>well performed and produced(by Tony Clarke, the George Martin<BR>of the operation--did this guy ever produce anything outside the<BR>Moodies?)  <BR>   All that said, I've always liked their work, even at its <BR>dumbest(like Graeme Edge's ridiculous recitations).  Since DTS<BR>is using the four-channel quadraphonic mixes from the 1970's for their audio reissues, might as well do this one as well, as the<BR>mix is not only more open and dynamic, but there are some int-<BR>eresting differences(lengthier fades, sound mixed way up, down or<BR>out compared to the original stereo mix)well worth hearing.  <BR>Hell, what I like about DTS audio the most is that it can keep<BR>even an overblown, preening mess like THRESHOLD captivating in<BR>spite of itself.
B00000IOSU|5.0|&quot;Mirrorball [LIVE]&quot;, a selection of superior-quality live concert recordings, features strong percussion, piano and guitar backups that allow Sarah McLachlan to vocalize more powerfully than on her studio recordings.  The selection includes Sarah's standards ['Building A Mystery' (featuring jazz-guitar solos backing Sarah's extremely strong vocals); 'I Will Remember You'; 'Adia'; 'Possession'; 'Sweet Surrender'; and 'Angel' (with solo piano accompanyment backing Sarah's performance, a powerful but graceful combination)].  The selection and sequencing of songs tells a story: the events leading to a young woman's first relationship with a new partner.<br />I recommend this recording based upon the quality of the recording and of the performances.
0380796090|4.0|I've grown accustomed to Keyes' style--to her female heroines who need a major shot of self-esteem, her stream-of-conscience writing, and in particular, her predictability. If it were any other author, it's that last one (predictability) that would spoil the books. I generally have a tough time getting through a book if I know the ending thirty pages into the story. Keyes' books are different though, and I can't explain why. All I can say is that I love them. This one was no exception.<br />Keyes' captures Claire's postpartum/dumped-woman depression with style. We watch her plummet and wonder if she'll pick herself up, and we feel sorry for her new daughter for having such a screwed up mother and maternal family. However, as Claire drags herself out of the dumps, we discover that we actually LIKE this family. They're quirky, but it works (and not to get off the subject, but it helps to explain the characters in Rachel's Holiday, another Keyes' book). <br />Besides the aforementioned predictability, the book is great. I was a little shocked to learn that Claire's two-timing husband was SUCH a horrid person, considering how Claire describes him at the beginning of the book. Although the change in her perception of him is realistic--it reminds me of a woman married to an abusing louse. She only sees the good until she's reached the breaking point, and when reality sets in, it changes not only her view of him but her personality and outlook on life. <br />Watermelon is another light and fun read. This book won't change the world or your view of it, and it certainly won't change your life. It will do exactly what it's meant to do though; it'll let you escape into a fictional world for a day.

B00005KFUM|5.0|Since I'm a huge Radiohead fan I decided to check out Muse's debut album Showbiz, back in '99, since the critics were calling them: another Radiohead clone. Indeed, at first, Showbiz reminded me of Radiohead's 2nd album The Bends, and Muse quickly became another favorite of mine. <br />Later it started to bother me to call Muse 'another Radiohead clone'. Their sound was so different, yet so very good too. I didn't hesitate when their second album was released. Origin Of Symmetry sounds absolutely nothing like Radiohead, but don't worry. This is a fantastic album... A masterpiece, one might say.<BR>If you love the singles Plug In Baby, New Born and Bliss... look no further... Origin Of Symmetry is jammed with eight other small miracles. It's a rock album, yet so melodic and atmospheric. My favorite tracks include Citizen Erased, Feeling Good and Megalomania. Don't hesitate buying this album. It won't disappoint anyone... that's impossible. If you don't like this, there must be something wrong with you.
0802136834|5.0|I was in search of a book to read on the long flight home from London and this was the book I chose.  What a delight!  Alison Weir brought the old English court back to life for me, and I now have a much clearer understanding of the personality of each of Henry VIII's wives, and of Henry himself.  As an American, I had little knowledge about the King's break with the Catholic Church of Rome, and never realized that it had a far greater effect on history than just getting Henry a new wife.  Our Constitution outlines a clear separation of church and state, and now I know why.  A wonderfully written and well researched book!  I recommend it for those who love to read history.
6304702205|1.0|My disappointment was complete.  I knew that after Live at the Acropolis things can only get worse.  I just couldn't imagine that &quot;worse&quot; could be that bad.  First, when I spend my twenty five bucks for a concert DVD I don't want a National Geographic world-is-beautiful program or &quot;we-are-all-the-same&quot; mini speeches.  Mercifully, the skip button on my remote came to rescue.  It is the music that made me sorry I ordered Tribute rather than Live.  Now, what can possibly be wrong with Tribute?  It is that simple: now matter how many times I play Tribute, I cannot hum or whistle or repeat in any manner a single piece.  Tribute seems a result of a &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; computer-run process of creating songs from the elements stored in the best-of-Yanni library.  Great music, like great speeches, is predictable and can be easily memorized.  Tribute seems more like a farewell to the greatness of Yanni.
B00005KHL0|4.0|It's Halloween in Haddonfield, and the story of 6 year old Micheal Myers killing his sister still remains in the quiet town.<br />  Only Dr.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) knows what Micheal is like, and what he can do, and that is why Micheal has been put in the mental hospital.<br />  The scene about how he escapes from the hospital is too unlikely, just walking out and stealig a car. But, when he's out, he's out, and he will not stop until his sister, Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee-Curtis) is dead.<br />  The character of Micheal Myers is played by Tony Moran, and played well too, giving an air of evil. Bullets, knitting needles and clothes hangers won't stop him. Can anyone stop him?<br />  Even though there is a lack of blood, and a slightly slow start, Halloween offers suspence, darkness and murdered teenagers. Recommended.
0767819594|5.0|This is a very cool movie on how some teens are today. Very extreme actions. Teens in my generation are usually like this, doing anything to suceed just like Kathryn, but we wouldn't do half the things she did. Falling in love, losing loves, learning your lesson, thats what this movie is about. Also, it tells people can change with the right motivation.
6304698658|5.0|We all need a little help with the Christmas holiday season now and then, but Clark Griswold's Christmas is the funniest send up of the Christmas holiday season ever made.  Other reviewers have done an excellent job in describing the movie and its merits.  I will say that I quote more lines from this movie than from any other comedy.  Trust me, this is a movie that you must see more than once to really &quot;get&quot; it.<br />One note though, every DVD and VHS transfer I have owned has always had one scene deleted.  I recall a scene when I first rented the movie when it first came out where Eddie's wife Catherine (Miriam Flynn) is in the kitchen and there is this whole cooking scene.  And, although hesitant, Ellen agrees to let Catherine cook the turkey.  Does anyone else remember this scene?  Where did it go?  Without this scene, Clark's carving of the dry turkey is confusing.<br />Please Warner Bros, how about an anamophic, widescreen, uncut release?  Please?  Pretty please?
0425170349|5.0|I've read many of Tom Clancy's novels (The bear and The Dragon, Executive Orders, The Hunt For Red October, and Patriot Games to name a few), but none of them even compare to this book.  I usually like to watch the moive rather than the book, but as there was no movie out for this book, I sat down to read it.  This was one of only 4 books I've ever read in my life thatr I literally couldn't put down.  The others being 1984, The Outsider, and Animal Farm.  And while Rainbow Six doesn't strike out against society as the previously mentioned books do, it is still a very entertaing and exhilerating book.  Personally, I believe it is the best Clancy novel I've read to date.
B00003CXTG|4.0|All I could think of when I saw 'Pearl Harbor' is how very much like 'Titanic' it was. The plot is very different, the actors have a very unique style, but it seemed like Michael Bay was trying to recreate James Cameron's success - a bold ambition. By using the same thematic elements - love won and lost, man-made disasters, and surrealistic settings, I am thinking he hoped it would gain the same epic-movie status as others like it. I'm not surprised it failed to get as much box office attention as 'Titanic', simply because the notice surrounding that film was so unbelievable. However, that doesn't mean that this film wasn't successful. It really is quite good.<br />Yeah, okay, sometimes the dialogue is quite hokey.. what's with Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett's awkwardness around each other - even after being close for so long - and with that constant rehearsing what they are about to say to each other? It was cute when it was first done, but after that, it just got rather old. The romance between Ben Affleck and Beckinsale was also rather contrived, kinda set up, but if you can push that into the back of your mind it's sweet and cute. You really don't get a glimpse of the seriousness of their relationship until they explain it.<br />The action sequences were very long and very drawn out, but managed to be relatively interesting. It was actually quite shocking for a while, until it was clear it wasn't going to end anytime soon. The way the nurses are portrayed is really fabulous, the confusion, the death, is all played out beautifully. The soundtrack is OK.. Faith Hill's love theme song is very irritating, altough on a particularly emotional day I heard it on the radio and began to sob. Hans Zimmer has done better work ('Gladiator', etc). The ending of this movie, with the dialogue being as cheesy as it was, could have been a whole lot more tear-jerking. But as it was, I was crying in the theater anyway! Heck, Ben Affeck and Josh Hartnett have been able to inspiretears in all their films - 'Armageddon', 'Here on Earth', all that. I must say that Kate Beckinsale doesn't really do it for me, even though she is a beautiful and talented actress. I think they needed someone a little less glamorous and a little more down-to-earth to play her, but she's still good. Her narrating at the end is quite nasty, however, really a bad way to end the film.<br />All in all, not as good as I hoped, but really not too bad. Doesn't deserve 4 stars, but 3 stars implies something only mediocre, and 'Pearl Harbor' does manage to rise about all that.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is purely a review of the DVD version of the movie; of course I enthusiastically recommend this BBC adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, just as hundreds of others have done before me. <br />Although I agree with other reviewers that there seems to be an issue with the colour (especially on the first of the two discs), I'd say it's easily adjusted on your television.  The DVD is much preferable to the video version.  I had the feeling when first watching the DVD that, thanks to the widescreen format, there is so much more scope.  Yesterday my sister and I conducted an informal experiment; we compared a scene in her video version to the same scene in the new DVD version.  It's very obvious that there is so much more in the picture on the DVD; one can truly appreciate how the director framed each shot, and it never seems that something is cut out (as it is in the video). I was also very impressed with the clarity; one can actually see the various textures of the fabrics, see individual leaves in the picture.  And as any true fan of the movie would agree, the ability to select and immediately jump to a specific scene is much better than fast forwarding through a video. Finally, some of the scenes are a bit different; the most notable is the wedding scene, when our hero looks at his intended during the ceremony. This never happens in the video version.
B00005OWEG|2.0|I had never seen the movie so my wife took me to it because it is an important film.  It was interesting for a while, but by the time the 3 hour mark hit, I was bored.  The last scenes just dragged on.  The additional footage added very little to the movie.  It may be worth having this movie, but if they offer the original on the DVD, watch it instead of the Redux.
B00005JG6Q|1.0|I am getting really tired of people telling me that Akira is &quot;the best anime ever&quot;. I saw this film for the first time years ago and think that it is one of the worst I've seen. The characters don't develop, the plot runs in circles, and the action sequences are so contrived and cliche they are mostly ridiculous. It felt like I was sitting in the back of a cab in Manhattan rush hour with a driver who doesn't speak English: You just don't know where in the world it's going, or why.<br />  If you want to watch good anime sci-fi, save your money for Neon Genesis Evangelion, Wicked City, or Trigun. If you just want good anime period, go for Ninja Scroll or Princess Mononoke, maybe Samurai-X. For those that love Akira, I just don't get it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Brilliant writing. Brilliant directing. Brilliant performances.<br />Nuff said. Buy this movie. You will watch it over and over again.<br />I  watched it a second time immediately after finishing it.
B000056NX5|3.0|Is it RENT? Is it JCS? Who knows. But one thing is certain, Gale Edwards has done it again, stealing another production's concept and staging but it has unfotunatly backfired on her. But despite some poor casting, costuming and staging a few cast members have pulled through in a good way, making it a mediocre version of a great show.<br />Jerome Pradon displays the best acting skills of both his career and the video but sadly his voice is not suited to Judas, perhaps he should take over Glenn Carter's role?<br />Renee Castle puts on a good rendition of Mary despite copying Yvonne Eilmann's flaw of over-acting.<br />Tony Vincent as Simon is a delight to the ear, putting on a fabulous rendition of the role. His only flaw being his tatoo. ;)<br />Fred Johansson is my favorite Pilate. His deep voice, large body and authoritive presense is awe inspiring and perfect for the part.<br />Fredrick B. Owens makes a good Caiaphas and uses his bass appropriatly but could have perhaps sustained it.<br />Michael Shaeffer creates perhaps the definative Annas by being scary just by being him. A delightful taste of pure talent appearing not frequently enough.<br />The priests are superbly cast and are dark and threatening, creating wonderful atmosphere in &quot;This Jesus Must Die&quot;.<br />The chorus is good and backs up the above mentioned people in their talent. It really is a shame to see most of the leads drag down what could have worked well but doesn't. My verdict: Either buy this for a good chorus, but the 73 version for a better show or go and see RENT to see how this staging SHOULD be done.
B0000019PA|5.0|this is the best indie rock opera ever made. the end.
B000003S2O|5.0|I enjoy the music of Mr Brian Eno on this CD immensely.  &quot;ON LAND&quot; contains environmental music which invokes for me a wide range of emotions.  THE LOST DAY is a brooding piece from which I experience remorse, sadness and dismay.  The piece titled UNFAMILIAR WIND (LEEKS HILLS) draws me slowly into a palpable experience of walking into a marsh.  These are mind-pictures of the experiences of remembering a place rather than picture postcards.  A word of caution about the term &quot;ambient&quot;.  In 1982, when Mr Eno first released this album, there was no classification, or permit me to write, marketing term, for ambient cds.  This cd has no similarity with what currently is classified as &quot;ambient&quot; music.  I'm afraid someone anticipating &quot;ambient&quot; music within the current context will be as disappointed as one reviwer who wrote, &quot;Brian Eno's 'ambient music' is certainly ambient ... but it's certainly not music ... I'll bet plants love it.  As for me, I'm just going to let it lull me to sleep.&quot;  In the liner notes, Mr Eno explains some of the thought processes utilised in creating this landmark piece.  &quot;From 'Another Green World' onwards I became interested in exaggerating and inventing rather than replicating spaces, experimenting in particular with various techniques of time distortion.  This record represents one culmination of that development and in it the landscape has ceased to be a backdrop for something else to happen in front of:  Instead, everything that happens is a part of the landscape.  There is no longer a sharp distinction between foreground and background.&quot;  His instrumentation includes electro-mechanical and acoustic instruments as well as non-instruments like pieces of chain and sticks and stones.  Mr Eric Tamm, author of &quot;Vertical Colour of Sound&quot;, writes, &quot;What sets ON LAND apart musically from most of Eno's quiet, contemplative music is that here the element of timbre takes over tothe point of there being very few pitches in use, and often nothing that could really be called harmony.&quot; The musicians who participated in this project have successful careers of their own, Laraaji, Mr Michael Beinhorn, Mr Axel Gros, Mr Bill Laswell, Mr Jon Hassell, Mr Michael Brook, and Mr Daniel Lanois.   I have done the best I could to explain what this album is and how it affects me.  If you are interested in an extremely influential piece of music from the late twentieth century, this CD will interest you.
B000002B7M|5.0|Ah, Ozzy. Total night fanatic. Not only does he sing about Alestar Crowley (a black night dude), but he has a song called &quot;Steal Away (The NIGHT!)&quot;. That song is incredible. In all it's 3 and a half mnutes of glory, it is my favorite Ozzy song. Revaltion is a great song about a dark (dark as night!) future. Great album! NIGHT!
0812548094|4.0|First off, I would begin by saying this is a good fantasy book for those who love the genre (as I do).  Second, I'd like to quickly address the copycat issue regarding Wheel Of Time: if you dig deep enough you will always find similarities between 2 stories especially when they dwell upon the same genre, however unless you happen to be in the head of the author (or unless the author confesses) you can never know which idea was consciously stolen or borrowed or which ones just happen to be in another book.<br />However what interests me more in this book is the fashion with wich Goodkind ignores all logic.  For instance take Kalhan.  Unless you tell me that confessors have super-human agility and strength Kalhan makes no sense at all.  <BR>First why would you need 4 man to kill a confessor when just one arrow would do the job. In the first episode they even say that Kalhan could easily evade a sword thrust by a Quad (swordman expert I presume) and then advance close enough to touch him before he can swing again... Wow !!! In SOT Kalhan also leads troops in battle, however not only does she plans the battles (which is quite possible) but she's also a front soldier in all of them (and when I say front I mean she's the first one out there)... She seems to thrive in the middle when surrounding by dozens of elite swordmen and she never gets cut.  She goes on solo suicide mission and then come back victorious (after dispaching the ennmy by the hundreds...  Unless she's got superhuman combat abilities that's quite the little soldier she is (No amount of training could yield such results)!!  On another matter, Kalhan also like to kill her victims AFTER she's taken them with her power...  Correct me if I am wrong, but once somebody's been taken by a Confessor, their personality is dead no ? All that remains is an able body 100% faithfull and dedicated to the Confessor... So why kill them ? That would make sense if the Confessor's magic was reversible... But it's not... In myopinion that's the beauty of the Confessor's magic. It's definitive, unlike every other magic I've ever read about where there's always a counter spell or a mean to reverse it etc.<br />In my opinion, the way I see her, Kalhan should remain well beyond ennemy fire(at camp pref) and control the battle from there with her military mind.  Plus when they capture an ennemy alive she should take him with her power, debrief him for information on the ennemy (plan, location etc) and then send him in the ennemy camp as a spy (with order to bring back a commanding officer for instance).  Sooner or later she'll have her own army inside the ennemies army, and with the 100% reliable info gathered by her 'conquest' she can devise even more deadly military plans... Not to mention that if she 'gets her hands' on a high ranking officer she can the use him to give false orders and such...   Plus, by keeping everybody she takes(the guilty I mean, not the ones like Brophy) with her Confessor's power she will rapidly have her own bodyguards (and none other will ever be more dedicated to her safety and no 4 quads will be able to squeeze through that!!)<br />That's the biggest logical flaw in Goodkind's story but not the only one.<BR>However as I said in the beginning, this is a good book because it's a fantasy book, and the defining traits of fantasy is certainly not logic...  So for those who don't ask too many questions, this is your kind of book.  For the others (like me) why don't you just go read a mathematic essai or go debug a software code or the like ;-)
B00005N9CV|5.0|Two weeks ago I had never heard of Diana Krall but read online how good a singer she was so I heard the sound clips from The Look of Love and instantly became a Diane Krall fan. <BR>  After buying the CD and hearing the complete songs I liked the music even better. The song selection was superb and Cry Me A River was a perfect example of how vocals should be mixed with music as Diana Krall sang this perfectly and the music didn't overpower the vocals. <BR>  Don't know when I have been more happy with a purchase of a CD. I have played it over and over and yet am not anywhere close to being tired of it. Diana Krall is in a class by herself when it comes to singing a song with emotion and her piano playing matches vocals very well....would recommend Look Of Love CD to anyone that loves soothing music.
0060925000|5.0|The negative review of &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; are not unfair -- it is true the book is light, the characters are rather superficial, and the plot is rather simple. Still, the book is one of the most enjoyable novels I've read of late.<br />Like Tolstoy or Dickens, Seth's novel is a grand epic potboiler, meant as an intelligent entertainment. It would be easy to imagine &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; broken up as a serial and spread across months of periodical publication. It is, in short, a soap opera, but a delightful and witty one.<br />It's not a deep book, but it is well-crafted and the characters -- not deeply drawn but intriguing nonetheless -- kept my attention. Despite the book's length, it flows quickly, and I found myself having passed 100 pages in what felt like the time needed for 20. Perhaps it's the simplicity of the story, but its 1,500 pages seemed like 400, so the length should not deter.<br />&quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; is a great light read even though the tome itself is heavy. Call it a &quot;summer book&quot; for anyone with an interest in India or Indian fiction.
1881273156|5.0|I went looking for a book that would help two different people communicate when one was an introvert and the other extroverted, and I didn't want an overly religious-minded book.  This is a great book that does all that and more - it explains in simple, easy-to-understand terms how to communicate with someone else and how to show them love in a way that they can understand.  I'm not engaged or married yet, but it really helped me and my partner understand each other better and learn what ways of showing love would mean something to the other.  This is a really good book to read at any stage of the relationship - pre-engagement like us or even 10 years into marriage.

0671722905|5.0|I own a great ragtag collection of Shakespeare's play, from a one-volume monster through the hardcover &quot;Arden&quot; editions to a variety of paperbacks. The New Folger Library paperbacks are by far the best. The introductions are intelligent and well-written, as is the concluding essay that follows every play and the notes (which take up the lefthand page, while the text is on the right) are useful and not intrusive.<br />I've settled on the New Folger Library paperbacks as the books I read before I go to a play. They're cheap and well-done.

B00000F14B|5.0|Ever wonder what the big deal is about watching movies in widescreen?  Get this movie and go directly to the Marian the Librarian scene.  Notice all of the people on the stairs?  They aren't in the other versions.  It's nice to see a movie as it was originally filmed.  <br />More than that, the movie is simply awesome.  It's a slice of Americana set to music that everybody in the family can watch.  Even my cats like it.
0446608955|5.0|Kelly Hunter<BR>October 5,2001<BR>Mr. Powell<BR>English<BR>A Walk to Remember<BR> A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, is about a man named Landon Carter who remembers his last year at Beaufort High School.  This year of his life is a year he will never forget.<BR> In 1958, seventeen-year-old Landon Carter is in his last year of high school.  He has dated before and has recently broken up with his last girlfriend, Angela Clark.  Landon didn't have a date for the homecoming dance as a result of their breakup.  Since Landon was a member of the student council, he was required to attend the homecoming dance.  It turns out that there are few girls available.  Landon ends up asking a girl named Jamie Sullivan.  Jamie was the daughter of the Baptist minister, Hegbert Sullivan.  Jamie was a quiet girl and always carried her Bible with her.  Most people, including Landon, considered her odd.  Her father was widowed and being taken care of by Jamie.<BR> The punch bowl was spiked at the homecoming dance and, as a result, Angela threw up all over the ladies` rest room.  Landon and Jamie helped her get home.<BR> At school, Jamie and Landon are both in drama class together.  Jamie and Landon both have the two main parts of the Christmas play.  Jamie's father wrote the Christmas play they were performing.  Jamie wanted this play to be extra special.  Landon would always walk Jamie home after they had play practice.  Landon liked Jamie even more each time he walked her home, but he wouldn't admit it to himself.<BR> The play was a big success.  When Landon saw how beautiful Jamie looked he finally decides that he is in love with her.<BR> Jamie wanted to do something extra special for the orphans this Christmas, but she did not raise enough money.  Landon secretly donated a bunch of money so that Jamie would have enough.<BR> They gave the orphans a big Christmas party.  While they were at the party, Jamie gave Landon her Bible as a Christmas present.  Jamie had figured out what he did for the orphans.<BR> Landon later goes to Jamie's house to see her.  They didn't sit on the porch and talk like they usually do.  Instead, they had their first kiss.  Later on, Landon tells Jamie, for the first time, that he loves her.  Jamie tells him that he can't love her because she has leukemia.  She and her father had been keeping it a secret from everyone.<BR> Jamie steadily became weaker.  Landon's father paid for extra care and help when Jamie had to go into the hospital.<BR> Landon decides that he wants to ask Jamie to marry him.  He asks Jamie's father's permission and then he asks Jamie.<BR> At the wedding, Jamie says that she wants to walk down the aisle.  She shakily walked down the aisle and she was determined to make it.  She did make it all the way down and they got married.<BR> The characters in this novel were round characters.  They were drawn well and had many traits.  This novel shows the depths of the human heart and shows how much a life can be changed.  The setting was in a small town, and this fit in well with the story.  The story was written in first person and the tone was very sad.  Things were described well and the readers are given a full picture of everything.  The wedding should have been described in more detail and the theme should have been clearer.  I would highly recommend this novel.
B00003CXDD|5.0|this movie was a real classic and I loved watching it when I was a kid... a movie that has to be owned!!!
B00003CXSP|4.0|I first read the book &quot;Hannibal&quot; and later learned that there was to be a movie.  I was excited and nearly broke my neck running to the theater when it came out.  I was disappointed mainly becuz the book was nothing like the movie and vice versa.  <br />HOWEVER, I did find the movie entertaining enough to order it on DVD.  Julianne Moore did a wonderful job playing Sterling and Anthony Hopkins by far was excellent in the film as well.<br />Reading most of the reviews online and elsewhere, I see that lots of people termed this movie as a SEQUEL to &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; and altho I can understand how and why this would be assumed, I personally don't see it as a sequel at all.  Both movies are totally different from the other so in my opinion, the movies really shouldn't be correlated in the sense where Rocky I, II, and III or Nightmare on Elm Street trilogy would be.<br />The DVD in and of itself (Hannibal) comes with lots of features that I found very interesting and I'm glad I did buy it even if I wish the movie itself was at least a little similiar to the book - rather the ending, I should say.
B00003CXX8|5.0|Wow, I went with 2 of my friends (and another one showed up half way through the movie, lol) to see this movie. We were gonna go and see &quot;Glitter&quot;, but it's theater release locations were cut in half. I was very excited to go see it. In the beinning, 'Lee' and her little brother live with their parents. But they get in a really bad accident, and so the kids are sent to live with the Glass' who were nextdoor neighbors of them for a long time. Everything in their house is practically made of glass. Just like Lee says in the film, there's so much stuff to do in it, that you wouldn't even have to leave the house ever. Lee sees the Glass' do weird things, and she suspects things of course. In the end, there's a HUGE showdown, can they escape the Glass house? Wow, 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6305165912|5.0|Without a doubt the acsolute best movie ever in the entire world.  A trifle of a film, marvelous and spectacular.  The director and producer and writers, the coens, did a tremendous job and there is not one act I can perform to show them my appreciation for giving me this gift of a histerical and bueatifully crafted master piece.  No other movie can compare.  The ending is the best ending ever, because if you notice, there really is no ending.  What happens to the rug?  Do they win the tournament?  The coffee can scene is the best scene in anymovie any where in the entire world.  WATCH THIS MOVIE AND YOU WILL THANK YOURSELF FOR SITTING THROUGH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001OAA|5.0|This album is the best I EVER heard...  Shirley Manson's vocals and good looks really make this band up and going.  I STILL listen to this album to this day.  This debut album and also their second album, Version 2.0, you gotta have!!  I guarantee you you will not be disappointed by their music if you're an alternative-rock fan...
B00003CY5K|5.0|This movie is halarious, and Reese is as good as ever. Elle Woods is dumped by her long time beau because he says he needs someone smart since he's going to Harvard Law School. Elle gets mad, and decides that the only way to get him back is to go to Harvard herself. When she arrives, she runs into her boyfriend and discovers that he's now dating Vivian (Selma Blair) who is very bitchy in the film. But in the end, Elle meets the right one & becomes a great attorney. She wins a case all because of a perm, lol. That was one of the funniest parts, but don't forget her cute dog who is dressed up halariously throughout the whole film. Elle & Vivian leave him behind & become best friends. The movie is a refreshing comic laugh that can't be ignored.

0440219078|4.0|Lois Lowry's The Giver at first strikes the reader as the ideal and utopian society, however it is quickly turned around to show how monotone the life is.  I myself am still half and half on this book because it seemed to be lacking something.  At some points in the later chapters in particular it seemed to be rushed through which detracted from the book.  That is why I've given it 4 stars, it was able to hold my attention for the entire book, but it seemed to be lacking that crucial element to be even better.
B00004U30D|5.0|It's simply the best film in the history of American cinema. Everything about it is really great.
B00003CXP1|5.0|What an amazing movie, I was speachless when I saw it. Everything is so great about that you won't believe it. It is the kind of movie that has everything well done, not a single error of dislikely thing, the type of movie that makes buy the dvd and the soundtrack. Darren Aronofsky is a genious no one can stant him. It's amazing to watch Ellen Burstyn and her passion for her TV game show, and how she changes at the end. Her acting is brilliant. Each drug in this movie causes the same mortal effect, it shows you clearly what could happen when your likes and passions get out of hands. Jared Leto prooves to me he's one of the best out there, he's such a great actor and has that strange look which is so fashionable and physically adaptable like in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Highway&quot;, it's like whole new different Jareds for each movie he makes, he is definately unique. I never thought Marlon Wayans could make it so fine, in fact the casting of this movie is perfect, the visual effects are beautiful, the music is SO for the movie, it goes exactly in every part, the movie is so complete that you can't ask for anything else. So if you want to see a movie like no other, something that you are not going to in any other movie unless it is from the same director, buy this movie and buy the soundtrack. It is just great. My personal favorite.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic is a phenomenal piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is a stunning, beautiful, haunting film that will live with the kind of respect and belovedness of classic Hollywood films like \\"Casablanca\\", \\"Gone With The Wind\\", and many more. They don't make them like this anymore. By now, everybody pretty much knows the plot. If not the romance plot, then the whole history of the grand ship itself. Director James Cameron showed Hollywood and naysaying critics that he knew what he was doing and made them eat their words. Speaking of words, some of the dialogue is a little silly, but, really, who ... cares?. A few amateurish lines isn't enough to stain a movie. No matter what. The costumes, effects, make-up, special effects, score, are some of the best seen in a film in eons. It was done with incrediblr care and accuracy. The movie deserves five stars just for that alone!. Leonardo DiCaprio is good, as usual, but doesn't have some of the depth he's had in many of his other films. Kate Winslet, as Rose, is good and appealing, but just a little weak. But, the best acting awards goes to Gloria Stuart as old Rose. A magnificent Oscar-worthy performance. ... Titanic is an epic blockbuster that isn't usual Hollywood blockbuster films. It is deserving of everything it got and did. It is one grand film that gives hope to audiences that special films like this still exist. A classic for the ages. ... Watch and enjoy. That's what it's for. A treaure for people who love movies.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Less introspective but more accessible than it's immediate predecessor, the brilliant TIME OUT OF MIND, LOVE AND THEFT is an extremely listenable collection of loose blues and ballads from an artist who continues to confound expectations and impress with his seemingly limitless gifts.  TIME was a darker, much more impressive piece of work; here, Dylan and his crackerjack troops just seem to be having a good time.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as Dylan sounds completely involved throughout and has once again written some tunes destined to be covered by others to greater commercial success.  The album just seems a bit slight in the wake of Dylan's surprising artistic resurgence with TIME OUT OF MIND.  Perhaps including the excellent &quot;Things Have Changed,&quot; his single from the WONDER BOYS soundtrack and one of the finest pieces of snarling ambivalence ever written, could have given the album more weight.  Then again, the man has more than earned the right to have some fun with the music he makes, and on LOVE AND THEFT, that sounds exactly like what he's doing.

B00003CXDD|5.0|This film rivals &quot;Star Wars&quot; in its ability to be movie with hugh amounts of special effects while not sacrificing the story. It takes elements from earlier movies like &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and vastly improves upon them. The Ron Howard/ George Lucas collaboration was a successful one because the talents of both producers mend seamlessly scene for scene. Val Kilmer truly shows off his ability to become the character he is portraying. The musical score by James Horner is one of best ever written, and by far the best of his career.  The music challenge's the Star Wars theme because it gives the film a certain organic felling, and really draws you into the action on screen. <br />The movie is rated PG but could easily be PG-13 in this day and age.  It's darker than the Star Wars films and could upset younger viewers.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is even slightly a fan of George Lucas or Ron Howard.

0802130208|4.0|Some of the other reviewers on this page have remarked on the book's ending as one of its strengths.  Quite the contrary, I found the end to be flawed, which is why the book loses one star from me.  After such an uncompromising look at the dysfunctional world of Ignatius J. Reilly and his utter inability to cope with the modern world, I felt that the finale was the literary equivalent of the feel-good ending that has been tacked on to a film that has not tested well at advance screenings.  Given what had gone before, I really didn't see how Ignatius could end up anywhere but a mental hospital.  This is not to impugn John Kennedy Toole's honesty as a writer.  Given the fact that Toole committed suicide before his book saw publication--according to Walker Percy's introduction, it would probably never have been published had his mother not shopped it around after his death--I wonder how much Toole himself was like Ignatius; it may be that giving his story a hopeful ending was his way of encouraging himself as well.  I was also put off by the over-the-top stereotyping of the gay characters.<br />The above-mentioned reservations notwithstanding, this is a remarkable work of black humor; although I laughed frequently, I was also struck by the real pain in these characters' lives.  A very unique reading experience.
B00005NZBN|5.0|I am a Dylan fan, but by no means a die hard fan.  I have always been of the opinion that Bob has made some TREMENDOUS albums and some albums that are not even listenable.  Let me say that this album is one of the great ones.  I loved it from from the first listen.  It has songs with rock flavors, blues flavors, and country flavors, but they are all distinctly Dylan songs.  His voice sounds first rate on all tracks and his band is tight.  I would recommend this to all Dylan fans, die hard or not.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is the only movie I've taken my family to four times. We also have the soundtrack. Sure, there is a little &quot;potty humor&quot; as one reviewer wrote, but so mild that the kids laugh and look at you like &quot;boy, are we getting away with something&quot;. This movie has so much heart and feeling, I never would have expected anything close to this. I am NOT an Eddie Murphy fan, and I absolutely LOVE him as Donkey in this movie. I don't know a lot of people who can't identify with some aspect of Donkey's character. This is such a clever movie, even after seeing it so much, there is always something else to see. This definitely isn't Disney, but not everything has to be to be good. <br />Shrek is a keeper, and I can't wait for the video. I almost hope they don't make a sequel. I don't see how they can top this one. It was wonderful.
B0000025H4|5.0|Being the first of many priest albums I've owned,it covers the early work of this band as well as any live album has ever done.<BR>No double live filler BS for this group. If Rob Halford ever rejoins this band definitely a must see concert. Saw these guys on the Heading out to the Highway Tour and couldnt hear anything for a week, Nobody makes you go deaf anymore!
0385486804|5.0|I couldnt put this book down...it reminded me of my own feelings and views at times in my life.  Following Chris McCandless on his journey was very entertaining and enlightening.  I feel like i knew him.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0812550706|5.0|This is really a great book. I really connected to the book, becuase through out my childhood, i dreamed of being the world's best stratiegist. Or soldier. Ender is like that. But ender is this young boy, not wanting to be a soldier, and a reject. A Third. It shows how he being someone that everyone hated, picked on to winning their trust, to doing sooo many wonderful things. I could go on, i just don't want to spoil it for you. I really recommend you read this.
B000002LQR|5.0|They did it again!!  This is actually one of my absolute favorites by the Chili Peppers.  Every song on this CD is good.  They are one of the most talented bands ever.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is my second Diana Krall CD, I also own a copy of When I Look into Your Eyes.  Unforetunately I missed her performance at the Santa Barbara Bowl this summer.  I always buy CD of performers I miss.  Even though Diana Krall is not the first smooth jazz/RnB artist to come out with a song titled The Look of Love(Marilyn Scott has a version of it on her Avenues of Love CD) she puts a nice piano twist on the song.  I like the song so much that I put it on MP3 player.  Cry me a River also got my attention the first time I heardfrom the CD.  Overall an excellent CD and the best Diana Krall to date.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Eclipsing any romantic comedy or drama from Hollywood in the last 30 years, The Road Home achieves so much by doing very little.  Master filmmaker Zhang Yimou successfully captures what it's really like to fall in love for the first time through his use of cinematography (sumptuous as always), unparalleled attention to detail, and, as always, a super strong cast (spearheaded by relative newcomer, the beautiful Zhang Ziyi).  Unlike most romance movies, there is no love-making in this film.  There is no kissing.  The characters show their love through little things that we often take for granted:  preparing food, giving small yet meaningful gifts, and other gestures.  Like most of Zhang Yimou's films, there is relatively little music, however, the music that is there is perfect.  It rises to the occasion when needed and dies down when not.  <BR>All of the elements of this film work together like clockwork...better than clockwork.  It manages to get its message across more than western romances through uncomparable use of setting and shot framing, costume and make-up, lighting (with some brilliantly-back lit shots of the actors), and figure behavior.  <BR>Now about the DVD.  This is a film whose setting was meant to be seen only in widescreen.  The picture holds up well both in sun-lit outdoor conditions and slightly darker indoor scenes.  The voices are set at a nice level and when the score hits its high note, the sound is heavenly...even through a plain Dolby Surround system.<BR>Plain and simple, this is a film which should not be passed up.
B000001OAA|5.0|Dirty, dark, despondent... and damn good, as well! I bought this album when I was thirteen, and I still love it now that I'm closing in on nineteen.
B00003CX5P|5.0|When most people saw the original movies they were young, with that I think alot of people were expecting the same magic.  That magic died when you were a kid and you wont find it in a movie.  What you will find in this movie is more question with a few answers and thats exactly what i expect from a movie of this caliber and scope.  I think it deserves much more praise than what it's getting.
6304211740|5.0|Director Franco Zeffirelli isn't currently the wild-eyed operaticist he was with films like &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot; and his masterpiece &quot;La Traviata,&quot; but this &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; adaptation shows that he can also thrive inside a Gothic tradition, a talent he first showed with his 1990 &quot;Hamlet.&quot;  A large part of the pleasure of this &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; comes from its sense of being a throwback to lavishly-mounted prestige pictures of yore which, unlike such productions today, featured a more authentic sense of romance and less bombast.  Zeffirelli doesn't drag the show on; his editing is quite brisk, without compromising the lushness of his visuals (his Baroque sensibility expresses itself with almost evangelical power when Helen Burns unleashes her red mane--the gift of beauty which the Lowood puritans would strip away).  Esteemed cinematographer David Watkin is in at least Oscar-nomination-worthy form here, managing the occasional touch of soft-focus diffused morning light without making the picture look frilly.  As ubiquitous as badly-done gold tones have become, it's a great relief to look at a film with such a lush sense of the barren.  But best of all, Charlotte Gainsbourg is absolutely hypnotic as Jane.  To paraphrase another Bronte: &quot;Nelly, she IS Jane!&quot;  It's amazing to behold such an unconventional beauty-- praise the gods for Zeffirelli bringing her to an English-language audience.  Her brooding manner, her sense of merit scorned, her hidden yet bound-to-burst amorousness--Gainsbourg ravishes with her quiet luminescence.  And the set of her mouth is one of nature's masterworks.  I could never forget her face in the mirror--she manages to incarnate the literary Jane's patient capacity for self-blame with tear-inducing force.  Such a lovely picture, both sombre and uplifting.
B00000BKDX|5.0|VH1's &quot;The List&quot; rated Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Metallica as the top three heavy metal bands of all time.  My list would remove LZ and place Iron Maiden at #3.  This album represents Maiden at their steel shattering peak, and is quite possibly the best heavy metal album of the mid 80's, before the genre would turn campy with the rise of the LA hair metal scene.  &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; are two of the genre's best.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Man, I'm not even going to write about the movie. Everybody already knows it's brilliant, a true masterpiece. Well, almost everyone... Some people refuse to admit that besides spectacular technical effects, the story itself is enjoyable, and meaningful. I won't go into detail on that, though...<br />I'll just rave for a moment or two about the DVD, whith which I am thrilled. I love the commentary, I love the documentary, I love the photage, I love the media presentations. I miss only one thing: commentary by Welles himself, but some things are impossible, sadly. I think he would have been tickled pink to sit and talk about his baby, for two hours, to an adoring audience. :) Oh welle... <br />Warner Brothers, I commend you. <br />To anyone who is reading this and hasn't seen Citizen Kane, BUY THIS DVD IMMEDIATELY, AND HAVE IT OVERNIGHT MAILED, THEN POP IT IN THE MINUTE IT ARRIVES! If you are not amazed, and touched by this film, I'm truly sorry for you. You're missing out. <br />To anyone who is reading this, and has already seen Kane, well, you better than I what you think of it. If you liked it, do yourself a favor, and buy this superb DVD, and enjoy America's #1 Film of All Time as you've not seen it before. If you didn't like it, don't buy it. Spend your twenty-five bucks on Batman Forever, or Titanic, or some other 'modern' movie, with 'superior effects,' and more 'engaging characters,' and an ending with 'more kick'. <br />I wrote my Senior Report on Citizen Kane. I got a ninety-three. It was one of the lowest grades in the class, and it was one of the lowest grades I'd ever gotten in English (by far my best subject)... but I loved writing that report, and I wouldn't do a single thing differently. It's a magical movie, and this DVD does it justice. <br />{steps off soapbox}<br />Post-Script: I can't resist. I hate being really critical, but, &quot;Rosebowl?&quot; &quot;Marlon Brando?&quot; &quot;James Caan?&quot; Was he even alive at this point? Mr. Tyler Durden (I believe I got the name right, forgive me if I erred), I'm afraid you've got some things mixed up... everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but please, refrain from watching, and especially critiquing a movie while under the influence of hallucinogenics. Especially Citizen Kane. Thank You.

You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy. But the sad part, I think is how Jo loves Beth and is ready to give her whole life for Beth. Mr. Bhaer and Jo gets married and .....read LITTLE MEN!!!!!!

B00000JYGX|4.0|Notre Dame de Paris is the most recent Luc Plamondon opera and is impressive.  This is a operatic version of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.<br />Unfortunately this opera has trouble telling a story.  That aside there are some wonderful songs in the show that more than justify the cost of this CD.<br />This 2 CD set is the entire opera and include all of the written words.  It was a recording of a live show and as such includes all of the slight imperfections that result when the actors are dancing and singing.  There is also sometimes annoying crowd applause.<br />All in all, this is a greatcollection of french songs.  Plamondon is the french Andrew Lloyd Webber and this opera is a major hit in France.  Try it out and also try Plamondon's Starmania for even better music.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film is the best I have seen all year.  The premise, the film technique, the characters...all of it was haunting.  I knew very little about &quot;Memento&quot; when I saw it, and I'm glad I didn't.  The way that the film is unraveled backwards is unique and mindbending.  I often had to ask, &quot;Wait, what just happened?&quot; in my mind, but it is not too hard to follow.  It's true, this movie has you asking &quot;Why did that happen?&quot; all throughout it.  You see something happen, and have to wait until you backtrack further in order to understand it.  When I left the theater, I could not speak, I was still trying to fully take in what I had just seen...I think it took me an hour to act normally.  Give this movie a try, you won't regret it!
0800187792|5.0|This movie was breathtaking. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. It is about a girl who finds a nest of goose eggs that have been abandoned by the mother because of the bussiness machines ripping their way through the wildlife filled forest and scaring away anything that lives there. This movie shows a great relationship between her and her adopted goslings. When fall comes there is one problem, the geese have to fly south but there is no one to lead them there, without anyone the geese will get lost and probably die, so the girl and her father build an airplane like machine and she and her airborne babies fly south, supported by the cheers of most people in America hearing the about the great mission on the news, this is a must-have and must-see I'm telling you!!!!
B00000GB76|5.0|Released long before Paul Simon introduced world music into the mainstream, Fabrizio De Andre' released Crueza De Mar, an album which draws heavily from sounds far beyond the reach of western rock music. The album breaks new ground on many levels, not only in terms of musical direction, but also in terms of language. The album is recorded in the Genoese dialect -incomprehensible to most Italian speakers. Co-produced and co-written with former PFM violinist, Mauro Pagani, the album is often  cited as De Andre's best work. Stand out tracks includes the wonderfully erotic Jamin-a, the evocative Sidun and the tongue in cheek A Dumenga, recounting life in Genova's red light district. My only criticism of this album is its length, 33 minutes of genius never seems enough.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|I LOVE th' D, so don't get me wrong, but this is way over-produced and consequently has lost alot of the edge by trying to give it more.

B000059PR3|5.0|Fulci's zombie movies are classic, must-sees for hardcore horror fans. It bears some similiarities to The Shing, but is in no other way similiar to it.

B00000JSJC|4.0|I missed Strange Days when it first came out, and I regret it.  James Cameron has almost always been a sentimental fool, and his story for this film is no exception.  However, his decision to farm it out to Kathryn Bigelow was inspired, because her films have always been wilder, more worrying and more extreme than his - with the noble exception of &quot;The Terminator&quot;, the only Cameron film with the courage of its altogether ignoble convictions.<br />It's sort of funny watching it now, in 2001, considering that the hi-tech-driven action is supposed to take place at the end of the last century.  A lot of people have a problem with Ralph Fiennes as the hero, but I have a soft spot for old Ralphie - his whole schtick as an actor is about playing morally ambiguous characters who nevertheless have high ideals.  He honed this doing Shakespeare on stage in the UK, and perfected it with his lover/traitor figure in &quot;The English Patient&quot;.  This is a test-run, as it were.  Lenny Nero is a dealer in other people's memories who, god help him, believes in the product.  His greasy hair, wheedling grin and obsession with his Armani suit are all beautifully of a piece, and his white knight complex is well-suited to his nervous charm and softly polished voice.  It's a strange, lovely performance, in my opinion, even if some of the more baroque bits of tech-explanation are no more than perfectly competent.  (Fiennes is great at the enjoyment of the memory technology, not quite so fluid at the exposition of it, but part of this is due to a more than slightly corny script.)<br />Tom Sizemore has a frankly alarming wig and a reliable turn in Dubious Friend, and that's all we want from him.  Richard Edson - the original drummer for Sonic Youth, trivia fans - does a nice jittery job as Fiennes' techie contact.  Angela Bassett is nothing less than splendid as Fiennes' protector, walking conscience and eventual...well, you'll have to see it, but you'll guess it pretty early on.  She has at least one great line to deliver: &quot;Memories are meant to fade, Lenny.  They're designed that way for a reason.&quot;<br />Michael Wincott, as a sleazy rock manager to go with the gallery of other sleazy people he's spent a career bringing to the screen, and Juliette Lewis, as his protegee and Lenny's glamorously wasted Ex, are more than OK.  Vincent D'Onofrio (one of the best actors in the world) carries off the psycho cop excellently, although any number of lesser actors could have done a comparable job.<br />The only problem is the script, which in its determined liberalism (the LAPD isn't really rife with racism, oh no, it's just a couple of loose cannons here and there) is at odds with the basically scary premise.  In the end, it relies on the concept of The Good Cop and Real Love Conquering All.  I don't suppose it could've been any other way, but...really.<br />The whole thing is executed (sic) with characteristic Bigelow panache.  One nice piece of support casting is the Quebecois dancer Louise Lecavalier as one of Wincott's bodyguards - a genuinely scary presence, six feet of muscles, blond dreadlocks and an enigmatic smile.  In all, it's a gutsier film than most, but the script veers away from its own momentum, and it ends up as just another potentially incredible movie gone respectable.

B00000JGHM|5.0|Sorry, this isn't going to be a particularly helpful review.  I thought I'd just say that this movie is definitely worth buying, even more worth seeing.  Sort of a mix between Sneakers and the Usual Suspects, only not really. : - )  You'll like it I think.
0688170528|4.0|This was not what I was expecting!  I hate to say it was a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; since the storyline can't exactly be considered pleasant, but it was definitely more gripping and plot-based (rather than character-based) than I expected.<br />With a significant but effective flavour of the legal suspense genre playing a part, Picoult tells the story of two very close families in the time leading up to and following the attempted execution of a suicide pact between their teenagers, Chris and Emily.  It really makes you wonder how well you can know a person... even your own child.<br />The plot itself is suspenseful and gripping - I'm not a fast reader, but I finished in a matter of a few days.  The characterization seemed lacking in a couple of characters, but perhaps that only stood out to me because the rest of the time it was almost unsettling in how real and precise the characters were.  The writing style is simple and just right for this novel.<br />I will definitely be picking up more novels by this author.
B000000WJK|5.0|I wish I had something spectacular to say that would make the doubting buy purchase this CD but I don't.
B000050FEN|4.0|This is one of the most disturbing movies ever made.  Of course I could not resist the temptation to buy it when it was 50% off.  This is a movie about a crazy man (played by Kevin Spacey) who is punishing people who have fulfilled one or more of the seven deadly sins.  This movie is not for the light of heart and definitely is NOT suited for children.  The ending is very twisted but not all that satisfying.  If you liked this movie you will also like the movie 8mm starring Nicholas Cage.
B00005N9CV|4.0|After her triumphed effort WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, the Grammy-award winning jazz prodigy Diana Krall shrewdly ventures into heady Bossa Nova and sensuous ballads in her new album, THE LOOK OF LOVE. Orchestrated by Claus Olgerman and produced by Tommy LiPuma, THE LOOK OF LOVE galvanizes with a majestic feel with the strings arrangement and judiciously creates a sweeping mood. The intoxicating first track S' Wonderful, the poignant Love Letter and the unabashedly sentimental Cry Me a River are enhanced by Ms. Krall's mellow yet sublime vocals. Fans will rejoice at the selection of tracks like the riveting Besame Mucho, Hoagy Carmichael's I get along w/o you very well and Jonny Mercer's I remember you.<br />Yet the powerful orchestration from LA and London Symphony may also attenuate the simple charms of Ms. Krall's piano performance along with her counterparts like Peter Erskine and Russell Malone in drums and guitar arrangement. Fortunately Ms. Krall's subdued vocals compliments perfectly with the overblown orchestrated arrangement. As such, The Look of love breathes ethereal blues with a melancholic touch to the ballads. Ms. Krall's experimentation with The Look of Love is laudably fine - but fans will probably miss the soulful essence hidden in simple orchestration from her previous albums.
B00003CX8J|5.0|When creating a movie about the X-Men there is undoubtedly a large amount of pressure on that persons shoulders.  So many people were looking forward to this picture to do theie favorite comic book characters justice on the big screen.  I am happy to say that the screen-writer and director both did a fantastic job with X-Men.  The plot is fairly complex, the charcters well cast(save Halle Berry, I could have done without her), and the action is kept up and supported with a great storyline.  The movie is great for fans of the comic book but people who have no idea who the X-Men are can also enjoy it since there is no real backstory for the movie needed to enjoy it.  The ending was left wide open for a sequel or two and I can't wait to see Hugh Jackman back in action.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Somewhere behind this CD is the ghost of &quot;Sinatra-Jobim&quot;, the ultimate 60's bossa-pop album - unfortunately Uncle Tommy doesn't let either Krall or Ogerman let rip and the result is immaculately recorded, intensively edited and tested BUT it doesn't actually give us anything new. A pity.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I love it. One of Megadeths finest. Buy it along with Peace sells, Rust In Peace, So Far So Good So What,and The World Needs A Hero.
B00003CXDB|5.0|I had to choose five stars because there was not an higher rating!! This is definitely an Oliver Stone's masterpiece. The movie simply does a great job is setting up the different characters and in developing a breathtaking story.  Michael Douglas in the role of Gordon Ghekko is simply astonishing, and it is no wonder that by interpreting this role he became a mith.<br />I also found the special features very interesting, with some very insightful clues on how the movie was actually made and the message that it should have conveyed (i.e. Behaving like Gordon Ghekko is BAD, Buddy is a model of integrity).
B00005O5N1|5.0|I love this movie, I could watch it over and over again!
B000059PR5|5.0|I believe this is one of the greatest and most comprehensive works on the subject of a full-scale nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. The movie is focused on a few people living in and around Kansas City when the nuclear holocaust takes place. Even if the large number of characters prevents the viewer to ever get to know any one of them well enough, the movie does a great job in showing what might have happened if an event like this would have really taken place.<br />The movie is now (2001) a terrifiying tale of alternate history, and it can be interesting in order to understand the cold war climate of the beginning of the '80s.<br />VERY IMPORTANT: As always with these kind of movies, AVOID WATCHING IT ON A DATE!!!
B00000IL1K|4.0|When I first heard this album I was a bit disappointed especially after her excellant Time To Say Goodbye album.But after listening to Eden a few times I began to like it.Sarah moves away from the opera and classical feel of Time To Say Goodbye to a more easy listening sometimes new age feel to her songs.So Many Things,Dust In The Wind,Deliver me,Only An Ocean Away and The Last Words You Said could easily pass as pop/easy listening songs.In Paradisum,Eden,Anytime Anywhere,Bailero and Nella Fantasia seem a cross between opera and new age.Theres an Italian version of My Heart Will Go On but it's not as good as the original.And her rendetion of Nessum Dorma could have been better.She doesn't seem to sing as moving on this album as Time To Say Goodbye.My guess is she's trying to move away from classical crossover to more mainstream,Which her fans may or may not like.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is a good read.  I think it has the word 'fart' in it way too much.  You'd think we'ed become more advanced as a society than to say 'fart' all of the time.  Especially child geniuses.  Oh well, maybe my idealistic hopes for humanity are unrealistic.<br />Seriously though, it's good, the character of Ender is excellent, and the whole Battle School scenario is fascinating.  Reminds me, in a weird way, of The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea.<br />Also, the nod to Ursula LeGuin is nice.  I still think Phillip K. Dick and J.G. Ballard are the best for being psychologically disturbing sci-fi, but this had me pondering war and children for quite a while.
B00003CXSP|1.0|What is it about trilogies? After creating the two best movies of all time, Godfather 1 and 2, Coppola served up a tasteless dish called Godfather 3, a film so bad he had to cast his talentless daughter in a key role. <br />We find the same issue here. After creating the BRILLIANT and oft-ignored Red Dragon (which was the basis for Michael Mann's clumsy &quot;Manhunter&quot; film), Thomas Harris followed up with an extraordinary book (and, with the help of many others, a delicious movie) called Silence of the Lambs. <br />As in the case of the Godfather, the Hannibal money machine demanded a third installment of this franchise. The result was a nearly unreadable book that actually broke the old Hollywood paradigm: bad books make good movies (certainly great books rarely make great movies, the Godfather being a notable exception). <br />&quot;Hannibal&quot; the movie belongs in the Ed Wood pile of misguided and misused celluloid. If you are considering spending any of your money on any part of Hannibal... the book, a DVD or VHS .. consider Jodie Foster, the original Clarice. She knew what she was doing... she took one look at the script and RAN. You would be well advised to do the same.<br />I only wish there were a rating of &quot;0 stars.&quot; Or less.
0805062971|5.0|The book tells about a generation of 30 something men (incidently I fit that description) who are angry to discovered that they did not become the movie stars, millionaies, what society claim they would and are very angry about it. They express their rage beating each others up in underground fighting club. Later the whole thing evolved into a more elobarate terrorist plot. The story is told by the narrator whose job is to apply the formula (is it cheaper to organize a recall or to indemnify the victims) for a large car company.<br />It is a very powerful book, although a little strange. I don't think anybody would like it, in particular I don't think many women would. If you are seen the film, there are many significant differences.
B000002JB3|5.0|As a fan of Phil since his late Genesis days, I have all his albums and &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot;, is almost the best album he's ever done, second only to &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;. The title song, almost a club anthem for the New World Order wakes up the listener and gets him anticipating more, and it's not a disappointment. &quot;That's What You Said&quot; is a traditional PC troubled love song, followed by the very different &quot;Lorenzo&quot;. The next 2 songs are pure Phil, one ranting, one introspective, and &quot;Wear My Hat&quot;, is a hilarious take on how he's treated by some of his crazier fans. &quot;It's In Your Eyes&quot; harkens back to his pre-breakthrough, &quot;Face Value&quot; sound, while the next two songs recall the tones of &quot;...But Seriously&quot;, one with angst, one more lighthearted. &quot;The Same Moon&quot;, although best heard live, stands out as possibly Phil's best ballad since &quot;I Wish It Would Rain&quot; or even &quot;One More Night&quot;. Another call to dance, another smooth love song, and the album closes with Phil's stirring cover of Dylan's &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot;, which well sums up the album's, and in its way, Phil's spirit. For those who love PC, or are just starting to listen, &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot;, with its variety and upbeatness, is an album not to be missed!
