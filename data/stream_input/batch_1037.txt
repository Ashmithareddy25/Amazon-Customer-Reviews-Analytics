B002MQYOFW|5.0|No summaries or spoilers here... and since this book has received nearly 1200 reviews already, I'll keep this short and high level.    This book is magnificent. Ms. Collins has achieved literary magic here. Whether you are a mature young adult or enjoying your retirement, this is a book you will love. Be prepared to immediately dive into the next book, however, as this one leaves you breathless and without complete closure.    Atmosphere & setting: Dark. Set in a brutal post-apocalyptic world. Survival of the fittest is law. U.S. after our world has fallen apart and been ripped apart by war. Nature has taken back ownership of the land and the politicians rule over the remaining population with an iron fist.    Characters: Highly developed- you will fall in love with them. They are all rich, colorful and captivating. From our narrator, the bold and practical Katniss, to her endearing, yet determined partner Peeta, to Gale whose grey eyes seem to watch the action with you from his distant perch, to even the supporting characters that get no more than a scene or two to make an impression. These are lasting characters with lives of their own- hopes, fears, dreams.    Themes and plot: This is not a light book. It deals with abuse of power, political and otherwise, class prejudice, family loyalty, loss of a parent, murder as entertainment, the harshness and beauty of nature, and what people will do when they are desperate to survive. There is cruelty and there is hope. A surprisingly dark book for a young audience, but full of important messages and the demonstration that the thread of human decency will always persevere. Most of the more gruesome violence is implied and not detailed.    In terms of age appropriateness, I would ask how mature your young adult is. I could have read this at 10. Now as an adult, I would suggest 13+. No matter what age you read it, be prepared to get wrapped up in the devastation and miracle of this world    Once I started reading, I was glued to the pages until it was done. And now... now I need more of this world.     FURTHER READING:  If you are interested in other young, strong female leads for young adults, I suggest the lighter, more fairy tale styled fantasy [[ASIN:1608606392 Sonia in Vert]] by Avi Ornstein. This has a much lighter atmosphere, but still handles important themes of equality and class prejudice.    For more mature readers of 16+, the slightly more romance centric fastasy series [[ASIN:084396300X The Battle Sylph]] which also deals with weighty themes around young heroines.
B000008M54|5.0|\\"And a Bang on the Ear\\" is fun and  unique  --  Great for dancing around  and laughing.  Excellent instrumental  variety and combo.   Great.    \\"Strange Boat\\" is wonderful. It's  rather wistful and haunting.    \\"Fisherman's Blues\\" is, of course,  massive and deserving of special  praise. It takes you beyond the  waves and into the real sea.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|I've come to expect a lot from Warner Bros. and the creators of Chuck, but this time they outdid themselves.  I am proud to count myself as a Chuck fan today.  If every show delivered a dvd release as Chuck did, we would have very high expectations.  Warner Bros outdid themselves with this release.  They fixed the menu problems and added a lot of value for those who already had the series through iTunes, making it worth the investment.    If this is to be Chuck's last season, then the episodes will far outperform what is expected.  Here is to a back 9 pick-up and season 5 of Chuck!  Go Chuck!!

0446691437|5.0|I've been reading excerpts aloud, sending lines from the book in emails and buying copies for friends...generally spreading the word about this incredibly useful, honest and down-to-earth book since the day I received it, got caught up in it and read it cover to cover in the same day I unpacked it.  If you want to make a change in your work or your life, this is the short cut to your North Star -- not an easy short cut, but one that is easily understood and hits you in the heart.  This is tough love transformation. If you're a writer, artist or just have to produce ideas on demand, this will give you a new way of looking at procrastination and creativity.
B003EW4KB6|4.0|I was able to order this Japanese import directly from Japan.  It plays in SACD players only.  I had high hopes for how it would sound.  But I regret that it sounds like the tape source was a few generations of copying from the original tracks.  The higher frequencies just aren't there, and it puts the sound behind a veil.  The Who is not quite inside my living room.  Since the manufacturer is all about quality, I think this means that the best available source material is this nth generation copy, whatever n may be.  Which is a great shame for this great masterpiece of music.     I remember having a US release and a UK release of The Sex Pistols album;  the US release had the same dulled quality as this SACD, while the UK release had razor sharp clarity.  My guess at the cause of the difference is that a copy of the master tape was shipped to the US for LP printing, and that the lost detail was due to the loss in analog tape copying.    But as the comment on this post makes clear, on this SACD, \\"The masters were used (which had previously been used for the Deluxe Edition and the old MCA CD that was mastered by Steve Hoffman) and no EQ or compression was used.\\"    I also received the Blind Faith SACD from the same company, and its high frequencies are also a bit dulled.  In contrast, the now out of print ABKO Rolling Stones Satanic Majesties Request, from this same era, has crystal clear definition.    Addendum:  I discovered I had an LP of Who's Next I got at a garage sale (looks like a vintage 1971 print), so I did a close comparison with the SACD.  This LP was pretty worn.  However, I could still hear some of the sound that was missing from the SACD.  Most noticeable was the tone of acoustic guitar strumming - with the LP the metal strings were right there by the right speaker; with the SACD, you didn't hear the metal.  The sound of the cymbals caught my attention on the SACD as sounding washed out --- on the LP they sound the same, so their loss of sizzle already happened in the grand master.  Also, the synthesizer on Going Mobile really zings on the LP, and it's veiled on the SACD.  Overall, there is a greater clarity and spatial definition on the LP than the SACD.  It has a different psychoacoustic effect --- somehow, the greater spatial realism wakes the mind up more, like the difference to a cat's attention between a stuffed mouse and a real mouse.    If it is simply that the LP had treble boost, but the SACD did not, from the same master source, then one ought to be able to recover the LP sound from treble boosting the SACD.  However, I've maxed out the treble on my system and still can't equalize them.    POSTSCRIPT, 2010-10-29:  Just got in from Japan the SHM-SACD of Wheels of Fire by Cream, not even listed yet on Amazon.  Listening to it, waves of goosebumps keep moving through me.  What more need I say about the sound?  Glorious, glorious sound.  A star gate collapsing time to the apex of the psychedelic era, this SACD.  Fairport Convention's Liege and Leaf is coming out in a month. Now, if these guys could just get hold of the master tapes of Live Dead ...
0439023513|5.0|It took me nearly a week to read Mockingjay. Not that it's an overly long book, or so dull I couldn't stay with it, but because I wanted to luxuriate inside its pages for as long as possible. And once I did finish, I felt an overwhelming sadness to leave Katniss and her world behind, though much satisfaction at how it all played out. Maybe it wasn't precisely as I'd pictured, but it certainly felt right after fighting alongside Katniss through two Hunger Games and the start of a revolution.<br /><br />Just to sum up Mockingjay's major points: We pick up the story as Katniss has awoken in District 13, lifted out of the arena by Haymitch and Co., leaving Peeta behind to face the devastation wrought when the arena exploded. Katniss, frail in both body and spirit, must come to terms with her unwilling abandonment of Peeta and the new life she must face as the symbol of the fight against the Capitol. Known as the Mockingjay, she now has the power to rouse the other Districts, yet she continually finds herself at odds with those around here and always aware of how Peeta must be suffering because of her deeds. Along the way, Katniss must also come to terms with her feelings for Gale and the loss of lives that can be laid at her feet. It's almost more than she can handle.<br /><br />I loved every page of Mockingjay, though this Katniss is somewhat removed from her earlier incarnations. However, I found that in itself realistic: just how much can a teenager be expected to endure before she shuts down or cracks? Katniss is still, at heart, the Katniss we've known and loved, yet she walks a thin line between doing what's right and knowingly placing herself and others in danger. And when it comes down to it, she's still no good at following rules or even listening to authority.<br /><br />It's exceedingly hard for an author to end a beloved series in the way everyone hoped because we all have our visions for how we'd like to see it end. However, Ms. Collins takes us into unexpected territory with Katniss; we see a softer, fragile girl who once again rises to the occasion against all odds. I confess to shedding a few tears when the major loss came to Katniss, though other losses were almost as devastating. My most minor quibble is the amount of time Katniss spends unconscious and recovering, but I can forgive the author that because I came away with a feeling of resolution that felt...well, just felt right. Along the way, I came across moving scenes that made my heart wrench and fevered chases that made it race, and I ultimately feel as though Katniss and her world were done justice. Highly, highly recommended for those with an open mind to all possibilities.niss; we see a softer, fragile girl who once again rises to the occasion against all odds.

B003OTLVAM|4.0|I am grateful for Blind Faith being chosen for this special SACD release.  I was able to order this Japanese import directly from Japan.  It plays in SACD players only.  I had high hopes for how it would sound.      The sound is more lively than [[ASIN:B003EW4KB6 Who's Next]].  But it is not what I hoped it might be in terms of clarity --- though this might be exactly how the original masters were.  The very highest frequencies just aren't quite there, and it puts the sound just behind a veil.  Blind Faith is not quite inside my living room.  Since the manufacturer is all about quality, I think this means that the best available source material is this copy.  You can hear the tape hiss, which is a good certificate for it not having been filtered in the A/DSD process.      And to be clear, the sound is much better than you can get from a Red Book CD.      To see how good sound from the late 1960s can be, listen to the now out of print ABKO Rolling Stones Satanic Majesties Request, which has crystal clear timbre and space definition.    But, if this is as good a version of these recordings as it is possible to obtain today, I will have to be content with it.
0385504225|3.0|Book was in perfect condition, just as described....however I was surprised at how well it was able to stay intact considering the awful packing job and the condition of the box it was in when it arrived.

B000F7CMRW|2.0|Syriana, 2005 film    The film begins in the early morning showing a desert with men standing around waiting for a bus. This is Tehran, Iran. People sit around elsewhere, waiting to make a sale of \\"Stingers\\". Then there is an explosion of the goods! A double-cross? How did a Chinese company get the deal for valuable oil rights? The managers at Connex want their merger with Killen for \\"economies of scale\\". The new owners of the oil refinery fire their workers; they must now leave the country. Bob Barnes is interviewed about Iran. It is crucial to the security of the United States. [Bob sprinkles salt on his food before he tastes it.] Robby seems spoiled. Bryan Woodman visits the Emir about strategy. There is an accident in the pool. Workers are clubbed for speaking in line. More scenes follow, in a jumble. Mr. Whiting asks the second son of the Emir what he wants.    Government agents study a family and a succession struggle. The ancient sport of falconry is popular in the desert. [What can they hunt?] \\"Are you wearing a wire?\\" Bob wants to return to Lebanon. \\"Clear it with Hezbollah.\\" The armed young men on the street need pay for their services. Bob is kidnapped at gunpoint and interviewed. Will a VIP be killed to adjust the succession in a royal family? Will Bob be safe in his room? Will he give up the names under extreme interrogation techniques? A cover story is prepared to disavow knowledge of Bob's activities. The \\"Committee to Liberate Iran\\" meets in Washington. Lawyer Ben asks questions. The prince wants to maximize profits to benefit his people. Do others have a problem with that? [Yes.] \\"Corruption is why we win!\\" Bennett is questioned. Bob Barnes searches a database unsuccessfully. Why is he being investigated?    The prince learns his younger brother will become Emir. The Americans want this, and have the troops to enforce their will. [Political power depends on military force.] Bob meets Stan in a movie theater for a confidential conversation. Whiting gets a phone call in the night. He later meets Bob in a restaurant, who threatens him. \\"We need another body.\\" \\"We're looking for the illusion of due diligence.\\" \\"Call me Jimmy.\\" There is a party for the new emir (he is in the silver car that is fourth in line). Bedouins have the right of way in the desert. A remote-controlled missile will \\"take out the target\\". A fleet of small boats approach a natural gas tanker. Will there be a terrible explosion? Bryan is back in the states.    Did this movie make a lot of sense to you? It seems like some parts are missing; or was it deliberately meant to be puzzling? Did some scenes remind you of \\"The Godfather\\"? [A story about a powerful leader who struggles against rivals and enemies.] This movie is based on the book \\"See No Evil\\" by Robert Baer (who plays a Security Officer in this film). There were a lot of people involved as well.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I remember watching these as a kid. The black and white picture of a gaunt child overlayed with flames and in the background a haunting operatic remeniscent of some obscure eastern european countries anthem. Visually striking even then. When I was young the war scenes were exciting but the geo-political side was boring. Now, as an adult watching the same episodes, the back-story and interviews are just as involving as the rare combat footage. This is THE standard that all documentaries should be judged by. The remastered edition is just icing on the cake. For anyone who has a passing interest in WWII, you need to watch this. From the beginnings of the National Socialists, fascist regimes in both Italy and Spain, to the buildup of fuedal Japan, the causes and effects of the second world war are discussed in good detail. Some of the stories of 'ordinary' germans and how they saw the war are eye opening. War propoganda, though racist (on all sides), is discussed some too. Well worth the money I paid for it. 5 stars!
B000002JPA|4.0|Lets see to give a bit of background here, I had heard of Dream Theater before(but never listened to any of their works) and was a big fan of the less popular prog metal band Symphony X(go figure). Oddly enough, I saw this at a Goodwill of all places. Since I heard they were good, I decided to give it a try for 1.99$ :D. I own almost every single Dream Theater album now all because of this album. While this is not Dream Theater best works, this is a very good album and an important album in Dream Theater's rise to popularity.    In my opinion Dream Theater's \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" is by far the best.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Even though the story line itself could have been better, I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! It's a must have for me! It was great to see all of these old school actors together in this action packed film.  Sorry to say, they don't make guys like these anymore...can't think of a single up and coming actor that could match any one of them.  Good fun! Love all of these guys and they worked well together.  Too bad Van Damme turned a part down.  P.S.  Maybe The Rock should have been in it, too! (Oops! Meant Dwayne Johnson... I guess he doesn't want to be known by 'The Rock' anymore!)
B00006L83N|5.0|This was my first Symphony X album and still remains my favorite one. I heard of the band here on Amazon, and then saw it in a used CD store in Illinois and decided to give it a try. We bought a few other albums there, but they all sucked except this one. Me and my Dad listened to this album on repeatedly all the way from Chicago to Cadillac, Michigan. Needless to say, its awesome. I remember the countless times we said, \\"woah rewind that part that was super bad\\" during the trip. The production quality, musicianship, and pure epicness of this album is unmatched. If your new to the Symphony X scene grab this album up, and skip \\"Paradise Lost\\".      If your fan of Prog music should own this. If you like Dream theater, Kansas, or METAL music in General....You must own this! If your a breathing human being you must own this!    Micheal Romeo should write movie music...
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I have always loved this story and enjoy the old english language which some reviewers did not like. However, almost everyone is familiar with the story and should be able to follow it.
B001D84NKQ|3.0|Well, I purchased this CD simply because I love the movie. Although the cuts were on the CD from the movie, it wasn't quite what I expected.  Still good music.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Love the workouts but the most irritating thing is that you can't fast forward past the intro. so, everytime you turn it on, you have to listen to the summery of the dvd. EVERYTIME!!!!.. super annoying. otherwise the workouts are very challenging but worth it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday a few weeks ago, and he absolutely LOVES it!!  Every so often, he'll check the time, then re-check it and say 'I really like this watch.'  He used to have an automatic watch years ago, but lost it, and has never found one that he liked that he didn't feel was way too expensive.  (and he'd never seen one with in green at all!)  This was an excellent find/purchase for me, and it was his favorite birthday present this year!  Thank you, Mary  :D
B001N26GFM|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  For me, this was not only an exceptional film involving the Holocaust and World War II, but an incredibly moving and emotional tale of a friendship that developed that knew no prejudice or intolerance. Those involved in the the creation and operation of concentration camps often had housing for themselves and their family close by.  How haunting to have your family living in close proximity to where so much torture and death was being carried out.  Karma can be cruel and this is played out in a chilling fashion.  I do NOT want to include any information that could serve as a spoiler, so I ask you trust that the film will not disappoint.  This was film on the scale of \\"Schindler's List\\" in terms of the impact of the story and the connection of the characters with the audience.  The film will stick with you long after the credits have stopped rolling.  A five star must see recommendation.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought this video when I couldn't find it for rent in my local video store for my daughter to watch. Glad I did! I forgot how much I enjoyed this Disney classic, which is obviously \\"in the vault\\". Now we can look at it whenever we like.
B003PIUC02|5.0|For all you people clamoring for Rome... please just stop. Rome was way longer of a series and an hour long. I've watched Rome and it's good, no doubt. Better? that's matter of opinion. My opinion is that I can't wait for new Spartacus while i could do without ever seeing another long drawn out episode of Rome. Honestly toward the end of Rome I couldn't stop watching but it was frustrating to the point I didn't enjoy watching it. It was almost a task, if you will. Spartacus left me hollering for more. It had me cheering and jumping from my seat in suspense. Can't wait for new season. As far as purchasing it goes... I'm not all too keen yet, becuz the series had one fault in my mind that the plot moved too fast and could have been longer. I wanted more each week from each episode and especially the finale.
1400032717|4.0|This is a world I had no idea about, well a small idea about, but now I think I understand a lot more, thank you Mr. Haddon. A very good, no, a very excellent book, sure there are times I want it to move faster or there is too much info about this or that but on the whole one of the better books I have read in quite some time.
0596009208|4.0|I saw this amazing book when I learning Java as a beginner. My boss given this book to me and pick several chapters for me to read. It real helpful that I can learning fast even I knew nothing about Java that time. Then I start to write code after the reading.<br /><br />Since my poor English, I can't tell you more but only one thing: 'This book is definitely worth buying'.
0321701763|1.0|Ok, so this is testament that you should buy from amazon.  I ordered the book directly from Adobe with the software and when I got it, still sealed, I thought, hmmm, does Amazon have the book and they do for $20 less. Worse, it has such a low rating.   So, I called Adobe to return it and the overseas line got disconnected.  I waited about 40 min for a callback.  So, I tried to return it on line, but it wouldn't take the ISBN in the serial number field and I couldn't leave it blank, so I called Adobe again, waited 26 min for another callback and was told by the rep that my book was IllEGIBLE for return.  I asked, do you mean not eligible.  No, he said it was \\"illegible.\\"  In fact, he said the reason was because he couldn't put in a serial number when he did the on line form.  I said But, I'm keeping the very expensive software and all I want to do is return a $55 book.  Nope, he said, it's not returnable.  I asked why the Adobe guy selling it to me didn't disclose it.  He said I couldnt return it.  So, I tried the chat - same thing - can't return the book because it doesn't have a serial number like software.  My fix is to challenge it on my AMEX card -- and they thought these people were as crazy as I did.  In any case, I applaud the amazon prices and I wonder if this stupidity is reflected in a book that has so few stars.  Isn't it a shame that we have to rely so heavily on this software maker?  As for the book, yeah, right from their own mouths -- it's \\"illegible.\\"
0399536108|5.0|The moment I started reading this book I knew it's soundtrack, \\"Meant To Live\\" by Switchfoot. What captivated me about this book is that it reminded me of the fervor that we all experience as a child...This notion that life is meant to be filled with our own personal definitions of an adventurous life.     While there are dozens of books that claim to help you break out of the 'routine-like life', \\"The Art of Non-Conformity\\" sets the bar because it deals with the core of breaking out - your emotional journey. The fact that Chris Guillebeau takes the time to explain why this book may or may not be for you and at the end of every chapter gives a bulleted list of the emotional transition to master the art of non-conformity, is a true testament that Chris is dedicated to helping his small army re-think the possibilities of an amazing life.    Chris has a knack for telling his story from the perspective of understanding where he fits into the world and how his dreams have manifested in line with his core beliefs. What I find especially refreshing about his style of prose is that it's as if you were sitting with him at a coffee shop, listening to the process of breaking through the mounds of social convention that we grow up with.     This book is not only tactical and strategic, it also hits an emotional nerve that inspires you to remember, \\"We were meant to live for so much more\\". The journey begins and ends with yourself, that is what Chris is so good at conveying. This book is where inspiration meet action and mastery of the art of non-conformity.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This movie absolutely blew my mind!    The sounds is phenomenal when combined with explosions and terrific fight scenes.    Though not 100% accurate, according to the comic book series, the storyline is intriguing as well as thrilling. Any Batman fan will throughly enjoy this movie.  With a combination of violence, mystery, and darkness it forms the perfect tone for a true Batman film.    Don't hesitate, get the movie. That means own it, cause you will want to watch it over and over again.
B000RZGIQ8|4.0|I saw TOP GUN in the theater, owned it on VHS & DVD, this blu-ray I just bought for $10.00 is no doubt the best I've seen and heard. I love this movie even more now than ever before. What really amazed me is how great the surround audio is, the audio on DVD disappointed me big time and thank goodness, this blu-ray made up for it, what a superb upgrade even with the video. I love the aerial and F-14 shots, Tony Scott really made a magnificent job with it, in my opinion, along with the great surround sound, it makes you feel like you're sitting right there inside that cockpit. I love this blu-ray and I highly recommend it, it will make a great addition to your movie library. Thank you, Paramount, for giving this movie the superb upgrade it deserves.

0553805371|1.0|OK - Prof. Hawking has lost it. M-Theory??? Seriously!? I bought this after the notices in the news about Hawking explicitly dismissing the need for God in the origin of the universe, and was hoping for Hawking's take on that question (I'm an atheist). But, unfortunately, I think I wasted my money, as I felt like I was reading some \\"newage\\" (rhymes with \\"sewage\\") crap by Deepak Chopra or one of those nitwits (OK - it wasn't quite THAT bad). I wish physicists would stick to hypotheses that can be tested, instead of all this nonsense about strings and other universes and so on. Read [[ASIN:061891868X The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next]] or [[ASIN:0465092764 Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law for Unity in Physical Law]] or [[ASIN:0465018955 The Lightness of Being: Mass, Ether, and the Unification of Forces]] if you want to learn something about REAL physics, not mystical mumbo-jumbo. If you're a SCIENCE person (as opposed to a mystic), don't waste your time or money with this one!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have always loved CATS The Musical, so when I got the 2-disk edition for my birthday many years back I was thrilled. I watched it so much that I wore it out and now it skips all over the place. I bought the Commemorative Edition and it is perfect! I absolutely love it, and it will be a wonderful addition to your movie collection.
B001GCUO16|3.0|Little James was born in the 1800s, always sick. His family background . . . well, he didn't have much of one, at least, one that cared. Except for his friend, Victor. One night, during a drunken upset with his later-to-be-found-out father, James learned he could produce bone claws from his hands and defends himself, killing his father.<br /><br />That night, James and Victor are on the run, and promise to always stick together. The years go by and the two find a great outlet for their rage: war. Victor (Liev Schreiber) also has a special ability and he is more animal than man, with claws coming out of his fingers. The two are very similar and age very slowly. War after war goes by, and the two eventually end up working with a secret team run by William Stryker (Danny Huston). While on one mission, James-now calling himself Logan (Hugh Jackman)-feels Victor has gone too far in his attack on an innocent and walks out on the group.<br /><br />Years later, the group's been disbanded and Stryker comes to warn Logan that Victor is behind the recent string of deaths of its former members. The only way Logan will be strong enough to fight the always-stronger Victor is to undergo a special experiment of Stryker's own design: graft the indestructible adamantium to his bones. Logan agrees.<br /><br />But there's something Stryker hasn't told him about what's been going on and when Logan finds out, he's furious and wages an all-out one-man war against Stryker, Victor and anyone else who stands in his way.<br /><br />On the action: cool fight scenes and neat concepts. However, it seemed to me Logan was a little too acrobatic and was able to survive way more and take way more pain than even a mutant with a healing ability could.<br /><br />On the story: works for me, in that we knew Logan had a history going in. He was the star of the X-Men movies after all, and X2 especially focused on Logan's origins as much as they were able without detracting from the main story. I did like seeing what really went on and, more specifically, how Logan lost his memory. I was under the impression that he lost it because of the adamantium experiment and not after it. Doesn't matter, but I did feel for the guy when the love of his life wasn't all she was cracked up to be.<br /><br />On Deadpool, because, you know, it has to be covered: the whole story involving the secret ops group Logan was a part of made for fun action. Deadpool's origin, hey, why not.

0385528752|4.0|Many books have been written about why people act the way they do.  Just as many books have been written about how to change your behavior.  This book presents a new framework for looking at change.<br /><br />The framework for change:<br /><br />**Direct the Rider - our rational side.<br />**Motivate the Elephant - our emotional side.<br />**Shape the Path - the situation and surrounding environment.<br /><br />Some of my favorite concepts from the book:<br /><br />**Find the bright spots and focus on them.  In other words, study what IS working and see why, rather than focusing on what's not working.<br /><br />**It may not be the people, it might be the process.  The example of employees not using the automated timesheets was a great example.  The timesheets had some annoying features that really bugged people.  People just didn't like the hassle; it wasn't that they were lazy.<br /><br />**Appeal to people's emotions, not their logic.  The example of colored M&M's convincing Target buyers to go with color showed how this can work.  This may not always work, if you're dealing with an analytical person, but it's worth a try.<br /><br />**Have a very clear path.  The statement, \\"We need to be nicer to our customers\\" isn't going to work.  Re-phrasing to \\"By December 1, 2010, our client satisfaction ratings need to be above 90%\\" is better.<br /><br />**Use Action Triggers to promote new behavior.  For example, tell your sales people that they should make a new client call with their first cup of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />None of these concepts are new, but I find it very helpful to read about important ideas from many perspectives.  It helps me to internalize them and to use them in my own life.

The only thing missing was the song Partisan.

0439023483|1.0|Suzanne collins has done a great job in ripping off a great story and im not just talking about the idea of a Dystopian future and pitting people against each other until there is only one standing either.<br /><br />The stories of battle royale and hunger games are very similar. Very. They are centered around teenagers forced to kill each other, and only one can survive. The government, which is all-powerful, has put them there because they are trying to control some aspect of the country. Those running the \\"games\\" can alter the environment so the chances of conflict is higher. The kids have access to weapons, though what they can get isn't always equal to what someone else has. There's a romance between the two survivors. The two survivors break the rules in order for both of them to leave the \\"games.\\"<br /><br />In the case of battle royale and hunger games they are tons of similaries and a chain of similaries thats when you know its plagiarism:<br /><br />they are school kids,<br />they are put there by the government,<br />they are forced to kill eachother,<br />both of the main character's fall in love and escape breaking the rules,<br />both books have the idea of the supply packs,<br />the boy and girl surviving,<br />similar unique deaths.<br /><br />How many books have these in them ?  just two hunger games and battle royale.<br /><br />However suzanne collins though interviews would have you believe it was her own idea.<br /><br />There are on more than 5 occasions carbon copy almost exact scene's in hunger games that were in battle royale. So similar in fact i felt uncomfortable and also angry that koushun takami's story had been repainted and re sold by collins, you're talking odds of millions that these 5 scene's were thought of separately. I don't want to say the scene's because i don't want to spoil either book. But read both stories i guarantee you will be just as angry at me that the story you fell in love with wasn't suzanne collins story it was koushun takami's.<br /><br />i haven't read hunger game's 2 (catching fire) but i'm going to guess susie collins will rip off battle royale 2 by the two survivor's trying to topple the government.<br /><br />p.s There are difference's between battle royale and hunger games its a shame though that suzanne collins stole those idea's off stephen king's the long walk .but i'm going to guess susie collins will rip off battle royale 2 by the two survivor's trying to topple the government.     p.s There are difference's between battle royale and hunger games its a shame though that suzanne collins stole those idea's off stephen king's the long walk .

B003Y2XI8W|5.0|Diet Coke uses the song \\"Sweet Disposition\\" in their commercial. When I would watch episodes of \\"Top Chef\\", a Bravo reality show, on \\"On Demand\\" they would play the diet coke commercial with the song. At first I found this song so annoying that I would mute the tv every time the commercial came on. I don't know why. But one day I thought to myself what is it about this song I don't like. I listened and could not figure out what the hick they were singing. So I became curious, I don't know why, and looked up a website that list songs on commercials. I listened to the song and then looked up the words on a lyrics website. Now, I absolutely love the song. I downloaded it and have shared it with others but it appears no one in my circle have paid attention to the song or heard of the group. Don't love the rest of the cd, yet. But I love the group and I wish them phenomenal success.
1558908846|4.0|I like this movie one of Stallone's better 90's action films and yes it's based on Judge Dredd.  It seemed fans of the comics had a problem with Stallone removing his mask, in my eyes, the live action version maybe it's time to remove his helmet people.  Plus you can see Stallone tried paying homage to Judge Dredd with his performance which I actually thought was very good.    Good action, nice set design, fun to look at, Diane Lane is hot, I didn't mind Rob Schiender all that much, and a good attempt in my eyes to make Judge Dredd come alive.  The movie gets way too much negativity it's fun to watch.    They are remaking Judge Dredd in 2012 - get ready for a hard R helmet not removed Karl Urban as Judge Dredd.  Should be worth a look as well.    \\"I am the Law!\\"
0374158460|5.0|This novel deserves 5 stars.  Why?    1.Style.  Franzen produces few novels.  He carefully crafts his sentences.  He has a large vocabulary, but doesn't use a big word just for the sake of showing off his erudition.  Critics have used the term \\"lapidary\\" to describe his prose.  The best proponent is Nabokov.  At times, Franzen's writing approaches that level.    2.Plot.  Freedom employs flashbacks and subplots, as do many post-modern novels.  But Franzen doesn't overuse these devices, and his use is seamless.  He has said in interviews that he wanted to write a serious book, but wanted it to be \\"accessible.\\"  He succeeded.    3. Tone. Many of the narrators are cynical and sarcastic, but at the same time earnest and even romantic.  This is an entertaining but difficult combination.  The best proponent was David Foster Wallace, who, not coincidentally, was Franzen's good friend.  If you like DFW's writing, you'll like this book.    4.Morality.  There is the usual liberal moral thrust, especially on the environment, politics, and war.  But Franzen doesn't preach:  his characters do, but while showing the holes in their own logic.  In so doing, Fanzen paints a balanced picture of life.  Both lefties and righties will find their champions (though there are more on the left).    This book doesn't suck.  You'll be hearing about it for many years.

0439023513|5.0|My Thoughts: Well, I've read so many reviews with spoilers after I read the book. I purposely avoided all the new reviews popping up all over the place because I didn't want to be spoiled. So basically this review is going to be short and I am not going to give away major keypoints of the story. It may contain some mini spoilers though. We are back in the world of Katniss and her family/friends/neighbors/so-called friends. She is now living in District 13 with her mom/sister/Gale. Peeta has been captured by the capital. Her spirits have been weakened because Peeta is not around and she feels like its partly her fault. The people of 13 want her to be the mockingjay, the face of the rebellion. The capital is using every tactic to break Katniss down, they are torturing Peeta and showing him on tv broadcasts, they basically destroyed her home in 13. Peeta is not the same either since he's been tortured. It did irk me a little bit that Katniss basically keeps going between both Gale and Peeta. Make up your mind! She also wasn't very nice to Peeta throughout the book even though in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, it was her sole mission to make sure Peeta stayed a live, where was that Katniss? Well, I've heard a lot say they hated the ending. I liked the ending. Yes its not picture perfect and it's not the happiest ending I've ever read but I think it tied the series up nicely. I think either way someone is not going to be happy because she can't end up with both guys (wouldn't that be nice though, LOL)? People die, people mature, people love, people grow up, people betray, I cried, I smiled, and I enjoyed this book very much. The characters I thought would die didn't, the characters I thought would live died. It was very heartbreaking and a roller-coaster of emotions.<br /><br />Overall: I enjoyed Mockingjay. I didn't quite love it as much as The Hunger Games but I did enjoy it just as much but in a different way. I think you just have to appreciate Mockingjay in its own different way than the first two books.<br /><br />Cover: Mockingjay is my favorite cover so far!

0802798225|5.0|My Thoughts:  We are introduced to Brittany, the golden girl and Alex, the boy who everyone is afraid of. Brittany is pretty, popular, has the guy everyone at school wants, she is perfect to everyone. Alex, is a badass, a gang member, a thug. Brittany and Alex couldn't be more opposite, their personalities, their lives, their whole existence but underneath it all, they are more alike then they think. Brittany is from the rich part of town, Alex is from across the tracks. Brittany and Alex get put together as lab partners in chemistry. They despise each other. They want nothing to do with each other. They both have their own set of problems. Brittany is trying to lead her life making everyone think she is perfect, trying to make her boyfriend happy, trying to live up to every one's  expectations while Alex is trying to take care of his family the only way he knows how. Brittany gets under Alex's skin so Alex makes a bet with a friend that he can get into Brittany's pants. But the truth of the matter is, Brittany is a virgin and sex is the last thing on her mind right now.<br /><br />Alex and Brittany spend more time together, fighting, arguing, bickering, while the sexual tension is always on the back burner just waiting to make an appearance. Brittany and Alex both go through so many struggles that is breaks me heart because more than anything I want them to end up together but the problems that lay before them are not easy. They start to care about each other as more than lab partners but they both deny their feelings for each other for a long time. There are side characters to make things interesting as well. Alex ex girlfriend Carmen, his family, and Brittany's friends and family. I was a little wary of Brittany at first because she is the typical snobby rich girl but she grew on me. Now Alex, he was a whole different story. I have a thing for bad boys and him being in a gang (which is not a good thing haha) just adds to his sex appeal. He was so tough on the outside but I knew on the inside he had a big heart. The mention of his tattoos made me blush even more. Through smart comebacks and sassy wit I fell in love with Brittany and Alex as a potential couple.<br /><br />If you want an epic love story that will leave you wanting to savor every page Perfect Chemistry is a hit you'll want to run out to the store to buy as quick as you can!

0439023491|5.0|My Thoughts: I loved this one so much I despised some of it. We are back with Katniss and the gang and this time a rebellion is on the horizon and Katniss fears her and Peeta created it! Of course, they did in a way. Katniss  is back living in district 12, she's still staying in her old house while her family is now in the Victors Village enjoying life a bit more privileged than before. Gale is still around and he seems like he's more angry and resentful to Katniss than he used to be. He had all this time to tell Katniss how he felt yet he just waited to darn long! Peeta is also around but he's barely talking to Katniss  because he basically feels she played him even though he knew her feelings were all just a ploy all along for publicity, but really I think she did feel something towards him; maybe just not die hard love.<br /><br />I didn't feel Catching Fire was as great as The Hunger Games. Mainly, because we had already been through the games once so the second time wasn't as thrilling. Yes, we got to know more of the players this time but I never felt much connection to the new players. I also hated the way they had to go back in so soon after they got out, I wanted to just scream that it had to be now! Give them some time and space to adjust darnit! Most of the time, I just wanted Peeta and Katniss to come out winners again. I did like some of the challenges they faced in the arena again. I wanted them to fall in love; really fall in love and live happily after ever. I can't say much of anything else that hasn't already been said so go read the books now!<br /><br />Overall: Loved it. This series keeps getting better and better! I know my reviews are a little vague on this trilogy but honestly I don't want to ruin the series for anyone!<br /><br />Cover: Like it!

0439023513|3.0|I cried at the end of Mockingjay. Were my tears the kind the author intended to evoke? I'm not sure.<br /><br />Mockingjay (and the trilogy as a whole) paints an absolutely devastating portrait of humanity. The book begins on a dismal note and the horrors only get more intense and explicit as it progresses. These horrors aren't just grisly deaths, although there are plenty of those. The horrors are psychological. Katniss -- our heroine? -- is reduced to a confused, victimized shell, and even her supposedly heroic choice toward the end of the book is tainted with questions as to her real motives.<br /><br />Who is there to root for in the world Collins has created? The bad guys are as bad as ever; the good guys aren't really all that good; and innocent children suffer and die. Katniss herself no longer has the luxury of killing only in the arena, and is reduced to slaughtering whatever stranger gets in her way. (Yet we're supposed to be touched that she can't bring herself to kill a boy she cares for.)<br /><br />War will do that to people. Terrible things happen; people see atrocities and are never the same again. Most don't emerge heroes; they emerge survivors, or they die. Is that what Collins had in mind for Katniss? Is our protagonist only a miserable pawn, playing a role in events she often isn't even there to witness? (One flaw of the book is that while certain big events unfold, Katniss is out of commission, fragile and brooding, only hearing about what has happened.)<br /><br />Readers expecting the ingenuity of the death traps in the previous books will be rewarded with similarly terrible concoctions here, except that this time they're booby traps in the Capitol City -- and I had a very hard time believing that these traps had been engineered into the city streets the way they had been in the arenas. I was able to put that disbelief aside, but it still nagged at me afterwards.<br /><br />What are we left with after reading Mockingjay? War is horrible. Well,yes. Does Collins go on and say that it's only the kindness of people, the goodness of one person here and there, that can pull us through and give us hope? No, she never gives us that satisfaction nor much of any redemption in any form. She leaves us at \\"war is horrible, and it's going to happen again and again, and we'll always be damaged goods.\\" The best she gives us, through the mouth of one oddly chosen character, is that maybe this time will be different and humanity will learn to be at peace, or maybe not.<br /><br />At the end of Mockingjay, I cried, but not because I was touched by the characters or even the story. I cried for my baby son that he's been born into a world in which humanity could be even remotely like what Collins has shown us. It may be true, but what is the point of leaving your reader with nothing but empty hopelessness?
B001S86J0I|5.0|I love this movie so much.<br />I can't explain it. There are so many one liners, so many scenes that are fun to reinact.

B00000AOUD|5.0|Jethro Tull's 5th album Thick As A Brick is a masterpiece of early 70's progressive rock. Of course it was designed to be a parody of the genre which by 1972 had become the leading genre in rock alongside glam/glitter. The band had broken big the year before with Aqualung, which critics labeled a concept album because of its thematic elements dealing with religion and whatnot. Although it was not a concept album Ian Anderson was taken back by it and decided he would give them a concept album and it would be \\"the mother of all concept albums\\". It ended up being a single song 45 minutes in length, split over 2 sides of the LP. It was interesting because Tull had largely been a underground band before Aqualung and somehow they were now superstars, injecting folk elements into their unique rock sound, Aqualung crystalized a more commercial sound with the dirty but catchy riff of famous title track/radio staple. Thick ended up being their most successul regular album (not counting compilations).    The album itself is a conceptual epic, filled with themes on soceity, culture and religion, too complex to explain in a review. It's something the listener must seek out for themselves, but musically its really a journey, of course its everything you expect if youre familar with bloated early 70's prog rock, multi sections, lots of structured sections, lots of non rock instruments like harpsicords, xylophones, lots of piano and keyboard but even still the guitar and drum work is quite nice. Many acoustic passages as well. And of course many time changes. It's an all encompassing work and might be Tull's best album musically. Whats interesting where other bands like Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer's albums might've bored the obvious rock listener this album somehow manages to not be as overwhelming as those bands epics were. The changes of mood, emotion, and thought the music evokes is not so much more simplistic or mainstream but more manageable. Tull never took pieces of classical compisitions like ELP or Yes which probably made them more acceptable to the common rock fan, much like Rush. Tull continued to do the side long concept album a few more records down the road but it never worked as well as this LP does. The opening acoustic riff is the most catchy part and its reprised for a quite grandoise closing segment where a beautiful but brief string section drops in. With all the madness going on for nearly 40 min, when that orignial riff chimes back it evokes quite a celebratory feel. The music in detail from section to section can go from happy, melodic and vibrant to hazy and somewhat dissonant but always busy. There's never a quite moment in the piece at all, there are so many things going on one part flows into another so smoothly which is really what makes it all work, there's no disjointedness here.    For fans who wanted more than sex drugs and rock n roll with their music and were into the story book aspect of prog rock which reigned supreme from 68-74, this is a towering achievement even though it was deigned to be a smirking yet illustrious effort from Anderson. The newspaper design of the original LP was classic and although the art is abridged into a booklet for the CD it doesnt really capture the feel. But thats something for serious collectors who really want a time capsule to seek out. If you like big indulgent prog rock, this is a must hear.
B003A9OVS0|4.0|With the release of Plastic Beach, Gorillaz has definitely diverged from the sound of previous albums. Plastic Beach is a noteworthy album in its own right but unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired.    The album is peppered with featured artists.  This gives a lot of variety to the tracks but really inhibits the album's cohesiveness.    Some of the rap and instrumental pieces aren't that great and feel like filler for the really solid songs.  Rhinestone Eyes is probably the first track that resounded with me.  Its detached, half-spoken vocals invoke the melancholy of a plastic society.    Stylo is another good track - probably the darkest-sounding track on the album.  Its fast pace is a nice complement to the slower ballad of Rhinestone Eyes.    I like the heavy irony in Superfast Jellyfish; the over-the-top-pop feel pokes good fun at modern convenience culture.  The mix of the chorus, rapped verse and miscellaneous sound bites is sometimes annoying, but usually pretty good.  All in all it's a nice track.    Empire Ants starts out slowly with a pleasant transition into Little Dragon.  Not earth-shattering but a nice track.  The switch from slow ocean sounds to dance beats is an enjoyable move.    Glitter Freeze is basically an instrumental track with a slightly harsh electronic sound.  I like the track a lot, and feel like I've gone on a boat ride to the plastic beach every time I listen to it.    On Melancholy Hill is my favorite track on the album.  The track maintains the vocal sound of other Gorillaz tracks but the rest of the song is very poppy, consonant and mellow.  It fits right into the pop song formula and comes out a success.    The title track, Plastic Beach, makes a timely return to the quiet gloom of Rhinestone Eyes.  The lyrics are a bit weird but catchy.  A nice song.    Pirate Jet is a decent song.  Sort of catchy and I like the lyrical ideas.  Unfortunately it still leaves something to be desired.    The other half of the album doesn't really seem worth going into much detail.  I felt most of the songs were just filler and kind of half-baked.    In conclusion, the album has a good concept and some good, solid songs, but an unfortunate amount of mediocre tracks.  I'm definitely pleased to own some of the songs but annoyed to have the others.

The book achieves 2 things- 1) An elegant explaination of creation by scientific laws, 2) Essentially reduces all known religions to nothing more than \\"beliefs\\" and simply unnecessary to explain the universe.

0894803123|5.0|This is one of the most adorable little cookbooks I have ever seen. It has the cutest artwork, in keeping with most of the Ben and Jerry's ice cream designs on their cartons. It has a cute story in the beginning which explains how they started in the business and became successful. It's a cool story. In the beginning of the book they explain different techniques. For example, if you are using fruit they tell you which fruit to add sugar to and which ones not to. There is a section for their Top ten flavors, then some fruit recipes, chocolate, of course, and frozen yogurt and other treats like cakes and cookies. They have three cream base recipes and number one is their most popular and that's the one I have been using with a lot of success. I made the chocolate chip cookie dough recipe and I thought it tasted almost 100% like the real thing. Maybe even better because it was so fresh. (For reference I use the Cuisinart IC-30 stainless steel 2 quart ice cream maker)For $10 this is a must-have for anyone that owns an ice cream maker. The recipes are simple and yield great, tasty ice cream.
B0000509C4|4.0|Masters of Horror Stephen King and George A. Romero return to deliver more comic book style thrills in \\"Creepshow 2.\\" With original \\"[[ASIN:0790744295 Creepshow]]\\" cinematographer Michael Gornick stepping in as director, the film is not only slimmer on content (three stories instead of five) but on budget and star-power as well. That doesn't mean that horror fans aren't in for a heaping serving of campy carnage candy, though. In tradition with the original, \\"Creepshow\\" is hellbent on making its viewers laugh and squirm in their seats simultaneously.<br /><br />While Gornick is no George A. Romero, he certainly brings a touch of style to the film that serves it well. Animated segments aside, the look and tone of the original is carried over into its sequel, with some surprisingly flashy moments that make one wonder why the director fell off the face of the Earth (you know, aside from the fact that this flick flopped). The script, penned by Romero, has its ups and downs, with some stories being more effective and more competent than others. Variety, however, is the key to the film's success. If one thing can be said about this affair, it is that it never bores and it certainly goes by quickly enough. In fact, some would say the fun ends far too early.<br /><br />The three stories are a mixed bag of creepy and goofy, with the first concerning a wooden Indian propped outside of a small-town general store. When local punks rob its kindly owners, the statue comes to life seeking revenge. This bit is rather slow moving and sets the movie off on the wrong foot. Although not terrible by any means, it is in sharp contrast to the two that follow. Next up, we follow a foursome of guys and gals going for a swim in a secluded lake. Soon they find themselves being feasted upon by what can only be described as an oil slick surrounded by a Hefty bag. Of the three, this is probably the strongest, with some genuinely creepy moments and terrific special effects. Then, to wrap things up, we find a woman of questionable morals being stalked on the highway by a drifter she accidentally hit. While his insistence on thanking her for the ride makes him seem harmless enough, the woman quickly slips into madness as she tries to rid herself of the passenger to no avail. This is the one segment most likely to induce a few unintentional chuckles for its ridiculously over-the-top premise and execution.<br /><br />Overall, there's a noticeable drop in quality from the first, but the sense of dread and humor is still intact. \\"Creepshow 2\\" is certainly a worthy sequel with a few moments of brilliance that may have panned out better in feature length films. \\"The Raft,\\" in particular, would have been a great 80's teen monster movie in the vein of the remake of \\"The Blob\\" that would roll into theaters a year later. Taken for what it is, though, this sequel is like a bag of Halloween candy -- some hits, some misses, but certainly worth the time regardless.n of questionable morals being stalked on the highway by a drifter she accidentally hit.

030745455X|5.0|I could hardly wait to get my hands on this after devouring \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" in a 24-hour period.  The characters are picked up where they left off, with Salander now a world-traveling billionaire and Blomkvist back at his beloved Millennium newspaper.  The story this time around revolves around a journalist and his girlfriend who are murdered on the eve of exposing many high-ranking and public Swedish officials in a sex trafficking scandal.  They are murdered and Lisbeth Salander is the main suspect.  Blomkvist and her mentor Dragan Armansky are convinced of her innocence and set about proving so.<br /><br />This book delves further into Lisbeth Salander's mysterious and damaged psyche.  We learn the root of \\"all the Evil\\" that was referenced in the first book as well as the mystery of her family.  It's all delicious and makes for one hell of a ride!
B003LL3NOK|2.0|Since the resurgence of the zombie genre with films like \\"[[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]\\" and Zack Snyder's remake of \\"[[ASIN:B0002ABURA Dawn of the Dead]],\\" George A. Romero -- undisputed Grandfather of the zombie genre -- has come out of the woodwork once every few years to try and either capitalize on or define the current undead movement. In spite of his best intentions, however, he has failed where he has succeeded oh so many times before. First, with \\"[[ASIN:B00005JO16 Land of the Dead]],\\" which in spite of being a surprisingly strong return to form, turned out to be a commercial dud, leading into the low-budget reboot of sorts with \\"[[ASIN:B0013D8LA4 Diary of the Dead]],\\" a \\"[[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]\\" spin on the material that only served to smudge Romero's legacy rather than breathe new life into it. This of course serves as the lead-in to his equally underwhelming new opus, \\"Survival of the Dead.\\"<br /><br />Like \\"Diary of the Dead,\\" \\"Survival\\" was born of a potentially great idea. Continuing where we left off in the previous film, the undead are slowly taking over the globe. On a remote island off the coast of Delaware, two families are finding ways to cope in spite of their bitter rivalry. One aims to vanquish any and all zombie inhabitants, while the other strives to domesticate and educate them. Naturally, this leads to heavy gun-play and lots (and I mean lots) of badly rendered CGI gore. While this concept is certainly a breath of fresh air, it is hampered by poor execution. Obviously limited by its budget, the film can't help but look and feel cheap. What really brings it down, though, isn't the bad cinematography nor the bad blood (ahem), but rather, the dull script that lacks focus and a clear vision. Whether Romero takes his material seriously or not is never made clear, and in the end, you'll find yourself chuckling at the ridiculous nature of it all instead of chilled to the bone by its characters and their actions. The actors are so wooden and the characters so clich&eacute;d and silly that they make their supporting undead stars seem more realistic and interesting by comparison. Is that the fisherman from \\"[[ASIN:B00005ML6Y The Simpsons]]\\" leading one of the clans? It might as well be.<br /><br />While Romero can never be accused of making the same film twice, it must be noted that his best days are obviously behind him. While no one can expect him to deliver another \\"[[ASIN:B0001611DI Dawn of the Dead]],\\" I think it's safe to say that no one could have expected him to fall so far from grace.

The story and characters are both complex and layered but handled masterfully.  Lisbeth Salander is and utterly fascinating leading lady, absolutely riveting and completely unapologetic.  She is the kind of character that none of us know in real life, and we're not sure we would want to. She is brash, moral, complex, angry, flawed, and brilliant.  Blomkvist is the perfect complement.  He is also flawed and brilliant, and the forces that conspire to bring these two together are awesome.<br /><br />Blomkvist is hired by an eccentric millionaire to write his family's complex biography, but with the secret mission of finding the man's niece, lost to him 40 years ago.  Blomkvist is a fallen and disgraced journalist, having written an unsubstantiated article about the financial corruption of a billionaire.  He decides to leave his newspaper for a sabbatical of sorts to give the scandal a chance to die down.  He accepts the offer from Henrik Vanger, thinking the whole time that he will be able to make no headway.  What he finds will change him and everyone around him forever.

0446691437|5.0|The War of Art is an amazing book. The more times I read it, the more I gather from it. Pressfield tells it like it is, sometimes using expressive language, and always writes as though he is right there with you, talking directly to you in simple, layman's English. You WILL find yourself moved by this book in some way, I guarantee it. You can read it straight through or read a page at a time. The titles for every mini-chapter (1 to a handful of pages) make it easy to pick up this book and thumb through it, gathering just the nugget of information you need for the day. And this book is completely filled with nuggets of gold. I have no doubt whatsoever that my drive has been greatly improved by continuously browsing this book. It is short enough so that you can continually peruse its pages, yet it is never lacking. He has an uncanny ability to wake up your inner-self, to enliven your emotions, to MOVE you in some way, shape or form. He does this by kicking you in the ass with his words and manners.    How many successful men and women has Pressfield helped create? How many worldly improvements has this book helped along their way? We'll never know, but it doesn't matter. All that matters is that we push on this day, guided by Pressfield's light and words.    This book is easily worth every penny and is definite must for anyone who wants to work hard for what they want.
0553805371|5.0|\\"Philosophy is dead.\\"<br /><br />That, to say the least, was ungracious!<br /><br />Actually, one might go further, and argue that it would be an elementary error in all forms of scientific epistemology not to treat physics and philosophy as one continuous entity. Indeed, I have often found that physicists do not always understand their own science.  In many ways this books appears to be an argument rather than a deployment of the evidence.  Nor is the exploration of space and time a purely scientific issue. For even if a scientific solution accounts for the structure of the universe, its quantum-mechanical symptoms nevertheless arise from mental processes, corroborating the direct effects of knowledge on our physical experience. Indeed, it is the irreducible predicament of a major technological species in its last stages of intellectual development, that its powerful urge to comprehend is somehow causally related to its own mode of being.<br /> Hence, that which presently dominates the research programmes and main funding of theoretical physicists as 'M-theory' is a self-perpetuating cul-de-sac; a hypothesis without end. Come to think of it, my own book, published today,  is  what I might reasonably have called A Philosopher's Guide to the Crisis of Modern Physics. The parallels are uncanny. Hawking is right about one thing though. Neither by the grace of God nor by intelligent design, but by the overmastering control of logical necessity, the Big Bang permits us, quite methodically, to consider the creation ex nihilo of human knowledge.  Space and time defined in this way obey all the laws of logical necessity, and it is a perfectly absurd notion to assume that an initial system which was cumulatively generating necessary consequences, should have been caused by anything other than itself.<br /><br />So, does this mean that God does not exist?<br /><br />Quite why such a nonsensical claim was ever made is entirely beyond me. To solve the epistemological paradox of a universe with no edge in space, no beginning or end in time, lies not within the scope of theoretical physics, needless to say.  It's Monty Python's idea of a God. Indeed, the irresolvable quantum uncertainty of the atom tells us that 'God' has its origin, not in any special mechanism of nature, but in the mechanics of the mind. So far from being of itself, the universe is 'man-made'; its order and harmony, structure, symmetry and extension are anthropic increments. Anthropomorphous but not human - man's conception but more than man. Let's face it folks, one is the alter ego of the other!<br /><br />V.H.IRONSIDEspace, no beginning or end in time, lies not within the scope of theoretical physics, needless to say.

0439023483|3.0|I have only read the first book, but I am interested in reading more though I have to get this off my chest.<br /><br />In the first book, _The Hunger Games_, we are introduced to a society that is similar or at least recognizable to own.  People still have to work; there is school and coal mining and other existent industries.  Nevertheless, there are huge differences.  America as we know it has ceased to exist.  Instead, the area that we know as North America is divided up into thirteen different districts strongly answerable to a central government at the Capitol.  Each of these districts has been set up in a fairly strict division of labor -each has its own industry outside of the general survival-level services: there is a coal-mining district, an agricultural district, a luxury goods district.  If district 12, the area we know most intimately, is in any way representative, the areas are small.  District 12 has only 8,000 residents.  If that is just an average, we can assume only 96,000 non-Capitol residents supporting the Capitol in their divided labor.<br /><br />The life in the districts is Hobbesian: nasty, poor, brutish, and short.  Katniss, the heroine, has essentially raised her sister and her mom since her father died.  (It would not quite be children's literature if there were strong responsible parental figures around, would it).  The residents seem to be prisoners of their district.  There is little leisure, and little even electronic idiot-box stimulation of any kind as there is spotty electricity.  They certainly cannot go on holiday as their meager existence is surely scrapped by.  Even if they wished to wander, they are caged in to the district.<br /><br />Aside from the quite literal prison nature of their existence, there are two strong forms of social control the Capitol exerts.  First, the reader is told that only twelve of the actual districts are inhabited.  There was once a district thirteen that must have been uppity so the Capitol incinerated the district.  If I remember, it is still smoking and polluting the downwind districts.  If you miss that, they play footage of the district on the television from time to time.  The second is that every year a male child and a female child must fight to the death in the annual \\"Hunger Games,\\" the central element of the book.<br /><br />This is the part that strains my credulity and kept me asking \\"Why\\" and \\"How\\"?  The reader of the book does not know enough of the back-story to know about the implementation of the games or the make-up of the central authority.  The early exposition is clumsy, forced, and unnatural.

Whatever reason, it does not work for me and had I not already bought the second two books in the series I may have abandoned the text.  I am glad I did not because I decided that you just had to ignore the logic for the time being.  I wanted it to be something like Paulsen's Hatchet, but I decided it was better to accept the logic lain out by the author.

Collins writes action well and the pages started turning with abandon.  However, there was still the nagging doubt about whether the central concern I have would be resolved.

0786956291|5.0|This is the best introductory product ever for the gaming phenomenon on which all other \\"fantasy role playing\\" tabletop, individual computer and online games have been based.  Instead of individuals winning and losing, characters with widely varying abilities work together to accomplish meaningful tasks, within defined rules but with an emphasis on creative thinking.  The theme that a few ordinary, good people can truly make a difference is central, and from its beginning D&D characters have actually defined themselves in terms of their morals and ethics.  The current edition of the game (the fourth in an evolving system) begins with the premise that the players are individual \\"points of light\\" trying to do right in a world full of wrong.  The game presents no danger to people who are able to distinguish fantasy from reality, and who can limit time devoted to a hobby to what they can afford.  Professionals have written about the value of a well-conducted D&D game in teaching social and math skills and creative thinking.     This \\"red box\\" contains everything that a new group needs to begin -- dice, boards, playing pieces, cards, and introductory rulebooks that -- like the best teachers -- focus on active learning, clarity, and immediate rewards.  For its price, it is the best D&D value ever.  Experienced 4th-edition gamers may welcome the new rules modifications (more choice in racial ability bonuses, partial effects for wizard encounter powers, the \\"human versatility\\" ability).  Beginners will no longer find learning to play confusing or frustrating.  Thanks, Wizards.... and may your own dice come up 20's!

0316743003|5.0|What a great book. It details the saga of America's leading aerospace corporation, its rise to technological excellence and financial success is to a large extent the story of how an extraordinarily gifted and at times overbearing aeronautical engineer helped to transform a meager airplane manufacturer into the world's most formidable air and space powerhouse. Mr Rich argued successfully to install a twin tail on the Electra airliner, thereby improving its stability. He continued infuencing designs at the company for the next forty years. The revolutionary World War II fighter, the P-38, the first operational American jet, the P-80, the high-flying spyplane, the U-2, and the ultra-fast reconnaissance platform, the SR-71, all emanated from the fertile mind. The legacy of this design genius is to be found in the Skunk Works' output since Johnson's departure -- the incredible F-117A Stealth Fighter, the Air Force's next generation air dominance fighter, the F-22 Raptor, and the X-33, which is a prototype of the Venture Star spacecraft destined to replace the aging and costly Space Shuttle. In the 576 pages of this opus, Rich superbly weaves Johnson's intriguing story into the mosaic of both the corporate history of Lockheed and the chronicle of twentieth century airpower. This masterful book provides the insight necessary to understand what made the Skunk Works and its parent organization the leading players in the aerospace industry. Rich asserts that the people carrying on the work of Kelly Johnson aim beyond the horizons and we should be grateful for that. And we should also be grateful that a distinguished aviation historian like Mr Rich has so accurately and comprehensively recorded such an important slice of aerospace development.

The paperbacks tend to bend and distort the images and it is much more pleasurable to view the depth of the images when the photo itself is rigid. Look for page size. This book has a good page size and you can move the photo in and out to arms length with certain images will have an apparent depth of up to 8 feet. One book, recommended by another reviewer on this page, I own in a paperback with small pages, yes the artwork is excellent but the depth of the photo appears to be 6-12 inches in most cases.

I am afraid because I rented the first disc of this show, I became hooked. Now I have only seen the first 5 episodes on Standard DVD. Right after I finished those 5 episodes I immediately ordered The 1st season of The Vampire Dairies on Blu-Ray.     What drew me to the show where the 3 lead characters Stefan(Paul Wesley), Damon (Ian Somerhalder)and Elena Gilbert(Nina Dobrev)  I have seen Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder in smaller roles throughout the year. Paul Wesley was in the 2nd Season of Everwood and he was also on the last season of 24. Ian Somerhalder I watched through Lost but his character on the show was short lived. I also seen him in Smallville. These two finally get a show together that show of their true acting abilities. Stefan and Damon are brothers and one does not want to feed and the other does. They have a feud over each other because they both fell in love with a girl who they both lost. Stefan is drawn to the Nina Dobrev's character, Elena as she slowly starts to be suspicious of both of them and starts to see signs that Stefan is hiding from her.     This is a great show and I am looking forward to finishing this season on blu-ray and hopefully I can catch up before the new season starts.  Paul
0307593525|4.0|I bought these for my mom for mother's day because Julie and Julia is one of her favorite movies. We were both very excited until we opened the books. My favorite part about cookbooks are the pictures, and this book had almost none. It ended up being more of a \\"how-to\\" book, rather than a recipe book. A little bit of a let down, but a good cook book nonetheless.
B003LL3NOK|1.0|If I watched this movie 20 years ago, I would have thought it a decent zombie flick.  But after the releases of films such as \\"I am Legend\\" and \\"ZombieLand\\", I can only say that this movie is garbage.  The storyline is simple enough to be gleaned from amazon's product description.  The dialogue is horrible, on par with that of an after-school play.  The acting is bad, the action scenes look so fake.  To give an example of the stupidity of this movie, there is a scene where a zombie takes a bite from the side of a healthy, full-size adult horse.  The horse proceeds to lie down for other zombies to eat it.  Try biting a horse sometime and see what the horse does to you.  A scared adult horse can run over or kick over lots of people before it tires and collapses.    Overall, a crappy movie and a waste of your time to watch it.

B00086P1JG|5.0|Virginia Woolf is one of the modern writers who changed writing not just in degree, but in substance. She even said explicitly (in the Common Reader) what she does, only so very few pay attention: The sentence must (I paraphrase here) imitate the same order of sensations as they fall on the human brain. This is what Flaubert did without knowing how or why, and what Hemingway did consciously (though he never explained what he was doing), and what Conrad, even Waugh (Evelyn, that is), and many others did after. But Virginia Woolf was one of the originals. Her book mixes all sorts of sensations, from a woman's PoV, so we have description, and auditory and sight and thinking, all connected thematically, leading to the soft denouement. Yes, she still operates somewhat by instinct, unlike Conrad who (I think) knew more explicitly that suppression of all sensations save one give the impression of shock, and that the sense of smell should be used sparingly, since it is it the most potent (the olfactory nerve goes straight into the brain, without any pre-processing), or Joyce (who knew exactly what's what-- see the famous girl-at-the-shore from Artist as a Young Man). But Woolf did marvels with the smattering beginnings of the modern writing technique that she could see, and Lighthouse is a marvelous example of it. Later on would come others-- just see what Flannery O'Connor does with modern technique, let alone Nabokov (in Lolita), Laxness, and other modern masters. But Woolf was at the birth of modern writing, and no one should miss her work. Warmly and wholeheartedly recommended.  AM
B002VZC9CY|5.0|I have listened to this CD multiple times both by myself and with my kids, and I also had the pleasure of seeing Natalie perform a lot of these songs live in concert.  Each time I hear the songs, I gain more appreciation for what an amazing accomplishment this is.  To set all of these poems to music, and beautiful, unique music is something not just anyone can do.  To those of those who only prefer the poppy, top 40 music that Natalie produced in the past, don't buy this album, but if you want something more deep and something that you can get new joy out of each time you listen to it, then definitely buy it!
6304025831|4.0|In some ways, Scorsese's most entertaining and interesting film, close in approach to Goodfellas, as it is seen through the eyes of a main character: previously, Henry Hill, here, \\"Sam Rothstein\\".<br /><br />Problems in character development and believability: as sensational as Sharon Stone is in this film, her character is oddly schizophrenic. She is completely in control as the Vegas socialite, who has Casinos wrapped up in the palms of both hands, but she is wildly erratic as an alchoholic and naive do-gooder. She is all about money and extravagance but when offered the chance to be the wife of a Casino owner, she asserts her independence.<br /><br />If she's spaced out on drugs how is she able to morph instantaneously into the perfect host?<br /><br />In this Reviewers' opinion, with Casino, we have Robert DeNiro's greatest performance. He too is schizophrenic, as he is the street tough in one scene and the sensitive, vulnerable \\"contemporary\\" man. But if his character is perhaps not fully developed, his range is amazing. He's compelling as hard driven businessman<br />and \\"laeding man\\" romantic, in some excellent scenes with Stone.<br /><br />Joe Pesci is the third actor who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, though his character seems more rooted to New York than Kansas City. Scorsese gives him alot of camera - his fascination with \\"Nicky\\" is obvious. The three main charcaters are violent but his is never contained. He has no deliberative skills...just street skills for any occasion.<br /><br />Another issue is that among the main characters, there is no character with whom we can fully sympathize, other than Sam, when he fears that his daughter is being corrupted by his wife; there are also fleeting moments when true friendship or concern is expressed: Nicky scolds Sam's wife when she implies he should do harm to Sam, on her behalf; she cries real tears when she reflects on the punishment inflicted on her childhood friend.<br /><br />Not to give away the ending, but I found that Mrs. Rothstein's fall a bit too steep, considering her intelligence and survival skills.<br /><br />Movie about 10 minutes too long with alot of music echoing the '50-'60s New York area and not the Disco era. I do not associate doo-wop with middle-aged Mid-westerners in the '70s.too steep, considering her intelligence and survival skills.

0312370849|5.0|This books makes me wish I taught older kids - ones old enough to read this book.  My students are around 9 so Sarah's Key would be too much, but I hope that when they do get to high school that they have an English teacher or a History teacher who assigns this book so that more American kids can learn about this sad chapter in history and that they might learn a little more appreciation for just how good they have it!    As a mother, I can't imagine having my children ripped from my very grasp.  This book gave me nightmares (really -  some bad person was grabbing kids and my son was one of them - shivers!!!)  but I still couldn't put it down.
0743298039|5.0|Though I'm an avid reader, it is not often that a book truly excites me and it is even more rare for one to leave a lasting impression on me over time. Many books are enjoyable but a select few are memorable. The Thirteenth Tale was a gorgeously written, subtle, wise and interesting novel meant for any fan of reading. It is truly a book for book lovers. I read it over a year ago and the story still sticks with me, as I often find myself thinking back to it. It has a sort of nostalgic feel to it that's easy to become a part of and cozy up to. What's so great about this novel is that the story is quite unique, completely engrossing, yet understated and quiet it tone and beyond the story, you truly feel involved with the characters, who are interesting studies on their own. This is not a book to be missed-- it holds a special place in my collection as one of the very best.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|What a page turner!  Well constructed and written ( and congratulations to the translator too).  One of those books that when you decide you must turn out the light when you get to the end of the chapter, Larsson hooks you in to start the next one and tell your partner that you haven't got there yet!  Can easily see why it's made the Top Seller List.
0439023483|5.0|Brilliant plot & memorable characters. Witty, fun, heart-wrenching, inspiring. Top 5 book of all time.
0393068382|5.0|Great book. I've always been annoyed by the constant \\"claims\\" that are made about men and women either being identical or totally different because I've never seen a book (until now) that described the science behind these claims. Both sets of claims have always seemed to be driven by an agenda. So I haven't known what to think.    What I loved about this book is that it was very funny, but also gave an amazingly good summary of what we know  (and don't know) about the differences between men and women. Dr. Fine makes her point of view clear, but she gave me enough information for me to judge the science for myself. While I didn't agree with everything she said I finally feel like I do have some idea about what claims about the differences between men and women are true, and which are totally bogus. Finally!
0439023513|1.0|I placed the first two books in my top 10 category. They were brilliant to say the least. I fell in love with the characters and could not decide myself -Peeta or Gale. After reading Mockingjay, I felt so numb I had to remind myself why I even bothered pushing through this book. Katniss does not mature in this story, instead declines as a character. She has no true \\"hero\\" moments with inspiring statements or thoughts and is mentally absent throughout this book that I feel that there is no point. Worse of all, the entire Peeta/Gale situation is so disappointing that I question if there was anything there to begin with. Katniss is made out to be helpless and heartless from beginning to end that I no longer cared for her. I was hoping for a happy ending, and again was completely put off by the lack of tenderness and any tying of loose ends for the love triangle. Gale was completely cut out with no explanation and Peeta never had a warm arms-wide-open welcoming from the too-numbed-to-live Katniss. No rainbows and happily ever afters here... pure depression that only brought me down and put me in a bad mood for days. I truly wish this book was nonexistent.
B000J103N4|5.0|From the very first time I played this album on my turntable back when it was originally released, this has been one of my all-time favorites, something I never get tired of listening to from beginning to end because each time is a dreamlike journey. The advantage of it being on CD is that you don't have to get up and flip the record to the other side!    Back when the album first came out, I don't recall it getting very good reviews. As I read over the reviews on Amazon, it's nice to know that this great work had as profound an effect on others as it did me, and that so many people think it is brilliant. I certainly do. There's really no other album like it. To me, some of Pat Metheny's works are in a similar vein but just not the same.    I don't have anything to add about the individual songs that hasn't already been mentioned but I wanted to add my review as a tribute to this album.  It's an incredible musical experience, and playing it today is as fresh as doing so nearly 40 years ago.    Edit: Be aware that the audio quality of the rerelease is a lot louder and more in-your-face than the original CD or the vinyl version.
0062004352|5.0|Finally! Finally! Finally! A romance novel in which the heroine ends up with someone cool, instead of some slathering, muscle-bound dude who really digs money and cars. Five stars just for the inclusion of a hot, indie band dude from Brooklyn. Big ups, Ms. Kelk.    I'm not hugely into chick lit, but Lindsey Kelk doesn't write like your average chick lit author. She's witty, caustic and hilarious. Yeah, Angela -- the heroine -- has her hang-ups and vulnerable moments, but that's part of her charm. You can relate to her, yet live vicariously through her all the same.    Yeah, the book is not wholly believable, but that's the definition of escapism, right? Can't wait to escape into the rest of Kelk's wholly enjoyable novels.
B000C20VPA|5.0|This movie is a must see for anyone who considers themselves a movie junkie... Lets face it, most movies that are released today come from the same monotonous formula that consists of little substance for an ever less attentive society, so if one wants to see a good film, one must dig from the past. This movie has De Niro and Pesci at one of their best performances. For anyone who enjoys the mafia theme this will not disappoint.
0545265355|5.0|Nice hardcover set with a cardboard case. Feel sturdy enough, though.  The books themselves are amazing - I'll be reading them again soon.  Book 2 had some printing issues - the type was slanted slightly, so I felt a little off-kilter as I read. Not a huge deal, but made the whole thing feel a little cheaper.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|At first I had no idea the X41's were gonna work or not. I had read other reviews and had not been convinced they were gonna do what was expected of them. And for the price tag on the headset, I was really unsure but I took a chance... and it payed off. This headset is great. I don't have much experience with surround sound headsets but I have to say I'm very pleased with turtle beach. I didn't expect these to actually create a good surround effect since they only have two  speakers but they work very nicely. I play games like call of duty and they work fantastic. I can hear an enemy sneaking up behind me (whether I get the chance to turn around and kill him in time is a whole other story). In big maps you can hear gunshots from far away that you sometimes can't even make out on a surround system unless you have the volume full blast. I play other games like resident evil 5 and final fantasy 13. For these games and movies alike you might not be completely satisfied with the performance but you can't expect everything to work as good as a real surround sound. The only problem the x41's have with these types of cinematic games and movies is the ambient sounds get lost within the rest of the noise coming from the center and front left and right channels. If you're not a surround enthusiast then this shouldn't bother you in the least bit. The x41's are also great for night gaming or watching movies while everyone else is asleep. Even if you use the headset function at night they are great. With the mic monitoring you actually don't have to yell cuz if you can hear yourself then more than likely so will your teammates (unless you forgot to take the mic of mute). The mic does have to be connected to the controller through a cable but if you're playing a videogame this shouldn't be a problem. And unless you're watching a movie while in a party the headset allows you to go from the living room to the kitchen to get a drink or something without any wires constricting your movements. I do have to add that I haven't really noticed the battery life on these. To start off, I got myself 4 AAA energizer rechargeable batteries. I keep 2 batteries charging (or in reserve) until the headset gives up the ghost and needs new ones. In heavy use I only have to change the batteries every other day (heavy use for me is over 8 hrs of gameplay straight). Now, if you're a bass endthusiast you may not like the bass in this headset. It's not gonna sound natural like a sub but it does give a good kick. Better than just regular headphones anyways. The RCA ports in the back of the base are great for attaching an MP3 player or another device that does not produce surround sound like your camcorder or PC (though I did have trouble at first with a really nasty and unnerving hum from my PC which I still don't know how I fixed). I had read some reviews that said they had trouble with getting their system to receive 5.1 from the base if their tv was connected to it but I have had no such problem. I have a 37\\" Vizio with my 360 connected straight to it by HDMI. From there I have the S/PDIF (optical) out going into the headset base and again out to the surround sound system. Full 5.1 from movies and games alike. I also have my time warner cable box (with HD) connected through HDMI and again full surround sound. The front port for an extra pair of headphones is great too. I have studio style headphones I use on my PC for recording music and they have really big speakers. I used these with that headphone port and I thought they sounded almost identical to the wireless headset. It was amazing. I also have some really nice headphones ($60 Sony) I use for my MP3 and I wasn't as amazed. Maybe it had something to do with the size of the speakers in the headphones themselves? Hmm... All in all great product. I would recommend this to anyone who plays lots of multiplayer games (like Halo: Reach comming out next week) or just likes to game at night without waking up the wifeand kids (or mother depending on your situation). They sound great and they are now cheaper than what I bought them for, I believe. If you've got the means and you're really looking for that little extra for night gaming then look no further. The x41's are a great surround headset you just can't live without.and kids (or mother depending on your situation). They sound great and they are now cheaper than what I bought them for, I believe.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|\\"The American\\" is a superbly crafted, visually captivating and subtle character driven drama with an incredibly 70's European style and sensibility. Be warned those looking for an action filled generic thriller will be severely disappointed. This is an artful character study about a troubled assassin nearing the end of what we can tell to be a long career. The general tone of the film mirrors that of the characters personality, a tense and emotionally reserved perfectionist. There is not too much emotion through much of the film because like its main character it is hard for him and the film to open up, or let anyone in. This is probably the most suspenseful film I have seen this year. It becomes hard to trust anyone he meets and I found myself becoming just as paranoid as he was at times. The performances were all wonderful, this was the most reserved I have seen Clooney since \\"Syriana\\". He played the character with such subtly and depth. I thought the end was fantastic. I felt it was the only fitting conclusion to this story. Although this ending isn't the most original, with the help of Corbijn's meticulous story telling and Clooney's performance I found it to be quite upsetting.    I can completely understand why some do not like this film but I absolutely loved it. I thought it was so fascinating and so well crafted. It was shot so beautifully and felt so much like it could have been a film by Jean-Pierre Melville. I can easily understand any comparison to \\"Le Samourai\\" because they really are very similar. I couldn't disagree more with what a lot of critics have said about this but I can understand that is just isn't for everyone. For me, it is easily the best film I have seen so far this year.
B003Y3BSSS|4.0|Chloe Thurlow does it again! She is fast becoming my favourite writer. No-one seems to write erotica as if its a 'proper' book, except for Chloe. There is an excellent story as well as the well written, beautifully steamy interludes as our heroine gets up to her naughty tricks. More please Chloe! xx
B002L5GQGY|4.0|I am not easily impressed, but Bonamassa really pulls the stops out here and produces a very powerful set. The guy has a superb powerful tone (one of the best I have heard - although of course this is as much a credit to the recording engineer as to him in this case). This is one of the best blues-rock DVDs I have seen.     I don't give it five stars because (and I have said this before) I find his original songs to be less interesting and in my opinion a little melodically weak. There is nothing wrong with them, but they do not grip me. They are great to watch once or twice, but I find I then tend to skip to his awe-inspiring covers with some sense of relief. You will be lucky to ever see anyone touch his \\"So many roads\\", for example.    Of course, all the ridiculous one-upmanship of the guitar community can be on show for these kinds of reviews. Is he an innovator like Eric Clapton or Peter Green or SRV? No he is not, but that is not his fault - and if he was he would not be playing electric guitar he'd be Moby or some such. JB is a great player and certainly takes his playing from Eric Clapton/Peter Green/Mick Taylor rather than SRV - it would also be rather difficult to imagine a more different player to him than Jeff Beck.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is a review for THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE (1948) dby John Houston. Adapted from a novel by B. Travern.  THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE concerns some down on their luck American drifters in Mexico looking for a chance at making some real money.<br /><br />Two Americans run into a third, an old timer,  who knows quite a bit about looking for gold.<br />They two younger men, Fred C. Dobbs played by Humphrey Bogart and Bob Curtain played by Tim Holt eventually raise enough money to stake the expedition as outlined by the old timer, Howard, played by Walter Huston.<br /><br />Once they get everything together they hit the road and soon the younger fellows find they can just barely keep up with the more exoerienced old timer.<br />After weeks of hard traveling they eventually hit on a mountain that has a healthy vein of gold in it and start to mining.  The trouble is keeping things quiet and to themselves.  Eventually they have an encounter with another American and finally with a Mexican bandit crew led by the notorious \\"Goldhat,\\" played by Alfonso Bedoyo.<br /><br />All three American prospectors survive these intrusions and finally decide that they have enough gold to last them for the rest of their lives. Now all they have to do is get the gold back to market and avoid the same pitfalls they have endured while encamped which turns out to be easier said than done.<br />THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE is one of the classics of the forties and well worth viewing many times over.  Well done in every department, Bogart, Tim Holt  and Walter Houston especially stand out in their roles as the hard up prosepctors in their character revealing trek.<br /><br />THE TREASURE OF THE SIERA MADRE is without a doubt a Five Star film.
B000068CNX|3.0|I purchased this item listed as \\"New\\" condition. When I received it, however, the outer cardboard case and inner plastic case were both cracked and torn.

Poor condition reporting on the part of the seller.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is review for the 2006 James Bond film, CASINO ROYALE<br />which was released on DVD in 2007 by Sony.<br /><br />I must admit that I was a Bond fan during the Sean Connery era<br />but drifted away after Mr. Connery left the series.  I did<br />see one of the Roger Moore Bonds and George Lazenby's<br />debut/farewell into the series.  But overall I just couldn't<br />see anyone but Sean Connery make me sit still and believe that<br />he was Agent 007.<br /><br />That is until I decided to watch the newer James Bond, played by<br />Daniel Craig, who quite honestly was an actor I had never even heard of.<br />I was very surprised by the vigor and intensity with which Mr. Craig brought<br />to the James Bond role and the whole film, CASINO ROYALE, semed to get a lift<br />as a result of the new Bond's energy and strength. Of course a lot if not most<br />of the credit must go to director Martin Campbell for this fine new edition<br />of Bond.  Even though this production is all new I think it's fair to say<br />that the Bond excitement that first revealed itself onscreen almost fifty years<br />ago has returned and returned big time.<br /><br />I'm certain that  the whole production team has been overhauled and maybe I am<br />making a little too much about the influence of the star but the new look<br />James Bond is almost riveting when it comes to the exciting chances the<br />character takes and the risks that he must go through to succeed.<br />CASINO ROYALE is an amazing film and the performance of Daniel Craig was a revelation to me and as I can see by many of these reviews  other film goers<br />as well.<br /><br />Five Stars.
B003S897UK|2.0|The Who song \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" does not begin with the \\"...listening to you, I get the music\\" climax. That is indeed the case with this cover by Government Mule, and the song advertised is not what I got with the MP3 download. This is not a fanboy nerd complaint; half of the song, as written, is missing. The samples from somewhere in the body of the track don't allow you to catch a grievous shortcoming like this. What I got for my money is a cover of half of the song.    \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is badly, badly marred by the omission of the 'tricky bits in the middle'. It's hard to describe, but if you know the song, you know what passage I mean. Government Mule are very capable musicians, and if guys like April Wine and Greg Lake's solo band can pull it off, so could have Government Mule, with some practice and some taking-things-seriously. This bogus editing of the composition itself is similar in nature to Ozzy Osbourne's mindless version, as well as Emerson, Lake (!) and Palmer's own cover on their box set. Lazy, lazy, lazy. If Robert Fripp were dead, he'd be rolling over in his grave.    No idea on the rest of the album, because I'm so discouraged by these two downloads.

0449000729|3.0|The most important thing a book must do is hold your interest, and this one does. It is in the style of James Michener as he focuses on one location and makes up short stories through the ages about events in this one location.<br /><br />I don't know why other reviewers overrate the book. It is interesting but not a great work of literature. It has too many faults to be considered a five star effort, and in the end it is simply a collection of short stories that are pretty interesting.<br /><br />Its only strengths are that it holds your interest and amuses you, and that it provides insight into various historical periods. That's enough.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about it is that it tries to achieve an odd continuity from one short story to the next by making children the carbon copies of their ancestors. If one character in the book is evil, you can be sure that everyone in his family will be evil and that all his ancestors will be evil. That is a drawback to the book taken as a whole. It was a poor decision by the author. It is one dimensional and silly.<br /><br />But that is the premise of the book. That families never change. That evil ancestors beget evil descendants. That basically all of the traits of an individual are passed down to all of his ancestors, as if we are cloned.<br /><br />So take the book for what it is and enjoy it.
030726999X|4.0|I like everyone else whose a fan of this trilogy wishes Stieg Larsson had stayed with us long enough to finish the supposed 10 books that were to be this series...I loved, loved, LOVED the first two books - this one - the hornets nest - was a bit too long.<br /> I love Salander and Blomkvist but Salander, especially, is hardly in the third one and Blomvist, was meandering it seems, doing what he does best, lovin' the ladies.<br /><br />My interest wasn't peaked until the last 100 pages where the first two had me riveted from the start. Great books, original - first two, five star all the way, the 3rd one? I think it might have been a jumping board for subplots to future books - too much fluff that was irrelevant. Well never know.<br />But as a trilogy - excellent.
0743201140|4.0|It was rewarding to read a book that helps you focus on strenghts, not weaknesses.  It's going to take a while to put in practice what I've learned because it's hard to change thinking patters and habits, but it will help me become a better professional and individual.  I highly recommend it.

0374158460|5.0|This is a brilliant book, worthy of all of the critical praise it has received.  No, it is not perfect (some of the plot twists seem contrived and the book would have been both more powerful and profound without either of the epilogues, to name just two flaws), but then again no book is.  We tend to forget, for example, that a significant percentage of \\"Anna Karenina\\" was devoted to painfully tedious discussions of Russian agriculture.  We nevertheless remember the book fondly because the main characters were so perfectly realized, the story of their lives so compelling told, and the society in which they live so vividly portrayed.  The same is true of \\"Freedom.\\"    Franzen is certainly not Tolstoy, but his ambitions are nearly as sweeping, and he comes closer than any other contemporary American novelist.  A more apt comparison might be to Dickens, whose biting social commentary was consistently leavened with humor, and whose primary thematic concerns were practical and political rather than philosophical.    Franzen's theme is what the baby boom generation, which collectively comprises the most forunate group of people in human history, have chosen to do with the extraordinary freedoms they have enjoyed.  His answer, in essence, is that they have squandered those freedoms in heedless pursuit of selfish gratification, destroying a great deal of the natural world in the process, and they have done so with very little consideration of their options and no thought at all of the consequences of their choices.  Franzen is disdainful of virtually every aspect of modern society, from the predictable targets - Dick Cheney and SUV's - to the surprising - NPR and the Democratic Party - to the idiosyncratic - flip-flops, iPods, housecats and, apparently, everything about West Virginia.  The breadth and intensity of his distaste for modernity is reminiscent of Micehle Houellebecq, which is interesting because it would be difficult to imagine two authors more different in theirstyle, temperament or politics.    Franzen addresses these issues through the life story of one married couple and their numerous friends, family members and acquaintances, who together represent virtually every segment of American society.  Though he lacks Dickens' knack for bringing his minor characters to life in quick, vivid sketches, each his primary characters is beautifully presented.  They are, like all of us, complex, contradictory, deeply flawed, and thus wondefully human and completely believable.  It is not true, as some have suggested, that none of the characters are likable.  It is true, however, that the reader's fondness for them will vary significantly over the course of the book, as it does for real people in real life.  That is the real genius of this book - we may or may not not sympathize with these characters as they struggle with Franzen's fundamental question of \\"How should we live?\\" but we can always empathize with them, and recognize their dilemmas.    Franzen never really answers that fundamental question - the only things he is consistently enthusiastic about are migratory birds - but that is at should be.  To raise the question is more than enough, and to do so in such a magnificant way deserves our attention.    The one star reviews for this book are frankly absurd.  Many of them are from people who acknoledge that they either didn't read or didn't finish the book, which should be a prerequisite for any review.  Most of the rest are from people who claim simply to not \\"like\\" the characters, as if that were actually a requirement for good literature (does anyone actually \\"like\\" the characters in Dostoevesky or Faulkner?).  If you want a serious, entertaining book that just might challenge your assumptions about America, buy \\"Freedom.\\"  If not, don't bother.
0439023513|5.0|Really enjoyed the final book. It was sad and depressing most of the way through, but I think that made it more real. People don't usually live happily ever after after war, they manage to deal with what they went through every day. I was sad that Collins killed some of the main characters, but I guess that's the way war goes. Great, great book!
0765326353|4.0|Normally I don't give criticism to a book I really enjoy for \\"being too long\\" - after all, most of us wish our favorite books were a little bit longer. However, in this case, there was probably 200-300 pages of material that could have been safely cut from the book, as many chapters were essentially duplicates of previous ones. A chapter about a character worrying about going crazy, or suffering as a grunt in an army is interesting. Having multiple chapters that are in essence identical to each other is... too much. It's possible that I've been spoiled by Sanderson's short stories, in which he's able to convey epic breadth and scope in stories only 20 or 30 pages long, complete with world building and interesting character development. Sanderson himself spelled the solution to this problem in his Alcatraz books - you can either dedicate 200 pages to tediously talking about how a guy crossed a desert, or you can just say \\"he spent months crossing the desert.\\" I honestly think this book would have been tighter with multiple chapters from each of the viewpoint characters chopped and combined.<br /><br />Now, criticism out of the way, the book is excellent. By the end of book, the reader is going to be treated to several very delicious plot points, which will undoubtedly lead to lots of speculation on theoryland websites until the next book is finished. Even though this book is just the first in a series, with nothing really resolved with any of the viewpoint characters, enough significant plot happens to each of them that you feel satisfied with the wait.<br /><br />Even more interesting is the moral system Sanderson is creating with this series. Besides a nebulous \\"Odium\\" figure which we never meet or see (a devil-analogue, perhaps), there's no villains in the work. The \\"voidbringers\\" that are responsible for nearly destroying the world a hundred times over fight with more honor than the \\"good\\" kingdoms that mainly squabble amongst themselves and oppress the poor. Likewise, there's no truly good characters in the book - the poor 'freedom fighter' is consumed with hatred for the rich, the rich (even the 'perfect general') brutally use the poor as slaves and cannon fodder, the 'honorable assassin' and his employer are highly moral that follow a strict path that results in complete atrocities, the 'helpful sailor' is a cheat at dice, the young 'good king' is a compulsive paranoid, the 'good brother' tortures animals, and so forth. You find real darkness in every 'good' character in the book.<br /><br />I find this interesting as Sanderson's typical heroes are a bit flawed, but essentially good characters at their core (cf Elantris, Mistborn, Alcatraz) that eventually assert their heroic nature and triumph. In this book, the characters all have actual evil tendencies or nightmarish actions in their past. It will be interesting to see what he does with this different breed of character.<br /><br />It's an outstanding work of epic fantasy, and I can't wait for the next installment.o truly good characters in the book - the poor 'freedom fighter' is consumed with hatred for the rich, the rich (even the 'perfect general') brutally use the poor as slaves and cannon fodder, the 'honorable assassin' and his employer are highly moral that follow a strict path that results in complete atrocities, the 'helpful sailor' is a cheat at dice, the young 'good king' is a compulsive paranoid, the 'good brother' tortures animals, and so forth.

B002ZG999U|2.0|In \\"The Expendables,\\" that which gets the most screen time, has the most facial expressions, and is clearly the best actor is a seaplane with \\"Global Wildlife Conservancy\\" painted on it.  And while it's doubtful that any of the actors in this action flick actually know what the term \\"conservancy\\" means, it is metaphorical.  The seaplane can be seen as a Noah's Ark, and \\"The Expendables\\" is definitely a Noah's Ark of has-been action movie stars.  It's supposed to be a joke of sorts, and there really are a lot of bad inside jokes: when Slyvester Stallone confront Arnold Schwarzenegger the inside jokes are just unbearably juvenile.     Taking the world's worst actors and having them show off their biceps may seem like a good idea, but having Stallone direct it is not.  You would expect the plot to be non-existent and the dialogue to be corny, but the movie is also badly filmed and badly edited.  The opening image is a motorcyle with \\"The Expendables\\" logo fading into the moon, and it's hard to create a cheesier, more amateurish edit than this. The action scenes are confusing and chaotic -- how exactly does four guys engage 6,000 soldiers on an open field and manage to win?     Stallone looks like a pimp, and Jet Li looks like a dishwasher.  Dolph Lundgren appears to have gotten killed, but comes back at the end of the movie.  That's an important lesson for us all:  action movie stars don't die -- they just get benched.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|I only give this set a 4 star rating because of the second season.<br /><br />the first season was all politics and Julius Ceaser. there were no battles no fighting amongst the senitors. you don't really know the reason that ceaser was killed. there was a lot of sex that didn't further the story much.<br /><br />season two there was much more. the beginings of the mafia. war between Marc Anthony and Brutus at Phillipi in Greese. a much better season then season 1.<br /><br />my only regret now is that in a couple days the whole show is over and there is no more Rome to watch.<br /><br />The story follows two warriors from the time they enter Italy by crossing the Rubicon. The quit the army and try to make an honest living. One, Polo, doesn't quite make an \\"honest\\" living, while his friend Verinas is frustrated with wife and family. a very Hollywood history lesson is intertwined with the story at hand. My only wish is that they would have gone through the early stages of the Christian Church and shown Paul being beheaded and Peter being hung upside down.<br /><br />Over all the first season is boring as a man with a runny nose. the second season is with the money you pay for this set.
B002RKSCA6|4.0|...But most people have probably not read.  At least for me, it was brand new.  I've seen the movies with the effect of the Hyde potion (the crackling, morphing, turn to a gigantic character).  The book was a lot more subtle, and if we didn't all know the story to some extent, would have been a great mystery.  It's also seen through the eyes of a friend of Dr. Jekyl's, which makes the story entertaining as he unravels the causes of Jekyl's strange behavior.  I would reccomend the book to anyone who hasn't read it and wants to be able to say they did!  And, anyone who wants to expand their Old English vocabulary to give their Kindle's lookup tool some excercise.
0439023513|2.0|I wish I would of stopped at the second book. The characters we fell in love with in the first two may have been present physically but they developed into people I did not know. I guess in real life this would happen to anybody who as endured the trama these characters were forced to deal with. So since I read fiction to escape the reality of everyday life this book was to real for me to enjoy and I did not like watching the characters deteriorate. Do not let this detour you from reading The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is one of the best books I have ever read. It's fast pace and the characters are awesome. If you have not read it buy it now.
B000G75994|5.0|I have long been a great admirer of the elegant style of Maria Joao Pires.  This collection of Mozart sonatas only elevates that admiration.  Quite frankly, I have never heard a false note from this wonderful soloist.  She is the ideal artist to cradle these wonderful piano works in her capable hands---from the simple and playful (K.545), to the inspired and profound (K.331)---and convey their messages with pristine and absolute clarity.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a blend of the very best in piano composition and artistic technique, by adding this special set to your collection.  You'll be reaching for it...often!
B002BWP4A6|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie after all the hype. However, this has to be one of the most boring and pointless movies I've ever seen. I sat through until the end expecting/hoping that something would happen that would make up for all the tediousness, but nothing happened. I don't mind slow-paced films, but this film was a complete waste of my time and attention.
B002ZG9968|3.0|This is perfectly enjoyable for a date movie and light entertainment.  Jennifer Lopez is very engaging, as is her co star O'Laughlin, in this story of a pet shop owner and an organic farmer who fall in love just as the woman discovers she's pregnant, as she had wanted to become a single mom and was inseminated.      It's hard to believe that a pet shop owner could live in such a great home with tons of clothes and shoes and plenty of time off.  It's also straining credibility that a man could fall so hard and fast for a pregnant woman.    Otherwise, though, it is a cute and inoffensive movie.
0553805371|2.0|The hype behind this book before its release concerned what the authors assert about God not being needed to create something out of nothing.  I was interested in seeing how this was elaborated upon in the book, but the assertion which I looked to see qualified throughout ended up being that offered on the first page - \\"philosophy is dead\\" - perhaps deliberately reminiscent of Nietzsche's \\"God is dead\\".  And, though such an assertion about philosophy is ambitious, the authors soon thereafter explain that what is meant by this is that philosophy is no longer needed to explain life's big questions (i.e., creation, free will, consciousness), as science has reached a point where it is able to answer these questions for us.   Fair enough.  Yet, I grew befuddled by the lack of science, and great utilization of what appeared to be philosophy (especially Western linear logic, ontology, and epistemology) needed to explain the \\"scientific\\" theories which support such the authors' conclusions.    This book also seemed to end prematurely.  I was still expecting some grand intellectual climax - and then it was over.    Given the hype before the release of the book and the \\"blah\\" feeling with which I have come away from it, I am tempted to think that the authors used their free will to decide to make some cash and sell themselves out a bit.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|If you loved The Great Escape and Papillon, with Steve McQueen as the king of the escape artists and chase scenes, then you will love Bullitt.  It features one of the most famous and exciting car chase sequences ever filmed. Bullitt is also a good example of a somewhat maverick cop who refuses to compromise his principles and stands up against the slimy guy played by Robert Vaughn.      Good stuff!

0393072231|5.0|This book uncovers how a relatively small number of poorly supervised people created the financial crisis of 2008 through a mixture of ignorance, arrogance, inertia, and greed.  You do not have to be a financial expert to read and understand this book.      However, a quick warning, the more you understand about the technical side of things, the more you will see the pointlessness of it all and the greater likelihood that you will experience regret that you didn't see it coming yourself.  I've often said, \\"in hindsight we are all idiots\\" and this certainly applies here.      Key Thoughts:    1. Everyone in the business assumed that \\"someone else\\" was reviewing the details of the prospectuses.   2. We should not allow a US chartered bank to issue a \\"credit default swap\\" where they take on almost unlimited financial risk in exchange for a relatively small \\"premium\\".   Even a life insurance policy has a maximum payout!  How did the people who created and approved these instruments keep their positions after they virtually destroyed even the incredibly large firms they worked for?    3. Incentives played a huge role as Charlie Munger said- \\"The Psychology of Human Misjudgement\\" - \\"If you wanted to predict how people would behave, you only have to look at their incentives.\\"    The author says that only between 10 and 20 people - made straightforward bet against the subprime mortgage market.  The books tells us quite a bit about three of them:  Michael Burry, Steve Esinmann, and Greg Lippmann.      Probably the most interesting and unusual character is Mike Burry, who was a former medical doctor/researcher turned trader - not your normal path.      After some time looking for a partner, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank allowed Burry to select any bonds to short he liked - they only looked at the ratings - while he looked at the underlying mortgages - looking for those most likely to default.    For example, one pool consisted ONLY of floating rate negative amortizing mortgages where the borrowers could choose to not even pay the interest and allow their loans to grow even larger as they didn't pay to live in their homes.      It is incredibly interesting to read how, as Burry's negative bets on these wacky mortgages were nearing huge payoffs, his own investors began to criticize him because their returns weren't good as he waited for the house of cards to collapse.  He was right and the people who trusted him with some of their money couldn't believe it because they didn't like their short term returns.  The criticism eventually turned incredibly ugly, including litigation.      Burry also had to endure/persist through the issuers setting their own prices on the securities he'd purchased - despite bad news for the issuers, they had no incentive to recognize reality and so they didn't - and didn't reflect the winning nature of his bets for over 2 years!      The bond market is much more complex than the stock market because the number of instruments is so much larger and they aren't traded with anything like the regularity of a NYSE stock.  Accurate pricing is very difficult to determine.      The MBS market was the ultimate \\"betting on the come\\" where even a fall in home prices wasn't necessary to spell doom - all that was required was a slowing in their rate of climb.  When the teaser rate period ends, the borrower will need to refinance, and the home needs to have appreciated to cover the new, larger debt - since there are costs and, often, interest to be rolled in.  Insanity.      Ratings Agencies - staffed primarily by the least talented of the all the Wall Street players - it appears that they didn't have any idea how to rate the risk in MBS.   These people were manipulated by the creators of the securities and, financially, these hens are incented to \\"play nice\\" with the foxes they are paid to watch.  S&P was actually afraid to ask for the internal mortgage data on the securities they were rating - if they pushed too hard, theymight go to Moody's instead... Insanity.      The book details how Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) were made and then abused.  A collection of mortgages (maybe strong ones, maybe weak ones, maybe a mixture) are collected in a pool.  The pool is sold, in sections, or tranches, to investors.  Some tranches (rated AAA by one or more agency) are structured to be most likely to pay back - they receive the best ratings and lowest interest.  Some (rated BBB) are structured to be paid back principal and earnings only if things go well - they are intentionally created to accept the most risk and have the most upside as well.  So far, so good - this has been done for years.  I remember them from the early 1990s in my bank examining days.      The problem occurred when a bunch of triple B securities were then put into a new pool and restructured again to have \\"most likely\\" to pay tranche and then higher risk tranches as well.  Here, the risk was much higher because the entire pool was made up from other pools' junk tranches.  Somehow, the ratings agencies allowed a large section of this pool to obtain the coveted AAA credit rating.  Of course, these AAAs had higher interest for \\"the same risk\\".  This is always a lie.      Although it seems impossible to believe, the BBBs from these 2nd tier of CMOs were often packaged again and turned into yet another pool of AAA and BBB credits.  Here you'd have the worst junk of the worst junk of the worst junk and a large portion of it would still get AAA ratings.  Again the interest \\"paid\\" would be higher for \\"the same risk\\".  Again, this is always a lie.      In the end even this activity wasn't enough to satisfy the appetite for the securities.  The \\"synthetic CMO\\" was created when the firms couldn't find enough mortgages to collect into the initial pools.  Insanity.        Although the book doesn't cover the transactions further downstream, I remember hearing that mortgage lenders were earning a $1,000 per loan incentive ifthe loan was a \\"subprime\\" loan - they were actually making more money to issue debt to bad borrowers than to good ones.  Insanity.  The wayward incentives started at the top and went through every level of the business.      To compound matters an additional level - credit default swaps on the risk of these loans could be bought from AIG who didn't even know what they were insuring.  They thought the loan pools were about 10% subprime when they were more like 95%.  They thought they that collecting the \\"insurance\\" premiums on the swaps was like free money.  For less than 2% per year, you could insure (or speculate against) all the risk in a BBB tranche.      At the same time, this was America's problem too - when John Q. Public decided to buy a home that he new in his heart (even if he didn't have the financial expertise to calculate it) that he couldn't afford - he created the problem too.      Our politicians, who also created this problem, through demanding that mortgage lending standards be loosened, and then loosened, then loosened some more - all with the stated purpose of \\"helping foster the dream of home ownership\\".  These same politicians also repeatedly voting to lower the capital requirements for quasi Government Agencies FNMA and FMLMC.  All the while Fanny and Freddie were contributing to these same politician's campaigns.  (See [..])   Remember the Munger quote about incentives?  These politicians, more than anyone else, have not been held into account for their actions.  Many have come out railing against \\"Wall Street Greed\\".  Insanity.      At this point accountability has been in very short supply.  The traders made their money - sure they may have lost their jobs - but one would suspect that their multi-million dollar salaries and bonuses will last them.  The Wall Street brokerage and insurance firms and banks like Goldman Sachs and AIG and Citigroup have had their exposure (indeed their very existence) propped up by the US Government.  The many ofthe mortgage borrowers have given their homes to the bank and moved on, or they've \\"strategically defaulted\\" to obtain better terms.  In the end everyone's happy and no one got hurt and we all learned a lesson.  Don't mind the mountain of US Government debt that got accumulated and it's ongoing effect on our economic situation.   So who actually has been held accountable?   Did our Bailouts really save jobs or did we simply prevent ourselves from learning the lesson?  Any idea where the lobbying money from the Bailed out institutions has been heading?      A bit of a warning:  The book is also contains wall street/locker room salty language throughout.     Memorable quotes:  \\"I think I've been in the top five percent of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it.  And never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little bit farther.\\" - Charlie Munger    \\"the wealthiest...have accepted that most managers are average, and the better ones are able to achieve average returns while exhibiting below average volatility.\\"  Michael Burry    \\"could very easily be a 50% drop in residential real estate in the U.S. - Michael Burry May 2003    I'm glad I read this book, it was informative, interesting, explains complicated things very well.   Thanks Michael Lewis!
1439148953|4.0|This book is fresh and the time in history is one not that long ago, but the world a bit different, yet the yearnings of a girl/woman coming of age, same as ever.  I felt so akin to Eilise with her constant weighing of decisions and her justifying her actions (or inactions).  I left home to work many miles from my hometown after college, and her pangs resonated with the ones I had - even though we are a generation apart.    The author has a lovely way of telling this tale and makes it so delicious to read.  A very satisfying novel.

0765326353|5.0|This is Sanderson's best work to date.  The world building is absolutely amazing. The creatures and flora are completely unique and intriguing which is important to me as elves, gnomes, dwarves and the like have been used way too much in this genre. I can't wait for the rest of this series and if the rate at which Sanderson has been releasing books lately is any indication then, unlike ceRRtain series, I won't have to wait that long.
0465011012|5.0|This is an incredible story written by a person who survived ten years growing up in a North Korean concentration camp for being the family member of an alleged traitor/spy.  The author provides vivid details of what it is like to live under the rule of an oppressive nation.    While reading this book and imagining yourself in the author's place you will get chills thinking about what it would be like for you and your family to be so severely oppressed and brainwashed.  The book will also show how helpless you can be if you don't take control of your own fate.    This is truly an amazing story and if you've ever complained about living in the United States you should read this book.  After reading this book I couldn't help but thank God (and I'm not that religious) that I live in the United States and not some god forsaken country like North Korea.  You really will appreciate all that you have after reading this.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is a really good hard rock album.  I'm a huge Creed fan and this is really well balanced album.  Plus for a first album they did exceptional.  \\"Are You Ready\\" starts it off with a great kick but the next song \\"What If\\" is probably my favorite on the album.  Probably the two most popular song on the album are \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and \\"Higher\\".  These songs are very good but I think they are a little overrated.<br /><br />Overall you will love this album.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was a great way to end an amazing series. Suzanne Collins ties up all of the loose ends that were lest by Catching Fire. We finally have an answer to the question Peeta or Gale? We also know what will become of Panem. Great plot, characters and writing style.
B001JJBO74|5.0|Turin and Sanchez bring to my mind the Fashion Police.  Any version of the Fashion Police.  Yes, they review and critique.  They praise and admire and gush, and every once in a while, the claws come out and they're as catty as Joan Rivers.  Funny, too.<br /><br />No house is sacred (except Guerlain) in this book.  Each perfume reviewed has a two-word caption providing a short description.  For example, L'Heure Bleue's caption is \\"dessert air,\\" which is apt because it's sweet and light.  Reviews of various lengths and seriousness follow.  Some are raves, some are descriptive, some are rants.<br /><br />But the real reason to read this book, and you SHOULD read this book, is for its entertainment value.  Sure, you'll learn some things along the way, and sometimes you'll disagree.  I regret to inform M. Turin he is entirely wrong about Jicky.  It is not a timeless classic.  I bought a sample.  My deperate attempts to like it failed, and for good reason:  Jicky is icky.<br /><br />Read this book because parts of it are hysterically funny.  And if you see a fragrance on sale, well, maybe the reviews can help you decide whether to try the fragrance.  Just don't take the book too seriously, because I guarantee you'll find a perfume you love dismissed as soapy!
B0025KVLUG|4.0|The 1999 Yellow Submarine Songtrack is not the 1969, 1990, 2009 Yellow Submarine Soundtrack. Names are similar and confusing. The 1999 reissue is a totally different alternate Yellow Submarine album.  It lacks the George Martin Orchestral tracks but adds in a number of then popular Beatles songs, some associated with the film, to make a sort of greatest hits album.  Remember the \\"Yellow Submarine (1969)\\" film story is also \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\\" too and is \\"continued\\" series of songs from that album.  The 1999 track listing is virtually totally different from the 1990 or 2009 CDs or 1969 LP.  Only sharing about 6 songs.  Amazon has the reviews all jumbled up and mixed up.  I have not compared the actual sound of the CDs yet.  Though since 1999 is between 1990 and 2009, the sound might be an intermediate improvement over the ancient LP (at least for the 6 songs. It like most reissues is surely remixed to some extent. Sure, the regular Yellow Submarine Film Soundtrack albums are short on actual Beatles songs (should be priced as an \\"CD-EP\\"), but there are some good ones.  Can't rate any Beatles (official album) less than 4 or 5. Buy both albums.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this since the season ended last year.  What an incredible show!  There have been several times both in this season and the last that I have yelled at the TV or jumped up from the couch because I'm so into the show.  And as anyone who saw the first episode of Season 3 the other night will tell you, this show just keeps getting better.  I definitely give this 5 stars out of 5.    Now for the negative...this was preordered for me as a Birthday present.  When Tues. 8/31 came around I was expecting it in my mailbox.  I wanted to watch all of Season 2 again before the new episodes started, but it wasn't there.  Next day, not there.  Same the following day and so on.  The person who preordered it for me checked their account it said it wasn't due to ship until Sept. 7.  To me, the reason you preorder something is to make sure that you will have a copy on the day it comes out.  If I had wanted to, I could have bought this in FYE or some other place that day and had it in hand.  I didn't get the actual DVDs in the mail until Sept. 9, which is 9 full days after it was released.  I will be thinking twice about preordering from Amazon in the future unless it is at least set to ship on the release date.
0399536108|5.0|It's hard to put into actual words the impact of this new book, The Art of Nonconformity, written by Chris Guillebeau.  But if I had to, the best description would be \\"life-changing\\".  I've been an avid reader of Chris' blog of the same name for over a year.  Not only does he talk the talk, but he walks the walk.  Within the writing of this book, Chris shares his experiences of living an unconventional lifestyle - not living life the way others expect you to.  Having the courage to think and be different.  Challenging us to create a lasting legacy.  Being the same as everyone else is easy.  Life starts when you wake up.  You've gotta read the book to find out how.    I've constantly used his 1st manifesto, A Brief Guide to World Domination, as a resource...now, this book serves as my new favorite.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Really takes the reader into the action. So many book clubs and friends read this book that I felt i \\"had\\" to read it. Worth the time. I'm ready to read the next in the series.
B003ZSIS6C|5.0|As a long time non-conformist, world dominator, reader of Chris' blog, and purchaser of his products, I couldn't wait for his new book to be published.    I wasn't disappointed.  This book really delivered.    I know Chris lives by a \\"Non-Guru\\" lifestyle, but he is indeed a guru of freedom.    He truly lives by his words, teaches you how to do the same, and provides you with realistic ways to accomplish the goals you set for yourself.    The resources he provides are invaluable, and will provide hours of \\"continuing education\\" long after you've read the last page of The Art of Non-Conformity.
0596805888|5.0|You've got to have a lot of confidence and nerve to write and try to sell a nearly 400 page book on cooking to the take-out pizza and cola set.  No cookbook is likely to turn many geeks into chefs or take them away from their computer screens.  However, even though \\"Cooking for Geeks\\" contains a large number of recipes, it is not a conventional cookbook but a scientific explanation of the how and why of cooking which will certainly appeal to that group, as well as to cooking professionals and intellectually curious others.<br /><br /> The author is a geek himself and brings \\"geek-like\\" approaches to the subject matter - deep intellectual curiosity, affinity for details, appreciation of problem solving and hacking, scientific method, and a love of technology.  What is even better is his filtering of cooking concepts by a computer coder's framework, analogizing recipes to executable code, viewing of ingredients as inputs and as variables, running  processes over and over in a logical manner to test and improve outcomes.  This is not a mere literary shoe-horning of cooking concepts into a coder's framework but an ingenuous approach to the topics that should loudly resonate with geeks.<br /><br /> The subject matter includes selecting and using kitchen and cooking hardware; prepping inventory; calibrating equipment (especially your oven, using sugar); understanding tastes and smells; the fundamental difference between cooking and baking (and the personality types which gravitate to one form or the other); the importance of gluten and the three major types of leavening (biological, chemical, and mechanical); the types of cooking; using time and temperatures; how to use air as a tool; the chemistry of food combinations; and very thorough and detailed discussions of food handling and safety.  The book is organized into seven chapters and includes an appendix dealing with cooking for people with allergies.  The recipes are indexed in the front of the book.<br /><br /> The major conventional flavor types of salt, sugar, acids, and alcohol have been supplemented by modern industrial elements - E- Numbered (a Dewey decimal system-like index) additives, colloids, gels, foams, and other yummy things!  All are itemized, charted, and explained in the chapter entitled \\"Playing with Chemistry.\\" A whole chapter (and an interview with mathematician, Douglas Baldwin) is devoted to the latest and greatest food preparation technique -sous vide- cooking food in a temperature-controlled water bath.<br /><br /> Threaded through the sections are short sidebar interviews of mostly computer and techie types who are serious cooks or involved in the food industry.  Some of these contributors are Adam Savage (of Myth Busters fame) on scientific technique, Tim O'Reilly (CEO of the book's publisher) on scones and jam, Nathan Myhrvold, on Moderist cuisine, and others.  Other interviews deal with taste sensitivities, food mysteries, industrial hardware, pastry chef insights, and many more. There is an insightful section just on knives and how to use and care for them.<br /><br /> Anyone who is interested in cooking will learn from this book.  I now pay attention to things I've never heard of before: browning methods like caramelization and the Maillard processes, savory as a major taste, transglutaminase (a.k.a. meat glue), for example.  There is stuff I didn't really want to know - \\"if you've eaten fish you've eaten worms.\\"<br /><br /> Although one of the strengths of the book is the systematic organization, there are useful tips spread throughout.  For example, keeping a pizza stone permanently in your oven will help even out heat distribution; storing vegetables correctly requires knowing whether they admit ethylene gas or not (a chart is included); you can test your smell sensitivity profile by using a professional scratch and sniff test kit obtainable from the University of Pennsylvania.  Whatever specialized information not contained in the book is  referenced to external sources, especially on the Internet.<br /><br />  If all of this is not stimulus enough for the geek crowd, how about learning how you can spectacularly kill yourself cooking with dry ice, liquid nitrogen, blowtorches, and especially an electrocuted hotdog. Cool!  This is mad scientist stuff. Engineering-minded types can learn how to make their own ice cream machine from Legos. You'll also learn how NOT to kill your guests with bacteria and other toxins.<br /><br /> The production is nicely done with easily readable text, plentiful drawings and charts, color captions, and many other quality production features.  Weights are based in both grams and US volume-based measurements.<br /><br />(FTC disclosure (16 CFR Part 255): The reviewer has accepted a reviewer's copy of this book which is his to keep. He intends to provide an honest, independent, and fair evaluation of the book in all circumstances.)enced to external sources, especially on the Internet.<br /><br />  If all of this is not stimulus enough for the geek crowd, how about learning how you can spectacularly kill yourself cooking with dry ice, liquid nitrogen, blowtorches, and especially an electrocuted hotdog.

0439023513|2.0|No spoilers here! Read on...    I loved the fast-paced action and fun characters of the Hunger Games and Catching Fire. But this book was just so incredibly dark, to the point of leaving me in a lingering state of depression. Sure, it was a page-turner and a quick read, and I didn't want to put it down, but by the end I felt like all the hope had been bludgeoned out of me (credit to the author for making the feelings of the characters spill out into my own life).    But seriously, the book turned into much more of an anti-war diatribe than anything else. We do understand that war is terrible, and often pointless, but even some of the people in our world who have suffered the most pull out of their depression, and make a decision not to be beaten down by it. Not so for Katniss.    For me, Collins' killing spree towards the end of the book just left everything pretty pointless. If you watched Lost, it's the same type of \\"why did I just spend so many hours watching this series\\" feeling. Sure, it's entertainment, but as with a fast food burger, not particularly satisfying in the end.    Despite the dark and sour taste this book leaves, I do look forward to seeing future work from Suzanne Collins. More, please!
0553805371|5.0|This book is great for those people who may not be too familiar with the Standard Model of physics. While we are not yet at a true unified field theory of the universe, the standard model does match experimental results and even predicted several new particles that have since been discovered. There is some humor thrown in now and then, but it seems a little out of place with the rest of the physics info.  I just wish he would have talked more about god and the fact that we don't need her.  A great book for people new to cosmology.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|It took me less than 24 hours to plow through this book (on my new Kindle!).  The only reason it took me that long was because I have to sleep sometime.  It reminds me a lot of a childhood favorite, The Stainless Steel Rat series by Harry Harrison. For whatever reason, I really prefer 1st person writing.  A fine mix of humor, thoughtful science-fiction and action make this book worthy of a download and a read.  And now I move onto the next book in the series..
B0019N8P2W|4.0|The show is as amazing as it always was, but the sound on the DVD set keeps going in and out. Though they say they \\"changed\\" most of the music, they really just removed most of it.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I have watched Grey's Anatomy since it's premiere episode of season one. I was immediately drawn in and became a fan overnight. I own every season on DVD, every book, poster, calender, refridgerator magnents and key chains they have put out. To put mildly I am one of the biggest fans of the show. No other show has ever gotten to me the way Greys has. I see myself in Meredith so strongly and I believe that is one of the ways this show has become what it is now, people can relate to the characters in a way other tv shows cant convey. I also work in a Hospital and a lot of the things that go on is so similar to Greys. Not the shooting rampage in the season finale of course but many other things ring true. I highly recommend season 6 as it is just as intense and wonderfully written and acted as the first 5 seasons were. Can't wait for the season 7 premiere September 23rd!    Sarah
B002OT730K|5.0|Love You Live is the Rolling Stones live, and unvarnished. The El Mocambo set is very much their reggae peak, while their Paris, France performance is electric (Disc one, not disc two as described), kicks off this slice of heaven, warts and all. I was there in Exhibition Stadium, Toronto a night after their reggae performance in the El Mocambo, and the atmosphere prior to the show was one of doubt, and some unease, from those 45,000 that hadn't been at the El Mocambo. Then, they came out and fired away as only they could. If that miserable slab of concrete and steel had a roof, the Stones would have blown it clean off. They told the world that night that they were not going away and they were ready to party and play the music, never mind all the **** being thrown at them. Yes, this is not \\"perfect\\", but if you were there or only wish you were in Paris in 1977, or Toronto a few months later it is as you may, or may not ;-) recall it all. Their Montreal stop on this tour was another memorable one, when they took the stade Olimpique (sic) by storm. When they ended the fun at 4AM (?) we roared well into the morning rush hour!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this because I read a good review on here about the use of this item with the UPPA Baby Vista stroller. This item is exactly what the stroller is lacking! I love the roominess of the pouch, the zippered pocket, and the two spaces for cups. The cup holders are stretchy neoprene which fits virtually any cup and holds it in place. Also, when moving the stroller in various positions, the caddy freely swings which prevents spilling your drink and items out of the center part of the organizer. Just the right size and seems to be well-made! Great product and comparably cheap too!
B003IPC5SO|1.0|I really like Kylie old songs but this album is just a trash,... Sorry I don't like at all,....
0811876373|5.0|I am incredibly impressed with this cookbook.  As a fan of Bakerella's blog, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  I'd never tried making cake pops before getting the book, but the photos, instructions, and trouble shooting tips were so good I couldn't resist any longer.  I am so happy to add this to my cookbook shelves--it is going to be pulled out again and again.  (My 4 year old loves looking through the pictures--he's told me exactly which ones he wants to make next!)
0784011176|5.0|Much has been said about the symbolism of this movie.  You can read them here among the reviews, and they all miss the mark.    As correctly assumed by most reviewers, it all centers on the piano.  But this is also where most misconception starts.  Most believe the piano is Ada's mouthpiece - the instrument that conveys her emotions and passion.  But it is not.  It is much deeper than that.  It is actually the symbol for Ada's sexuality.  For a woman totally devoid of any assets, sex is the only possession she can use and trade.  As one reviewer said, we do not know if Ada is diabolical, or the victim.     This is why, for her infidelity, Stewart cut off her finger (which symbolically, is an extension of her piano, hence here sexuality) and for which Stewart thinks is what Baines is only after.   This is also why, when she lost her finger, she tried to kill herself, for she now has nothing to offer (or lure) Baines.  But then, she realizes, Baines' love is pure and sincere.    Flora was able to see through her mother's guile precisely because she has an innocent heart, still not comprehending a woman's power over men.    In the end, the piano is like a phallic symbol, and as such, it represents power.  Cut it off, and we have nothing - except the love, if there was ever love.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|I read The Grand Design in one sitting, it took me a couple of hours.  In the past when I've read physics books (for example, [[ASIN:0553380168 A Brief History of Time]] or [[ASIN:0375708111 The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]]) it has been necessary for me to pace myself, to slow down and drop the book every now and then to think long and hard about the latest mind-bending lesson I'd just learned about the nature of our universe.  This wasn't the case with The Grand Design.  The material covered is certainly grand and epic, but the presentation is relatively light.  There's no math at all, and the style is welcoming.  This book is VERY understandable as far as popular physics goes, and I was extremely impressed at Professor Hawking and Mlodinow's ability to explain fundamentals of the universe in such an approachable way.<br /><br />This book covers some of the history of scientific theory.  How did old-school scientists decide how to approach the study of our world?  How did we end up framing the universe as a series of laws and theories?  How does philosophy fit into this puzzle?  The Grand Design moves on to give a primer on quantum physics and then covers such controversial topics as free will, an infinite number of universes, and the view of our own universe as one without a designer/creator.<br /><br />The writing style is clear and concise, with plenty of anecdotes.  It's entertaining and interesting, even funny at times.  The authors move in such a logical way from one topic to another, building up concepts and knowledge, that by the end you may be surprised at just how comfortable you feel thinking about some of the deepest mysteries of our universe.  You probably won't be figuring out the 'theory of everything' any time soon after reading this book, and the model/conclusion presented in this book may not actually shake out to be 100% correct - but if you read The Grand Design then chances are you'll have a much better understanding of the related material than you did yesterday.  To me this is a great thing.<br /><br />I read this book on my Kindle.  The one thing I should note is that a number of the illustrations have labels such as \\"the yellow line shows X and the blue line shows Y\\" - and unfortunately the Kindle is black and white.  As a result it can be tough to tell exactly what the authors mean when it comes to the visual supplements.  Not really a huge deal, but worth mentioning.tter understanding of the related material than you did yesterday.  To me this is a great thing.    I read this book on my Kindle.

0439023491|5.0|I'm thinking that I should have written this review BEFORE reading Mockingjay, as now the two are sort-of jumbled up in my head as one big mess of madness and fabulousness.<br /><br />And anyway, I always find it hard to write about books in series after having already written about the first one.  Unless there is some writing style issue or plot line issue that makes the second/third/etc. . . book in some way better or worse than the first book.  If not, I always feel redundant.<br /><br />And this seems like it might be one of those cases of redundancy.  I adored &lt;a href=\\"[...]l\\">the Hunger Games (check out my review if you haven't already)&lt;/a>, and I adored this book just as much for all the same reasons.  Colllin's future dystopia is so horrific and so real that it genuinely feels as if it must exist somewhere.  But, as I said before, thank god it doesn't.<br /><br />To be honest, I was wondering how Suzanne Collins was going to make three books out of this story.  I could see how one could easily write two, but I was really unsure as to how she was going to make Catching Fire happen without either being extremely redundant or taking away any possibility of a third book.  While there was the occasional redundancy, I never really felt it.  I shouldn't have been worried.  She managed to pull off this book with fluidity and grace, and I once again found myself in a non-stop whirlwind of page turning and NEED for more.  Questions will be answered, the Capitol will come to be better understood (and far more psychotic), and new characters will be loved.<br /><br />And now I must be redundant - just like the first one, though this book is YA, it absolutely surpasses its' genre and will easily be enjoyed by people of all ages reading all different kinds of books.<br /><br />There is one other issue that I would like to address before this review is over, and that is the violence in this book.  As someone who is absolutely NOT a fan of violence, especially if it is gratuitous, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy these books.  While it's true that there is a LOT of violence involved, I don't feel that any of it was gratuitous or even necessarily negative.  The violence in the book, in a way, made it very clear that violence is a bad thing just by being violent.  If that makes sense.  Sure, you have teenagers doing HORRIBLE things, but that's the horror.  That's what makes this world so horrifying.  And on of the things that makes it okay is that the people involved are still so good.  Still so innocent.<br /><br />Anyhow, read the Hunger Games, read this book.  You won't regret it.  But make sure you set aside enough time to finish it in one or two sittings, because stopping might be impossible.gratuitous, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy these books.

B001FB55YE|5.0|My aunt has been telling me about this movie ever since it came out. I finally after 2 years decided to purchase it, and what a great purchase it was. I love English movies, and this was full of funny, action packed drama. Had me and my friend laughing the whole time, and had us anxious to see what happened next! I loved all the characters in the movie, and the actors / actresses who they had playing the part,  you couldn't ask for a better cast. Glad that they will all be in the next one. I can't wait for \\"The Real Rock N Rolla\\" to come out.
B000JLTR8G|4.0|This was a sometimes interesting film, but not riveting.  A chance to catch a 1975 Robert Mitchum in Japan, though Takakura Ken's performance was more impressive.  I was ready to give this movie 3 stars up until the ending - when the fierceness of their devotion to honor did overcome my misgivings.  Prior to that I felt Mitchum's performance hadn't been overexciting, and the story in the second half resembled a 'Kung Fu' flick - Takakura Ken, the Japanese star, who did do a good job, looked a bit like Bruce Lee.      The DVD is presented in widescreen with subtitles in English and Portuguese.  There's a commentary by director Sydney Pollack and a 'vintage' featurette.  The caption on the case reads \\"A man never forgets. A man pays his debts.\\"      This movie is worth watching, but - though its message is noble - it suffers from pacing and other problems that do keep it from being the masterpiece some are making it out to be.
0786956291|5.0|Wizards of the Coast definitely got me with the nostalgia factor with the Red Box, a throwback to some of my favorite sessions of D&D with my cousins, a simplified version of the game that my older brother was playing with his friends. It always seemed like the basic set was more about the telling of great stories rather than being tied down by a bunch of rules.    Flipping through the box set tonight I see this same thing, a simplified introduction to a wonderful game.    This is definitely an upgrade to what I played before, each book has color illustrations, rather than black and white, a little more basic drawings than what you will find in the nicer hardcover books. But still a nice touch.    Bravo Wizards of the Coast on this, describing it to my wife tonight, I may be able to get her to sit for a game or two...maybe.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I was truly disappointed in the book. I thought that since they were making it into a movie, it would be pretty good. But, this was not the case.<br /><br />I found the first chapters interesting, but then it got very boring, and I couldn't tell who they were talking about and who was doing the talking. I still can't figure out why they called it \\"The girl with the dragon tatoo\\", when she really didn't have that much to do with the book.<br /><br />I've seen the trailors for the movie, and it looks very exciting. I hope it's better than this book. I was planning on buying the next two books, but I have since changed my mind. I'm glad I didn't buy them before I read this book.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I purchased this bundled with the larger Smith's sharpening system (which works fantastically).  I thought that it would be good to have on the key chain or in an emergency kit.  Looks like it may fill that roll alright, but I wouldn't trust it to give an edge to my more expensive knives unless the situation has really gone downhill.    All in all, it will fill the role, but not something to use when performing exacting maintenance on your collection.

0374158460|5.0|I read \\"Freedom\\" in two days over the Labor Day weekend. I've structured this review in two parts - impressions that I jotted down while reading it, with a few paragraphs that try to provide a synthesis.<br /><br />Scattered observations:<br /><br />*Writers probably can't ever ditch certain fundamental aspects of their style. With David Foster Wallace it's the slightly manic, ever-looping association of ideas as his brain connects his current thought to stuff you would never have imagined. Franzen seems unable to dodge the unevenness trap - brilliant for long stretches, interspersed with material that is either preachy, superfluous, or both.<br /><br />*Less powerful than \\"The Corrections\\" because his characters are less universal. Arguably they are all stand-ins for Franzen's own concerns and insecurities. Which are not uninteresting. But neither are they super-interesting.<br /><br />*Why are they all so uptight? Even when kicking over the traces, nobody seems to be having much fun.<br /><br />*So much emphasis on life's constraints and limitations. A \\"great\\" book/author should leave us with a heightened sense of life's possibilities? (Should it?)<br /><br />*Despite the superficially broad canvas, at the 400-page mark it feels really, really claustrophobic.<br /><br />*Clear pluses - writing is smooth; invariably, just when you feel you'll never get out of a particular dull patch, Franzen delivers something that's not just good, but kind of awesome. He can also be very funny.<br /><br />It's hard to provide a coherent summary. In its favor, \\"Freedom\\" is a very enjoyable read, it's structured very smartly (though this is obvious only in retrospect), and benefits from Franzen's ability to nail aspects of the culture with enviable precision. Its mixture of small-scale concerns (the Berglund family dynamics) with larger societal issues is laudable, ambitious, not entirely successful, but certainly a worthy and interesting effort. It does suffer from some of the Franzen tics mentioned above. The variation in quality (some characters are superbly realized, others remain flat), occasional bloating (Franzen's particular hobby-horses relating to the environment and population control get quite a workout), and restriction in focus (to a very narrow section of white, upper middle class intellectuals and their concerns) prevent it from being a great novel. There's also that sense of claustrophobia, bordering on joylessness, that hangs over much of the central part of the book, though this is mitigated somewhat towards the end, which was surprisingly powerful and quite moving.<br /><br />It is, nonetheless, a very good novel. Franzen cannot be blamed for the extraordinary hype that it has generated, and it shouldn't be held against him. Though I don't think \\"Freedom\\" quite matched the brilliance of \\"The Corrections\\", it's still one of the best books you're likely to come across this year.ers are superbly realized, others remain flat), occasional bloating (Franzen's particular hobby-horses relating to the environment and population control get quite a workout), and restriction in focus (to a very narrow section of white, upper middle class intellectuals and their concerns) prevent it from being a great novel.

B002GJT4YQ|5.0|Couldnt notice anything wrong with the blu ray. But it didnt totally blow my mind away like some movie comparisons.   The movie does come in a clever little box with some cards, nice if your a harry potter collector. I am not, so those things are useless to me. The only thing i cared about was the extended version, which was only 11? minutes. It wasnt long, you can totally notice when the scenes come up. Your wondering, was this in the movie?
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the best wireless headset guys! I had a Logitech G35 but I find that unit bulky and uncomfortable though the sound quality is superb but what I need is a headset that I can walk around the house because the wire is very annoying. So when the soundblaster wow wireless headset came out last year I bought one right away. But the only thing good about it is only the wireless and nothing else plus the reception is very bad.     Now this new logitech G930 I would say this is the best so far. This is how I rate it:  1. Comfort - 6 stars out of 6. Very light I can wear this all day.  2. Sound quality - 6 7.1 surround sound is really awesome.  3. Signal range - 5.9 this works as advertised though but I just wish it could go further more so I can't say it is perfect.  4. Design - 5.9 it does have a very light squeeky sound when you wear it but not too much unless you bang your head or rather I would say move too much.  5. G controls - 6 this is what I really miss the most with the wow soundblaster I have to go back to my computer just to pause/play but with the G935 G controls are programmable. When I watch a movie it is easier to press the control to pause/play the movie/music when it is needed especially when you are not right next to your computer.    I may have forgot some of the criteria but I hope this is enough. This is the very improved version of the G35 so do not hesitate buy. I never been excited to review a product but this one I just can't miss it. You may have a software problem at first but just reboot the PC 1 or more times then it will work fine which I had to reboot my pc twice before it worked fine which is wierd coz usually a program only asks to reboot once. I really love this product. Thank you Logitech! It is expensive but it is very worth it.
0756405890|5.0|All of the accolades that this book (and debut author) received are well-deserved. I read on Patrick Rothfuss' blog that he spent something like fourteen years crafting the world, story, and characters. Let's just say it's time well-spent, and the care given to all of these elements shows.<br /><br />Kvothe (pronounced almost like \\"quothe\\") is by and far one of the best real people I have ever read about. Character, what? Yes, he has character! He's not real, you say? LIAR! BEGONE FROM MINE EYES!! I saw him with my own two eyes...and I keep hearing his voice in my head; it's getting a little crowded in there.... Oh, and now you're saying the other voices aren't real either? THAT'S IT.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Fine, I'll finish the review. The people in this book are awesome, just like the name of the wind is awesome (and hard to spell). The description is another favorite of mine, because it elucidates the setting and/or the characters without interrupting the flow of story. It's really quite fantastic. It also has a very interesting non-linear narrative, switching from third-person present to first-person past narrative as Kvothe tells his story.<br /><br />So. Kvothe is a name of some legend in this world, but in the present storyline he is living the quiet life and mentoring a young man named Bast. Through his story, the idea of what it means to be a hero is thoroughly explored; through the heroic, unheroic, and the accidental Kvothe and the Hero become more than just characters on a page. There are also a lot of subtle pokes made at traditional fantasy fare (like using leagues as a measure of distance, or galloping madly from a town when there is an urgent rush, and other references that I can't recall off the top of my unwashed head), although in some ways, in exploring the hero, Kvothe's story is very traditional. He is and he isn't. It's hard to explain. I did enjoy the touch of arrogance and boastfulness that begins his story; it added some real old-school class, a la Beowulf. I enjoyed the lack of pretense regarding Kvothe's extraordinariness. You know the type: the main character seems ordinary, but extraordinary circumstances are thrust upon him/her, and oh...it's a hero! HERO IN A BOX, just add dragon, yours for only $24.99! (Don't get me wrong, I've read many stories like this and enjoyed them immensely, but this is a refreshing change.)<br /><br />Kvothe, from the beginning, is extraordinary and not only do others see it, but he knows it as well. And so what? This is the other side of the coin:  if extraordinary circumstances are not thrust upon the character, then the character is extraordinary and s/he finds those circumstances because s/he is on a Quest. This leads me to one of the things I enjoyed most about Kvothe's journey thus far: if his intelligence helps him out of extraordinary difficulty, it also, like as not, helps him into it. He's the example of \\"too smart for his own good.\\" So, despite his extraordinariness, there are many difficulties encountered.<br /><br />I found only one flaw with this book, and likely has more to do with my personal preferences than anything. It starts off slooooooow. Understand that it would be difficult to start a story with this sort of narrative another way, but that doesn't change the fact that it starts slow. Now, plenty of people don't mind this one bit. They like the slow buildup to more intense sequences. I, however, like to get tossed into the middle of some action, preferably with people being slaughtered in pools of their blood and dying dreams. I then crawl out from the wreckage, survey the scene, and savor trying to put the pieces together into a story. That being said, this story is ostensibly about Kvothe and so naturally when he begins to tell his story, he starts from the very beginning, his childhood. It's all very well-written, and from the perspective of the end of the book I can see that it probably wouldn't work in another format. But that doesn't change the fact that when I started reading this back in February, I got about 270 pages in and set it aside until recently in favor of some action-filled stuff (comics!). Call me simple if you will, but I have to read things all the time that I don't want to (college and such) so if I'm not as entertained as I want to be by my free-time reading, I'm not putting the time into it. Anyway, glad I picked it up again, because as a whole this book is PURE AWESOME.<br /><br />Read it!<br /><br />NOW.ack in February, I got about 270 pages in and set it aside until recently in favor of some action-filled stuff (comics!).

B000OHZJKK|5.0|Many people seem to regard This Year's Model as the best Costello album out there. I agree with most of this opinion, but naming it \\"his best\\" neglects his other important works. Elvis Costello's first 6 albums (excluding Almost Blue) work as an all-for-one/one-for-all outfit. But even so, I'd personally place This Year's Model as the initial masterpiece that sets the wheels of Costello's career in motion.<br /><br />After his first record, Costello came up with a set of songs that were even faster, more aggressive and cerebral. This Year's Model could be represented as Elvis' epitome of anger, and his most \\"New Wave\\" album out there. This is also the first album which gives full credit to \\"Elvis Costello and The Attractions\\", the most explosive combo to come out of the pub rock scene.<br /><br />If there is something that this album lacks is a passive mood; every song is bold, outspoken brutallity in the most fashionable way. The first four songs show off these characteristics; weather it's the smashing feeling of \\"Pump It Up\\" or the flow of rythm in \\"This Year's Girl\\".<br /><br />Initially, I felt that the album started to mellow at the beginning of the second half - maybe because of the great punch the first half of the record gives off. But if you get to listen to it a couple of times completely, all of the songs get stuck in your memory. \\"Lip Service\\" and \\"Lipstick Vogue\\" are great examples of this.<br /><br />The instrumentation of This Year's Model is flawless; loud but precise guitars, mood setting drums and the best use of moog/organ synthesizer I've ever heard in a rock album. The lyrics also come at their finests; the rhymes are mesmerazing and accurate. There is not one element of this album that I do not enjoy except maybe the song \\"Little Triggers\\" which I usually skip.<br /><br />As any other good album, it invites you to listen to it over and over again; it has the perfect timing for it to be memorable but not tedious. It also leaves you hungry for more Elvis Costello material, which as I stated on the beginning of this review, you are going to require!stated on the beginning of this review, you are going to require!
006145205X|5.0|This outstanding book shows why, since free market capitalism began the world's living standards have gotten better and better. He makes the case that as long as governments maintain order, provide justice, and protect individuals rights this can continue exponentially for centuries to come. The author explains the one thing that doomsday pessimists all had in common. They were all wrong, not a little wrong but absurdly wrong. Why has the world not been destroyed in the past with pollution, running out of coal, pollution disasters, and nuclear war? Doomsday predictions never take into account that when individuals are free to become millionaires and billionaires by inventing new technologies that increase standards of living they do, generation after generation. Everything continuously improves in free markets: cars run on far less gas, they pollute at much lower levels, fossil fuels are used more efficiently, electricity is invented, batteries are invented, governments enact environmental protection policies,technologies are invented that grow more and more food on less and less land. Also in game theory no nation would be foolish enough to fire the first nuclear bomb, unless they are insane.<br /> By trading with trading partners human intelligence has become collective and cumulative in a way that happened to no other animal. It has allowed people to specialize in one field and trade money for all their other needs. Unlike what people in our modern era believe, times before the industrial revolution were not Utopian. People were mainly agricultural and self sufficient, they lived in what we would consider today, abject poverty. Today the poor among us have far better living standards than most of the upper classes before the 1900s. We all have thousands of servants working for us in grocery stores, restaurants, mechanic shops, shopping malls, and lawn service or maid service if we choose. Even the majority of the poor have cable television, cell phones, internet access, air conditioning, heating, automobiles, clean drinking water, electricity,and medical care. What ancient emperor could have imagined such things? Or ever believed everyone could have access to them? We to often take for granted the unbelievable riches we experience in the modern world thanks to free markets and capitalism. These luxuries did not come out of the government or communist countries. They came from entrepreneurs being handsomely rewarded for their efforts when they raise the standard of living for everyone. The only danger the future holds is governments killing the goose that laid the golden eggs through over taxation, and criminal and political parasites breaking the system by taking what is not theirs and killing the motivation of the producers and traders to create and produce. This review does not do justice to the excellent book it is about. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an education on free markets through history and their amazing results on continuously raising standards of living for everyone. The future looks bright as the engines of capitalism are getting faster than ever.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|If you're a fan of the series SONS OF ANARCHY then you're probably aware of most of what happened in this season and want to pick it up on DVD to watch it again and again. If you're not a fan then you probably haven't seen it yet. I fell into that category and now find myself recording the third season which just began. This is a solid series that may take the low road, but remains interesting if nothing else.<br /><br />The Sons of Anarchy are a motorcycle club (what most would consider bikers), officially known as SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original). This group is the original band, the beginning of the club, though most have passed away. Originally started with 9 members, the club has expanded and as we've learned in season two is even international. Comparisons to the Hells Angels would be expected, but knowing their reputation for dealing in drugs and more the link isn't really there.<br /><br />The Sons deal mostly in illegal weapons and small time extortion, tending to protect the small town of Charming, CA that they live in rather than do it harm. They keep out drug dealers and meth heads, keeping the streets safe even if they do use a bit of violence to do so. The story never turns lose of the fact that these are dangerous men who do dangerous and illegal things and yet you find yourself rooting for them. Perhaps it's the biker mystique that has long been associated with freedom and a life without care. But those two things aren't found with the Sons as they have as many problems as anyone.<br /><br />As I said, I never saw season one, but from what I gathered, club president Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) made the decision to take out a member named Opie and by mistake that member's wife was killed. At the same time, vice president Jackson \\"Jax\\" Teller (Charlie Hunnam) was trying to decide what to do about the club having read his deceased father's \\"manifesto\\" wherein he discussed the fall of the club should things continue down the path they were at the time of his death. Jax knows of Clay's orders but doesn't let the club know. He'd rather attempt to save the club than see it destroyed from within. Add to that the fact that Jax' mother Gemma (Katey Sagal) is now married to Clay and the plot thickens.<br /><br />But that's just how the new season opens. Not only does Jax have to contend with attempting to reshape the club in a new mold, he has to continue helping with the old. While attempts by the ATF to shut down the Son have failed, setting up a new source isn't easy. Ties to the IRA are slow moving and personal grudges between members of both groups won't make for nice bedfellows.<br /><br />Worse yet is the arrival of someone new to town, a businessman with ties to a white supremacists group known as the League Of American Nationalists (LOAN). Ethan Zobelle (Adam Arkin) is sly and cunning, something the Sons haven't faced before. Hiding any connection to this group from the locals, Zobelle has plans in motion that will change the face of Charming forever. With his hooks already dug into the town's mayor, Zobelle will use this force to shut down the Sons and take over the town, allowing all the things the Sons prevent from running rampant and taking his cut as well.<br /><br />Along with this storyline we find the Sons becoming involved with a legitimate business due to the wife of one of their imprisoned members coming to them for help. That business is the porn industry and while it may be unsavory for most, it's a legit moneymaker that the Sons need while trying to restart their arms business. It's a business that Jax brings the Sons in to and that Clay wants nothing to do with.<br /><br />The crux of the show pits Clay and Jax against one another for various reasons. At the core is the knowledge that Jax has of Clay's actions as well as the resentment he has for the man his mother married. But both men deep inside want nothing more than for the Sons to continue on. They just have differentways of seeing how that will happen.<br /><br />Toss in the IRA double dealing, an ATF agent with a personal grudge, a chief of police who helps the Sons as often as possible and a deputy chief trying to keep things straight and you have a decent drama going on here. Best of all it doesn't rely on weekly fist fights of motorcycle chases to hold a viewers attention. It actually offers a story and some great acting to go with it. Perhaps the biggest surprise to some will be Katey Sagal's portrayal of Gemma, a woman who sees herself as the mother figure for the club, trying to keep it together as well as keep the two men who mean the most to her from killing one another. Forget Peggy Bundy, this role offers Sagal something that she can display her acting chops with. And when a twist in the story involving her comes out (sorry, for once no spoiler on that one), you'll feel so involved in her tale that you can't help but feel for her.<br /><br />As I said, the series revolves around a group of men who choose what most of us would avoid for both a lifestyle and for a profession. But as for offering great drama it delivers in spades. The show will hold your interest from beginning to end. I for one found myself watching it and thinking, perhaps I'll put in the next disc and see what happens. The next thing I knew it was 5AM and I'd spent the entire night watching the second season and setting the DVR for season three. It is that good.<br /><br />A word of warning for parents: the show is seen on FX and like many of their other series is definitely not for kids. Slight nudity and extreme violence are the norm for this group and visible throughout the series. Just a warning for those uninformed.IRA double dealing, an ATF agent with a personal grudge, a chief of police who helps the Sons as often as possible and a deputy chief trying to keep things straight and you have a decent drama going on here.

B000FQJAIW|4.0|...I only bought this for the 1977version of SW. I got sick and tired of watching greedo shoot first and all the fake looking CGI. Its really unfair to the fans how Luca$ wont clean up the 1977 version. I guess this is his way of getting back at the fans for hating The Phantom Menace.

They had been involved with each other and Iris still holds out hope that they will get back together. That is until she finds out that Jasper is engaged to be married to the woman that he cheated on her with. This leads her to be depressed. She wants to get away and list her house on a home exchange.<br /><br />Amanda who is a L.A. Movie trailer designer just broke up with her live in boyfriend and also wants to get away. She sees Iris' ad and they decide to switch houses for two weeks during the holidays.<br /><br />Iris loves L.A. and Amanda's house. During the time that she spends there she meets Arthur (played by Eli Wallach) an old Hollywood Producer and they become close as he tells her things about old Hollywood and she helps him regain some mobility so he can walk up the stairs at a reception in his honor. She also meets Miles (Jack Black) who is a composer who worked with Amanda's ex. As they spend time together they realize that there is a spark between them.<br /><br />Amanda does not like England so much at first. She is cold and board and shortly after she gets there she buys a return flight home. Then she meets Iris' brother Graham played by Jude Law. They end up having sex and after spending time together Amanda realizes that she is falling in love with him.<br /><br />A very good-feel good movie.
B002ZG9846|3.0|The aspect ratio of 2.40:1 is too narrow for acceptable viewing on a normal television set, particularly if you have below average eyesight. Avatar and the Walt Disney films such as Toy Story 3  are 1.77:1 or 1.85:1 which is much better. If you zoom in on a 2.35: 1 picture you lose too much of the peripheral action. It would be great if there were 2 versions, one in 2.35:1 for those who like that format and one in 1.77:1 or 1.85:1 for those who prefer those formats.

Somewhere on the ninth level is a guy named Adolf being forced to watch this over and over...    ...shudder...

0312330855|4.0|A charming collection of stories from the life of a 1930's veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. Herriot is as good a writer as he is a vet. Although, I believe I now know far more than I ever wanted to about the uteruses (uteri?) of various farm animals, I do plan to read the entire series. Herriot's prose and genuineness really capture a reader and leave one wanting more.
0785134352|5.0|A lonely young man decides to right the wrongs of the world the only way he knows how - by dressing up as a superhero called Kick Ass and wandering the streets for crime! News of his exploits spreads via YouTube and Facebook and soon he is a celebrity but not before he's beaten nearly to death during his first encounter with crime. He soon finds other \\"superheroes\\" though - the Red Mist, another young man with a costume but no real powers, and Hit Girl, a 12 year old girl with mad martial arts skills and a masked gun toting father. All roads lead to a mafia boss and Kick Ass soon finds out what it means to be a superhero.<br /><br />It's an excellent concept and Mark Millar writes a fun, witty script with dark overtones of a disenfranchised society. The characters are excellent and the story barrels along at a fast pace. Millar is quick to point out where comics heroes ends and real world heroes begins which adds to the overall strength of the book. John Romita's drawings are also top notch with a lot of gore to offset the cutesy \\"kids in costumes\\" concept.<br /><br />The book is almost the same as the film but with one notable exception - Hit Girl's father's motivations. They changed it to fit a more mainstream cinema crowd but Millar's original idea is fascinating and speaks volumes about the idea that grown-ups are supposedly grown up.<br /><br />An excellent comic book with a great script and fantastic art, forget any preconceptions you may have, this is as good if not better than Marvel and DC superheroes. Can't wait for the sequel.

B0032KNA4I|2.0|I am going to keep this short. This was not the worst movie I have ever seen, however it was pretty bad. The story line was... well... ridiculous. The special effects were too over the top. Throughout the entire film I kept thinking the effects, while on one level were impressive, they were so unrealistic that they suspended my 'suspension of disbelief'. The movie really did deserve one star, but as I recently sat through \\"Furry Vengeance\\" I could not in good conscience lump it at the same level.

It continually amazes me that Herriot is apparently just as skilled with a pen as he is a scalpel or syringe. Even 80 years after the occurrence of these events, his stories are captivating and strangely relevant.
0061914177|5.0|Great book on motivation, even if it was not written for that purpose.  The author does a great job of showing people that persistence pays off (and it does in most cases.)  I found a lot of the information in line with what I've seen, found, and heard in my experiences in Marketing - but he also talks about a few tactics that were new to me. I like the fact that he points out exactly what route he took as well as talks about what tools were used.<br /><br />If you are ever contemplating starting your own business, whether full time or on the side, this is a great read.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|First of all, I admit that I'm somewhat biased by being a big fan of the original Star Trek movies. I grew up with them, so I had to take into account my bias when I finally got around to seeing JJ Abrams' 2009 version of Star Trek the other day. Suffice it to say, I was highly disappointed.    My disappointment with this movie has a lot more to do than with just the original actors being replaced with new, younger actors. Although, that certainly plays a factor. NONE of the new actors drew me in. None of their performances were truly impressive. They were average actors playing average, and sometimes over-the-top caricatures of the original portrayals of these great and classic characters. I found myself particuarly annoyed by Karl Urban's \\"Dr. McCoy.\\" He was trying too hard to act the part just like DeForest Kelley. But that's on the low end of my annoyances. Anton Yelchin made me want to plug my ears every time he opened his mouth in his portrayal of \\"Chekov,\\" and I used to think Walter Koenig was bad. Now I think I can listen to Walter all day long. Simon Pegg's \\"Scotty\\" was satisfactory right up until he started to become annoyingly arrogant. John Cho, a Korean-American, as \\"Sulu?\\" Really? At least he made virtually no impact in the movie. And why was Zoe Saldana's \\"Uhura\\" in this movie at all? Abrams tried way too hard to make her a more significant character than she was before, but instead she came off as nothing but a cliched, stand-in love interest. Eric Bana as the villain \\"Nero\\" made no impact. He was perhaps the most boring and non-menacing villain of any of the ones I've seen in all movies, including TNG. A shame, too, because a much better villain could have brought this movie up a few notches. Villains make movies like this....See \\"Wrath of Khan.\\" Heck, even see \\"The Undiscovered Country.\\" Plummer was better than Bana. Both Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine were somewhat tolerable as \\"Spock\\" and \\"Kirk,\\" respectively, especially Quinto. Neither seemed over-the-top, and fortunately Pine didn't really try to act the part like Shatner. He'll never be Shatner, or Kirk for that matter.    One more thing to add about the actors is how they leave you with absolutely no feelings for the characters they portrayed. You simply don't care if they get hurt or die because they don't convince you to feel compassion for their plights. Their acting just isn't good enough. That also leads to the complete and total lack of chemistry between them. The original actors, when they got together to make the first \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture,\\" had worked together for years on the original series and they formed a true bond that you can't fake on screen.    As for the story itself? Wow, too much to discuss in this review, so I'll keep it short and to the point. There were far too many \\"conveniences\\" and cliches in this movie. Want to make sure Character A/B/C takes his/her proper place in the story? No problem, let's kill off this guy, and that girl, and get rid of the Captain in this manner so that so-and-so can take his proper place in the big chair. What's bad is that most of the conveniences take place within seconds, or minutes, all lined up in almost perfect order. (spoilers) What about when Kirk gets stranded with old Spock? Oh boy, we can't see that cliched ice monster(for lack of a better description) coming after him can we? What about the ultra convenience of there being a nearby base that old Spock apparently didn't know anything about(based on his facial expressions when they enter the facility), that somehow allows the story to both introduce Scotty and make sure Kirk and Scotty can get back to the starship at the same time? What luck for Kirk!! Oh, and wasn't old Spock supposed to stay there? And someone please, please tell me, was the little ugly rock-like creature that was some sort of aid to Scotty really necessary? Was he supposed to incite a few giggles and laughs from the audience? EPIC FAIL.    I know I learned from this story that you can plug a black hole with a mining ship like a cork in a water drain, a ship that had previously gone through a black hole without any problems. I also learned that you need to pointlessly blow that ship into bits, although the black hole itself should have torn it apart. I learned that a starship can eject its warp core to blow itself back out of the black hole, and still make its way home in a relatively timely fashion. I learned that a turbo lift from the shuttle bay can make it to the bridge in a matter of about 3 seconds, even though it's supposed to go both virtically and horizontally on its trip there.    This movie boiled down basically to a generic space adventure with some nice visual effects, albeit not nearly as encompassing as the trailers made it look. And on that note, was this Star Trek or Star Wars? Seemed more like Star Wars at times. The movie left me with no feelings one way or another. I didn't like it and I didn't hate it. It was just forgettable, as in one second after the credits started to roll. It's an absurdly overrated film by the critics, most of whom were probably just big fans of Abrams' hit series \\"Lost.\\" I don't recommend it unless you just want to add it to your Star Trek collection, which is why I bought it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found this book almost impossible to put down once it got going.  Everything about this book is interesting and compelling.  I think I would classify this book as an action/adventure book, but with a little bit of politics and romance thrown in to keep it interesting.  As a guy that doesn't read romance books, I was nervous that the romantic plot was going to overtake the book but it didn't, it was just the right amount to keep it interesting.      I was surprised to see this listed as a children's book because some of the violence did get a little disturbing.  But I would recommend Hunger Games to any teenager or older.    I read Hunger Games on the Kindle and did not notice any formatting errors or typos.
B00005YKSL|3.0|NOTE:  This review focuses mainly on the production quality of Garage, Inc., not the musical aspects.  Specifically, it is a warning for people who are interested in the 3-disc vinyl version.    I own the double cassette version and the triple vinyl version of this album (along with several MP3s; Yes I'm old school).  On a technical level, the cassette version is fine.  They really screwed up the vinyl version, specifically side 2 of disc 2 (The Garage Days Revisited tracks).  That entire side play WAYYYYY too fast, as if the disc was running at 45RPM (Yes, I made sure my TT was set to 33 1/3RPM).  It almost sounds like Alvin & the chipmunks instead of Metallica.  The other side of disc 2 plays fine, and discs 1 and 3 are perfect as well.  I have no idea what the producers and/or the QC staff were smoking when they made the vinyl version, but they really messed it up big time.      Do yourself a favor and get the CD version, or if you must have analog, you'll have to settle for the cassette version.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is one of disney's most beloved and classic films of all time. this movie is great for everyone. i just have one question. Where is Dumbo 2: There is a preview for Dumbo 2 on this disc and yet it's ten years later and no Dumbo 2. What Happened? Hopefully they will finally come out with it. Well all in all this movie is great.
B003PR77I8|5.0|I chose this vinyl + cd version because, obviously, I have both a turntable and a cd player. And the experience is invaluable!!!    About the music and the lyrics, I only need to say that they are as good as you can imagine and expect. DEVO are in the 21th century, so fresh and brilliant as they always are. DEVO are still DEVO!    I think the vinyl version of the album is not only for hard die fan. May be I am a nostalgic, but I think the good 80's bands was made for vinyl format. So, hear the A side and do the pause to turn the vinyl and hear the B side is a ritual, always a religious one. Even I feel the sound is better on vinyl... it's my experience. And I think I'm not the only one who feels that way, because vinyl is still a profitable format for bands and actual artists.    So, I cannot be impartial. If you can hear the brand new DEVO material on vinyl, you should do it. And if you want the digital version too, just buy this \\"Something For Everybody\\" (Blue-Colored Vinyl w/Bonus CD).

B002SQ364Q|3.0|Ang Lee's \\"Taking Woodstock\\" is a gloss on both the epic 1969 event and the epic 1970 documentary, of interest primarily to nostalgists. Taking place on the periphery of the event, literally and figuratively,the film has a cipher where the main character/performer should be. Elliot Tiber, the real life individual, must be more interesting than Demetri Martin plays him, else why make a movie based on his experiences? Interest by association?   At slightly more than 2 hours,this film could have been judiciously pruned or at least focused on more provocative supporting characters such as the festival hustler played slyly and seductively by Broadway and \\"Glee\\"'s Jonathan Groff and the most macho drag queen ever, incarnated by Broadway and Hollywood's uber actor Liev Schreiber. Imelda Staunton's thoroughly repulsive mother figure doesn't do the film any favors either.  The best that can be said for this film is that it continues Lee's sympathetic portrayals of gay characters (\\"Wedding Banquet\\", \\"Brokeback Mountain\\").
0545265355|5.0|The hunger games are a heart pounding non-stop action adventure filled with romance, deciet,and heart stopping tragedy. I suggest this to any thrill lover  because there are plenty of twists and turns
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It's a great read, as are the first two novels in the trilogy.  The writing (and translation) are superb, the twists and turns exciting.  Most importantly, it makes the reader think about good and evil, decision-making in organizations and society, and the legacies of corruption in government.
B003QCCS36|5.0|A very honest record start to finish... from the first listen  Looking at Ray's work and the tone and feel of each respective album, this seems to be a very natural progression and an honest reflection of where he's at in his life.  From Trouble's raw emotional ups and downs, to the more somber Till the Sun Turns Black, to the rhythmical Gossip in the Grain, I really felt this record showed Ray's 'coming to terms' with some of his personal demons; radiating a much happier feeling from the mouth of a country boy.  I felt the spirit of Neil Young in the air, coupled with the complexity and deep emotion that we've come to love from Ray's music.  One the great singer-song writers of our time, I hope he never stops making his music, honest, raw, and straight from the heart.    I cant wait to see what comes next!
0439023491|5.0|it came fast... and well it is a book so it depends if you like it or not but as far as the delivery it came real quick ...
B0026WNGBA|1.0|I enjoy reading on my Kindle, I would rather have all of my reading content on it.  I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble.  Until I saw that it was more than if I ordered the paper back.      What are the publishers thinking?  Does their greed know no bounds?  They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press?  Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?      While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost.  Amazon had it right when they launched the Kindle $9.99 for hot sellers, yeah I can get behind that but I can't get behind what the publishers strong armed Amazon into.
B00000I2PG|5.0|ABC's \\"The Lexicon of Love\\" is a lush, classy musical experience that is a definite listen for those only familiar with their singles.<br /><br />This is one of those albums where the non-hits are just as good as the singles.<br /><br />ABC basically bridged the gap between disco and the synth-heavy '80s dance music to come. I like to think of this album as a cross between Chic and Roxy Music. It has funky rhythm and a suave lead singer crooning clever lyrics. At times it is positively majestic.<br /><br />The album opens strong with \\"Show Me\\".<br /><br />The single \\"Poison Arrow\\" is next, and its influence can still be heard in the dance music of today.<br /><br />\\"Many Happy Returns\\" starts quietly but doesn't take long to heat up. The chorus has great drumming.<br /><br />The funkiest track, and my favorite, is certainly \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\" (not to be confused with the 1985 single by Northern Lights, Canada's answer to USA for Africa). This one tops the three hit singles on the LP, IMO.<br /><br />\\"Valentine's Day\\" starts out rougher than the other tracks, but a charming xylophone soon appears and although this song is largely instrumental it's my second favorite.<br /><br />ABC's biggest hit \\"The Look of Love\\" is next, and still sounds as good as it did in 1982. I love the wailing at the end \\"Yipee-i-ayyy\\".<br /><br />\\"Date Stamp\\" still has a dance beat, but seems more laid back than the previous cuts.<br /><br />The slower, mid-tempo \\"All of My Heart\\" was the follow-up single to \\"Look of Love\\".<br /><br />The weakest cut is \\"4 Ever 2 Gether\\". It's a little bit darker and different that everything else that has come before it.<br /><br />A few of the songs on this album end abruptly, but it's great from start to finish.
0515125024|1.0|For a book with guns going off constantly - this is elementary. But he knows nothing. Sorry I wasted my time.
0439023491|4.0|Wouldn't say this book was as good as the first. However, it held my attention and kept me wanting more. This one is a little slow starting...but picks up pace, so stick with it! I am excited to read the third.<br /><br />And as I said in the first book review, I would not let my child read this. Ever. Some people may see it fit to let a child read this series, but I do not. (Considering the series is about a yearly game where kids are put in an arena to kill each other and see who is the last one standing.)This book also had some pretty sexually suggestive material. Great for an adult, or late teens though! :)
0374158460|2.0|Okay, I'm on page 140 and I'm packing it in.  I can't continue, even though I know everyone says this book is amazing and is the must read of the fall.  I just don't get it.  I can see quite clearly that this is a very talented writer.  I think the only reason I have kept going this far is my enjoyment of his writing ability.  Each sentence seems carefully constructed and delicately nuanced.  In that regard, this book is a marvel (at least the 140 pages I've read).  So why am I packing it in?  These characters are so deeply unlikeable, I don't care a bit about what happens to them.  This is a peep into a family full of jerks, narcissists, doormats, alcoholics, drug addicts... I could go on and on.  Most have very few redeeming qualities and I did not feel that their lives were all that compelling. I'm sure that the remaining 400 pages only have more of the same, so I am over feeling annoyed and frustrated.  I need at least one character I can hang my hat on, and a narrative that seems to have some sense of direction.  I gave it 140 pages which seems to be the extent of my patience.  Good luck to one and all who attempt this journey, maybe you'll find treasures that I failed to discover.  Be sure and bring extra patience.
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|Stylish, nostalgic and certainly clicked as the motherlode in creating the successful \\"Ocean's 11-13\\" series. The story is simply about a man who has everything, therefore creates his own risky adventures in doing \\"the impossible\\" robbing banks and avoiding implication.<br /><br />Steve McQueen reminds one of an Americanized, Daniel Craig, very \\"James Bondesque,\\" yet also,\\" bad boy sexy. Faye Dunaway is gorgeous and superb as the unrelenting insurance investigator, set out to ensnare her culprit by any means, including seduction and calculated entrapment. The verbal parrying and physical chemistry are unsurpassed, symbolized by an erogenous chess game within the film.<br /><br />The more modern \\"Oceans\\" series with George Clooney are mentioned again, because the parallels are obvious with the \\"cat & mouse\\" pursuit, non-stop, drama, action and quizzical mystery of character actions. The split screens of activity were brilliant and avant garde in 1968! Sophisticated and daring, enthralling with a marvelous cast, direction and great musical score....good lord, the clothes rocked! I loved this movie....because it is timeless and the transfer to HD is superb.
0517543052|4.0|Very pleased with how quickly the books were shipped.  They arrived earlier than expected and in excellent shape.
1416550534|1.0|As a number of reviewers have noticed, this novel is quite startlingly derivative, literally from the first line on. I really have to wonder how she got away with it.  Did none of her editors ever read \\"Rebecca\\" or watch \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\"?  Or \\"Titanic\\" for goodness sake!
B0029O08WA|5.0|I love this soundtrack, and listen to it every evening as I lie in bed reading a Twilight Saga paperback book.
B003102JDM|4.0|I got a lot more from this subtle, provocative movie after reading some of the excellent reviews (GP, you ROCK!)...and will not attempt to pretend i understand \\"Schrodinger's cat\\" or the eccentricities and significance of modern, or traditional, Judaism. The movie has great depth and incomparable symbolism, however, I would offer one suggestion....you really have to be in the \\"Coen Mood\\" to appreciate this movie. I am going to re-watch the Big Lebowski...and am thrilled about potentially new perceptions...
0765326353|5.0|There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said by previous reviewers. The imagination Brandon has astounds me. In fact, I can safely say that out of all of Brandon's magic \\"systems\\" that Stormlight is definitely my favorite.     I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, well-rounded characters, unique environments, awesome action sequences, etc. Heck, I would recommend this to anyone who knows how to read.
0451219597|3.0|I just wanted to emphasize what another reviewer said.  I used to read all the Follet back in the day of Pillars.   However, i actually have a paranoid belief that he does not write all of his books.  Sure Pillars and Needle are incredible, but it is hard to believe the same guy is writing this and Pillars and World Without End.  i have had this feeling on other Follet books.  that is why i quit reading him circa Dangerous Fortune.  This triangle of WWII books is like they took Needle and told a staff guy to go and write two more like it.  Anyway it remains a decent read but nothing like his two Novels.
B000006NX5|3.0|I had a little trouble deciding whether I should put three or four stars here.  Of the eight songs, five of them are \\"background\\" music that easily fades one into the others.  But only one of them is a clunker that needs to be hauled away.  The other three songs are great!  I have caught myself humming along to them, tapping my foot, etc.  Romantic?  Why not?

B002SJIO5E|2.0|I admit the final half hour or so of this was extremely good, but I hated it virtually from the first few minutes.<br /><br />Several believability problems:<br /><br />1.  Housing the aliens wouldn't have been a hassle!  For something like that, countries would be vying to host them -- for research purposes, if nothing else.  The UN would probably have to maintain a waiting list.<br />1.  How are you gonna fit 1.5 million creatures in that ship?<br />2.  Civilizations in which when the leader dies, the masses are helpless and directionless are not civilizations that perfect interstellar travel.<br />3.  The ship wouldn't have flown at the end!  It had been there for like 20 years!  Human engineers would have torn that thing apart by then!<br />4.  Humans would have been able to activate the aliens' weapons by using their severed limbs.<br /><br />So literally the movie is impossible to swallow.  This leaves us with its allegorical meanings.<br /><br />This, also, was repugnant.  Not for a second could I buy the filmmakers' heavy-handed metaphor of the aliens as refugees.  Are they trying to say the prejudice against aliens is analogous to the prejudice against immigrants in our own society?  If so, they could have done a much better job showing how the fear of aliens might have some rational underpinnings.  As it was, it was as if the humans' fear and hatred of the aliens was completely baseless.  If we had been told that the aliens had had, say, some equivalent to Koran 47:3, then the movie wouldn't have struck me as so simplistically one-sided.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry knows how to create the perfect anthem for any occassion or mood. And Teenage Dream doesn't disappoint. If you think 'California Gurls' is a catchy tune to get your foot tapping, just wait until you hear the rest of the album. It's a perfect album for blasting in your car on a road trip with the top down!    HM
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm a lifetime Beatles' fan, and have been playing this 'Love' album frequently since it was first was released.  All I can think when I listen to this album is one word: \\"Whatever.\\"  It is almost ridiculous how talented and innovative the Beatles were/are.  Kinda makes me wonder why anyone else has bothered since...

0811876373|5.0|I had forgotten that I had preordered my Cake Pops book and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  Then I was super excited and couldn't get it out of the box fast enough.  This book is amazing.  I love all the little tips and tricks, I love that it's sprial bound and I love all of the amazing photos.  This past June a friend and I even started a business making cake pops and we are doing quite well!!  I love how you are only limited by your own imagination.

B000KC86F4|1.0|Hey, why did you ship me a blu ray with a broken case. How are you expecting me to keep the blu ray, very disappointing on your act.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The pair of these I have I think I bought in 1995, and they're still kicking.  I bought those new spongy in ear headphones because they looked like a good idea, but when I'd get really running and sweating, the one in my left ear would start crackling from the seal and sweat.  Yuck.  Annoying.  So, after those finally gave out I somehow re-located my old pair of these Sony's and after running in them this week I don't know why I ever quit wearing them.  I thought they had stopped making them!  Yay!
B00005JKDR|5.0|We LOVE this movie....it is funny and it is just an all around good movie!!!!!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Don't go by the first few chapters of this book.  I almost didn't keep reading it because of the financial/political background of Sweden in the beginning but I kept telling myself it had to get better because of the great reviews it has.  Once the story started, I could not put it down.  The same with the two sequels.  I was sorry when I finished the third in the series, I want to keep reading about Salander & Blomkvist, I feel like they were a part of my life.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|This movie replaced the first one we bought, due to my son playing it over and over again. We love the movie as parents. Very Funny
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Saw the movie and had to have the music-haunting, passionate, uplifting and gut wrenching all at the same time.  It leaves me speechless.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|After seeing the first two Twilight movies and the big glaring omissions they left out from the books or completely changed, I was very afraid that my favorite book in the saga would be ripped to shreds and the movie would be horrible.  Because that's what happened with Twilight.  We ended up with over two hours of Kristen Stewart stuttering her way through a love story with a vampire.  New Moon, wasn't much different, except she was stuttering with werewolves.  So, I could only imagine what they would do with Jasper's backstory (which was one of my favorite parts of the book), the big fight sequence at the end, and the near sex Bella and Edward have.<br /><br />Thankfully, David Slade (whose movies I have never seen, because I have a strong aversion to bones being broken) came through, and made this movie shine like the saga should've been handled from the beginning.  There was humor, great action, passion, jealousy, and believable vampires.  For the first time, Jackson Rathbone shined as Jasper, because he wasn't hidden in the shadows like they had him in the first two movies.  Kristen Stewart, seemed believable (even with the crappiest wig on Earth) when she kissed Jacob.  I still have issues with her ability to kiss her supposed real-life boyfriend who plays her immortal beloved in the movies.  I think the thing that grabbed my attention was the lack of chasteness.  In the first two books, Edward and Bella have strong lusty feelings.  But for some reason, they were more suppressed in the film.  Finally in Eclipse, the hesitancy is gone and it was much closer to the book in content.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Obviously, you shouldn't have pre-conceived notions about the movies/books, but this one is definitely the best of the series.
0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris has always been dry, clever and often quite funny. When You Are Engulfed in Flames starts out familiarly so, with some entertaining stories and some stories falling flat. If you make it through the first half and have had a pretty good laugh but wouldn't put it up there, prepare to be amazed.<br /><br />In the second half, David Sedaris shows his pure talent, pushing life to the edge with beautiful wit, sarcasm and the best dry humor around.<br /><br />His Japan segment is sheer brilliance as he recalls his quite interesting and hilarious tales in a foreign country - but the other stories don't disappoint either. A must read, Sedaris ups his game to a sometimes relatable and always hilarious level. Never have I been more enthralled in Sedaris' work and I'm a big fan and have read most.<br /><br />Throughout the beginning, some of the dry humor just really isn't that funny and at some points it seems almost as if its trying to be funny and loses the dry quality. The Harvard essay just didn't hit me that well, with some well placed jokes but what really came off as an uninteresting, mildly humorous tale. I've often found that Sedaris does his best when observing the life around him, not when creating a fictional world.<br /><br />His family interactions aren't presented in a new light in the early, yet still funny, chapters and there are some hilarious stories but still nothing compared to the second half, a brilliant observance of mere life.
0385484518|5.0|Book was in almost perfect condition other than some wear on the paper jacket which was disclosed up front.  Received it in the time advertised.  Will absolutely use this seller again in the future.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Four of us bought this headset, and it sounds good but not great. Comfort is good.  The mic came broken for my brother and was replaced.  All of us have problems with the mic cutting out to the point where even a brief conversation isn't possible.  The bass on one of the headsets has gone completly out at about 4 months.  Not a good value.
B002ZG997C|2.0|A cat is killed in the opening scene for food, yet Denzel is kind to a rat, who he feeds some of the cat meat to. It made me know right away that I wasn't going to like this. The desert town he goes to is too old western cowboy. The world is desolate now, yet everyone still has stylish sunglasses? And where do they get the gas to power their cars and even motorcycles? The \\"twist\\" didn't gel with the rest of the movie. I only gave 2 stars instead of one because the fight and action sequences were well shot and edited along with the cinematography.    SPOILER ALERT    At least the intentions of Gary Oldman's character of wanting to use the bible to control the masses was a breath of fresh air because it rings true to how most fanatical Christians were... still are. And if the bible is what caused the war that lead to the apocolypse, how then can the last surviving copy help and save the rest of mankind? Too many holes in the story.
0786955570|4.0|I got the opportunity to play through Castle Ravenloft with a couple different groups of people at the PAX convention during the first weekend of September and was thoroughly impressed. The game is a great one-nighter for anyone who's played Dungeons and Dragons before, and a quick and easy introduction to the role-playing game for anyone who's never played before. Themes and some basic mechanics from the D&D game are kept in place, though greatly simplified allowing players of almost any age to jump in and have a great time. I probably wouldn't recommend trying to play with kids under ten though, the game is a bit harder than the average board game.  The game includes a large number of unpainted miniatures that are to-scale and pulled from various past D&D minis products, so even if you're unsure how long you and your friends will stay interested in the game, it still has great value for fleshing out any other D&D genre games you might play.
B003QNXPUK|3.0|The surface area covered by this product is not what I would call Maximum Coverage. It does fit well and installation only took about 5 minutes per phone. We have two iPhone 4 and went with this product due to the replacement offer and how well it protected our 3Gs phones. There are some edges left exposed so I do not consider this maximum coverage and the small side strips probably do not solve the antenna issue under all situations since you hand can still touch the surface.    Since we use the OtterBox Defender, the less than Max coverage was not a concern to us. A plus we found is that the iPhone with the Max Coverage shield fits in the iPhone Otterbox Defender case. Something you could not do with the 3Gs and full body invisibleShield.   The only modification we made was to remove the Otterbox stock shield, which you can leave on if you choose.    Overall its a good product but I would not use my iPhone with this product alone. If it did not fit in the Otterbox I would have taken it off.
0143034901|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me by a friend and I loved it.  The book has a tale with a parallel tale going on at the same time and it was wonderful to realize that.  Very satisfying novel.
B002RWKSII|4.0|When the Gershwin estate asked Brian Wilson to go through the catalog and give his special California spin on songs that are almost 100 years ago, Brian initially didn't think he could do any of them justice. It took his wife, Melinda, to tell him \\" C'mon You're Brian Wilson!\\"    Brian Wilson ReImagines Gershwin is wonderful.  It's a beautiful, almost child-like redo on songs that are approaching a century of age.  These are songs that your grandparents danced the night away too, and their parents before them.   Make no mistake, some of the songs featured here are familiar to younger generations as well.  Songs like, Summertime, I Love You Porgy, and I Got A Crush On You, are done stunningly, and feature Wilson's signature ear for arrangements. Brian does a truly fabulous job at spinning these old standards into modern songs  with flair and surf jazz sync.    Wilson, who has one of the greatest singing voices ever recorded, took singing lessons before hand to get his vocal range where he felt it needed to be to make Reimagines Gershwin a success.  He's 68 years old, and he's still making this amazing music, that no one can duplicate.    Brian's usual backing band is here in place again and to amazing effect.   They are easily the greatest group of musicians ever assembled to play this music or any other type.   Interestingly, listening to Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin allows one to easily see where Brian's influences stem.  This go around, he's employing recording techinques and instruments, that you haven't heard on a Brian Wilson produced record, since the Beach Boys's Pet Sounds (1966).    Sadly, while Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin will no doubt earn him a Grammy nomination, the album and it's subject matter might alienate younger listeners /record buyers who may have caught the Brian Wilson bug on his legendary Smile (2004) and Lucky Old Sun (2009) releases.  But without a doubt, Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin is a must own.  Put on tuxedo, pick up yourbest girl, smoke a cigarrette or two, and dance the night away under the stars with this record.
B0000AFX64|5.0|Being a fan of the new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" show, with it's many layers of depth and emotion, I can understand where modern viewers might see the original \\"movie\\" (The first two episodes of the series) is dated, campy, and a little cliche...but having been a huge fan of the series as a ten year old, I can say that watching this was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The transfer is about what you'd expect; nothing that will win any awards, but good enough by far to be watchable and enjoyable. Not too much to speak of in special features, but that's not what anyone that buys this would really be interested in.<br /><br />All in all, if you are an old fogey like me, and a sci-fi fan from way back, this is a definite must have for your collection; and with it's old-fashioned, late seventies/early eighties mentality, it just might hook a younger, less-jaded audience as well.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I expected a little more drama and \\"in between the lines\\" info on the music business. Movie was very good. The idea was a good one but it did not make it very clear what happens to artists who arent business minded. Only a person who is in the music industry would understand that the artists portrayed in the film were getting taken advantage of... To everyone else it would just be an enjoyable film...
6305546789|5.0|There's not a lot that can be said about this awesome piece of horror art that hasn't been said: John Carpenter and company, with a small budget but a huge vision crafted a tale for the ages.<br /><br />Simplicity is the key to this movie: Yes, the Rob Zombie remake (which I'm NOT dissing, I enjoyed it on it's own merit) gave us more of a backstory, humanized the character of Michael Myers, and gave us some insight into why he is and what motivates him...but the original proves that all of that wasn't really necessary.<br /><br />What works in Halloween is that you DON'T know what caused this little boy to go off his rocker; it raises the possibility that the boogeyman is a REAL thing; Myers is more of a force of nature than a troubled youth that fell into madness; he is instead an unstoppable evil that wreaks it's havoc on that one night that all is free to roam the earth...<br /><br />...and that's what's so frightening. There's not any gore to speak of, but the dread that the story, cinematography, and the chilling score builds in your heart is a palpable thing. The fine cast really puts forward the fact that terror has come to the little town of Haddonfield, and even the good Doctor Loomis, who's had fifteen years to figure it out, doesn't really know what the hell precipitated this rampage...nor just what it IS in the masked spectre that makes him what he is.<br /><br />The simple fact is that he is OUT there, and he is looking for...maybe YOU.<br /><br />What explanation do you really need?
1603425381|5.0|This is the best crochet border book that I've ever seen.  It has an amazing assortment of ideas and the patterns are well written and also include a stitch diagram for those of us that like a good crochet chart.  I love that it shows you how to do the math to find out if a border will fit into your project or how to make it fit.  BUT, my favorite aspect is that the patterns show you how to turn a corner. This is something I've never seen in a borders book before.  Sooooo awesome.  My new favorite crochet book - hands down.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|OK, so \\"Flash Gordon\\" just doesn't compete with \\"Star Wars\\"...but it was never MEANT to.<br /><br />I mean, really; Scorsese makes \\"The Departed\\", which wins best picture and is arguably one of the best cop dramas ever made...does that make us like \\"Starsky and Hutch\\" or \\"Law and Order\\" any less?<br /><br />Of course not, it's like comparing apples to oranges.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I have to say that this early 80s incarnation of the comic strip and serial hero from long ago is one of the most entertaining movies to come out of that era in it's genre.  You had it all; really REALLY bad guys (Max Von Sydow as the ruthless Ming the Merciless really seemed to have the time of his life here), flaxen-haired, burly really GOOD (and I mean from the titular Boy Scout to the seemingly selfish but gold-hearted princes of the realm) good guys, beautiful maids on BOTH sides, and enough laser blasts and over the top explosions to make anyone happy.  Add to that the inspired soundtrack by Queen, and you have one heck of a Saturday afternoon worth of enjoyment...I suspect the same kind of enjoyment that was inspired by the serials way back in the day, with the similar cliffhanger elements and rapid fire sequencing.  There's a touch of Indiana Jones as well as Luke Skywalker in our hero here, and I suspect his spirit may inhabit the both of those descendants a little bit.<br /><br />The film was intentionally done as a \\"live action comic book\\", and the dialogue and costumes show it, but if you are looking for a fun, sentimental ride where the bad guys are bad and the good guys are good, something you and the kids can watch and ALL of you enjoy it, you could do an awful lot worse that joining Flash, Dale, and Zarkov in their efforts to keep earth safe from the tyrannical Ming.
0425180638|2.0|It's been obvious from the last couple of books that Cornwell was determined to make some significant changes to the long-running Scarpetta series. Signs of the characters' unhappiness and frustration with their lot were telegraphed as far back as 'Point Of Origin', and were woven thickly into the narrative of 'Black Notice'. So it wasn't a surprise to me that 'The Last Precinct' seems designed as a complete re-boot of the series. Okay, I thought, this is the book where all the loose ends from previous books will be tied up, and some fascinating plot and character revelations will drive the series forward into new and exciting territory. Fair enough.    Except, it doesn't do any of these things. At least, it doesn't do them well.     'The Last Precinct' is terribly forced and clunky novel. While it does try to clear the decks and start the series afresh, it's done in a very jarring, ham-fisted way. Major plot and character twists are suddenly flung at you out of nowhere. Oh by the way, Lucy created some IT gizmos years ago and is now a millionaire gun-for-hire who's set up an independent law facility with her old ATF boss. You know what, Scarpetta decides she really doesn't love her job anymore and wants to resign. Did we forget to mention, yeah everything you thought you knew from 'Black Notice' was a lie or a mistake. And do you realise that nearly every event since 'The Body Farm' was actually part of giant years-long intertwined conspiracy? Yeah, well it was. I'm not exaggerating, this really is how events play out. If there was even a hint of these plot elements in earlier books, it might not have been so bad, but having all these \\"Facts\\" thrown together in one book just makes it seem convoluted and unconvincing.     Ditto the character development, with Scarpetta turning into a flaky, paranoid shell of the woman she once was, for no apparent reason. Scarpetta has previously had her home invaded ('Postmortem', 'Body Of Evidence'), been put on trial on flimsy evidence ('Cruel And Unusual'), and had corrupt politicians and police trying to do her over (nearly every book). Her solution has always been to stay strong and focussed, and battle her way through knowing that truth was on her side. Seeing her fall to pieces, jumping at shadows and distrusting everyone she knows, is grossly out of character for her. And the way she basically \\"gives up\\" by resigning and walking away....that's not the Kay Scarpetta we know.     The book also suffers from its long-winded rehashing of 'Black Notice'. Cornwell uses the investigation into Scarpetta as an excuse to have Kay, her psychoanalyst friend Anna, and prosecuter Jaime regurgitate nearly everything from 'Black Notice' in great detail. Most dedicated fans would have read this book, so why the need to repeat everything at such great length? Even more frustratingly, despite its long convoluted build-up, the book ends very abruptly, with many issues left unresolved. So despite its length, there's not much that actually happens in the book. And despite being designed as a re-boot, it leaves all these new plot and character devices hanging, with no resolution.     Really, there's not much positive to say about this book, and Cornwell makes a real mess of what could have been the key novel in the entire series. Unfortunately, if you're a dedicated fan of the series and want to see the plot points of 'Black Notice' dealt with, you pretty much have no choice but to read this whether you like it or not. The Scarpetta series apparently goes downhill big time after this; with 'The Last Precinct', it looks like the rot has already set in.     Two stars.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan as long as I have conscious memory; I've thoroughly enjoyed all the movies and series, but the Original Series has ALWAYS been my favorite. I grew up watching it in syndication, had the first two seasons on VHS which I eventually wore out, and have read countless of the novels, mostly focusing on the original Enterprise and her crew...I'm one of \\"those guys\\" who can tell you planet names, ship classifications, et al...proudly, I might add...so it was with no small amount of concern that I approached this \\"re-imagining\\" of what to ME was an integral part of my childhood, and still a large source of enjoyment to me as an adult.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" is set in the Ozarks during a hard winter for a 17 year old girl taking care of her dirt poor family.  Her mother has had a nervous breakdown, and her father has jumped bail for charges of making methamphetamine.  The 17 year old, Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), has had to grow up fast, and take on parenting her two younger siblings.  They are living on the edge - almost starving - when she learns from the local bail bondsman that her father put a lien on their home.  The sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs her that her father, Jessup, has not shown up for his scheduled court appearance, and she only has a week to find him.  Ree feels the overwhelming responsibility of making sure the family can keep the land and home, their only asset and place to live.  She steels her spirit and is determined to keep the house and property.<br /><br />Ree sets out to find her father, knowing her life could be in danger as well.  She has many confrontations, and a physical beating by the local farmers to keep her off her father's trail.  The worst thing in the community is to be a \\"snitch\\".  She hears rumors that her dad was killed in a methamphetamine brewing session that went wrong.  She does not believe it, but continues to confront her father's pals in his drugged life.  Her Uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes) helps her in a round-about way, as well as a crusty old hag named Merab (Dale Dickey) who knows more than she lets on.  The whole community is covering up for the illegal drugs and bad habits of their \\"clan\\".  The ties that bind are revealed through their squalid, near Neanderthal living conditions.  The community reminded me of junkyard dogs all fighting for a bone, but bonded by blood and experience.<br /><br />Slowly clues add up for Jessup's fate and Ree's realization she has to carry the full responsibility of family.<br /><br />The movie is rough and tender, a fantastic story of strength when life is cold and cruel.  \\"Winter's Bone\\" is fabulous in all facets, the noir cinematography<br />and location all combine synergy with a great story and fantastic acting by the entire cast.cinematography   and location all combine synergy with a great story and fantastic acting by the entire cast.
0800177177|4.0|I was excited back in the day when this film was released; one of my best friends and I were ardent horror fans back then, and had both often talked of someone doing \\"Dracula\\" as it was written...I had seen Franco's \\"Count Dracula\\" on late-night television, but was anxious to see a big budget, and hopefully even more faithful, adaptation of Stoker's work.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed, per se, although I did have a major issue (more on that in a minute), but overall, I very, very much enjoyed the movie. The pageantry and scope of the scenery was marvelous. I was spellbound by the cinematography, and the eerie shadows and unearthly feel of the film, especially the sequences in Castle Dracula. I was a little put off by the red, Oriental-appearing garb that the Count wore in the beginning (although I understood the symbolism), but all in all Coppola's style and techniques made the film a very well-woven tapestry of dread and gothic style.<br /><br />As far as performances go, I thought all of the acting was very well done (although I'm not a fan of Keanu Reeves' wooden style), but the standout to me was Anthony Hopkins. I dare say that his portrayal of Professor Van Helsing is the DEFINITIVE version...I take nothing from Peter Cushing, but from the book, I always pictured him as more of a swashbuckling, mystical man, one who spoke his mind and was perhaps a bit irreverent in his conviction...in short, EXACTLY as Hopkins performed him.<br /><br />Now, for my issue: I was disappointed with the whole \\"reincarnation of lost love\\" theme that Coppola went with. Not only is this an old trick (Dan Curtis did it with the TV Dracula in the 70's, and I wasn't crazy about it then), but had no place in the novel at all. The only love story in the NOVEL is the love of the men who would sacrifice all to save a virtuous woman from the blackest of evil. I had looked forward to a monstrous and menacing Dracula as he was in Stoker's story, and while Oldman did a brilliant job, I was chagrined at the character being so sympathetic and played as a romantic lead. Whereas it did the movie in and of itself justice, to proclaim to be \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", the addition of this element flew in the face of that claim. While I know this was done to draw a larger audience, the movie could have been as well done and beautiful without this contrivance.<br /><br />A very good movie, in every way, and I highly recommend it...would have been a five-star rating if not for that one glaring departure from the story.cter being so sympathetic and played as a romantic lead.

B000W4KT64|2.0|Hollywood should have left the original version alone, the remake is just awful and loses the spirit of the play.  It is full of energy and starts out fresh, but soon gets bogged down with a overdoing a heavy message on racism, which the first movie kept in perspective for a light and fluffy teen musical.<br /><br />It was fun to look back through rose-colored glasses at 1962 and overall simplistic view of the times.  The first movie was better - even though this version of \\"Hairspray\\"  was fun seeing John Travolta in drag.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|There's not a lot, either good or ill, that I can say about this little film that hasn't already been said, but I did want to interject my opinion to throw in with those that DID enjoy it.<br /><br />I realize a lot may find it disappointing (and with all the hype surrounding it, this was inevitable), and I remember all the fallout after \\"Blair Witch\\", and thus find it no surprise that so many people didn't enjoy it...but still, I have to say that I really did like it. Granted, it leaves a lot to your imagination, but that to me (and to Hitchcock, and quite a few others) is where the real terror lies; I can create something far more horrific (and believable, to me) in my mind than any special effect, regardless of how good, can ever accomplish. This film, with it's small budget and broad vision gave us, in my opinion, just enough visually to get the subconscious wheels rolling well, and that to me is where a true horror movie lives.<br /><br />Everyone is entitled, and I can understand how in our jaded society, many head to the movies to see everything laid out before them; they want to be swept up and not have to do any thinking...and that's all well and good...I like a film like that myself every now and then...but for something that hearkens back to stories around the campfire or told in the dark of night, where the screen is inside your head, one could do a lot worse than Paranormal Activity.
B00006GA48|3.0|It must still shock people to realise that Mark Farner---whose sense of self-importance married uncomfortably to his absolute inability to write message songs that a) had all that much substance; and, b) evolved rhetorically (not even his staunchest defenders ever accused him of being anything resembling a poet) even two steps past simplistic, platitudinous sloganeering and hectorings (which only seemed to emerge every third or fourth line)---had one genuinely subtle, even poetic message song in him during Grand Funk Railroad's initial peak . . . and the title track to their third album was it. And it was also the one song above and beyond anything else this lot produced, before or after, that qualifies as a no-questions-asked rock masterpiece. (Which is saying something, considering their albums were going platinum and their concerts were going sold out, fast, as a matter of routine; and, they had a pleasant run of crunchy, radio-friendly hit singles in their none-too-distant future . . .)    One doubts that the earnest enough Farner was sophisticated enough to have thought extensively about it (he has said since that writing the song began with him fiddling on a guitar and falling by happenstance upon the strumming mode on which the song was built in the first place), but his metaphoric marriage of an mutinied Ahab to contemporary (read: 1969-70) alienation and the Vietnam War was at least as daring as anything more conscious protest writers were fashioning at the time, not to mention affecting. That he resisted his usual career-long temptation to lapse into teen preacher mode is very much to his credit; there are few lyric lines in rock and roll more chilling than \\"I can feel the hands of a stranger/And they're tightening 'round my throat,\\" few more affecting than \\"If you return me to my home port/I will kiss you, Mother Earth.\\"     Farner bound his unlikely lyric to music that saw and raised influences as apparently unlikely, given Grand Funk Railroad's then-customary piledriving squall of sound, as the Monkees, from whose \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\\" he borrowed the introductory guitar lick; Creedence Clearwater Revival, from whose \\"Proud Mary\\" he must have been inspired toward the lower-range guitar break that carries his compromised ship toward its final and unforgettable crescendo of a cruise; the Beatles, whose \\"Hey, Jude\\" inspired God knows how many others to try variations on its famous coda, among whom only Farner and his partners succeeded in forging (with a little help from the then-uncredited Cleveland Orchestra, whom producer/manager Terry Knight engaged for the project in a separate session) a genuinely affecting and universal variation that was entirely their own; and, the Velvet Underground, whose scratchy rhythm guitar style informs Farner's here (as on no few Grand Funk tracks, incidentally). While we're at it make note that Mel Schacher often sounds like he's playing a tandem rhythm guitar as well as his trademark rock-bottom bass, and Don Brewer executes some of the most (I know, you never thought you'd see this word applied to him) subtle drumming of his life.    Above and beyond that larger-than-life title track (and Grand Funk critics otherwise might care to remind themselves that far better bands and writers haven't always come up with something that compelling), however, there was still an entire album to hear in order to get to that track in the first place. In terms of the album, \\"Closer to Home\\" sounded at first like a kind of day of reckoning for the trio---having cranked out two albums whose flat production almost made the performance-oriented songwriting and squall-of-sound playing unlistenable as often as not, Grand Funk delivered as listenable an album as their power-trio incarnation would ever offer. Listenable, that is, in terms of being able to sit through it without feeling as though your brains had been bludgeoned.    In terms of the writing and playing, it goes this way: 1) \\"Sin's a Good Man's Brother,\\" the leadoff track, and acoustic guitar strumming intro aside (a nice enough touch, that), basically finishes what Blue Cheer's \\"Gypsy Ball\\" began and completes the blueprint for Black Sabbath, which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you think of Black Sabbath, even if Farner's reedy tenor isn't exactly a great vocal match for that kind of metal. (On the other hand, it's also one of his better message songs, too, using implication and question rather than flat pronouncements and hectorings to listen up, and the title alone is worth the ticket.) 2) \\"Aimless Lady,\\" whose lyric seems to anticipate the ribaldry of \\"We're an American Band\\" by a very different Grand Funk, is further evidence that this trio couldn't shuffle with authority to save their hides. 3) \\"Nothing is the Same\\" takes off entirely from Schacher's murderous bass riff, though at times it seems to have a problem plotting course once airborne. 4) \\"Mean Mistreater\\"---in essence \\"Heartbreaker\\" re-imagined with electric piano taking the guitar's place---does what the earlier song does and threatens to make you root for the object of the singer's scorn. 5) If you have a thing for snoozeable jamming, \\"Get it Together\\" should please you, at least until the lyric---consisting entirely of the title---is heard from what sound like inebriated hookers trying to sing over in-service tongue depressors. 6) \\"I Don't Have to Sing the Blues\\" is about as close to stripped and whipped rock and roll as this version of Grand Funk ever got; it would have made an intriguing proposition as a single, from the opening guitar lick to the quick-and-dirty riffing that bridges song to the brief but breathless coda, even if you take the song's title as a kind of sneer (at their acknowledged models, Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience?) considering they never sang or played the blues in the first place. (And probably wouldn't have known what to do with themselves if anyone suggested they try, \\"Time Machine\\" from their first album notwithstanding.) 7) \\"Hooked on Love\\" is the far more typical platitudinously preachy kumbaya messagemongering you came to expect from Grand Funk, and probably lasts about five minutes too long in the bargain, even if the minute-and-a-half jam midway through is probably the best such exercise in their early canon.    All of which makes \\"I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)\\" look even better than it already does. In the day of its original release, most who weren't Grand Funk die-hards but bought the album after their Funkophile friends gave them the taste of the title track that compelled the purchase in the first place (there was a laughably-edited single issue of the song, which could have worked as a single merely by fading out the famous coda at a mere six or seven minutes) sat through one complete listening, then probably bypassed everything except perhaps one or two selections and went straight to the title track. Appropriately. You and I know that \\"I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)\\" is one of the most beautiful songs in rock history, that it has transcended its time and place, and anyone who says it's been overplayed is just a sourpuss.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|If you're a sci-fi fan, it's hard to have not already seen this at some point in your life (and it could well be the REASON you're a sci-fi fan), and it would be even harder not to love it.<br /><br />This movie isn't called a classic for no reason; it's clear upon watching the vast influence it has had on virtually every science fiction film made since. Especially telling is the \\"Star Trek\\" inspiration: from the attitudes and behaviors of the crew (more akin to the original \\"The Cage\\" pilot) to the viewscreen and use of communicators, one can feel what young Gene Roddenberry must have taken with him from this movie. Also, the special effects were AMAZING for the early fifties; and yes, the \\"monster\\" is animated (although for the purposes of the story, it's VERY fitting that it would be)...but if you gotta have an animated monster, you couldn't ask for a better one than one done by a Disney animator.<br /><br />All the conventions of sci-fi are represented, and the storyline is a very cerebral and provocative one...and seeing a very young Leslie Nielsen in a heroic and romantic role is great...and Anne Francis is very easy on the eyes as well, made all the better by being a strong and intelligent foil, not just there for the scenery...something else ahead of it's time and a template for the Ripleys and the Uhuras that were to follow.<br /><br />All of this depth and thoughtful story, and Robby the Robot too! The great-grandaddy of R2-D2 and C-3P0 (George Lucas had to have had this guy in mind) adds cerebral value, some amount of menace, and even comedic relief to this overall staple of the genre.<br /><br />All in all, if you're an old school sci-fi fan like me, or someone new to the genre wanting to see where a great deal of it all began, you cannot go wrong with this absolute classic.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.

There are so few bands with such incredible originality, engaging lyrics and guitar and drums and YUMMMMMM.  I can not believe how many times I've put this on my MP3, more than ANY other chunk of music, maybe EVER.  Only Metallica and Queensryche have inspired me so much.

This is his best album since \\"No More Tears\\".  \\"Ozzman Cometh\\" was a great collectible, but didn't introduce anything significantly new.  \\"Ozzmosis\\", \\"Black Rain\\" and \\"Down to Earth\\" lacked the passion that had previously been evident in his music.<br /><br />With this release, I would have to say, \\"The Ozzman Returneth\\"!  I've only given the CD a partial listen so far, and have heard a few of the tunes on Live365, and it was definately a good move for Ozzy to inject new blood into the band.

B001DDBCUA|1.0|I don't know why at this late in the game I am writing a review, but saw that not one of the   negative reviews say what I am going to, so I think it's worth it. The biggest problem with   this movie, is not the product placement or shallow writing. ***Spoiler alert*** It was that  Carrie accepted a man back into her life after he humiliated her by standing her up at their   wedding. It upsets and disturbs me how many people seem to be able to accept his lame excuse  for why he bailed, and that somehow she had been narcissistic to focus on planning the wedding.  He could have acted like a mature adult and told her about his cold feet, his desire to have a  small wedding; in short, acted like the partner he was supposed to be! How can his betrayal of   her trust be so easily forgiven? I for one found this extremely troubling, because the show was  all about empowerment. Not accepting less. Not accepting a relationship that wasn't a true   partnership. It \\"undid\\" the end of the series. The end of the series was perfect because Carrie  was finally able to stop searching for a partnership b/c Big finally stepped up and committed to it.  As he said, \\"I don't know why it took me so long.\\" Well, of course they had to break it apart to   create drama in the movie, but it was so contrived. I don't think the producers understood(and it looks  like no one who saw it did)how empowerment was the theme of the show, perhaps even a little more so   than the importance of having empowering friends. It is like the show was perfect in it's arc through the seasons to it's perfect metaphorical ending and then they ruined it because they wanted to make money off of a movie. BTW, all other characters  storylines are so undeveloped they seem an afterthought, except perhaps   Miranda. I wasn't offended by the literal bathroom humor. With such an unempowering, depressing movie, I   was happy for any break offered. Also, though not surprised that the Samantha character couldn't remain   monogamous, this time it seemed less empowering, because again, the series left us with a much more   empowering message; that love is the most empowering thing of all. Ruined it. They just ruined it.   I have tried to forget the movie ever happened. Don't let it happen to you! :)

It's so simple - but for years I could not figure out how to make the transition from nice art to moving pictures.<br /><br />Besides that, this book is a great read!

Over time, Six Degrees has become my favorite... Really an example of DT's writing, musicianship, and intellectual capacity, especially if you understand the lyrics and meaning behind songs like \\"Glass Prison,\\" and \\"Great Debate.\\" This is progressive rock/metal for people with a brain. Not to be missed, at least in my humble opinion.

B00003CX8Y|4.0|My daughter was really happy when we got this DVD.  She watched it four times so far, and it's one of her favorites.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I am a guy who likes mostly SciFi and Action movies but for some reason, this movie just gets me every time. I always end up with a HUGE smile and moist eyes during the last 15 minutes. Do you believe in magic? Because if you don't, I feel sorry for you. Yes, things like this do happen and when they do, time stands still. This one, The Love Letter, and Somewhere In Time.....are simply  the 3 most beautiful and magical movies I have ever seen. I never get tired of hope, love, and the beauty of finding a \\"soul mate\\". Kate and John give endearing performances and I remember I saw this movie in the theatre in Katy, TX in early December, just a couple months after 9/11. It helped me escape and go to a better place....then and now...and forever.
B00123KDMO|5.0|This is the least known, and most unsuccessful album in the DLR era catalog. But, to the true VH fans, and guitar players specifically, this is the album that Edward Van Halen rips the head off of every other guitar players neck on the planet, before or after. Just fierce, uninhibited, yet very melodic shredding from start to finish. The best song is, of course \\"Unchained\\", but \\"Dirty Movies\\", \\"Sinners Swing\\", \\"Mean Streets\\", \\"Hear About It Later\\", \\"So This Is Love\\", and \\"Push Comes To Shove\\" are all fantastic songs. My personal least favorites are \\"One Foot Out The Door\\", and \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park\\", though I wouldn't say I don't like them, just not as good as the rest of the album. Overall this is the best Van Halen album, with the debut being a close second, followed by \\"Van Halen II\\" at 3rd, \\"Women And Children First\\" at 4th, \\"1984\\" coming in at the 5th spot, and lastly \\"Diver Down\\" cuz it was almost half covers.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I adore this film. I never saw it in theaters, but the second I saw it, I fell in love. It's a really interesting take on Peter Pan that will appeal to both adults and children. Jason Isaacs is brilliant as Hook and Jeremy Sumpter is perfect as the self-centered and adventurous Peter Pan.
0375842381|5.0|Plenty of reviews showing their praise so I won't bother retelling what they've said. The series is great, and I can't wait to read the additional pieces Pullman has written.    My only negative comment was that I'm unhappy that the US version was censored in book three over something so absolutely small that I'm surprised anyone actually bothered. (Check Wikipedia, it's a small paragraph in the Marzipan chapter).    It really doesn't affect the read, but I'm adamant that censorship is not for some outside entity to decide and impose. Especially in a country so proud of their \\"freedom\\".
0061914177|5.0|Came to write a review and noticed the \\"debate\\" going on in the 2 star review section. A bit entertaining, at the least.<br /><br />I had one reason to purchase the book...to learn how Gary believes the landscape of business is changing.  That's what I came after, that's what I found.<br /><br />Gary shares his personal journey (who doesn't?)and tells you his opinion on what he truly believes is happening or will happen with businesses, marketing/advertising, and the internet.  I believe that his book will be remembered years from now (largely due to his branding and getting his message out there) and people will be saying...Gary was right.<br /><br />Although he strongly believes that you have the opportunity to make money from sharing your passion with the world, he does not mislead you into thinking it will not take time, energy, & patience.  As a matter of fact, the \\"work your face off\\" didn't sound appealing to me at all, but he goes on to explain how you are able to do it, if you are passionate about what you are doing, without it feeling so much like work.  So you may be sleep deprived some days...what millionaire isn't?  Okay, besides the ones who have a family to fund their lives...there are days I'd raise my hand to be one of them, for sure.  (Threw that last sentence in because of the 2 star review debate.)<br /><br />Making money from your passion definitely sounds like work to me. Thankfully I'm no stranger to it AND Gary's book confirms that what I am doing right now at 1:45 in the morning is working, with passion...not dread, boredom, or suffocation.  I know there is a lot more to cashing in on your passion than than just starting a blog.  I get what you are saying, Gary.<br /><br />So, thanks Gary for sharing your story, motivating me to continue on my path in an authentic way, and giving me a heads up on how you think the internet is changing the rules of the game for advertising, marketing, and business.  Oh yeah, thanks for outlining a way that you believe is possible for me to spread my web on the internet to get noticed,too.

B002NPUCRQ|4.0|Like many, I'm wary when albums are rereleased. Usually, they'll just add a few remixes, ask for more money, and call it a day. Taylor Swift apparently knows better.<br /><br />I fell in love with her version of \\"Untouchable\\" a while back and was thrilled to find it as the second track. \\"Jump Then Fall\\" is simple, catchy, and fun, while \\"Superstar\\" and \\"Other Side of the Door\\" are age-appropriate and lets me pretend I'm about ten years younger. If only it would nix the gray hairs, too...<br /><br />The original album was quite solid, with only one song that I tend to skip: \\"The Best Day.\\" It's sweet, but far too saccharine for my taste. I'm partial to \\"Hey Stephen\\" and \\"Fearless\\" as easy listens, while \\"The Way I Loved You\\" shows a surprising amount of self-awareness as a girl who's learning what it means to settle...or how sometimes you really just can't figure out what you want.<br /><br />This is a great crossover album, and if the samples and radio play suit you, then it's probably a smart purchase. I'll agree with many other reviewers that Taylor's voice itself is mediocre, but she doesn't try to out-sing her range, and her songwriting skills make up for limited vocals and occasional pitchiness.
0061245097|5.0|First book was great, second book was even better. I love Cat. I love Bones. And I love the way they love each other. This book has very graphic sex scenes...just a heads up. I love this author! She is so TWISTED! Seriously though, its a great series. It has a very engrossing story. Its just as addicting as Twilight, only directed towards a much more mature audience. Keep an open mind, folks. Its hardcore.
0061148512|5.0|Sylvia really writes from a \\"someone who gets it\\" perspective. I appreciate her raw demeanor and honesty. I found myself relating to her immediately as she drew my mind further and further onto the pages of this novel.    ***Caution: Unfortunately, I was already at a low point in my emotional cycles (BPD and BD), so when she was contemplating suicide, so was I. By continuing reading I pushed myself all the way over the edge and woke up alive the next day in the ICU at a hospital. So, DO NOT READ if you are at all at a low point!!!
B000002HMH|5.0|I have to admit...I was 16 when Load came out.  Was really into Kill'em all to Black album.<br /><br />When I went to midnight release I was So excited to get the new Metallica release.<br /><br />Then boom...not what I was expecting...sounded like 70's rock except with a harder edge and Hetfield dragging words out..and acoustic guitar WTF!!!!!!  This was not my \\"Whiplash\\" metallica!!!!<br /><br />I shelfed the album after about 3 spins through it.<br /><br />About three years ago @ 27 years old.  I blew the dust off of it and threw it in the player...what I found was hard rock bluesy bliss.<br /><br />I think I was just to young at the time to get the albums and I was pissed about the look and everything even the new wussy logo.<br />Now at 30 years old, I'm not joking when I say next to Kill'Em All & Master Of Puppets this is my 3rd Favorite Metallica album.<br /><br />Took me 11-14 years after the album came out to truly appreciate it.  Glad I gave it a chance many years later.

B002JVWR4U|4.0|I see where you're coming from, but just watching the shows over make it pretty clear why it got cancelled. Starting from the first season, Eliza just isn't good enough to handle her role. Dichen Lachman has the same job as her and does it easily. When they finally hooked some people in with Man on the Street, they brought in Echo's past identity, which sucked and was a complete turnoff like in Lost when people found out What Kate Did, wished they didn't and decided they didn't like her anymore.<br /><br />Then after that pretty good finale that screamed good times are coming, this season starts flat all over again. Tahmoh Penikett sucks. Maybe it felt like he was a better actor, because BSG focused on his talents,  but he sucks the life out of most of his scenes. I really like this show, but understand why people didn't watch. Echo and Paul suck compared to Sierra and Victor, but you can sell people on Eliza and someone with Tahmoh's looks.<br /><br />This should could've bounced back, but you never gain an audience after you lose it. You cultivate your base, which the last half of season 1 tried to do. It was pretty great compared to the pretty eh and forgettable first half. Then you keep raising the stakes until people can't deny the work you're doing and tune in. Instead, by the time people had given in to the second half getting better, watched the first season then tuned in for the first couple new episodes.<br /><br />What they got treated to was more of the same of Paul and Echo. After a couple more they figured out how to deal with them, but you can't burn people twice. A show you couldn't really recommend to many friends, but maybe got a couple into it after the great ending of the first season isn't allowed to fall back into it's bad ways to start the next. It deserved to get cancelled, because even though it always ended on a great note, it never started on one and was never consistent enough to hold people to something so different.<br /><br />I wish it was better, but I'm really happy it ever happened.py it ever happened.

B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|In the third Tinker Bell film (\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\"), I found myself surprised yet again at the high quality and entertaining quality of this straight to video release. I also found myself puzzled (again) why this film didn't hit theaters first. Going by the preview trailers, the next installment, \\"Tinker Bell and The Mysterious Winter Woods,\\" might be different, since it is advertised as an \\"all new movie event.\\" But back to this movie...<br /><br />The story is about Lizzy, a young girl whose father has little time for her. She is fascinated by fairies, whereas her father is caught up in facts and scientific research. Through a twist of fate, Lizzy meets Tinker Bell and they become fast friends. Tink sees that Lizzy's father is not giving her the love and attention that she needs, so she helps Lizzy put together a book of facts on fairies, thinking that it might appeal to her dad. Meanwhile, Tinker Bell's fairy friends go on a journey to rescue Tinker Bell from the human world, putting themselves in grave danger. Can Lizzy catch the attention of her dad? Will Tink's friends be able to \\"rescue\\" her without getting caught by Lizzy's dad and used for research?<br /><br />The film is somewhat predictable, and the plot motivations are fairly standard. Yet...the high quality of animation, excellent character development, and quick pacing of the movie make it extremely enjoyable, especially for kids. With a smaller group of fairies in this movie, it is easier to get to know each one and they are all filled with plenty of personality. Lizzy is easy to like as well; her father on the other hand is very difficult to bond with. His personality transformation at the end of the film comes too quickly and is somewhat difficult to believe. This was the only fault I found with the storyline. There are plenty of thrilling sequences for children, and they will quickly be dazzled, imagining themselves in Lizzy's place. For those that were annoyed that Tinker Bell was given a voice in this series, this movie \\"explains\\" away the issue by still showing her as \\"silent\\" with humans, with her voice translating to the tinkling of bells. HIGHLY recommended.<br /><br />TECHNICAL SPECS: 2.35:1, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound (DVD) DTS-HD (Blu-ray). Languages and subtitles are English, Spanish, and French. The picture itself is lush and rendered with amazing details. The flight sequences around London are particularly thrilling. The sound is pleasing, but didn't really notice that the speakers got a dynamic workout.<br /><br />Previews:<br />1. Disney Blu-ray/Combo Packs<br />2. \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" Diamond Edition Blu-ray<br />3. \\"Tangled\\": this preview is definitely designed to appeal to young boys, focusing on the hero,  Flynn Rider, instead of Rapunzel.<br />4. Disney Movie Rewards<br />5. \\"The Search For Santa Paws\\"<br />6. Anti-Piracy message starting Tinker Bell<br />7. \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua II\\" on Blu-ray/DVD.<br />8. Disney Parks<br />9.

Directors Nathan Greno & Byron Howard talk about how \\"Tangled\\" has something for everyone: action, romance, humor, etc. Vocal leads are Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider). Looks like it could be fun.<br /><br />2. Deleted Scenes (14:44) - with intros by Director Brad Raymond and Producer Helen Kalafatic. Usually, the deleted scenes don't do much for me, but this time, I found myself wishing that some of them had been kept.<br /><br />A. \\"A Real Live Fairy\\": Flashback showing Lizzy's dad as a boy meeting a fairy and the consequences. Although this scene is a little dark, getting this background on Lizzy's dad would have fleshed out his character much better and made some of his actions more believable.<br /><br />B. & C. \\"Lizzy's Bedtime Story\\": shown in both storyboard and grayscale versions, this is also a very cute sequence.<br /><br />D.\\"Cat Attack\\": this sequence is fully rendered in color, and shows my new favorite character, Mr. Twitches the cat. He is a loveable semi-villain from the movie that left me wanting more.<br /><br />Interesting note: in the intros to the deleted scenes, it's stated that these movies are all prequels to the \\"Peter Pan\\" animated classic.<br /><br />3. Music & More: \\"How To Believe\\" with Bridgit Mendler (3:02) - fun music video with cute Bridgit performing this lighthearted number.<br /><br />4. Backstage Disney: \\"Design a Fairy House\\" (1:52) - Brad Raymond talks about the contest that challenged children to design a Fairy House. Zoe Periale from California was picked the winner and got to go to WDW in Florida, where she was able to build the house she had sketched out and display it at the EPCOT Flower and Garden Festival.<br /><br />5. Games & Activities: Fairy Field Guide Builder - Most of the games are boring snoozers. Children will enjoy this fairly easy to figure out primer on Fairies. Definitely one of the best games on a Disney video that I have seen.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING: This one is a sure-fire hit for the children and also very enjoyable for adults.h better and made some of his actions more believable.

0439023513|2.0|************************SPOILER ALERTS*************************************<br /><br />  Like everyone else, I loved the first 2 books: the female protagonist was strong and resourceful, the stories were clever and engrossing...but what on earth happened with the 3rd book?? It was almost as if this story had characters with familiar names, but completely different personalities. What is worse is I did not like any of these newly written characters. Katniss became weak and nothing more than a puppet that spewed a few angry diatribes aimed at the government and President Snow. And she did not get to display the skills and cunning that had made her so strong and thrilling in the first place. Gale, always loyal and protective, (I always rooted for Team Gale) did a 180 degree turn and became a hollow, uncaring militant figure. And Peeta, don't get me started on Peeta's character. I was very disappointed with how his part in the story was written. Whenever he was part of the story.<br /><br />  The deaths of Finnick and Prim, important driving characters in the first 2 books, died to add drama and angst to the story, yes, but they died in a couple of descriptive sentences. And then they mattered no more. What?<br /><br />  Why wasn't President Coin mentioned before this book? That might have made her appearance in the story less jarring. Otherwise, she was completely unnecessary and would had made more sense if written as an evil military figure.<br /><br />  Why on earth would Katniss even think to vote for another Hunger Game?? She was fighting the government to end them! How could it be revenge for Prim? Perhaps a distraction for Coin?  I was not able to read Suzanne Collins' mind for that answer. It certainly was not in the book.<br /><br />  Then there's the ending. Gale goes off to another district with \\"a fancy new job\\"? Even if he and Katniss do part ways in the end, his former character would have gone home to rebuild District 12. It was hard to see how Katniss could marry Peeta after spending more than half the book ignoring him, fearing him or wanting to shoot him. The way this book was written, Peeta should have died. Plain and simple. His new character would have become a martyr. None of this makes sense.<br /><br />  I waited so long for this book and I knew it be bittersweet. But, dear God, I did not think I would be so annoyed and truly disappointed by it.ould marry Peeta after spending more than half the book ignoring him, fearing him or wanting to shoot him.

0307454541|1.0|I am reading this for a book group selection I am at 300 pages and still waiting for it to get better. If i can't sleep I pick this book up read a chapter or two then out like a light. I hope it gets better soon.
B002ZG999U|2.0|Of course, out of solidarity for the action fan you were in the eighties, you need to buy this upcoming DVD. It's for the Macho or the caveman inside all of us. Testosterone at it's best. A tribute like that won't be made often. No matter how trivial the story, no matter how corny the dialogue, you will want this in your collection. There is an obvious pleasure in seeing Arnold, Sly and Bruce together, even if it is for a short period of time. I did feel sad about the way Arnie and Sly looked, though. Clint Eastwood ages well, I think. When Charles Bronson was alive, he still looked tough, even in his seventies. But Arnold and Sly? Something in the way they walked... The eyes are still piercing but the Austrian oak looked... dismembered and the Italian Stallion seemed to be limping or something.     Anyhow. We all knew before hand that the screenplay wouldn't win an Oscar. But why do people seem content with that? I wrote at the beginning that the only fact of having that many action stars in one single movie is sufficient but still, it didn't have to be this way. Look at \\"The Losers\\" for example. It's a similar story. And it is overblown, absurd and exaggerated just like \\"The Expendables\\". But with the first, you're ready to accept pretty much anything. It's based on a comic book and doesn't take itself seriously whereas the second, Stallone movie that is, is soooo solemn even if it tries to have fun at times. That's a Stallone thing. He jokes about himself and he does make us laugh at times. But the solemnity, I think, lessens its wackiness.     But I have to admit that there are some guilty pleasures in the movie. After the viewing, you will be glad to talk about the way Stone Cold opened up a can of whoop-ass and layed the smack down on Sly's butt. You'll still laugh about how Jason Statham stole the movie at two specific places or how Terry Crews wipes out an entire battalion within a few seconds. They are some good ideas that forces a grin on your face (Jet Liwanting a raise because he is shorter, Statham saying to his ex-girlfriend, after a impressive fight, that he was worth it, Lundgren saying \\"my turn!\\" when he fights Li, the little jabs Arnold and Sly throw at each other, Couture talking about his ears, etc...).     The only problem, really, is the misguided importance it tries to instill. Oh! And also, those darn camera movements (too fast and too much twirls) that, again, give the impression that Stallone really wanted to give a personal signature to something that should have been taken way more lightly.     Hope he corrects this for the sequel. And maybe get Chuck Norris?
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|I've seen both versions and like them both for different reasons. The BBC version is far superior than the 2005 version because of the detail of the screenplay. The BBC version gives background as to:(1)why Darcy and Lizzy like and dislike each other (2) how often Darcy and Lizzy were actually around each other (3) why Wickham really runs away with and then marries Lydia. I agree that some of the length of detail in the BBC version made me want to fast forward - (1)was Caroline Bingley really so dense that she continued to make so many unflattering comments about Lizzy even though Darcy made very pointed remarks as to why Lizzy was so favored by him? (2) Mrs Bennet's many hysterics (3) party at Mrs Bennet's sister's house, just to name a few.     Had I not previously seen the BBC version I would be left wondering: (1) how Darcy could have fallen in love with Lizzy when only seeing her three of times - at the first dance, when Jane is sick and at the Bingley's ball - then barely saying two words to her each time!  (2) Why in the world did Wickham want to marry Lydia?  The 2005 version left me puzzled.  They had spoken to each other only once in this version - at the ribbon shop - and he runs away with her?  Really? (3) Why was Mr Bennet (Donald Sutherland) even in this version when much of his script was edited out. (4) Why in the world Lady Catherine said to the Bennet family \\"You have a very small garden\\" when she came in the middle of the night (5) Why Darcy didn't have more to say in the 2005 version (6) How did Darcy manage to walk from Rosings to Longbourne in the wee hours of the morning?    Things I liked more about the 2005 version: (1) the house the Bennet's lived in.  Much more suited to their income in appearance and size; (2) the hall where the assembly was held when Darcy and the Bingley's were 1st introduced; (3) Jane (Rosamund Pike) - so beautiful (4) Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) - less hysterical and more motherly (6) Georgiana Darcy.

B0036EH3X4|5.0|This is literally the best show of all time. Don't listen to the retards with 1 star reviews. If you're too stupid to understand the ending of a show after watching it for six seasons, you should just kill yourself instead of writing negative reviews. If you haven't watched LOST or haven't watched season 6 of LOST, BUY IT NOW. Seriously, it's the best.
B003XU02QG|5.0|Glad I got the opportunity to watch this movie at least through video on demand. It wasn't playing anywhere in my state that I could find.<br /><br />Reminded me of Gladiator & Arthur. Great scenery & filming.<br /><br />Well worth the price of rental to watch for 48 hrs.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|OK. I can cut the Lost writers some slack because it is one of the best TV shows of all time.  But \\"The End\\" of Season 6 was disappointing when aired, and again watching the Blu-Ray. I was hoping I'd missed something, but alas.  So when did they all actually \\"die\\"? In the initial crash or with the bomb? Shannon was not near the bomb, but she re-appears as one of the \\"chosen\\". If they all died in the initial crash, then is the reference to \\"all their time together is the most important part of their 'lives'\\" a la the island as a purgatory?  I mean, GEEZ! \\"They're all really dead.\\" That's the ending we've all been waiting for? An eighth-grader could have written that sappy ending. And while I'm at it, TOO MUCH WHINY VIOLIN MUSIC.  But up to the last episode, 5 stars.
B000000OU4|5.0|I had not heard this album before, although I am well acquainted with many of his other albums.  I started listening to this album on a whim after seeing Pat Metheny in concert back in early May for his Orchestrion show. I slowly grew to love this album each time I listened to it.  In fact, I have found myself addicted to this album, listening almost daily ever since then. I even play it every time I exercise.  I thoroughly love the piano sounds found in Here To Stay, To The End Of The World, Episode D'Azur and Red Sky. It goes without saying, that I love Pat's guitar in every single song too.     All the different interplay of sound styles, instrument sounds, changes in tempo and music style, make this a great little find.   I totally love finding hidden gems like this, that I can listen to time and again and never get tired of hearing.
0525951652|5.0|I can't say enough of this book. First off, it is HUGE. However I love the larger books so that was a challenge for me! Note, I probably won't do the book justice because a lot of the politics go right over my head and who is doing what to whom and why, but this book was so engaging that I told everyone who called, stopped by or online.<br /><br />This is my first book by Ken Follett but now I want to pick up his others and gobble them up. I think Maud and Ethel were my 2 most favorite characters because they both were strong, intelligent and still feminine ladies. So much happens in this book, it is over about 10 years or so I believe, but it is good to see how all the 5 families get entwined.<br /><br />Knowing this is a trilogy, I can't wait for the next 2 parts. My least favorite character was Fitz, he is one you love to hate. Hey every book has to have some of them. Ethel and Fitz's love that can never be; in fact I do believe there were a few that could never be. Lev was another character that was such a slime bag. I hope Olga smartens up; although I doubt she will. She is stuck with him now that well...read and find out about all of these wonderful characters! You won't be sorry!
B002NVTBOU|5.0|I cannot begin to describe the beauty of this album. Buika provides immaculate emotion to each song, reviving what has been lost over the years. If you grew up with these songs you'll love this album, and if you just love the old latin music of the 50s and 60s, this album is perfect. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with this album, it is perfect in every way, although I don't get the album cover? Overall, the choice of songs is amazing, the arrangments and performances are haunting and beautiful, and this is a fine album of latin music overall. If you buy one latin album this year, make sure it is this one.    Soledad: 9/10  Sombras: 9/10  Las Cuidades: 9/10  Cruz de Olvido: 10/10  El Andariego: 10/10  En el Último Trago: 10/10  Se Me Hizo Facil: 10/10  Un Mundo Raro: 10/10  Las Simples Cosas: 9/10  Somos: 9/10  Luz de Luna: 10/10  Vamonos: 10/10    115/120= 96= 96/20= 4.8= 5 STARS (or a ridiculuosly perfect album)
B003ITZBVS|5.0|If you have read enough comic book history,then you will have no problem following this movie.It starts with Jason Todd's death at the hands of the Joker.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|In the meantime you can borrow it from your local library for free (usually - some libraries have a minimal charge!)  Or for that matter the special edition in 3D is out in theaters right now!  So go see that.  James Cameron gives us his best movie since Aliens and The Abyss!  I hope they bring Michael Biehn for one of the sequels!
B003629IPW|5.0|When I first heard that This Is It was going to be made into a movie, I was estatic! I counted down the days of the release and bought my ticket 2 months in advance and waited in line to get into the theatre and it was worth the wait! This Is It is probably the most extroidinary concernt documentary that anyone could ever create! When Michael Jackson died on June 25th, the world stopped turning for 24 hours and a part of it died with him. This is by FAR the best DVD to ever come out of 2010 and I recommend it to anyone who loves Michael and i'm sure by now every single of of Michael Jacksons TRUE fans have this DVD.<br /><br />In the This Is It DVD, Michael is not portrayed as a fragile, sick, old man the media made him out to be. You see him smiling, dancing, joking, having so much fun being back where he feels at home the most. You can tell he could not wait to show the entire world his greatest creation EVER! He is totally like a kid again, giddy with excitement and you can see that come out in every dance step that he takes. From the start of Wanna Be Startin Somethin' to Man In The Mirror, you will be glued to this DVD and to Michael as he reherses for his final concernt that the world never got to see LIVE.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse is a band that I have really grown to enjoy and just the fact that a band like this has become so popular gives me faith that at least some people out there still appreciate quality music.  Muse fuses progressive rock with electronica, pop, and Queen like bombast to create a wall of sound approach that could easily be overblown and pompous, but in their capable hands becomes modern rock at it's absolute best.  The band have become a bit more commercial with each release, but it is a natural progression that is not as distracting as it often is with bands reaching this level of success.  The album begins with two instantly catchy singles \\"Uprising\\" and \\"The Resistance\\" both of which deserve the massive airplay that they have received.  Other highlights include the Queen influenced \\"United States Of Eurasia\\" and especially the final closing suite \\"Exogenesis Symphony Parts 1  - 3\\" which features Muse at their progressive best.  There are a few clunkers on the album which keep me from rating it a 5 star.  \\"Guiding Light\\", \\"MK Ultra\\" and \\"I Belong To You\\" sound like deliberate attempts at commerciality and don't do a lot for me.  From a progressive rock standpoint Muse are not nearly as complicated as many of their lesser known contemporary peers, but they do what they do really well.  I hope with the success of this album it will inspire people to explore more progressive minded artists.  \\"The Resistance\\" is definitely a good jumping off point.
B002R68U7K|5.0|This is a great box set that contains mini versions of all of her singles as well as a great DVD of all of her videos.  Each sleeve is a single pocket of sturdy cardboard. Each disc mirrors the cover art of the box--black with the britney logo and heart.  Hard to believe that its been 10 years but after listening to each disc and all the b-sides it is amazing how consistent her music has been. And its great to have all of her videos in one place. Great fun and a celebration of Britney's pop perfection.  Note:  I bought this when it was first released, list price has gone up since then.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was very pleased with this product. it had no scratches, and plays perfectly fine.I would highly recommend ordering from them.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I love Porcupine tree. When I heard them in the first time I was amazed how great they are .   Wilson knows how to do music . The first album I heard was FOBP released on 2007 . I was waiting for a new record and what can I say , It's good album but not perfect.Some of the songs are too boring but the most of the album is good  Porcupine fans should not pass this release.   If you like Porcupine go and buy it.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I always thought I could watch George Clooney sleep. I finally got a chance to test this theory when I went to see him sleepwalk through The American. Cloony assumes a weird chewing tic which I think is supposed to be sexy or something but is very distracting. In fact, he chews more than he speaks, which is probably a good thing since the film's dialogue is mostly grunts, sighs and cryptic three word sentences. What was he thinking? Maybe a chance to shoot a film in Italy close to his Bellagio villa had something to do with it. This is what Clooney does in the movie -- he walks down the identical cobbled street a dozen or more times, drives down the same hill over and over again, lies in bed, wakes up from nightmares, stares, twitches, drinks wine, and chews. There is one pathetic chase scene, and one hot sex scene. The beginning is better than the end but neither make any sense. There is no backstory and don't expect to ever be able to figure out what's going on because the film makes no attempt at plot, meaning, or visual delight. I have been a stalwart fan of Clooney since ER. I think he's handsome, funny and I am jealous of his girlfriend. But after The American I am beginning to wonder if he is just another pretty, if aging, face. Deadpan acting, no matter how attractive the actor, is always a copout especially in what is purported to be a thrill.

0749942010|5.0|With a really good thriller novel, sometimes it's not so much the story as the way you tell it that gives it the credibility it needs.  In Rosamund Lupton's Sister, the unexpected death of a young 21 year-old woman, Tess, initially promises an interesting but perhaps not exceptional case where her sister attempts to piece together the dead woman's actions and contemplate her state of mind in the days before her death - was it suicide or murder?  What makes Sister fascinating reading however is the decision of the author to tell the story not only from the perspective of the dead woman's sister Beatrice, but to do so in the form of an open letter to Tess.    There are several benefits to this approach.  On the one hand, it fully captures the sense of helplessness and loss that Beatrice feels.  Having been separated by an ocean, Beatrice returns to London from her New York home to try to come to terms with what has happened and piece together what could have happened through her knowledge of her younger sister, relating those thoughts directly to Tess, but also to the prosecuting lawyer in preparation for a trial.  This creates a fractured kind of narrative that gives some indication of what is going on in her mind, as well interweaving past and present and lending the intriguing suggestion that, with a court case pending, there is a lot more to uncover.    More than that, it lends immediacy to the writing that also brings you closer to Tess, as you come to understand her relationship with her sister and family, events from the past coming to mind that shed light on her character - small but significant events that lead Beatrice to conclude that she couldn't possibly have taken her own life.  But how can she convince everyone else that this is the case?  In passing then, Sister takes in issues related to women - and different types of women - taking in babies and childbirth, their relationships with families and with men - fathers, husbands and lovers.  Actually, it'snot even in passing, it's integral to the book and to its success as a crime thriller, the author brilliantly interweaving the story with real issues that do indeed mean life and death to people.    Most significantly, the structure of the novel and the first-person directness is such that it also makes the investigation and revelations genuinely suspenseful, keeping the reader guessing and then surprising them with some remarkable turn of events that make it much more than just a gimmick.  This is Rosamund Lupton's first novel, having previously worked as a scriptwriter, but her ability to entertain, probe into characterisation, pace a thriller and find the most effective means of delivering it is remarkably assured, making this a thrilling and ultimately deeply moving novel.
B003S897U0|3.0|One great thing about the Black Crowes, aside from being one of the greatest rock bands in the last 20 years, is that they value their fan base, as exemplified by the low price (especially the download price--wow!) for a double CD of new recordings. The concept of this release is a novel one--to release new acoustic versions of their old songs. For several tracks, this works great...kind of breathes a new life and puts a new twist on some of their material. A lot of the songs, however, are more obscure, and just plain boring. And the new arrangements don't really make them any more interesting. I would have liked to see a few more of their upbeat old chestnut rockers treated to the \\"rockin' acoustic\\" approach as Jealous Again (the first track) was. In other words, I think this would have been better as a single album pared down to size. But of course, hey, it's the price of single album, anyway, so who cares? :-) It's just that I found myself waiting for a few songs to get over with...    Still, great performances throughout! Some arrangements were a little countrified for my tastes, with fiddle here and there. It's all good musicianship, but I prefer to view the Crowes as mainly a blues-based rock band. The fiddle and mandolin takes away from that, for me. Probably the main reason I got back into the Crowes in recent years was due to Luther Dickinson joining the band, of whom I am a huge fan. On this CD, he does shine in places, but I think his incredible slide guitar talent was minimized a bit due to his mandolin duties here--bummer.    Overall though, a good send-off from the Crowes to all their fans--thanks, BC!
B001P9KR8U|3.0|No doubt, this movie is entertaining, but is it an Academy Award winner for Best Picture?  The acting is a bit stiff, the story is Ok, the cinematography is amateurish.  The story is very linear and straight forward....no surprises really.    It just seems that this film kinda went \\"viral\\" on the Academy and they jumped on the bandwagon and decided to purge themselves of guilt towards those that are impoverished and award this movie Best Picture.  On the other hand, there wasn't that much to choose from in 2008.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Seems to be alot of bashing about not being bluray.  Consider the following.  This concert was filmed at the 2009 Download Festival at Donnington Park which Slipknot headlined.  The original footage was from a webcast of the festival.  I would think that the footage intended for webcast would not exactly be of the HD/Bluray quality that everyone is demanding here.  This concert was phenominal, you can see much of it on video sites on the web.  I am glad I am going to be able to relive the concert on DVD, isn't that what we should be looking for here.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|Salt is your run-of-the-mill summer action movie with a twisted story akin to The Bourne series or James Bond  of old. Like those movies the action is over the top and crazy, guns blaze and sparks fly but the PG-13 rating spares us the blood and guts that should accompany such wicked projectiles. One scene has Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie)  killing a guy by ramming the jagged end of a broken bottle into his neck but this is left to your imagination since all we see is the motion and then the discarded bloody bottle after the fact. Am I the only one who prefers his action graphic and R-rated? Still Salt was highly likable and the liking goes beyond the beauty at the helm.<br /><br />The plot of Salt is not easily summarized without offering up spoilers so I cannot go there. I will say however that it involve the CIA, a super-spy named Evelyn Salt, her fellow spy Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and a plot involving Russia, North Korea and terrorism. Angelina Jolie does her thing as Evelyn Salt, with the action looking very much like she did the stunts herself (which she did). Speaking of stunts, unlike the Bourne series, the fighting and action in Salt was done extremely well. When Evelyn fought bigger guys she would use objects and moves that made sense for a smaller woman. I have grown tired of seeing small, slight women throwing roundhouses, jabs and fancy moves to drop big 300lb muscle men in action films. Salt takes guys out by kicks to the groin, trapping the knee, breaking bottles across their faces and choking them out with chains. If anything, this really impressed me with the action.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the action was the tired, incorrect and convenient knockouts that occurred when people got beat up. Movies tend to lean on this to discard bad guys who they don't want to have the hero kill. The hero will punch baddies in the gut and step on their hand and they will lie on the ground knocked out no matter where they were hit. Salt did a good job on the choreography but guys were getting knocked out from subtle blows and it really bothered me that they took this route. Film quality fluctuates at times especially during the traffic scenes but it isn't enough to distract the viewer from the scenes that are playing out.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Peabody and is a strong presence as he always - which leads me to wonder when he will headline his own picture. Salt starts out a bit uninteresting and scarily bland until 30 minutes in then it turns into a bullet train ride of action. Angelina is a Jack of all Trades in the acting profession having played the tender damsel and the hardcore action heroine. I believe that after Tomb Raider, Angie was bitten by the action bug and not only loves playing the femme fatales but does a damn good job at it too.<br /><br />Grab Salt if you are an action fan!y but guys were getting knocked out from subtle blows and it really bothered me that they took this route.

1597801585|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I'm not going to say a lot here.  If you want plot descriptions there are plenty of other reviews for that.  I enjoyed the grittiness and most of the characters.  Anderson was the only one I struggled with getting a read on.  The others were relatively real and consistent.  The graphic sex/rape scenes fit with the theme and atmosphere of the novel, but you must be warned that they ARE graphic.  While some reviewers have disclaimed the need for a \\"fembot\\" it seems an almost fundamental part of the steampunk formula. And frankly, if you haven't realized it yet, the porn/sex industry drives a lot of technological innovation.  There will always be men willing to pay big bucks for \\"realistic\\" sexual encounters, especially if there's a little risk added in.  I thought Emiko was a nice \\"twist\\" on the fembot by giving her real genes, though engineered.  Emiko's in-built mannerisms were explained by using the contrasting cheshire cats and the danger of tampering with genetics and leaving procreation viable.      The writing style is conducive to a feeling of breathlessness.  To me, it fit with the lives portrayed in the main characters.  All were living under constant threat and all were anxious to better their situations.  For those who question the \\"power\\" of the corporation, you're not paying attention to the world around you.  Free market capatilism is evolving an oligarchical framework on modern society.  A few are gaining power and resources to rival nations.  It will not be long before multi-national corporations will have the strength to force countries to back down from aggressive actions, in the name of continuing profitability for their subsidiaries found within rival nations.  It isn't far-fetched to see corporate espionage take a turn toward aggressive actions to defeat rival companies.  Such is the world \\"The Windup Girl\\" lives in.    All in all, engrossing read.
B0031R5K68|2.0|This book may work well as a thriller for the movies, but its predictable final has a \\"final surprise\\" that is incoherent with what is said in the first half of the book. After the solution of the case, there is a long and boring final chapter that seems only to try to get some simpaty from christian people and the Church. It is only a shade of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", nothing more.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy star   this 1988 Robert Zemeckis comedy. A private detective  tries to solve a murder case involving a falsely accused  animated rabbit. I've always loved this film since I was  a kid and glad to have it on dvd. This 2-disc set has  nice picture and sound plus cool extras. I recommend  this fun comedy.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Eminem's first comeback was in, well 2009 with the highly anticipated [[ASIN:B00192M9FC Relapse]].  While 'Relapse' was successful compared to the tepid sales of a majority of other albums (not to mention in won the Grammy for Best Rap Album), fans weren't sold on it.  There were too many crude and lewd jokes and despite being a production masterpiece by Dr. Dre, the album drew markedly mixed reviews.  I personally liked 'Relapse,' but I see why it wouldn't appeal to the \\"new\\" generation, many of which weren't Eminem fans when 2004's [[ASIN:B00065XJ52 Encore (Deluxe Edition)]] bowed.  'Recovery' does find Eminem doing a better job of reigning himself in without compromising himself too much.  He tames down the jokes that caused mixed fare on 'Relapse' in favor of adhering to more modern approaches on 'Recovery.' The results are pleasant, even if the consummate Eminem fan wishes he/she could combine the best moments of 'Relapse' and 'Recovery' to deliver one stellar album.<br /><br />\\"Cold Wind Blows\\" is a sound opener, if slightly less satisfying than \\"3AM\\" from Relapse. Just Blaze contributes the production work, which may not contain the shimmer of the scantly featured Dr. Dre (who is the executive producer), but bodes well in Eminem's favor.  \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\" featuring Kobe features DJ Khalil on the boards.  Here, Eminem sounds inspired, but the cut doesn't blow or over-captivate the listener; it's good, though not \\"great\\" by Eminem standards. \\"On Fire,\\" which features a smart sample by the Gap Band (\\"Peace and Love\\"), falls into a similar boat.<br /><br />The fantastic DJ Khalil production \\"Won't Back Down\\" featuring P!nk is easily the best cut up until this point. P!nk's hook is somewhat restrained (for her) but cleverly written: \\"you can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards/you can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards/but I won't back down, oh no I won't back down.\\" Eminem's flow is especially fresh and \\"vital\\" here. \\"W.T.P.\\" is enjoyable enough, but not a particular favorite.  \\"Going Through Changes,\\" which uses a Black Sabbath sample (\\"Changes\\") is a fine cut and a clear stand out. Similarly, \\"Not Afraid,\\" produced by Boi 1da is exceptional if for no other reason than it places Eminem in a different environment as a rapper.  On \\"Not Afraid,\\" the conception is less like a rap song and more like a pop song, which bodes well for an artist trying to revamp his image slightly. Even the hook is departure for Eminem: \\"I'm not afraid, to take a stand, everybody, come take my hand.\\"<br /><br />\\"Seduction,\\" a second contribution from Boi 1da is enjoyable as well, finding Eminem once again being portrayed as more than just a rap artist. \\"No Love,\\" featuring Lil Wayne is an instant classic featuring a clever use of sample \\"What Is Love\\" as performed by Haddaway (you can thank Just Blaze for this one). Wayne raps first, spitting fire as usual while Eminem's first appearance is on the hook.  Eminem truly brings the fire on his verse where he raps: \\"I'm alive again, more live than I have been, in my whole entire life I can/see these people's ears perk up as I being/to spaz with the pen, I'm a bit sicker than...\\"<br /><br />\\"Space Bound\\" is enjoyable, despite not being say `revolutionary.' \\"Cinderella Man\\" is a production standout (Script Shepherd) with its best line being during Eminem's second verse: \\"It's a trap, f--- my last CD's, s---'s in my trash.\\" \\"25 To Life\\" is enjoyable while \\"So Bad\\" proves to be the only Dr. Dre offering.  Of course, it's a great one.  \\"Almost Famous\\" one-ups it, featuring another clever hook by an unknown vocalist and nice rhymes by Eminem.<br /><br />\\"Love The Way You Lie\\" featuring Rihanna is the last of the three major collaborations (P!nk and Lil Wayne, excluding Kobe).  Again, the \\"pop\\" ruminations of this cut make Eminem appeal to a new audience; kudos to Alex Da Kid's production work.  \\"You're Never Out\\" and \\"Untitled\\" close the album, but aren't necessary to the success or detriment of this album.<br /><br />Essentially, 'Recovery' is another solid album by the MC.  It is not his best, but it introduces him to a new audience, which is great for him. 4 stars.lly, 'Recovery' is another solid album by the MC.  It is not his best, but it introduces him to a new audience, which is great for him. 4 stars.

B003O85W3A|4.0|Once any noteworthy band \\"blows up,\\" it seems the U2 comparisons fly rampantly - first it was Coldplay and then it was Kings of Leon.  The Arcade Fire are subjected to nothing different.  Like the beloved U2 (who are the slightest bit too hyped at times), The Arcade Fire use minimalistic progressions and production tactics to make grand songs.  Creativity runs rampant on [[ASIN:B003O85W3A The Suburbs]], surprisingly trumping the grand [[ASIN:B000MGUZM0 Neon Bible]] at times.  While \\"Intervention\\" isn't necessarily bested, there are songs of nearly/if not the same level on 'The Suburbs'.<br /><br />The album opens up superbly with the strong \\"The Suburbs,\\" where frontman Win Butler's vocals are their most clear and present - not to mention his grand falsetto on the refrain  (\\"sometimes I can't believe it/I'm moving past the feeling again\\").  \\"The Suburbs\\" benefits from a fine and haunting production work filled with strings, electric and acoustic guitars, and piano.  \\"Ready to Start,\\" a personal favorite cut, maintains a driving groove and contrasts the mid-tempo groove of \\"The Suburbs.\\" Again, the superb songwriting lends a catchy refrain (\\"If I was scared, I would, and If I was bored (broke, pure, etc.), you know I would, If I was yours, I'm not... now I'm ready to start.\\" 'The Suburbs' bats a thousand with \\"The Suburbs\\" and \\"Ready to Start.\\"<br /><br />\\"Modern Man\\" finds the band dabbling in asymmetrical meter and once again a minimal harmonic progression provides the backdrop for Butler's vocals.  Not quite as epic as \\"The Suburbs\\" or \\"Ready to Start,\\" its still a fine cut.  \\"Rococo\\" loses no momentum, while \\"Empty Room\\" is an interesting listen, if a bit hard to decipher.  Regin&eacute; Chassagne, wife of Butler leads the charge vocally but the busy production work overtakes her vocals.  This cut would've benefited from being mixed slightly better, but maybe the cacophonous effect was what the band had in mind.<br /><br />\\"City With No Children\\" proves to be much better featuring a notable bass line and a clever groove.  On \\"City With No Children,\\" the religious allusions come full circle as Butler sings \\"feel like I've been living in, a city with no children in it, a garden left to ruin...\\" \\"Half Light I\\" and \\"Half Light II (No Celebration)\\" are two contrasting cuts, both worthy of a couple of spins.  On \\"Half Light I\\" Regin&eacute; Chassagne is the main focus, where her lovely vocals are better produced this go-round.  On \\"Half Light II (No Celebration), \\" Butler takes the reigns, with Chassagne's vocals harmonizing mid-way through the first verse, mixed in the background.<br /><br />\\"Suburban War\\" stands out, if mainly because of its stylistic changes at given points within the track.  \\"Month of May\\" finds Arcade Fire channelling \\"punk rock\\" to an extent  with its driving guitar work and Butler's raw vocals.  \\"Wasted Hours\\" doesn't necessarily stand out, but it is another solid number.  \\"Deep Blue\\" and \\"We Use To Wait\\" are both Arcade Fire cuts at their best.  On \\"Deep Blue,\\" the guitars take on a \\"garage\\" sound and the piano twinkles make this cut reminiscent of a saloon or lounge.  \\"We Use To Wait\\" makes clever use of a minimalistic piano figure and clever songwriting.<br />\\"Sprawl I (Flatland)\\" turns out to be a languid, dark cut exploiting a vulnerable sounding Win Butler while its sister cut \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\\" sounds as if it could have been equally at home on MGMT's [[ASIN:B0037W68F4 Congratulations]]. \\"Sprawl II\\" is a worthwhile cut if for no other reason than it contrasts everything else that Arcade Fire has released at this point.  Kudos for that.  A reprise of \\"The Suburbs (Continued)\\" closes the album.<br /><br />'The Suburbs' is easily one of the top albums of 2010.

B003EYVY0E|3.0|They have ruined this box set by not including extended versions of the films. The first 2 had them so I expected that all the movies on ultimate edition were going to be extended. Will no longer be buying these! Rumor has it they have tons of footage that was removed especially from the later movies. I heard like 30 to 45 mins worth. I was expecting each release to get longer extended versions then the past. Only thing making this still tempting is the new documentary's they have on each one. I wanted to see all those.

Though we can neither see nor physically examine gravity, we can to a limited extent measure it.  Yet, we can \\"measure\\" gravity only with respect to matter.  Without some form of matter, gravity would remain indiscernible.  Matter, then, is the sine qua non of gravity.  It follows that both matter and gravity exist.  It also follows that the two are mutually dependent.   Logic also tells us that self cannot create self.  Gravity did not create gravity.  Matter did not create matter.  That brings us to \\"source.\\"  If gravity is, as you say, a law, then it has an author, that is to say, a source.  And since matter did not create matter, it, too, has a \\"source.\\"  And, Professor Hawking, that which has a source is not \\"spontaneous.\\"  So, we find ourselves, Sir, seeking that which man from his earliest days has sought.  The source.  Frank Tilton, Virginia, USA
0887431453|5.0|I ordered this book for my 3 year old son.  He rarely wants to sit still and do anything, but the bright colors of the pages enticed him and we were able to do 3-4 pages at a time.  I even walked into the livingroom the next day to find him doing some of the mazes on his own.  He loves this book!  We do 3-4 pages a day and it is really enjoyable.  Would highly recommend this book!
0061673730|1.0|There is a sort of elitism about ZMM that requires a person to either proclaim it a masterpiece, or be subjected to scorn at not being smart enough to \\"get it.\\" I notice how many other one-star reviews begin with an acknowledgment that it takes courage to dislike this book, which reveals something ominous about the cultural mystique that surrounds it.     But the book itself is tedious. I am NOT saying that the philosophy within it can't be life-changing and enlightening, which is why many readers adore this book, but as a book itself it's as profoundly dull as it is profound. There are several crucial problems.    First, the \\"plot\\" device of a cross-country motorcycle trip is nearly disposable. You can barely call this a novel, or claim it has a plot at all. What we have instead is a father-son road trip, a topic which had me excited to read this book. What a wonderful context for meaningful storytelling! But no, instead we have a \\"plot\\" that nearly gets abandoned; it gets so distant that at times Pirsig merely throws in an obligatory comment about the road going uphill now, as a token gesture to what was supposed to be the book's whole premise. Consequently, the narrator actually becomes LESS likable, as the 12-year-old son is nearly shoved aside for the narrator's self-involved musings. The narrator rhapsodizes endlessly about HIS philosophical obsessions, while the emotions and experiences of the son are happenstance story litter. This is ironic for a book claiming to be an investigation of values and quality. Here's a thought: how about you stop musing about your own brilliance, and actually PRACTICE quality values with your son? Merely thinking while he sits in the background of your self-absorption is abominable.     Second, Pirsig accidentally mistook this for a novel. It's not. It's a series of essays with a few tacked-on details about road sights interspersed. Pirsig doesn't even pretend otherwise; the narrator actually begins many passages with phrases like, \\"What I'd like to talk about now is...\\" The narrator makes no effort to hide the fact that he's simply lecturing. If Pirsig wanted to do this, he should have just written essays instead. But to write such dry essays and disguise them as first-person musings is a dull thing to inflict on us. These \\"Chautauquas\\" go on and on...\\"Now let's compare Euclidian geometry with...\\" AARGH!     This is the Ekhart Tolle of bygone decades. I've seen reviews that call this \\"exhilarating,\\" and I always wonder if people read the same book as I. Or perhaps they also regard collecting antique twine to be an \\"exhilarating\\" hobby, or spending hours ignoring your bored kid while you debate Aristotle to be \\"exhilarating.\\"     Real Zen masters teach us that after enlightenment, go chop wood. In others words, enlightenment ought not to take you out of the everyday tasks that must be attended to. Perhaps that could include using a cross-country road trip to actually explore your child's mind, bonding with him in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, rather than tossing him crumbs of attention so you can get back to your deep, clever \\"Chautauquas\\"?

B00005JO5L|1.0|The only reason worth watching is Pacino and Sorvino isn't bad either, the ending I am sure is what gets to most people as I hate open endings.It could have been way better had it not had the gay backstory(no pun intended) especially s&m and freddy mercury look-a-likes. Do I think this is representative of an actual people NO not all,Do I think it is Moral? NO. Of course that is none of my business but as long as you don't parade it around or force others to your culture(Homofascism). It get's 1 star not because I feel that it offends any particular \\"Minority\\",it only offends you if your are under that group,but because of it's meant to shock imagery and sadistic violence.
B002MEW7YY|4.0|Lucia di Lammermoor transposed to the Victorian age, with a fully fledged verismo Russian soprano and somewhat unknown central Europe tenor and baritone? Yes, and it works!<br /><br />I see no use in comparing Netrebko with belcanto specialists (on studio audio only recordings): this is on stage, on the fly, and she is beautiful, big voiced and a magnificent artist, she brings a true Lucia, perhaps without the fioritura found elsewhere, but always musical and tasty.  And her Italian diction, questioned by other reviewer, is nearly perfect. She's the star of the show. Brava, Anniuska!<br /><br />And, IMHO this opera is not only the soprano role: the male section is also important, and it's well served here. I'm a fan of Lord Enrico Ashton (sure Verdi was a big fan of him too), and young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien is a terrific one. Good voice, right mean attitude, perhaps a little too much spice, but powerful and believable. Also very good is young bass Abdrazakov (Raimondo), who sings not in the usual \\"peace everybody\\" way, but shows plenty of blood in his veins. Tenor Beczala is fit, musical, elegant and well behaved on stage, but he's a little short of the Italian fire the role needs. Edgardo is a desperate romantic hero (that's why Di Stefano, not a belcantist, was so good at it), and Beczala lacks that crazy determination. He's no match for Enrico, I can tell you.<br /><br />Production and stage direction are new but not annoying. Perhaps the infamous photographer will spoil the sextet in Act II to some traditionalists, but to me is OK (and the guy is indeed a pro in his job). We can call it a septet from now on ;-)<br /><br />This 2009 2-DVD set is technically flawless, 16:9 screen, very good sound 5.1 and DTS, subtitles in Italian, German, French, Spanish and Chinese. I can recommend it.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|This is definitely a movie timepiece.  Released in 1984, it represented the cutting edge of technology to produce the longest computer generated animation to appear in a feature length movie.  It's not the new \\"Star Trek\\" Movie, but the story is classic and entertaining to all ages.     I read another review this morning, before UPS arrived, complaining about the DVD Version being the 4:3 version (Old TV Standard) cropped to look like the wide-screen version. This new Blu-Ray, 25th Anniversary Version is the true theatrical release with crisp picture and outstanding sound.  If you are a fan, you'll love this release.[[ASIN:B0025VLELQ The Last Starfighter (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B002ZG981E|5.0|Non-Linear, mind bending and abstract style of story telling , no wonder many have been annoyed by this movie.

037571457X|5.0|Delivery Service Review    I will be writing a review on the delivery speed of Amazon, which is ultimately the service. I am a first time buyer on Amazon, August 27,2010 I bought my first item off of this website. This item was a book named Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. On the 31st I received the book around 9:35-ish in the morning, which was very convenient for me. Amazon estimated the date and time in which the book should be delivered to me, their estimate was September 2 (2 days late, however that isn't bad since I needed the book read for my AP Lit. class by the 7th). There is also an optional to have Amazon text to your cell phone updates on the delivery of the book, I chose this option. However, the text came about 3 hours later saying that the book was being delivered to my address. Despite that minor fact, all in all Amazon service quality was great!

B002C6A6N6|5.0|First, let me start off by saying that I was a devoted Dr.Quinn: Medicine Woman fan for years throughout my childhood, as I reached puberty and adolescents, my interests turned to the darker televised world of MTV.  It wasnt until recently, I'd say the past year or so, that a co-worker, Mr. Paul Waldeier, really brought Dr.Quinn back into the forefront of my mind.  It was Paul's relentless attempts to prove to everyone on the sales team how valued the show's reign was to our society that really opened my eyes to the overall impact that this show has had on EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR LIVES...I mean, how can you forget Dr. Mike (Jane Seymour), \\"Sully\\" (the native american played by a caucasian), Matthew, Colleen and Brian (Dr.Quinn's three crazy kids)...<br /><br />For $150, you receive not only the finest quality of televised drama that has ever been offered to mankind - you will be purchasing a piece of televised history...good luck and gods speed...

0142402753|4.0|This is a fun book that early elementary students can enjoy on many levels.  As a story,  it is funny and engaging and develops in a predictable yet entertaining way.  The scruffiest giant in town decides to change his image when a new clothing store opens up in town- a town inhabited by giants, humans, animals, and even an elf or two.  In an instant, he transforms from the scruffiest to the spiffiest giant in town, and proudly heads home, walking tall.  On his way home, however, he encounters several animals who are in trouble and without even thinking twice, the giant gives each animal an article of his new clothing in order to solve their problems.  After each encounter, the giant walks off, singing a happy song that my students usually end up singing the rest of the day.  Needless to say, the anticipation over when the giant ends up in his underwear and how the situation is going to be resolved brings much excitement and many giggles.<br />  The illustrations are fun and colorful, and the students love to revisit the book and look at how the animals, people, and elves interact and behave in this unusual town.  The giant is an excellent role model for all, and the appreciative response the animals give to the giant reinforces the concept of 'thanks' and 'being grateful'.  This is an all around excellent read that rewards children in many ways during repeated readings.

0446563048|5.0|My husband and I got married on 8.29.10 in Boulder, CO. Right across the street from where we were married, was the book tour for Delivering Happiness. Tony's entire team worked with us to ensure that our day was special and that they didn't disrupt the ceremony etc since they had a live band. I was so grateful just for that, but he also sent us a signed booked that included a really sweet personal message for our wedding day. He also sent over a box of these signed books for our guests and gave us a champagne toast! It was so awesome and has created great memories for us. I've already gotten through the entire book, it was a breeze to read and SOOOOO GOOD! Everyone in my office has read it and we are all impressed! Very impressed with Tony, his team, his book, everything. Thank you for helping us make our day extra special!
0307120007|4.0|If only this were a regular board book....  My 10 month old loves books and she loves this one in particular - every page of this book has something fun for her (well, she's not very interested in the \\"smell the flowers page\\" - but every other page).  Books for babies are essentially toys - and this one is just not designed to be played with, which is a shame, because it would be perfect otherwise.  After my daughter tore the cover off, I actually bought a second copy from Amazon thinking we'd be more careful with it next time.  Well, the cover was off the second book within 5 minutes and the rest of the pages are following in quick succession.  Get rid of the spiral bound \\"thick\\" paper and give us a regular board book already!!!!
B0038QMREA|4.0|I bought this based on reviews and being a fan of most Dylan music I took a chance.  This person has some great talent and I enjoyed what I thought was excellent guitar work and I assume he was the piano player also which was also good.  The music was full and unique.  He know doubt did remind me of some good Dylan and I thought the lyrics were quite good.  However, on a couple of tracks I thought the recording level was quite off, particularly on the last track \\"Kids On the Run\\".  Since his voice can be a bit raspy or scratchy the high recording only amplified this and made it almost unlistenable.  Kristian Matsson is talented and I have no doubt he will only get better.  I think on future recordings they need to tone down the vocal recording level.  Worth buying.
B003X73QA8|5.0|If you told me a new release was a concept album about suburbia, I'd approach it with a mixture of skepticism and curiosity.  If you told me it was a sixteen song c.d. with this theme, my preconceptions would have leaned to three possible conclusions:  overreaching, just plain hubris, or sheer genius.  After years of elaboration from Supertramp, the bottom line of The Monkees' \\"Another Pleasant Valley Sunday,\\" as well as Billy Joel's appropriate update, \\"No Man's Land,\\" what else needs to be said about the banality of life in the suburban world?     Fortunately, because it comes from Arcade Fire, and music samples abound, their latest offering `The Suburbs' shouldn't be discounted.   I like to make up my mind on my own, but I have to admit, I'd go no further if it wasn't for favorable reviews by `Rolling Stone' and `The Boise Independent'.  For the former, Arcade Fire's creative prospects are still flourishing; for the latter accolades come just short of this generation's `Sgt. Pepper' or `Nevermind'.  Either way it's an easy bet this offering is on the short list for The Top Ten albums of the year.     Arcade Fire prevent themselves from painting into a corner by elaborating this theme well--and, going out on a limb--they're more consistent at sticking to their concept than The Beatles ever were.  The real goldmine, however, comes from the music itself, which is more varied than The Mall of America.  With shivery and shimmering strings, solid piano,  and cascades of synthesizers on select songs, their collection remains solid and interesting.  The texture and sound is outstanding throughout.  To build my own analogy, `The Suburbs' is this summer's `Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'.     The sing-a-long with the piano feel is given to the title track and \\"Deep Blue;\\" but they're also rock `n' roll ready with punky moments like \\"Month of May\\" and \\"Empty Room\\".  There's plenty--perhaps too many--pensive moments, too, but \\"Wasted Hours\\" with its 'Pet Sounds' nuances does more than tread water, and the Rickenbacher 12-string Byrdesque folk sound accompanying \\"Suburban War\\" is supple and smooth.  Synthesizers are awash in \\"City with No Children,\\" so at least `The Suburbs' music never gets boring.    As the talking head, Win Butler, seldom runs out of elaborations.  \\"Something don't feel right.../Like a record skipping, I'm a modern man. Maybe when you're older you'll understand./Why you don't feel right. Why you don't sleep at night.\\"  While his sentiments on \\"Modern Man\\" may resemble W.H. Auden's  (The poet who coined the phrase, \\"Age of Anxiety\\".), the soundtrack is indelibly and unforgettably Arcade Fire's.  . Although \\"Wasted Hours\\" can't be considered the suburban counterpart to Springsteen's \\"Jungleland,\\" and \\"Suburban Sprawl\\" (the first) sports a dangerous trend toward snooze control, \\"Suburban Sprawl II\\" gets right to the point.  While Butler's vocals resemble the next Neil Young, his wife,  Régine Chassagne's siren Yoko Ono-esque vocals admirably lament \\"...We can never get away from this sprawl, living in the sprawl/ Dead shopping malls/ Rise like mountains beyond mountains.\\"      The lectures, sermons, and stories made in between are left for you to investigate (They're about as eloquent as they are unsurprising--although one of the C.D.'s very best songs, \\"City with No Children,\\" is hardly retread.)  While not all territory is groundbreaking on 'The Suburbs,' the musical variety is enough to fill our shopping bag with enough nuances to keep us satisfied for some time to come.      (Please note that if you are downloading 'The Suburbs' you should put the seconds for no pause if you are burning a c.d. because of the number of segues--indiscernible pauses characteristic of classical music and brought to popular music on The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper'--are considerable.)
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Australia is the story of a well-bred but meddlesome English woman Lady Ashley (Nicole Kidman) who decides to go to Australia to check up on her husband's affairs there. When she arrives, she is met by a rough bachelor called Drover (Hugh Jackman) who takes her to her husband's property, only to discover that he has been killed. The murder is blamed on the natives, but Lady Ashley quickly finds that something is afoot with the cattle boss (David Wenham) and she promptly fires him.<br /><br />Without someone to drive her cattle, Lady Ashley is forced to care for the land herself, and she must make a quick go of it. She becomes \\"Miss Boss\\" to the natives, and her forceful nature and womanly touch makes her a better candidate for the job than one might have first expected.<br /><br />The story is long and very predictable. It is obvious that most of the auxiliary characters will die, and the storyline doesn't make these deaths very surprising. The author wanted us to feel sad, but not in such a way that would affect the story too much.<br /><br />The scenery is beautiful, but that doesn't make a film great. Aside from that, the best part of the film is Brandon Walters who plays the makeshift son of Lady Ashley and Drover. The old adage about kids in film seems true here. Although Kidman and Jackman are well known for their acting skills, this boy steals every scene from them. He is charming, intelligent, and his lingo is very entertaining. He is an Aboriginal boy, and an incredibly talented one at that. Here is to hoping we see him again on the screen.
0393078299|5.0|My bookshelf holds many titles explicating quantum physics for the interested layman (I am a retired attorney), but Manjit Kumar's \\"Quantum\\" stands alone.  Many of these books focus on the personalities of and personal/professional conflicts among those who made advances in the field over the course of more than a century and, as a result, the science can get lost in the human-interest forest.  Others highlight the 'hard science' without historical context and the presentation gets lost in the weeds of 'quantum weirdness'.<br />  Kumar's book is unique, in my reading experience, in the perfect balance it manages to strike.  It is rich in details of the human side of the story but always in a way that illuminates the evolution of the science.  As a result, the entire landscape becomes clearer, including several areas which had for me always remained somewhat opaque. I am thinking, in particular, of EPR, Bell's Theorem and their progeny.  In addition, Kumar's presentation creates a space around the Copenhagen Interpretation within which critical thought can be applied (many of the books in this area taking some form of the Copenhagen Interpretation as axiomatic).<br />  At ground level, quantum mechanics is a mathematics that works; practitioners can apply it as a tool without giving any thought to the higher-level questions it raises.  One level up, one finds the subject matter of most of the 'quantum for laymen' books I have read -- explications of what is commonly termed 'quantum weirdness'...superposition and Schrodinger's Cat, particle/wave duality depending upon the experiment, entanglement and 'spooky action at a distance' etc etc.  All very interesting and challenging.<br />  Kumar's \\"Quantum\\" includes but goes beyond that level of inquiry to focus the reader on the philosophical question as to what quantum physics has to tell us, if anything, about the nature of reality -- what is 'real' prior to or independent of observation?  Is the universe itself the product of wavefunction collapse? Is the concept of 'the' universe itself valid?  And much more.<br />  \\"Quantum\\" is, as a result, a singular achievement.the product of wavefunction collapse? Is the concept of 'the' universe itself valid?

B000WC3864|5.0|The Movie     This movie is amazing. Its an older movie, and it was low budget, but it has an amazing story. This movie is pretty bloody but nothing you can't handle and the action scenes are awesome. It was directed by Sam Raimi (Director of Drag Me To Hell and Spider Man 3) and is probably his best movie. Evil Dead is a cult classic and is truly the ultimate horror experience. If you like horror movies at all you'll buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.     The DVD     Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition) over exceeded my expectations. It has more extra content than I know what to do with. It comes with 3 discs. The widescreen, now the widescreen has had some problems, instead of stretching the image it actually cuts off the top and bottom of the image. BUT DON'T WORRY. The ultimate edition also comes with full screen which has all of the original film, the widescreen edition has commentary by the Director Sam Raimi, and the Full Screen edition has commentary by bruce campbell. The full screen and widescreen edition both have other extra content like behind the scenes and things like that. The artwork on the Ultimate Edition is wonderful and it also comes with a movie poster. The third disc is all extra content, SO MUCH extra content it will take you a long time to finish it all. It has interviews, meeting with the fans, update on how the actors are doing, ext. If you are a fan of Evil Dead this is the only way to go. You must buy Evil Dead Ultimate Edition.

At first I liked this album (ultra), but didn't love it - it had several decent songs, but nothing great - I thought.

No one album of theirs before or since has as many fantastic songs.

0439023513|3.0|I was SO excited to get Mockingjay. I had been wait for about nine months. When I first got it, although I was very excited, it was actually hard to get into, very unlike the other two. Katniss didn't seem like her real self. Although this would have been a bit much, because the 1st and 2nd books feature this, I actually missed the arena's suspense and exhilaration. It seemed like the book was blah for 2/3 of it and finally got ok at the end. I really wish this would have been better because I love Suzanne Collins but she just didn't come through on this. I have to give her credit though, it's hard to follow an act when the first two books were such great sellers. All in all, disappointing but at least we know what happens.   Corinne - 13
0385341008|4.0|I must say, I was dubious about the style of this book. I thought a bunch or letters would be stilted and boring. And to be honest, it does take a little while to get used to it. But once you're into the meat of the story, this is a delightful book with beauitful characters. The letter-style isn't a distraction - it merely reads like chapters from the point of view of different people, written in the first person. It means there is less description, but what it lacks in visual descriptions, it makes up for in characters and story.<br /><br />The book has somewhat of an Austin style - if you don't like traditional writing you may not like it. But for me, it added to the charm. The latter parts of the book are dedicated to a romance, which again, if you don't like romance you may lost interest.<br /><br />But for me, heart breaking stories, beautiful characters and a little dash of romance among literary allusions and a picturesque backdrop were all I needed for a good read on my recent holiday. Enjoy!
B002DKGWSE|5.0|I've been a Wes Craven fan for a long time. His THE HILLS HAVE EYES, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS are some of my all-time favorite horror movies. That said, I must admit that I'm not very fond of the original Craven version of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. It is one hell of a cautionary tale though! Now, I just watched the new (unrated), updated remake, and loved every minute of it! Produced by Craven and Sean Cunningham, this \\"re-imagining\\" is indeed glossier than the original, but it benefits from its tweeking / polishing. In the first LHOTL I found the criminals to be a gaggle of boobs who were occasionally frightening. In the new one, this bunch is completely cold-blooded, without a hint of slapstick. They're more hardened, stone-killers than murderous bumpkins. The parents are willing to do whatever it takes, especially during the unexpected, explosive finale! If you enjoy revenge / survival horror, then this is heaven-sent...
B00005QGAV|3.0|The videos for these songs are amazing, but the songs by themselves..most of them..well let's just say they work better with the videos. Michael Jackson was a genius in many ways and all his songs have a unique quality. I did love Black or White, Will You Be There, and a few others. They bring back great memories of my childhood too. But as an album, I don't think this is his best album, even though there are some songs I love, I just think most would agree that Thriller was much better.
B003YGC7OE|3.0|Antony has returned with a collection of songs which meander with quiet reverie. \\"Thank you for your love\\" is a brass infused piece which would work if only for the repetitious twenty-times-too- many \\"I thank you\\" freak out at the end. \\"You Are the Treasure\\" spans just over 2 minutes and amounts to a mediocre meditation on themes Antony revisits again and again. \\"My Lord My Love\\" is arguably the most beautiful and haunting song on the EP. It harks back to the older, tortured work titled \\"I Am A Bird Now.\\" For Antony to cover Bob Dylan and John Lennon for the last two tracks \\"Pressing On\\" and \\"Imagine\\" is an interesting -- if not odd -- choice. Both songs carry the same tone as the rest of the EP. While \\"Another World\\" and \\"The Lake\\" were EPs with a wider range, this one sort of plateaus from the very beginning.

0938045768|5.0|I became interested in bodyweight training recently, and as I was doing online searches for exercises and training programs, I kept running across references to this book. The reviews were all so uniformly glowing that I finally, hesitantly, ordered it. I was hesitant becuase the price is rather high, but I'm glad I made the purchase. The book is living up to the reviews I've read.<br /><br />The reason I appreciate this book so much is because I've let myself get out of shape and I need a program that is clearly outlined and begins slowly. I'd love to be doing one-armed pushups and pullups right now, but that's just not possible. The author breaks each exercise down into steps, and the first steps are simple enough that nearly anyone -- even me -- can do them. The author has developed a \\"beginner standard,\\" an \\"intermediate standard\\" and a \\"progression standard\\" for each step. For instance, the beginner standard for Step 1 of the pushups exercise is 1 set of 10 repetitions. Intermediate is 2 sets of 25, and the progression standard is 3 sets of 50. Believe me, anyone can begin with Step 1 -- in this case, Step 1 is \\"Wall Pushups\\" in which you stand facing a wall, place your palms against the wall, and do \\"pushups\\" that way. Surely even the most out of condition person can do one pushup like that. Once that person can do 3 sets of 50 (you're probably already there) you move onto Step 2.<br /><br />At the end of the book, \\"Coach Wade\\" puts together a number of workout programs. The program I'm doing now is called \\"New Blood\\" and involves \\"four of the most basic exercises performed over two sessions a week.\\" Wade writes: \\"Practice this program, or a similar routine, during your early work on the ten steps. Once you get past Step 6 on all four of the exercises mentioned, it's time to move on to the next program.\\"<br /><br />I appreciate very basic instruction like that -- I tend to push myself too hard in exercise programs, triggering internal resistance (\\"I hate working out! It's too hard!\\") and often injuring myself so that I'm sidelined and eventually give up the program entirely. I initially thought the \\"New Blood\\" routine would be too simple for even my out-of-shape self, but I was sore after my first few workouts. It's going to be some time before I've reached Step 6 on all four exercises, but I can already see progress.<br /><br />If you're interested in bodyweight training and the lost art of calisthenics (the word comes from the Greek words for \\"beauty\\" and \\"strength\\"), this is definitely a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />(Note: at the time of this review, the price set by whoever is selling this book on Amazon is about thirty dollars higher than the price of the book on the publisher's site.

B000078DOH|2.0|It doesn't have a good consistency to it, most songs are too loud and boring and there are maybe 3 songs I can truly say I like. It would be better to get What Hits instead or another best-of album.     For serious Pepper fans it might be nice to have because of nostalgia and the pics of Hillel Slovak with the band, before he passed away. But I don't find myself listening to it much.
B0002KVULG|4.0|Director John Badham's above-average remake of Tod Browning's original \\"Dracula\\" doesn't qualify as a frightmare.  Although \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" scenarist W.D. Richter adapted his screenplay from the stage play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, this glossy, 1979 Universal Pictures' release departs from Browning's version where Jonathan Harker went to superstitious Transylvania to confer with the sinister vampire count at his dilapidated castle about his future lodgings in England.  Conversely, the period piece action opens without delay as Dracula emerges from a sailing ship after it crashes on the beach at night near Dr. Jack Seward's sanitarium on the English coast.  Badham and Richter never let the action loiter in their wonderfully inventive yarn.  The brisk `cut-to-the-chase' opening and the swashbuckling ending as well as virtually everything in between make this 109 minute tale refreshing and enjoyable.  Mind you, dashing Frank Langella doesn't eclipse Bela Lugosi as the most notorious of all bloodsuckers.  Nevertheless, this \\"Dracula\\" wasn't played primarily for chills.  Instead, Badham and Richter underline romance rather than revulsion. This strategy distinguishes Langella's Dracula from Christopher Lee's predatory bloodsucker, so that Badham's \\"Dracula\\" adopts a completely different tact than the original \\"Dracula\\" and the gruesome Hammer \\"Dracula\\" franchise.  Despite efforts to convince him to do otherwise, Langella refused not only to bare his fangs but also let blood drip from his jowls.  Of course, the Hays Office did not allow Lugosi either the luxury of fangs or even black and white blood on his chin. On the other hand, consummate actor that he was, Langella managed to conjure up more than enough presence as Bram Stoker's legendary protagonist without playing second fiddle to gratuitous special effects.  Remember, this \\"Dracula\\" appeared long after Hammer had revitalized \\"Dracula.\\" Basically, Langella's Dracula is a debonair dude in evening clothes.  In this sense, he adheres to the tradition that Lugosi and Lee forged. Initially, Langella starred as Count Dracula on Broadway in a revival, and the two-year run proved triumphant enough to prompt producers Marvin and Walter Mirisch as well as Tom Pevsner to transfer it to the big screen.  Although he doesn't rely on fangs and blood, Langella's Dracula is a supernatural creature who can transform himself into a wolf and a bat. The scene where he flees from a vampire killer and lunges from an upstairs window as a wolf is impressive.  The stellar cast boasts a frail Laurence Olivier as Dracula's arch nemesis Professor Abraham Van Helsing with a heavy accent, a scene-stealing Donald Pleasence as Dr. Seward who gobbles candy, and a striking Kate Nelligan as Dracula's romantic interest Lucy Seward.  \\"Star Wars\\" lenser Gilbert Taylor makes everything looks atmospheric and Badham's staging is invigorating, particularly the ambiguous ending.in evening clothes.

0374158460|5.0|Getting to know the characters inside out, understanding their stories from different points of view allows us to care about them. Self-honesty of the characters encourages us to cut them some slack too, even when they and we both know it's not going in a good direction. But most of all, it allows us to see ourselves mirrored in their lives. One of the characters in the book admits that he enjoys reading the sections about himself more than the rest of it. We all see ourselves in what we read. What happened to me in this book was to observe their lives and to say, \\"yep,\\" about my own. All of us have experienced some kind of sibling rivalry, disappointments with our parents, mother or father, grandparents, misbegotten coupling with those we are meant to be with and those we aren't meant be with after all.     Franzen has provided it all along with a backstory and front stories of our cultural and political times. That is why it seems rather artificial to compare him to other writers or to weigh in on whether the critics are right or wrong. To me, it cracked open the realness of relationships described in ways that we witness as similar to our own. And it is not just about rich white folk either. These kinds of dynamics occur in most families around the world, I think.     Moreover, it opened up my own willingness to own what is real about my family and my life in the same way as the Berglunds did with theirs.  What I don't understand is how Franzen got to know so much about our culture if he had his laptop port to the Internet purposefully blocked for the nine years while he was writing \\"Freedom.\\" The word occurs over and over again in the book--and the various ironies with which our lives unfold within such freedom is part of the joy of reading this novel. You will laugh out loud! And also feel so bad at times. And, as they say, hopeful in the end. And, like me, perhaps you will look at yourself, your marriage and family with more understanding than beforehand. Quite a feat in my book!

B000IHY146|5.0|I became aware of Karen Dalton through her association with Fred Neil, and purchased her first album \\"It's So Hard To Tell Who's Going To Love You The Best\\" because of quotes I read from Neil praising her talent. That album was sparse in terms of production, and featured only acoustic instruments in its minimal backing of Dalton's voice. It was also the result of the producer in a sense misleading Dalton into recording an album of her own at a Fred Neil recording session. \\"In My Own Time\\" was Dalton's second record, and was more of a planned effort at making an album. \\"In My Own Time\\" features some of the best session musicians of the period, and despite the complaints of some of the other reviewers does not sound overproduced to me. I should preface my praise of any of Dalton's recordings to include that Dalton's voice is an acquired taste, and after reading some of the negative comments about her vocals on this page, it is obviously not for everyone. Nick Cave goes so far as to acknowledge this in his excellent liner notes. (I for one cannot stand her versions of \\"When A Man Loves A Woman\\" and \\"How Sweet It Is\\" that are on this album, and skip them immediately when they come on.) However, the good outweighs the bad in this case, at least to my ears. Like Nick Cave, I found \\"Something On Your Mind\\" to be one of the most amazing vocals I have ever heard. Cave stated in his contribution to the liner notes that he has listened to this song many, many times over the years, and I have to confess that for the first year I owned this CD I barely made it past the first song because I put \\"Something On Your Mind\\" on repeat so many times. \\"Katie Cruel\\" is another devastating song: a very minimal arrangement with Dalton on banjo and vocals, and a haunting result. I also have to comment on Dalton's version of Richard Manuel's \\"In A Station\\", and how her voice absolutely soars at about the three minute mark, not a moment that occurred too often in her recorded work. It made me think what it must have been like to hear her sing live. I also loved hearing her sing with an electric rock/blues backing on tracks like \\"In My Own Dream\\" and \\"One Night Of Love\\". The melancholy tracks \\"Take Me\\", and \\"Are You Leaving For The Country\\" are both ones that I play repeatedly; I love the feeling she gave those songs. I have to also mention that the packaging for this disc is top notch: a booklet accompanying the CD contains many photos of Dalton, an essay on the making of the album written by Patti Smith's guitarist Lenny Kaye, as well as notes on Dalton's music from Nick Cave and a poem by Devendra Barnhart. This was the last album that Karen Dalton recorded in her life, and I'm glad it is available. Her sad life may have shaped her voice to be what it was.

0316067938|5.0|SPOILERS<br />I can understand where the haters are coming from. And I think it boils down to this...<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer was writing an epic love story for Bella and Edward. Breaking Dawn was their happy ending, with a few obstacles along the way. Usually you don't get to see the happy ending. I'm grateful to be able to see their happy ending. I thought Stephenie did a great job of connecting the dots, so to speak. Not just in this novel but between all of them. But I'm digressing...<br /><br />My main point was that this above all else, is a love story. If you're reading it for the fantasy or the syfy or anything else, you're not going to \\"get\\" the last book or appreciate it.<br /><br />As Stephenie stated herself, to anyone complaining about parts of it being too hard to believe...you're reading a series about vampires and werewolves! She can write whatever the heck she wants because the whole thing is hard to believe!<br /><br />To those who complained about there being a baby at all and her lack of a maternal instinct and then all of a sudden she must have and love and protect this baby...maybe you'll get it once you're a mother. I honestly don't think even a father could completely understand this point of view. There's something about carrying your child, feeling her move inside you, that allows you to understand how Bella can go from no maternal side to being all about her baby.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, Stephenie did a beautiful job of connecting everything. I can't remember it all now, but here are some examples I can think of: Foreshadowing the immortal children and the imprinting on a very young child, making sure Bella fully realized what she was giving up before choosing to become immortal, Siobhan's gift of getting what she wills and she was willing no fight with the Volturi, Bella's pregnancy automatically brings about the deadline of her transition without anymore discussion or argument about it, Bella's protectiveness over her child brings about her ability to control her shield and protect them all, the child's ability to harmoniously resolve the love triangle because of the imprinting, how Jacob couldn't fall for Leah because he'd never imprinted on her and wasn't the whole point for him to imprint at some point. Hmmm, there was more but I can't remember it all. I just thought she did a beautiful job.<br /><br />To those who thought Edward turned weak, I say you're being ridiculous. Throughout the entire series his first priority has always been Bella's safety, phsyically and emotionally. He was watching Bella die in front of him due to the draining pregnancy. Who wouldn't react the way he did?! He came around once he could hear the baby and he saved Bella's life, kind of, haha.<br /><br />I will say, while I LOVE this novel & the tone, the tone is quite different from the first 3, so it'll be interesting to see how they do the movies and how they divide it. And I really hope they are able to show parts of the novel that occur in people's minds. I mean, the fantastic ending where Bella shows Edward her memories of their relationship and how much she loves him. The movie won't be the same without that beautiful ending, and of course Reneesme's unique communication, even Zafira's gift. I can't wait to see how they capture it all and pray they do a good job since it's so hard to make the movies as good as the books.<br /><br />I really really really really really really really hope Stephenie finishes Midnight Sun and even takes Edward's perspective all the way through to the end of the whole series. I love Midnight Sun, more than Twilight.<br /><br />I also must say simply because of how I relate to it. I hated that she had to turn around and have Bella realize she was in fact in love with Jacob too. I understood why she had to do it. So that Bella would see her option to remain human and have the full life. But I have been where she was. Where you're in so much pain and someone comes along and isable to help you heal. I have loved someone and not been in love with them but needed them and that person fell in love with me and I didn't reciprocate it. And I've also been the person someone needed and I fell in love with them and they didn't reciprocate it. I've been on both sides and neither is easy. And both the book and the movie spoke to me as that's who Bella was as well. I can't help but feel like she wasn't in love with Jacob. But I understand it, and understand how it lead to them being a part of each other eventually through Reneesme.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved this book the best and highly recommend it and just take into consideration whatever your perspective is going in.em but needed them and that person fell in love with me and I didn't reciprocate it.

B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception<br />Thousands of reviews have been written about Inception and everyone knows that this movie is a mindteaser that does not give any easy answers. I thought the movie was very good and had excellent acting, music, locations, action and performances. Chris Nolan has served us another mid bender after Memento. I came across an article which said that Inception can be attributed to Quantum Physics which points out that the real world does not actually exist and solids are nothing but an illusion created by energy. I read many articles which have attempted to decipher the movie and the following is a compilation of the best answers to the riddle called Inception. I strongly caution that you do not read the following if you have not seen the movie. These are not my theories but compiled from various blogs and newspapers.<br />Explanation 1 The spinning top is central to the film. Cobb explains that one can distinguish dreams from reality on the basis of the totems motion. If it stops you are in the real world and vice versa.<br />Explanation 2 Cobb's ring appears in dream sequences and disappears when he is in reality. In the last scene the top is still spinning but there is no ring on his finger. His children have not aged and look the same. Was Inception a dream or a reality?<br />Explanation 3 Cobb was just dreaming on the flight from Sydney to Los Angeles.<br />Explantion 4 Adriane ( Ellen Paige) not Cobb was the head shrink who had been hired by Cobb's father played by Michael Caine to cure his son of his guilt complex. According to this theory Cobb was in a mental facility and his room number was 528491- the number that Fisher gives as the password to his father's safe. Adriane plants the Inception in Cobbs head to make him realize that his wife is dead and that he should move on.<br />Some other Theories:<br />Did Cobb and Mal ( Marillion Cotillard) go old together? They did and Cobbs memory of their youth is a fantasy. Why? Because when Cobb tells Adriane the final story of how they escaped the limbo, the clasped hands of Mal and Cobb on the railroad tracks appear old and wrinkled, just as they are when we see them walking towards the city. The youthful version could be a delusion created by Cobb which was visited by Adriane.<br />Too many questions, Inception deserves multiple viewings to be understood. I loved the movie and will give it four stars. 9/10/10they escaped the limbo, the clasped hands of Mal and Cobb on the railroad tracks appear old and wrinkled, just as they are when we see them walking towards the city.

B0025KVLTM|3.0|The music on Sgt. Peppers is great (5 stars).  But there is a problem with the lyrics.  Every song on Sgt. Peppers is about drugs.  So I can't recommend it to anyone.  There should at least be a parental advisory warning on the label.  Here is a list of the songs and the drugs that they are about:    1. Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (amphetamines)  2. With A Little Help From My Friend (pot)  3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds (LSD)  4. Getting Better  (uppers/speed)  5. Fixing A Hole (heroin)  6. She's Leaving Home (Quaaludes)  7. Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite (heroin/'horse')  8. Within You Without You (hashish)  9. When I'm 64 (crystal meth/'crank')  10. Lovely Rita (psilocybin/'shrooms')   11. Good Morning Good Morning  Good Morning (PCP/'Sherman')  12. Sgt. Peppers (reprise)(caffeine and datura/jimson weed)  13. A Day In The Life (LSD and tobacco)    Instead of re-mastering this album again in a few years, hopefully what the Beatles will do is change some of the lyrics so that the songs are not all about drugs...  Hey Paul and Ringo, are you listening?  We want new lyrics for this album.    Note:  It should be mentioned here that I don't hold it against the Beatles that they wrote songs about drugs.  Back in the 60's, they didn't really know how bad drugs are for you.  In fact, The Beatles (and other hippie bands) believed that drugs are good for you.  So it is understandable (even commendable) that the Beatles encouraged kids to take drugs.  After all, it is the thought that counts.  The Beatles thought that they were helping kids by turning them on to LSD and grass.     It wasn't until later (the 80's) that doctors realized how bad drugs are for you.

I'm doing that - I'll be a hit -- I'll give make a batch of Cake Pops to put in front of the basket and if you buy a ticket - you get a pop!

0374158460|2.0|So it's \\"only\\" 576 pages.  It feels like 1000.  Jonathan Franzen reminds me of the smart guy in creative writing class who comes up with experimental fiction that is both Clever and Tedious and insists on reading the whole story out loud to the class.    I have written over 130 reviews for Amazon and this is the first time I have ever reviewed a book I have not finished. I really tried to get into \\"Freedom.\\" I knew I was in trouble when it took me a week to finish the \\"free sample\\" on my Kindle. But, I did buy the rest of the book and kept going. The first section of the book was somewhat engaging, but I was driven to distraction by the way it was told through exposition rather than dramatic scenes. (I was glad to see that at least one other reviewer has pointed that out.)  I did not really like the characters and their story read like a slightly enlarged caricature of latte-drinking, Prius-driving liberals.  Then we got to the Autobiograpy of Patty Berglund, written like her own diary \\"at her therapist's suggestion.\\" It became unbearable reading in Patty's own voice, as she is an intentionally (by Franzen) unpolished writer and not a very likable character. I could not event tell whether Franzen ultimately respected or liked Patty--I hope so.  I can recognize the talent of Franzen's craft here, and he does sneak some interesting and revealing details in here and there, but it just did not hold together for me. I could take Patty's voice for one chapter but was dismayed to realize it would go on that way for three chapters.  I really don't want to read that much of anyone's diary, much less this character, whom I could not motivate myself to care about very much.       I ultimately gave up just after Patty met the musician Richard Katz and also her eventual husband, Walter.  Katz was promising, but when Patty met Walter and Franzen started to go into the details of Walter's background, I was profoundly bored. Then I saw on my Kindle's progress marker that I was only13% of the way through the book, and I decided to throw in the towel.  Could all that reading have really made only 75 pages' worth of progress?       There is much debate about whether Franzen is overrated as a literary genius. Clearly I don't get the attraction. The novel that most reminded me of \\"Freedom,\\" a story that succeeded better, was [[ASIN:0307454614 Swimming]] by Nicola Keegan.  Her story is also challenging in many ways; first person narration that starts from birth; family drama that detours into total melancholy, but even though at times \\"Swimming\\" frustrated me, it did carry me along and I was glad to have read it.  Franzen never generated that hook and momentum that I needed to tackle his massive novel, which, by the way, feels even longer on the Kindle as it is served up a demi-page at a time.    **Please see my October 4 comment for final thoughts after finishing the book.  I stand by my original review.**
B001NERPHS|3.0|MUSIC: 5 stars, sound-quality: 5 PRODUCTION: .5    Over 100 songs in bootleg-form ARRIVED from these epic 1967 sessions, songs which caused Eric Clapton to \\"change his life,\\" and change his band, songs which served to memorialize the first pure demand & awing purity of the music-living-public of the late 1960s, songs which They The People named as the \\"Great White Wonder,\\" for the plain white cover of this bootlegged LP showing up in hundreds of little record stores across America. That bright white cover became a metaphor for people taking music as seriously as life and death, shelving careers and the so-called real world, and staying up all night and partying in parking lots & on sidewalks while awaiting a rock-concert or a new record-release; They The People were sexing-it-up, dancing, doping, traveling, above all, living fully and wildly.    It was not so much a COUNTER-CULTURE, as a Euphoria-Culture, and as well, a COUNTER-Enslavement-Culture; bootlegs like the Basement Tapes were not merely its soundtrack but its basis, as music meant more to more people than ever before.    This culture has been bartered dead, frittered away by pettiness, by sickly greed, hysterics, spite of matronly moralizers, and of these 135 songs, some half-dead businessman, or eunuch-\\"person,\\" (as equal opportunity numbness reigns) smugly decided we get \\"24 songs.\\" Good going record labels. Learn to sell records & get at least greed right. There are TWELVE TO FIFTEEN cds in the REAL, bootleg editions of these \\"Basement Tapes.\\" After 40 years the philistines serving us music have still left most this masterpiece to be bootlegged: wasting tax-payer dollars with the FBI ordered to hunt down bootleggers reacting to pure market-demand, a thing doomed in this monopoly of idiocy. The Great White Washout, The Great White Hope/lessness, The Great White Wonder of Wasn't.     Here are some songs, EACH ONE left off the legal version, some representing the best work done by either Dylan or the BAND:\\"Spanish is the Language of Love.\\" This is simply one of the greatest songs celebrating sexual love ever created. Other great songs: \\"Folsome Prison Blues\\" \\"People Get Ready\\" \\"Instrumental Jams\\" \\" \\"Bourbon St\\" \\"I'm Guilty of Loving You\\" \\"I Forgot to Remeber to Forget\\" \\"900 Miles\\" \\"Under Control\\" \\"You Win Again\\" \\"Big Flood\\" \\"Allen Ginsberg\\" \\"All You Have to Do Is Dream #s 1,2,3 et al\\" \\"Lock Yr Door\\" \\"\\"Try Me\\" \\"Rock Salt Nails\\" \\"I don't Hurt Anymore\\" ET AL: folks do you think that commerce-cretins who lack any strains of a soul should have to power to deny us these songs and this legacy?  I don't. Nationalize the archives, seize the material and put it out so it doesn't mold-over in some billionaire's basement.    What songs are out legally are great. Everyone needs to know, for example, that multiple versions exist even legally released between albums The Band's BIG PINK, and this legal edition of the BASEMENT TAPES: Bob Dylan sings \\"Tears of Rage\\" here, but on Big Pink, it's apparently The Band's Danko singing the song. This anarchic method of creation makes the sessions great: members recorded different versions & takes of the same song, with differing singers, guitar-treatments, melodic push/pull. These are the speciations forming great art. Upto 13 cds of the Dylan/Band sessions--some people claim more--have been printed on bootleg record-labels. These indomitable, unstoppable, lively bootlegs represent the still-not-attenuated assertion of liberty, a mortal, last-minute left-hook thrown hard by a people still convinced they have a right to their joy & celebrations, and that the Blob-Bushes, the rabid-Ralph Reeds, & all Ahmet Erteguns are just plain wrong & black-mamba vile. The real, bootleg'd Basement Tapes are works of genius; these mere 2 cds could never show so: the many versions of \\"TOO MUCH OF NOTHING,\\" each beautifully unique & on varied bootlegs, do NOT appear on this collection. You get just one. Alas, TOO much of nothing. Perhaps Robbie-Rob might Remedy this too much of lacking.     This legal collection DOES have excellent sound quality. Given the sources, that's quite a commendable result.     But O Record Labels: it's been 40 years: put out the whole thing. It's late. Tapes are disintegrating. People are dying. Many don't have health-care: at least let them die in sublimity-song. While you're at it, box-set ALL THE STONES TOURS for especially 1969, & 66-77. As well, no-one would ever know from existing CDs that Mr. Clapton & his CREAM rivaled Jimi, esp. in years 66, 67; the bootleg soundboard of CREAM Detroit 10-15-67 justifies the graffiti titling him \\"GOD.\\" NSU goes an epic 20 minutes. The petty amount of CREAM material we have is so sickeningly small it proves Marx wrong & De Sade right (at least via Karl Abraham's retentive sadism). Back to Mr. Dylan/Band: where are all the tapes/films from 1974, then 1975-6 Rolling Thunder Review tours? The live albums? One cd set is \\"too much of nothing\\"... THE TAPES ARE JUST ROTTING: IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE HOW TO SELL THEM, GIVE THEM AWAY, you puffy puerile scrooges. PEACE. (ps: when I phoned ABKO records & told A & R that the 2010 GET YER YAYAS was STILL cut in the epic Sympathy for the Devil, she said \\"really? I didn't know that..what do you mean\\") Write your local record CEO.

I have been \\"God-blessing\\" difficult situations or difficult people and that has been the only thing that has made a positive difference.

B002UJIY7A|3.0|I tried to watch this film about 10 times,and fell asleep everytime.I finally got to see \\"A Perfect Getaway\\" last night.The best part is seeing Hawaii.I was there in 1996,and its beutifull,and the movie brings back all the wonderfull memories.  I don't want to give the movie away,but I knew right away who the bad guys were,and you don't find out untill the last half hour.I can see why \\"A Perfect Getaway\\" wasn't a huge hit,but its worth watching if you have the time.
B003ITZBW2|4.0|I recently received this DVD as a birthday gift.  I was a little hesitant, at first, because I was unfamiliar with the voice actors but after watching it, I'm very impressed with this production.  Bruce Greenwood was excellent as Batman and the rest of the cast was also great.<br /><br />The animation was really amazing.  Some of the scenes of Gotham City looked pretty realistic.  This movie was much darker than any of the Batman movies to date.  I definitely noticed that there was much more violence than what I'm used to seeing in W.B.'s animation.  Most of the really \\"bad\\" things were done off camera but there was a lot of gunfire, beatings, blood, and killing.  Not to say that those things are not appropriate, because they certainly are, but parents may want to preview this film before allowing younger children to watch it.<br /><br />Given the storyline of Jason Todd's Robin/Red Hood, the violence is not surprising.  There are appearances by Nightwing, Alfred, Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, the Black Mask, and various other Gotham criminals.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the special features.  There is a really interesting featurette on Robin/Dick Grayson, which I enjoyed.  There are also two episodes from Batman: TAS featuring Robin.  On the main disc, there is a sneak peak of the upcoming Superman/Batman Apocolypse movie, which looks good.
1605092762|5.0|Paul Polak has clearly done amazing work for impoverished people, and this book tells that story well. I found his book to be refreshingly practical, clearly written, and engaging. Here is a man who, rather than wringing his hands at the injustice of poverty, has rolled up his sleeves and come up a number of effective ways to help people pull themselves out of poverty.<br />Although he mentions many tools, the key ones he talks about are the treadle pump for tapping shallow ground water, and low-cost drip irrigation.<br /><br />There are a couple of very critical points that Polack brings up that are worth underlining.<br />First of all, the tools that his company sells are actually sold to poor people. Yes the tools come with great support. Yes the tools come with a strong guarantee of quality. However they are not given away for free. Rather they are sold, and this contracting requires a risk and a commitment on the part of the buyer.<br /><br />Just as importantly, and this is the second point, bringing user money (as opposed to donor money) and commitment into the business model, gives it a fighting chance of being a self-sustaining model. It's not just about designing and manufacturing the treadle pump, rather it's about creating a whole support ecosystem around such a product, including a dealer channel, marketing,  financing, product installation and training, product repairs, replacement parts, and so on.<br /><br />Every part of this system creates more opportunities for value-add and employment. This is a subtle point, and yet it comes out nicely in Polak's book, that you have to think of developing a *system* around products in developing countries, rather than just dropping them from the air and going away.<br /><br />A final note is that this book is an absolute pleasure to read, particularly against the backdrop of many books on poverty that while being impressively sophisticated, are challenging to get through. In contrast, this one's a page-turner.
031606792X|5.0|I'm writing this review after reading the heart wrenching reviews of some who found the book not so pleasing, and that's putting it very very mildly. I understand why some would not find the book very pleasing, but having read the series since day 1 I have read them over and over and over again. My copy of Twilight was so battered and broken that it had to be re-purchased. I read the signs and knew what was coming. Her life with Edward was never easy or simple, and what kind of life would she have had without a little bloodshed?<br /><br />This ending was a story, not a kiss on the throat and wonder. And that's what we would have done: Wonder. We would have wanted more, another story, an \\"after life\\". We got what we didn't have to ask for.<br /><br />I think the ending is probably more suited to the younger readers, I'm 22, and to my friends and me this was the best book.<br /><br />Now I'm just waiting for Midnight Sun, if she's even still working on it.

0226264211|4.0|Capitalism and Freedom is a classic work by Friedman. Many of his thoughts, from the mid-20th century, are still timely here in the early 21st. This book is a good read for capitalist and socialist alike. And although I enjoyed it, I would like to have seen better sourcing and references from this author. Yes, it's an essay-type work, an extended think-piece, but because Friedman wrote this book in the late 1950s, when he wasn't quite yet the economics superstar that he would later become, I think better support and references should have been provided by someone of his then-status.
1439181780|5.0|\\"The Power\\", by Rhonda Byrne, is a book about the power of love.  The author wrote \\"The Secret\\" in 2006 and it became a world-wide bestseller.  The author promises that this book will add immeasurabley to what you learned in \\"The Secret\\".<br /><br />My father suffered a heart attack and I was spending endless hours at the hospital.  One evening, I went to Walmart and I noticed this book on the shelf.  I was instantly drawn to it.  I spent the next couple of days reading this book as I sat in the hospital.  It was a very anxious time but this book helped me gain a different perspective.  The \\"power\\" in this book is the power of love.  Your life is made up of only two kinds of things...positive things and negative things.  This book explains how your attitude and way of thinking can make bad things seem better.<br /><br />Most of the information in this book comes from the New Thought Movement of the early 1900s.  These authors taught the principles of positive thinking and the law of attraction.  Ms. Byrne quotes many of these authors in this book but she also describes how these principles can be used in everyday life to produce positive results in your life.<br /><br />My favorite chapter in the book is \\"Keys To Power\\".  One of the topics in this chapter is the \\"key of gratitude.\\"  Everytime I start feeling down, I think of things that I am thankful for.  I am soon feeling much better.  Ms. Byrne says, \\"No matter what negative situation you may find yourself in, you can always find something to be grateful for, and as you do, you harness the force of love that eliminates negativity.\\"<br /><br />Positive thinking does not always come easy to me.  I remember my mom telling me when I was a child, \\"All you ever do is grumble, gripe and complain.\\"  Children tend to live up to spoken expectations so I tend to see the cup as half empty instead of half full.  I like this book because it reminds me that changing your mind can change your life.  I have a decision to make.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|I loved the Grindhouse Films: Death Proof and Planet Terror!  When I heard they were making the mocked trailer of Machete into a true film, I was phyched!     This movie lives up to the other \\"Grindhouse\\" films--with it's exploitation and bloody, comic book like effects and action!     The movie is about how one hand washes the other between dirty US politicians and Mexican Drug Lords--using and betraying poeple on both sides of the fence--only to care about money and power.  It's a story about corruption,betrayal, revenge, poeple coming together, \\"Messing with the wrong Mexican\\" and, as Jessica Alba's character says, \\"To do what's right.\\"     It's a film chuck full of great actors such as two LOST stars, Danny Trejo from Rob Zombie's DEVIL'S REJECTS, Tom Savini, Robert Di Nero, Cheech from Cheech and Chong and even Don Johnson!  Lindsey Lohan played a slutty, drug using daughter of a politican's lackee: so it wasn't much of a stretch for her to play! How she became a popular actress is beyond me! On the other hand, we did have the beautiful and very talented actress, Jessica Alba in the film--from such fame as Dark Angel, Sin City and the Fantastic Four Films.     If you wanna see a fun, gorey, mind blowing action packed film--this one is worth every penny to catch on the big screen and to purchase when it's made available on DVD!
0439023513|2.0|With \\"Mockinjay\\" one realizes that the point of trilogies is to ruin the last book. I can not see how Collins could have made this much worse. Kill Katniss? She might as well have since she is asleep, crying, in a coma, or something else for the entirety of the book. And she ends up dead inside anyway. KIll Peeta? She actually did. Not physically or anything like it. But she destroyed the character from the first two books and for what? He is literally a killing zombie. Kill Gale? Again, she might as well have since he is no longer the same character. The good friend turns out to the one who kills prim.  Kill Prim - the main driving force of the series? Yeah, she does.    All in all, this last book is a complete waste of time since nothing happens as it should. Whenever readers can come up with a better ending for a series, then you know the author has done nothing memorable. And if this is in any way memorable, it's because it is such a terrible conclusion to the first two installments.    The violence, the war, the suffering is what drives the first two books. But there is also love. There is katniss and there is peeta. This last book has no katniss, no peeta and no gale. There is no conversation long enough to captivate the heart. There is no hope long enough to inspire a future. There is no fixing of a broken mother and daughter strained relationship. And if all good human qualities are nonexistent, what is the point of this book? All the emotion and all the love and all the hope of a future are left for the last two pages in a summary so short as if it's bone thrown for a starved dog. But it doesn't satiate the hunger. It doesn't heal the violence. Katniss has an \\"insane-psychotic\\" peeta, two kids and a broken, empty heart that nothing can heal.    Great book!!!

B001NLKT60|4.0|This is a sequel to Larsson's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and it grabs the reader from the very first page.  It ties up many of the unanswered questions that arose in 'Tattoo' and further enhanced Salander's character.  Well written and produces a thought provoking experience that will be hard to replicate.
0156027321|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in the past 5 years.    The true meaning of the story is not revealed until the end. I was refreshingly taken by surprise and ended up thinking about the layers of meaning for several years. This is really quite unusual and stimulating. I don't wish to say anything about the story, the other reviews provide a surfeit of details, I simply recommend- just read it without preconception.    I hate to say this, but I doubt the author will ever be able to achieve this level again. Not because of lack of talent, but simply the fact that this book is of the Animal Farm, Catch-22, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest etc literary transcendence quality.
0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson is really onto something with the Millennium Series.  Best read in years.  Terrific characters and plotlines...
0307454541|3.0|Who knew that Swedes loved coffee so much? If we are to believe Stieg Larsson's narrative in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" then Swedes enjoy coffee around the clock ... be it 3 pm or 4 am, they're knocking back a cup of joe and inviting others to join them in over caffeinated bliss. Which, you know, to each their own, it just seems like coffee was the central plot of the book rather than any overarching, suspense filled murder mystery.<br /><br />I'm usually not one for the mystery or political thriller genre, but I was waiting for several hours in Boston's South Station and decided to purchase it. The glaring neon book jacket was calling to me at the bookstand and I had recently read about the casting show-down as to who would play Lisbeth Salander in the US film adaptation of the book. Would it be Natalie Portman? Emma Watson? Carey Mulligan? I believe the part has now been awarded to an actress named Rooney Mara.<br /><br />I didn't hate this book but I didn't love it either. Not to regurgitate too many other reviews, but the character of Mikael Blomkvist was definitely hollow. I'm sorry, why do all these women immediately fall in love with him? He doesn't seem to have very many redeeming qualities unless you consider: adultery, narcissism, and bad parenting to be redeeming. He also describes his time spent in jail as something of a holiday. Huh. Interesting. Note to self: if going to do jail time, do it in Sweden.<br /><br />Larsson spends a lot of time and page space going into excruciating detail about things that really make no difference to the story (ie: what type of equipment someone is using, what its made out of, how much it costs, how heavy it was; what exactly is on someone's sandwich ... never forgetting the coffee of course). These details would be fine if they served to expand the reader's knowledge and understanding of the character, but they don't. I felt like half the narrative was consumed with minute details, cataloguing things that I didn't care about and which added nothing to my experience of the book.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander was slightly less hollow and more interesting than Blomkvist. She seemed to be capable of real emotions exhibited through (oh my god!) a reaction that was more than just [shrug] \\"ok.\\" I felt like the mystery of the book was more about her and what kind of character she was rather than anything Blomkvist was fiddling around with in the hinterlands of the Swedish countryside. That being said, there were moments when I was drawn in to the mystery of the missing girl, Harriet Vanger, but I found the conclusion of that part of the story to be far-fetched and implausible.<br /><br />I really didn't care about the sub-plot involving Blomkvist and Wennerstrom ... something that is also tied up a little too neatly by the end of the book.<br /><br />Again, I didn't hate it and found it to be an okay airport/train station/beach read/vacation read.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I won't bore you with a really long review, instead I will tell you what I have owned before these and how these compare.<br /><br />I have owned or extensively listened to the following:<br /><br />Audio Technica ATH-M50<br />Audio Technica ATH-AD700<br />Sennheiser 595 premiere<br /><br />and with my taste ( since all sound is dependent on the user after all ) these simply blow away all of those headphones in every regard.<br /><br />My first impression of these is WOW, the soundstage is absolutely the most wide and accurate I have ever heard! All of the frequencies are balanced, not to much bass or highs its just natural! Everything sounds amazing, I won't go into detail about how the highs have amazing detail or that I can hear things in music that I could not before ( of course all of those things would be true with these headphones ) but I am sure that all of the other reviews will tell you that, instead now I will compare individually to each of the headphones listed.<br /><br />Compared to Audio Technica ATH-M50<br /><br />First off this is kind of unfair since the M50 is a closed back headphone but with that out of the way the following still holds true. Soundstage, soundstage, soundstage! The M50 lack any form of a 3D soundstage everything with the M50's sounded smashed up against your face instead of natural not to mention there was too much bass and it lacked detail over all the frequencies.<br /><br />Compared to Audio Technica ATH-AD700<br /><br />The AD700's are the closest to the AKG 702's in overall performance. The AD700's actually retain a wonderful soundstage and nice mids and highs. Too me it sounded like the AKG 702's just made the soundstage a little bigger and added the bass that was missing in the AD700's not to mention a nice little detail boast throughout the range of audio. So better sound stage, better bass and more detail. Overall though for the $80 the AD700's can often be bought for they are not bad at all.<br /><br />Compared to the Sennheiser 595's<br />I was expecting a lot from the 595's when I ordered them based on the great reviews not to mention I had owned older pair of Sennheiser that I liked. Wow was I disappointed with the 595's! Everything on them seemed like it had a tint or vial over it. Like they added overcast onto the audio and IMO lacked the detail level that even the AD700s had. Honestly that's the only thing that bothered me was the masked sound. But it REALLY bothered me so I would put these phones  near the bottom of the list in terms of overall sound.<br /><br />I hope this helped some people make up there mind. I am also sure there will be a lot of people who disagree with me, and that's fine after all whats \\"best\\" is up to the user and everyone has a different taste in sound. I am simply sharing my opinion. Also make sure that you have these headphones properly amped and that you have a good DAC or sound card.sed on the great reviews not to mention I had owned older pair of Sennheiser that I liked.

B002ZG98UA|5.0|When it comes to movies, there are general expectations that everyone can rely upon:  Having big name stars does not guarantee quality, anything James Cameron makes will earn more money then the total income of many third world countries, and movies based on video games are awful.  Yet, surprisingly, Resident Evil:  Afterlife breaks the trend by being a movie based on a video game that isn't just decent...it's actually really fun.    Resident Evil:  Afterlife, follows Alice, genetically modified super heroine, who for the past three films have been battling zombies, undead monsters, and generally making the film's universe revolve around her.  This film sees her continuing her quest to fight the evil Umbrella Corporation and save the world (or what's left of it) from a zombie apocalypse that has wiped out over 99% of humanity, by means of guns, kung fu, and whatever weapons she can improvise on hand, while trying to find the last, true safe place on Earth.    While the past entries in the Resident Evil film series have been good, but not great, it's one of the very, very few franchises that has steadily gotten better with each installment, and Afterlife is the best one yet.  The production values are surprisingly high throughout, featuring solid effects, fantastic cinematography that creates a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere, and best of all, lots of action.  From beginning to end, Resident Evil:  Afterlife is packed to the brim with exciting action sequences, the highlight of which is a water drenched battle with a massive, axe-wielding monster.  This is a film more interesting in hurling monsters and rabid zombies at your face, rather then debating the finer qualities of the human condition.    Now, I will admit that as a fan of the video games this movie is based off of, I am somewhat biased in my review of the film.  There are plenty of little errors that are common in the genre, from a paper thin plot, thin characters, and an ending that sets up yet another sequel, instead of ending a few minutes earlier and being a self contained story.  And yet...even knowing the flaws were there, I still had a fantastic time watching the gunfights, monster battles, and all the explosions, and seeing the games I enjoy coming to life before my eyes.      In the end, Resident Evil:  Afterlife is really meant for fans of the games the movies are based on (complete with plenty of winks and nudges towards moments from the games themselves).  People who haven't played the games will struggle to make sense of the characters, the genetically engineered super powers, and what's going on in general, but even then, fans of post apocalyptic action films, zombies, and monsters can enjoy it as well (and for horror fans, there are even a few genuinely scary, jump-out-of-your-seat moments).  The film sets out to be a fun, action packed B movie, and in that aspect, it completely success.  Highly recommended.

B000AYEIZY|4.0|The band sounded as if they never broke up. The song selection was fairly inclusive though Stormy Monday was a surprise. Clapton's playing seems inspired. Claptom seems to be avoiding the wah wah pedal which is especially noticeable on White Room.  The sound is great and sounds as good as they did on the Fairwell concert video.
0439023483|5.0|My son is eleven and I have read to him every night nearly since his birth.   Some years ago we read the \\"Gregor the Overlander\\" series by S. Collins and loved it. It's a wonderful read. I'm nearly embarrassed to tell someone the plot and expect them to believe me when I say it's a wonderful series, but truly, that is the case. I recently discovered that Ms. Collins had written another series, a trilogy and bought the first book in that series; The Hunger Games.     This series is much darker than the Gregor series, and at times I've questioned whether it's appropriate for my 11-year old. I decided to press on, as kids get exposed to so much these days anyway (despite no TV in our home) that sheltering them from written violence really doesn't shelter them from the violence they hear about every day at school and other locales. Plus, violence in the context of a well reasoned and thoughtful book is much less \\"damaging\\" than what they're routinely exposed to despite our best efforts.     This book is absolutely en-captivating. It pulls you in from the very beginning and you simply can't put it down. The lead character, Katniss, is a complex mix of warrior and care-giver. She has been driven, by her devotion to caring for her family in a post-apocalyptic world, to learn the arts of hunting and survival. When her sister, Prim, is chosen as a Tribute for the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Her hunting/survival skills have prepared her well for her warrior role in the games. She's less prepared to understand and deal with her own emotions as she learns that others, like her fellow Tribute Peeta, put honor, love and ethics above simple survival. Katniss is continually torn between her distrust of other's intentions and her observations of what appears to be selfless giving.     I won't give away details of the plot. I will offer that whether the reader is an adult or a tween, this book is one well worth reading. For parents who are eager to instill a love of reading in their children, this book is a fabulous \\"tool\\" to achieve that end. My son would have me stay up all night long and read the book from beginning to end. As I travel a lot for my job, I even went so far as to install Skype on my computer (per my son's request) so that I can continue reading this book to him while I'm traveling.     Parents, if you want your kids to embrace reading, buy them this book. They won't be able to resist the story-line (and neither will you if you read it).
B0009WFFS6|5.0|The sound is superb and the filming almost perfect. I especially liked when there were images of all three at the same time in separate windows. The vocals seem to be split up differently than when they first recorded these songs. Maybe they were trying to preserve Bruce's voice to last for four days. Very enjoyable and a purchase I am glad I made.
0439023483|5.0|A very intense book, while not a new concept in the genre it is told very well. Every book out there now is about vampires and people with special powers, Katniss the main character is just a normal person with skills anyone could learn. The characters are well developed, better than any shimmering vampire or hairy werewolf. The quality of this story is amazing, and the qualities displayed by its characters could teach us something.

B00111YM5G|3.0|5 stars for the sexy female \\"Jade\\" character, less 2 stars for the confusing end.<br />Towards the end of the movie, we see Archangel Michael healing Gabriel and Gabriel throwing himself down from the rooftop. Wait, didn't we learn earlier in the movie that once any angel, good or bad, dies in this earthly realm, s/he remains dead as a human mortal? So why is Gabriel \\"commiting suicide\\" after his earthly mission has been accomplished?<br /><br />BTW, this movie is about Archangel Gabriel being sent to earth after his heavenly compatriots went missing during the battle to oust an evil one. I'm not quite sure  how to rate this low-budget movie just yet. I guess it's OK.
0399536108|5.0|Just as Chris has done with his previous ventures, this book really resonates on a visceral level.  There is no easy way to describe what topic best characterizes this book.  It's a business book and a self-help book and a philosophy book and a guide to life book.  Chris truly believes that there is enough out there for everyone and relishes in helping people find their way to true happiness.      His examples and stories are incredibly relate-able.  So much so that I called my 7 year old son in to sit with me and read some of the parts on fear and pushing through the walls that hold us back from experiencing life.  Those lessons made sense to my son and I know that this book will make sense to anyone that gives it a chance.      The Art of Non-Conformity is destined to be a book that people will credit as causing turning points in their life.  I know it will for me.
B0039TD7RC|2.0|This is a classic Stones collection, of course, but I wouldn't recommend this particular version, \\"re-mastered\\" as it is. The material is overly processed to keep the volume constant throughout and as a result it is NOT a pleasure to listen to. This has been already pointed out by others; I should have noticed.
B003JTHESA|2.0|After the phenomenal album A Matter of Life an Death I was excited to listen to this one.  Unfortunately it doesn't even come close and may be even worse than Dance of Death!  I would go song by song but it's just not necessary.  The entire album lacks any energy and both Dickinson and the band sound tired and old.  Hopefully the follow up will be close to Matter.  It seemed as if Dance was the end only to kick Maiden back to life.  This however is a disgrace!
B002ZG98UA|4.0|As far as movies based on video games go, the Resident Evil series has been a cut above the rest.  One good reason for this is the director, Paul WS Anderson, and his wife, actress Milla Jovovich (as Alice), who have created all four of the films together.  None of the last three has quite topped the first RE, but then that's usually the case with sequels, right? (With a few notable exceptions.)  Still, this 2010 version of RE is pretty impressive, especially with the introduction of 3D to the RE universe.  The story consists of several very strong scenes separated by passages of relative dullness.  The same is true of the 3D, which is used well at various points along the way, but there are also many times where it wouldn't have made any difference whether things were shown in 2 or 3D (as when the only 3D is the character standing out against the background).  But when this movie is good, it is very very good.  That includes highlights such as the 3D shots of Alice's small plane flying over coastal Cali and a destroyed LA; and especially the fight with the giant, hooded Executioner guy (probably the film's best scene).  By contrast, the climactic fight with the main Umbrella Corp bad guy near the end feels relatively ordinary.<br /><br />While I enjoyed RE Afterlife and am glad I saw it, there were a few minor problems (sorta) such as how so many fight scenes borrowed very heavily from The Matrix (something a lot of filmmakers do).  That gave some of the fighting a \\"been there, done that\\" feeling.  Also there were a bunch of things that either were not explained, didn't make sense, or defied any logic.  In the \\"no explanation\\" category is the Executioner -- what is he and where did he come from?  I think the answer is he exists for no reason except to be a cool, scary enemy, as was generally true of other \\"monsters\\" in both the games and movie series.  But with the \\"Suspension of Disbelief\\" required in all movies of this type, these kinds of issues were really not problems.  Those things were not the main reason I dropped a star in my rating.  No, it was the lulls in action and 3D during the movie.  But the good things definitely outweighed the bad overall.ms.  Those things were not the main reason I dropped a star in my rating.

0062004352|5.0|If you are a chick lit fan, you are going to love this book. This books screams chick lit and is the perfect example of the genre. This book is not deep heavy literary fiction that is going to change the world. If you are expecting a serious read that will force your brain into over thinking this is not the book for you. If you are, however, looking for a fun escape read with a little bit of fantasy living that everyone wishes that they could have and takes place in the most exciting city in the world, then this it the book for you.<br /><br />If only everyone could be so lucky and have find a Jenny when they are down on their luck. Angela doesn't know how good she had it at finding her new friend. Seriously, Jenny is like a fairy godmother who takes Angela under her wing. Right from the get go, Angela is treated like royalty and gets to do things almost every girl dreams of but either can't afford or is not given the opportunity to experience. Hair treatments, shopping trips, clubbing adventures - the perfect life for a 20-something in NYC. Plus two hot guys are there to take away any thoughts of her cheating ex.<br /><br />Angela's adventures take her all over the city. I had a fun time traveling along with her as she discovered the wonder that is NYC. The two guys she dates give her a different perspective of life in the city. One is a well to do businessman while the other is a hipster musician. One is upscale Manhattan, the other is artsy Brooklyn. BTW, I've visited Brooklyn and I love it. Why all the hate from Manhattanites? Please explain!<br /><br />There are times where things are a bit unbelievable. Of course the whole Cinderella transformation is unlikely to happen to everyone who comes to NYC. Angela's only been in the States for a few weeks and gets a job like *that*. She stars a blog for work that almost immediately is a hit right from the start. Personally, I'm a bit wary of that because unless you are a celebrity who has been talking about starting up a blog weeks before to gather hype, almost every blogger starts off with either a very small or non existent readership. Also Angela seemed a bit naive to think that the two guys she was dating wouldn't find out about each other. She talks about them all the time on her blog and the nicknames she doesn't give are very discreet. Plus she talks ABOUT her blog to BOTH guys so of course they are going to check it out, see their portrayal on there AND see that she's dating another guy at the same time. A bit more discreetness could have helped her out.<br /><br />However, even with those qualms, I really loved this book. It was just what I needed in between all the serious books I have been reading lately. Except for the bit of my boyfriend cheating on me, I would have loved to trade places with her. New York City is one of my favorite places to visit and it's always wonderful to read about it from fresh eyes. Kelk makes the reader feel as if they are actually there and live vicariously through Angela. I'm excited that her books are now coming Stateside. She's written several other books that have been published in Britain that continue the adventures of Angela and I really hope that they make it over here soon. If you are ready for some fun chick lit, this is the perfect book for you. HIGHLY recommended.gather hype, almost every blogger starts off with either a very small or non existent readership.

As someone who watched Mortgages first get packaged and sold Lewis has a special insight and a special way of storytelling that makes the inane world of Investment Banking come to life.    If you suspected that the corporations behind investment bankers lacked a integrity...after reading The Big Short you will be certain of it.

For goodness sake, Ms. Roberts, your storytelling ability is really captivating (I loved every single word about the dogs and dog-training; I loved the characters... they were believable to me even if not to some of the reviewers) and it boggles my mind that you think it necessary to rob such a good story and mesmerizing characters of all their potential for class and dignity and honor.  Our culture has sunk too far down into the swamp. We're drowning in it.  The story itself was compelling and I liked Simon and Fiona and the dogs very much and could not put them down.  I won't read any more of her books though.  Such talent so smarmed so unnecessarily.

It is great to see that the movie pegged him almost to a T!  Boxing, drugs, black moods, experiments, make-up, seeing all the little details that we mere mortals look at but do not see; terrific!  If you have not read Shirlock Holmes, you might be wondering why this is not like the proper English man played by Basil Rothbone.  This is more upbeat, more lively, more the way I see it played out when reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  And, as a plus, you can actually see what is going on, unlike the old black and white shows with all the fog!

0470876417|5.0|\\"Then He said, 'To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it?'\\" -- Mark 4:30 (NKJV)<br /><br />You've probably heard the old saying that a picture is worth a 1,000 words. Well, this book has more illustrations, sketches, design flourishes, and graphic displays in it than pages so you can probably imagine how much content it covers. In addition to sharing ideas about business model generation, you'll learn about business strategy, change processes, story telling, design, and creativity . . . among other subjects covered in a few paragraphs or pages. If you haven't read many of the books about business innovation that have come out in the last ten years, you can just use this one to get a brief summary of the key ideas in each of those areas. So your cost per subject is almost nothing. What a bargain!<br /><br />If you get bored easily, you will like this book. It covers most subjects in almost no space. By using small type, a lot of information is concentrated onto just a few pages.<br /><br />A lot of my graduate business students tell me that they like books that teach them a lot of the technical terms that business people use. Business Model Generation is excellent for that purpose. It's jammed full of C-level business jargon and lots of flow diagrams of the sort that technology managers and engineers love to use.<br /><br />So, what is a business model? \\"A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value.\\" Got that? \\"This concept can be a shared language that allows you to easily describe and manipulate business models to create new strategic alternatives.\\"<br /><br />If that isn't clear to you, the authors offer nine building blocks that give you the whole picture:<br /><br />1. Customer Segments<br />2. Value Propositions<br />3. Channels<br />4. Customer Relationships<br />5. Revenue Streams<br />6. Key Resources<br />7. Key Activities<br />8. Key Partnerships<br />9. Cost Structure<br /><br />Each of these nine elements is conveniently broken down into still more subsegments of what to consider.<br /><br />Fans of Michael Porter's work on competitive strategy will note the strong resemblances between this approach and his pioneering work of 30 years ago. But Professor Porter doesn't include as many graphics and his examples are much longer and more detailed. If you want to learn more about advantaged value chains, Professor Porter's work may be more helpful to you.<br /><br />The book similarly borrows deeply from 20 other standard business and strategy references.<br /><br />Who is the ideal reader for this book? I think it's someone who hasn't been introduced to business models before and has just been asked to work on developing one at work. The book seems to be aimed at people without much business education such as technologists and designers.<br /><br />If you are such a person, be sure to take notes on where to find the examples you want to refer to. There's no index to the book and you'll be thumbing through all the pages to find what you are looking for.<br /><br />The approach emphasizes a small group of people doing the business model generation for a business or a company. That's pretty typical of a venture being formed (venture capitalists always want to know what the business model is), new ventures, and smaller enterprises that need to make a big change in direction.<br /><br />The recommended approach is 180 degrees away from what many business model innovating companies do which is to encourage stakeholders and employees to continually develop low-key, inexpensive experiments and then to expand the successes.<br /><br />I always find books such as this one more helpful when they teach me about businesses I've never studied before. So if you don't know about the Swiss private bank, Pictet, France Telecom, KPN, Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Siemens, book publishers, LEGO, Metro in Stockholm, Google, game console makers, Apple, Flickr, Red Hat, Skype, REGA, Gillette, P&G, Glaxo SmithKline, InnoCentive, Amazon, Microsoft, and Yahoo, you'll get some new knowledge. You may find that you'll have to do more homework on your own in many cases. Most of the references are 75 words or less.<br /><br />The book was co-produced by hundreds of contributors. It shows.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|24 season 8 is 24's most shocking and exhilarating season yet, but not necessarily the best. The season starts off with the relatively enjoyable story arc of Cole and Dana Walsh but its definitely not 24's strongest plot arc. What makes this season an exemplary conclusion to the series is the twists and turns that take place toward the end. With the evil Charles Logan manipulating his way back into power and the shocking death of Jacks' partner, we see the absolute worst (best?) of Jack Bauer come out. The extreme vengefulness of Jack as he takes out EVERYONE involved is what takes this show to the edge. Its violent, scary and its a hell of a fun ride. You'll never see anything this exciting, this chaotic, or this gripping on network television. When you see Jack use his mini military arsenal to annihilate everything in his path it sends chills down your spine. The writers take huge risks and it pays off tremendously. The violence and chaos reaches its climax and the rest pay for their sins through the hand of Jack Bauer. As Freddie Prince jr. said, \\"there is no good guys here.\\" He's right.  In my mind, just great television.

0439023513|2.0|First, the best thing about the two previous books is Katniss.  She is not there the entire third book. She is literally on drugs the whole book, and a total puppet.  Gone are her independant streaks, her planning, her brain.  The book could not only be 100 pages shorter, it could be less graphic, and there is no reason to kill off characters Collins does.  It's just gratuitous violence.  This book is barely related to the other two.  Plus, the ending is far too pat, too easy, too succinct and neat.  There is a huge war, people are killed, and Katniss lives happily ever after...What???  No way!

B0015DROBO|4.0|At last a mystery (or thriller if you prefer) that doesn't feature a worn out tough cop from central casting or a cocky PI (from the same). The strange team of a temporarily defrocked magazine publisher and a socially undeveloped hacker with photographic memory is an interesting and refreshing approach to solving an equally strange crime.<br /><br />What makes this book even more interesting is that it's from a Swedish author whose characters don't use the predictable approach to solving a mystery. The fresh writing style avoids the usual cliches of the genre.<br /><br />Being set in Sweden, the reader is not bored with the clap trap description and dialog of New York, LA, Detroit, Miami and all the other usual mystery/thriller sites. The only problem with the locale is trying to pronounce the Swedish names. However this is easily remidied by simply not trying to pronounce them!<br /><br />For something different, captivating and fresh it's worth your (reading) time.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|If you're a Spacey fan, you'll love this.  It is all about Old Hollywood, both the glamourous and the grimy.  Awesome crime story which rivals the Departed way before that movie was ever conceived.  Great cast of actors which hold their own, and tell the story together.  Due to the strong ensemble of characters no one is responsible for carrying the film, however they all do in their own way.  This has become one of my favorites, give it a try, and it may become a staple of your collection as well.  It can be watched again and again in order to experience all of the subtle nuances of the film.

0765326353|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has never let me down and this is certainly his best book yet. It didn't take me long to get sucked into the characters lives and the world. For me personally Kaladin's viewpoint was the most interesting. In the beginning I wanted to read about him the most but eventually as the other viewpoints got going I enjoyed them all. I spent the most time reading this book than I have on most in quite awhile. I recommend this book to all fantasy fans and of course those who are already Brandon Sanderson fans.    Sanderson has started something truly epic and beautiful and I'm sure will be continued to be read and loved through out the years. There is only one evil thing: time. We fans must wait for the next book! This is certainly not going to be an easy thing for me.
0439023513|1.0|This book doesn't deserve to stand beside its two predecessors. The ending is rubbish. The characters are OOC compared to how SC drafted them in Hunger Games and Catching Fire. It's a bloodbath with no hope. Even if you were rooting for the winning \\"team\\", there isn't any triumph in it because the two lovers are so broken and wasted they can't even enjoy themselves. The novel is sick. I'm pretending it didn't happen.
B00337KM2S|4.0|Some great lines. A situation that makes the audience ask how does Clooney feel playing this role? Is he that guy? Nicely done.
030726999X|5.0|Another great book in this series. I found it a little slow in the beginning just because there were a lot of facts and background being introduced. Stick with it though it all ties together down the road about half way through found I couldn't put it down and was along for the ride. Love, Love, Love Lisbeth Salander. I am just sad this is possibly the \\"last\\" book in the series. This book did not disappoint and was very happy I stuck with it!!
089898890X|5.0|the first time I tried the \\"warm up\\" exerises in this book I couldn't believe how stupid I sounded-I literally threw my sticks on the floor and closed this thing for at least a year telling myself \\"I will never be able to play like that\\".....but I never forgot about the thing either..a month ago I said I have to try again-well  long story short I preservere and found that with effort (harder than ever worked before) I could at last do the warm up.(took three weeks) you all know what I found? the warm ups are very hard but the comp material(next section) is much easier and s**T loads of fun!!! and super cool to play--dudes it will make you sound years more cultured than you are! (I usually play metal). I went to a music store with a bunch of loud ass kids bangin around and started playn this stuff and when I finished...everyone was quiet and dads were smilin and kids were lookin-that has never happened to me hahahaha very funny-but please read--- to unlock the rest of the book YOU HAVE TO GET PAST THE VERY HARD WARM UP EXERCISES!!! thanks mr riley for your great contribution to my playing!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|As someone who did not particularly undersand all the fuss about The Da Vinci Code; i absolutely LOVED this book! fast paced, really interesting, keeps you turning the page...I never lost interest in this book. Give it a shot!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book, as I have all the previous Dan Brown books. I had high expectations for \\"The Lost Symbol\\" as a follow-up to \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" especially after waiting so long for it to be written and published. Finally, I got the time to read the book!     All I can say is it was a most disappointing read! The characters are shallow and the plot, or lack thereof, is thin and all but entirely missing! Without flashbacks, this story could have been told in less than 100 pages, which would have made it much less painful to force on myself than the over 500 pages made it. It was more like a penance than a pleasure to read! It might have covered only 50 pages, minus the inane thoughts and snide remarks delivered by EVERY character, ad nauseam, highlighted in italics, on every page. Very few, if any unvoiced comments and thoughts in italics contributed to the suspense of the plot. There was little enough suspense even with the italic thoughts plastered throughout the book! I anticipated a well thought out, intelligent plot with appropriate levels of suspense in a Dan Brown book. At the very least I expected answers to the few 'burning' questions presented. (We all know how sneaky those mysterious Masons can be!) What I got was a poorly written screen play, almost ready for Ron Howard to begin filming...after spicing it up with a little action, not included in the book!
B003W5C0VM|5.0|Words don't do this concert film justice. Buy it. Play it loud. Invite all your friends. Get hammered. In the meantime we can all hope for a Brussels Affair Europe 73 Concert Film to follow. The mecca for all things Stones concert excellence. Mick Taylor finally gets his long overdue limelight. Bigger Bang? Shine A Light? Lets Spend the Night Together? All skeet targets.
030745455X|5.0|Stieg Larsson has written another very good thriller. The more I get to know Lizbeth Salander the more I grow to love her. She has been victimized her whole life by just about everyone, but she is in no way is willing to lay down and play the victim. She's a fighter and it is neat to see her relationships with the very few people in the world she has learned or is learning to trust. I could not put this one down and could not wait to get started on the 3rd in the series.
B00028U6B8|4.0|I'm a bit prejudice because I have loved The Jefferson Airplane since I was a kid.  Their first five albums being the best, this is the fifth in sequence.  It has everything that a JA fan wants.  Turn My Life Down, a beautiful ballad sung by Marty Balin, who by far has the best voice in the group!!  He's also the cutest of all the guys, if this matters.  Grace delivers as usual with Hey Frederick and Eskimo Blue Day.  Don't expect to understand these two songs, this is Grace Slick we're talking about!!  Jarma Kaukenan delivers his usual siblime guitar renderings, as well as Jack Cassidy's amazing bass!!  It's classic Airplane, all the way through!  A must for the Hippie crowd (or at least former Hippie crowd).
0374158460|4.0|Jonathan Franzen's new novel, Freedom, is a great big sweeping novel that attempts to capture the early part of the 21st century in America. While the key dynamic in his previous novel, The Corrections, involved inter-generational conflict, this novel focuses on marriage and love relationships. While I found the characters in the previous novel to be unappealing in a distracting way, in this novel, the characters are sympathetic and nuanced enough to become appealing, no matter how they behave. The theme of freedom takes on multiple forms throughout the novel, and readers are led to reflect on the ways in which we become handcuffed by some aspects of freedom, and that free markets aren't necessarily good. The bird on the cover makes its first appearance on page 210, which I found amusing, given that I was waiting to see where it would fit into the novel. Franzen's writing is sometimes so finely done that it becomes overdone. Overall, I found this novel to be enjoyable and the writing was outstanding.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B000JQU4TW|2.0|I read this book as a child (around 11) in Russian. Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents.
0439023513|3.0|Even if the final chapter was not what I expected. I would definitely read more books from Mrs. Collins.
0307454541|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me. I was hesitant at first because it was a Swedish writer. I am so glad I read it anyway. I found at the beginning it was a little hard to read for several reasons, the writing style was a little different, not familiar with the places being described, a lot of little facts and background information included. It got a lot easier to read once I got into it. This one I was up very late into the night reading. I loved it and thought what a great cast of characters, Blomkvist, Salander (my favorite), the vanger family.....was a great book and quickly became an easy read !!
1402760663|5.0|Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee is a forty year old book by Dee Brown.  In it, he tells the history, the very tragic history, of the plight of the American Indian people.  This new addition, with its beautiful photos, and added stories and commentary, was fantastic.  I would say anyone who collects material on AMerican Inian history has to have this addition to his/her collection!!  I loved it!!
1592332803|3.0|I'm not a vegan. I am in fact a huge meat eater, probably a bit too much for my own good. In fact, I have no particular problem with vegetarianism, but veganism to me is one of those diets alongside the Atkins and Feingold diet that I hold in utter contempt for the pseudoscience and guilt tripping they're based on. But I have no problem with vegan cooking per se, and I bought this book mainly out of kitchen science interest (i.e. mainly how to make baked goods without eggs). Well, this book delivers on that at least.     Don't expect health food; this stuff is no different from its dairy/egg equivalents in most regards, which means the desserts will be just as decadent and bad for you as something you'd find in the [[ASIN:0881505811 The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion]]. The main difference, of course, is the substitution of things like \\"vegan butter\\" (i.e. margarine), soy or almond milk, and various egg replacements for their animal-based equivalents. They do use white flour and sugar (though presumably the kind that isn't filtered through bone char). It actually all looks quite good.    However, what I don't understand is why the book seems to be constantly trying to guilt-trip the reader. No love for honey (um... do we let the honey bees all go feral and take our chances?), constant and somewhat hollow hammering on alleged downsides of animal products from a kitchen chemistry standpoint... look. Someone buying this book likely already knows what they're getting into. Preaching to the converted is condescending and annoying, and preaching at people who just want a few vegan recipes for friends with food allergies or the like is flat-out a waste of time. I like this book for the recipes and what it can teach someone about the chemistry of cooking, but really -- does the author really need to hammer on the point every four or five pages when an appendix will do?
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever seen. The life story of Temple Grandin is incredible, inspiring, moving and true. And Clare Danes deserves a special Oscar for her performance. She plays the autistic Grandin full out, no holds barred, never stooping to sentimentalize her portrayl for easy audience sympathy, always showing us total honesty and insight into Temple's character. And this is no easy task, because Temple behaves and reacts quite uniquely. But Danes makes us see the world Temple's way. She creates one of the most fascinating and complex characters I've ever seen portrayed on screen. And best of all you never see the actress working at it, so you are completely drawn into this young woman's amazing struggle and her brilliant mind. It reminds me of one of the all time great movies, \\"The Miracle Worker\\", except Clare Danes is Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft rolled into one. Give yourself a wonderful evening, see this movie.
0374158460|4.0|I had just finished his memoir (excellent read!) on CD so I knew about the author's birding fixation and thought I had an idea of his perspective on environmental issues.  And his general obsessiveness.    I didn't quite buy the two teenagers he portrayed, having raised kids of my own.  There are name conventions for generations that don't quite match.  Joey never evolves into Joe as he gets older.  Girls at war with Mom during their childhood harbor it through adulthood, and they just move away.  Like the Mom.    I thought the main character Walter a perhaps sufficiently neurotic to be a 21st century Rabbit but I don't expect or hope for him in sequels.       I had a difficult time confining time to decade in many places in the context of the writing (just too indefinite), although there are references to obviously \\"staked\\" throughout the book.     The plot had some serious plausibility issues and while I admire the author's reputation,  I expected better.  MUCH better.    All that being said, I read the book in 3 sittings.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I'm not sure why there are some people who don't seem to have enjoyed this film<br />I absolutely loved it.<br />I first had the chance to see it in my english class back in 2004 during my junior year of high school.<br />I fell head over heels for the party scenes and the delightful music.<br />In my opinion, Gatsby's parties are the heart of this book.<br />For it is due to these parties that he is constantly throwing that turn him into a renowned figure among the populous of long island sound.<br />It was at these parties that people began to speculate about his mysterious nature.<br />It was at one of his parties where Gatsby meets Jordan and finds a way in to Daisy's life.<br /><br />I loved the portrayal of Daisy and Jordan specifically.<br />I just love almost everything about this movie.<br /><br />I felt this film was pretty true to the book as well in terms of character.<br /><br />I wish i was a lot more articulate so that i can better defend this movie but i will just have to end this review with my stamp of approval.<br /><br />Great flick.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the BEST exercise video I've EVER done. I lost 18 pounds and toned up my legs losing 2.5 inches off each from doing the routine I've written below over 6 weeks! (but don't forget to add in a healthy eating plan too!)There are 3 levels. If you are looking to lose serious weight or just to switch up your current exercise routine, check out what I've found from experience WORKS to your advantage! Start with level 1 for 1 week, 5 times/week. Even if you're experienced with working out you should start here. If you don't usually do interval training this will get your body use to it for level 2. Then move on to level 2 for 1 week, 5x a week. Do level 3 for 1 week, 5x a week. Then switch back to level 2 for 1 week, 5x a week.   NOW HERE'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE EXTREME RESULTS::::: After the 4 weeks, do levels 1 & 2 back to back for about an hour long workout 3x/week and level 3 + 1/2hr cardio of choice right after 3x/week (do levels 1&2, the next day do level 3+cardio, next day levels 1&2 etc). I know, if you've ever done this dvd before your mouth is dropped, but trust me, you'll see major results in just 1 week from this!!! Do this (I call it double up workout) routine for 2 weeks. Jillian is tough, but she pushes you and doesn't waste your time, her dvd will transform your body. For women out there, you'll see even more incredible results doing a low carb diet with it and will help keep the weight off later. Just cut out things like bread for a sandwich and white potatoes at dinner, you'd be surprised how much this helps drop the pounds!
0553805371|1.0|I'm clearly not Christian, nor do I come from the Abrahamic faiths and have no vested interest in this mythical \\"God\\" sitting there and one day deciding to create the universe.     That being said, this book is garbage because there really isn't the experimental evidence to test Hawking's hypotheses. Hawking is trying to make money by selling a book that espouses Nietschtze's old aphorism of \\"God is dead\\", well to an extent anyway. Of course, its possible that the universe could have began without God, but ultimately, hypothesizing about it idly is indulging in the same fictions that religious people do when they read 2000 yr old books for clues on stem cell research morality.     This is just a book making claims that it cannot support, drumming up controversy in the process and ultimately cash.     A far from worthy addition to Hawking's other works, not to mention Feynmann, Sagan, Gribbin et al.
1401310400|3.0|Previously I gave a one-star review - that was before I was into 6 chapters into the book.  It does get better the further you get into it but it still lacks the feelings of interaction that are experienced in the show (which I love).  The story is a little more complex than initially expected which makes it more enjoyable.  I still encourage people to stay with the TV show as you get the real feelings of Castle, Beckett and their cronies.  If you want something just to pass time, it'll do but I wouldn't waste my time on making it a priority addition to my library.
B000000H4A|5.0|King Diamond's 1986 debut album Fatal Portrait just plains rocks. It's dark metal at its finest. King Diamond sounds like a cross between Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Metallica. They are definitely influenced by these bands, as all bands are influenced by something out there. King Diamond (formerly of Mercyful Fate) has a wickedly high voice that fits the music perfectly and he has cited Robert Plant, Ian Gillan, Rob Halford, Ronnie James Dio, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, and David Byron as his main influences.<br /><br />My favorite songs on this album are \\"Halloween\\" and \\"The Candle\\".<br /><br />If you want some really dark heavy metal for your listening enjoyment, listen to all this band has to offer. Their concept albums are awesome for the Halloween season and any time you want to immerse yourself into the dark world of heavy metal.
0439023513|2.0|I read the first two books, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and was amazed. I really loved them. I didn't expect Catching Fire to be as good as The Hunger Games, but it SURPASSED it. I found Mockingjay on Amazon and decided to pre-order it. This was FEBRUARY 15TH. I expected that Mockingjay would be as good Catching Fire, if not The Hunger Games at least. I finally received my copy of Mockingjay August 26, and was thrilled. I read the first chapter, then put it down. I didn't pick it up for about a week.  God, I wish I hadn't picked it back up. I wish I could've just left it alone and conjured up my own ending in my head and have that be the end of it. Mockingjay was WAY below my expectations. Half of the characters I didn't even KNOW until they were dead. It was hard to follow because of the random characters being thrown into the mix, only to be killed off five, six, maybe seven pages later if they're lucky. And that strong girl, named Katniss, that appeared in the first two books? Gone. 80% of the book is her hiding somewhere and crying. That's what disappointed me the most, she was so easily broken.  Also, the ending. What the hell was with the ending? It was way too abrupt. Here's the ending:  Kids in one group.  Explosions go off.  Kids Die.  Second Explosion Kills Prim.  Katniss wakes in Snow's mansion and chats with him.  Katniss votes yes for Capitol Children Hunger Games.  Katniss shoots Coin.  Katniss goes to 12.  Katniss chooses Peeta.  Katniss has Kids.    That's it. That's around the last 30 pages too?  Collins has left me dissapointed. I suggest making up your own ending.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|We all need to appreciate Leonard and Van Morrision while we still have these two music legends with us. Both are beyond superb and non generational as you can tell from the age ranges of those in attendance at the concerts. Do yourself a favor and go to one if you can.
1441850953|5.0|I quite enjoyed Riordan's new adventures featuring the Cain siblings, Carter and Sadie (I believe 14 and 12 years of age... though I thought Sadie seemed older), who are introduced to the possibilities that Egyptian mythology may be a bit more real than they realized.    Sadie and Carter's mother died when they were young, and since then they have had to live apart - Sadie with her mother's parents in London, and Carter with his father, traveling the world looking for Egyptian artifacts.  Since they only see each other once a year or so, it nicely adds to the story to have their relationship develop and evolve.    When visiting the museum something goes terrible wrong, and Carter and Sadie discover that there may be more to their father, and the Cain family, than they realized.    I listened to the audio book, which I thought was wonderful!  It is narrated by Kevin R. Free and Katherine Kellgren.  Because the story is told both by Carter and Sadie, each narrator reads the appropriate section.  The book is very suited to an audio recording, as it is supposed to be Carter and Sadie making a recording of the events that have transpired.     I enjoy the Percy Jackson books, and I think that this book has a similar style, a similar since of fun and lightness, but happily it didn't feel the same, like I was reading the same story just with differently named characters.  To me, Red Pyramid felt a little more mature and complex (not in a bad way, just in that the protagonists are older, there's more history, details, etc.).  I enjoyed this, and - like the Percy Jackson books with Greek mythology - The Red Pyramid made me intrigued with Egyptian mythology and history (the author's note, by the way, is fantastic!).    Also, it was very nice and refreshing to have the Cain siblings be mixed race, with a black father and white mother.  Not only does this bring about some interesting sibling points (since Carter is darker and Sadie lighter they are often not perceived to be brother and sister) but I also thought Riordan handled it all really well, not making a big deal about, letting the story still be the story, but with a few mentions here and there where this is mentioned.      I'm hoping that there will be more to this series, and I'm anxiously awaiting reading the rest - I mean, what's not to love with dueling avatar half-man-half-bird forms, wands and staffs, and a protective cat?
B002ZG9846|5.0|Ah, [[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]].<br /><br />The young cast, led by Aaron Johnson, really shines. Characters are about as well developed as a vehicle like this will permit. Nicolas Cage is fine in his supporting role - he contributes just the right amount of father-figure.<br /><br />Hyper-violent in a cartoon-ish way (but I've never seen a movie I consider too violent - it always freaks moms out when I say that).<br /><br />Ya gotta get past the shock of the language from 11-year-old Chloe Moretz (\\"Hit Girl\\"). It's very very funny, but I wouldn't have let my daughter say them things.<br /><br />Not for kids, not a cinematic triumph, but it gets my highest recommendation. Kick-Ass is probably one of those movies you'll hate yourself for enjoying.
0156034565|4.0|This cleverly-written book tells you everything you need to know about raising salmon and fishing for them--very interesting, whether you fish or not. The real story is a biting critique of political opportunism and refusal to accept responsibility for choosing the wrong course. In addition Paul Torday is a fine creator of sympathetic characters.

0689835604|5.0|My son loves to flip open the flap to find out \\"where are baby's hands\\", etc. After a few days of reading this book, he could tell me where his feet were, too! Nice, interactive, educational book.
0439023491|4.0|Excellent sequel - couldn't put it down.  Strong character development continued as Collins aged the key players with a little time and a lot of maturity.
0439023513|3.0|This book left me feeling like I'd been punched in the stomach.  It was nothing like the first two.  Much darker.  Much heavier.  And while there were flashes of brilliance (the scene at the end when Katniss yells at the cat had me bawling) most of it was depressingly mediocre!  The plot plodded.  The actions of the last quarter of the book turned out to be pointless.  The Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle is finally resolved, but not because Katniss finally makes a choice and fights for that choice.  Rather she just accepts what gets dumped in her lap!  Ugh.  I can't hate this book because I love the first two so well but, really Suzanne Collins?  You're a better writer than this.
B000VWYUR6|3.0|I love the fact that every track is on these CDs, but the sound quality isn't the greatest.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved the film.  The story was clever, light and tricky.  Having said that I am confused on the ending.  Are we to believe that Pride and Prejudice is permanently altered in that Amanda stays with Mr. Darcy?  What happens to Elizabeth?  A little confusing, however, I still gave 5 stars as I really enjoyed it.  The acting was excellent.
B000YAA68C|4.0|This is a truly enjoyable movie if you are a sucker for a good romance story like I am. The story is really about true love and how it can continue on after death. It is also a story of a husband who over time gives his surviving wife the ability to move on with her life as she is currently familiar with. There are moments when I wanted to cry, laugh, and just think about the story of this movie and imagine that something like this really could happen. The movie at times leave you anxious  during the middle part of the movie but aren't unexpected movie endings something all viewers crave? You will get that and more in P.S. I love you. After I watched I thought this is a 3 star movie but thinking about it a day later I realized there are not many films out there that can grab every sense of emotion you have and pull you along for the ride. So it is a post movie 5 star rating. Enjoy P.S. I love you is a very good movie. Though the movie starts out in a long argument followed by complete confusion if you haven't read a review it tackles and tugs on every emotion a movie goer should have for this type of film. From a males perspective, it was a little tough to get into at first but the movie grows on you as it continues.
0439023513|2.0|First off, let me say, I LOVED the first two books of this amazing series. I felt it wasn't afraid to give the mature violence and emotions needed that some yound adults shy away from. Well this book sure had the violence but I was left just skimping the last half of the  book because every chapter became more and more of a let down! I had been waiting so long for this amazing end to a trilogy, only to feel, well, cheated. I understand the emotional toll and stress, and devestation war can bring. However the character Katniss, who I had no greatly come to admire for her strength and \\"guts\\" as a female main character, ended up running around the entire book lost and confused. She rarley if ever stood up and made definitive decisions.And as a female I was excited to see she picked peeta at the end , but \\"oh wait!\\" lets just snub him the whole book and not try to get close to hime at  all and then at the end basically say, \\"This is best I could hope for.\\" Geez. I'm not into the gushy,mushy romance but she could have at least acted like it she truley loved him instead of it was her only option! I am beyond frustrated and I serioulsy feel cheated as a loyal fan. I will contiue to re-read the first two book and disreguard this last one. Little emotion, little explanation to major plot changes, and too little of our old beloved Katniss.
0374158460|1.0|History abounds with examples of great authors confronting the social issues of their time and creating transcendent, poignant stories illuminating problems in the context of awareness, solution or other salvation. Dickens, Steinbeck, Harper Lee come to mind.  History also abounds with effective satirists, whom also offer social commentary through acid wit (Swift, Waugh, Amis).      Apparently, in present day America, Time Magazine, the New York Times and many others will annoint an author as the new champion of literature, whom creates a half-dozen characters to spew his political views ad nauseum over the course of nearly 600 pages.  Franzen has created a vaccuum in his novel, wherein only the most annoying and closed-minded party leftists are given voice, and where all characters in disagreement are clueless suburbannites, gun-toters, or other caricatures of Bush-era Americans.     Admittedly, the novel begins with a Tom Wolfe-esque sharp-tongued observation of a gentrified neighborhood in Minnesota, and a nuclear family in particular.  Thereafter, Franzen abandons the hard work of keen observation, and instead indulges himself in a flagrant and unentertaining rant, dragging all of his characters into the vortex of voicing HIS opinions, dragging them to New York City and Washington, D.C. to add weight to HIS opinions (egregiously, he also gets a college student unbelievably involved in an international scheme to supply defective parts for the Iraq War), and then abandoning them in a last-minute forgive-fest.  This book is neither insightful nor witty; it is a mean-spirited and cynical portrait of Franzen's view of those who don't agree with him.  Booo!
0439023491|5.0|There was a twist to this book that I didn't expect & didn't know how Katniss would get out of it. I read the whole book in one sitting--couldn't put it down!
030726999X|3.0|I was late to the party with the first book in the Millennium series, and even then, it wasn't an instant love affair. I really enjoyed the first two books, but I found there were parts that seemed more uneven than others, and even moments in the characters and plot which gave me serious pause.<br /><br />The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest made roughly the same impression on me. I found it fantastically entertaining, but not wholly satisfying. Lisbeth Salander in particular began to grate on my sensibilities in the third book. I'm trying now to think of why she felt off here. My only answer is she's just a little Too. Too everything. Too attractive. Too abused. Too hated. Too much of a beacon for Larsson's tribe of Men Who Hate Women. Her Too-ness didn't really bother me in the first book, started to be a problem in the second, but bloomed into its final nature as an obstacle now. She changed into a kind of comic book character, and that's too bad. A lot of what I liked about her initially was how Larsson made me believe that this extremely improbably woman could exist.<br /><br />Still, a very entertaining book. Smarter than most of the other books you can find in similar categories. I'm loathe to pan it. It's hard to claim I didn't like something, at least, that I read so compulsively. But the pleasure was weakened by my issues with Lisbeth and the plot around her.<br /><br />In the end, I guess the most damning thing I can say about the series (and this book) was that I didn't quite love it. And I could have, very easily. Shame that Larsson didn't live long enough to create a follow up to this flawed but impressive series.
0618001905|5.0|There's a very clear defining moment at which Europeans began pilfering the world...and this is one of the defining moments.  This book shines light on the horrors of what Leopold did but as the author states, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  The Dutch, Germans, French, and British (to name the main gang of vile imperialists) were no better...they just managed to slip under the radar somehow.    The amazing part is how self-righteous the British were in this whole ordeal...being the premier imperialists of rather recent history, it's incredibly repulsive on their part to act as though what Leopold was doing was somehow more evil than what the Brits were doing to the rest of the world which they ordained to be theirs.    What really adds to the final puzzle is now we can understand how the new world imperialists like America have come about.  As far as I'm concerned, the US is simply an extension of European imperialism...particularly from the British angle.  Nothing gets by 10 Downing Street when the Americans want to pull a dirty deed somewhere around the world...regardless of how \\"unilateral\\" it may seem.      Leopold was the beginning of the type of self-righteous imperialistic mentality we see today.  The excellent example the author gives with Mobutu and Zaire and how the US played him and the people of that country shows how related the two times in history really are.    While we are enjoying our cell phones and computers and whatever else we take for granted, next time we should consider where the materials to build these items come from..how many \\"negros\\" in 2010 are in some mineshaft digging up precious metals so Steve Jobs can get is Ipad out in time and a bunch if self-indulgent yuppies somewhere in LA or NY can sip their lattes and cruise the web.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Excellent movie - by the same director as \\"Inception\\".  You have to be very careful as the movie unfolds backwards and ends with the beginning scenes. It keeps you on your toes as you piece the story together.  A brain teaser!
B00408AN5A|5.0|At age 40, I have read many books to improve all aspects of my life. This book is one of the best I have read in terms of personnal growth. No magic formula, just simple words to make us understand what simple things done consistently will make a huge difference on the long run. We basically have 3 choices: decrease our well-being, stay still or improve exponentially. He explains very well how to take control of your life, and eventually meet Big-MO, I will let you discover who is Big-Mo. After only a few pages, it got me moving.
1843793792|4.0|I have always liked Georgette Heyer but I must confess the reason that I made this purchase is because it is read by Richard Armitage, who has a fantastic voice!  I was very pleased with the story and also by Mr. Armitage's talent in changing his voice for each character.  This was a very good purchase-you will really enjoy listening to it.
B00005JNX0|2.0|This movie, while entertaining, has a racist theme. The phrase \\"cracker lackin\\" is uttered again and again. Can you imagine the contoversy, if this were an equivilent racial slur against black, or any non-white race of people? I suppose that \\"cracker lackin\\" means \\"a place without white people,\\" because of the context that it is used in. Because of its repeated use, I have deducted three stars.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since I was about 7 years old (1977).  The documentary does a great job of showing the different phases of the band, from the early rockers to the heavy synth phase of the 80's, to the present day.  I have a new appreciation for the music and the band.  the interview with Gene Simmons from Kiss is priceless!  I would recommend this for those who are Rush fans, obviously, but also for non-Rush fans who may enjoy the fact that one of the most successful and long-lived bands in rock can be so humble and grounded.
B001ET5X8K|4.0|Yes, this is one of the best albums of rock history. The only complain is just an average sound quality. It's not bad, but not as good as expected. Hope that in some day I will hear an all analog remastering with good vinyl pressing.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I just got this yesterday and I love it! It is just so cool, plus the black light reveals a few things.   The included journal entry also answered a question that i have been pondering for quite a while.    if you are a fan of LOST, you MUST own this!

B00000DLVA|5.0|The cd I ordered The Cardigans Gran Turismo. Was processed and shipped in a timely manor. The tracking # are great to see the process of the order shipped all the way through to pick up. The packageing and cd was in good shape when recieved through mail. The cd tracks were very good. I enjoyed the cd through all tracks even though I purchased it for the song My Favorite Game. The purchase was well worth the money.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Wow, the first few minutes of this film really had me fooled.  I mean, I'd been told the animation was great, but the paraplegic guy was so realistic that I actually believed he was a person! And Sigourney Weaver looked almost ALIVE! (Madame Tussaud, eat your heart out!) Then I figured out that the characters that SEEMED real were way too stiff to be real people.  (You could tell by the way their lips hardly moved that their lines had been dubbed over the original Japanese.) So, I just sat back and enjoyed the special effects--ferns, trees, seeds.  But then--huge disappointment--these big blue guys showed up and spoiled everything. I mean, it was so OBVIOUS that they were just a bunch of Indian extras from Pocahontas. Then, the Virginia Company gave 'em hell with a bunch of Centurions and heavy raiders and turned the entire forest into South LA. There were lots of explosions and a big fight between the Good Guy and the Bad Guy. In the end, the Ents beat the Cylons, the Marine got the Navy girl and everybody sang \\"The Circle of Life.\\"
B001EIOOVS|1.0|I wanted to like this film.  The idea of Crowe & Washington working together again (remember VIRTUOSITY?) with Ridley Scott directing the real life story of Frank Lucas seemed too good to pass up.  I just wish I avoided this film as it was a complete waste of my time.     LOCATION: The only reason I start with this is because its the first thing I noticed in the film.  If you're a NYer (and I have been all my life) you'll recognize locations in films that you've either driven past, walked to or view from a distance. Opening shot involving the dirty police is right by the famous Domino Sugar Plant in Bklyn right by the Williamsburg Bridge, meanwhile the description on the bottom of the screen states New Jersey.  Already, the film has me worried.      Movie takes place in 1970s Harlem.  Sh!#hole doesn't begin to describe the place in those days (just look at blaxploitation films SUPERFLY & SHAFT to see what it looked like so long ago).  Harlem looks pretty here and that also took me out of the picture.    Look, I know they film movies within \\"NY\\" in Toronto (FRINGE TV Show) or Australia (The Matrix Trilogy) but I thought that the film was going for authenticity and it obviously didn't show.  This began the descent of my giddiness for a film I had high hopes for.    STORY: The story involves the rise and fall of Harlem Kingpin Frank Lucas.  You get introduced to his life, the struggles that come with being a gangster / drug lord, police interaction, etc.  I couldn't get into Frank Lucas.  I didn't feel like he was a threat or smart.  If anything, he seemed lucky.  I just couldn't connect to this character.  Crowe's cop subplot was useless.  The subplot was designed to give Crowe's character humanity but it felt more like filler than anything else.  The only interesting aspect of the story was the smuggling of the drugs. Other than that, I struggled like crazy to stay with this film.  That alone should have told me to bail the theater.    As I continued to watch this film, I couldn't help but feel that I've seen other films with similar plots had turned out a better product: Godfather I & II, GOODFELLAS, SCARFACE, CASINO, DONNIE BRASCO, BLOW, CITY OF GOD and BOYS IN THE HOOD.  These films were able to transport viewers to a world that no longer exists (or, perhaps, still does).  They allow you to be a fly on the wall & see everything for what it is.  This particular film did none of that for me.    ACTING:  Denzel was as stiff as his crippled character in THE BONE COLLECTOR and most of his co stars are just as bad.  Crowe's bklyn accent kept slipping due to his aussie accent. I thought this was an A list film so why am I seeing C list acting?  The only one that nails it is Josh Brolin who plays scumbag cop like nobody's business (reminded me of my dad - LOL!).  He takes this secondary role and eleveates it to a level that so called stars couldn't reach.  I can't wait to see him in meatier roles / starring roles like this one in the near future.    DIRECTING: There's a reason why Ridley Scott's current films haven't been doing so well.  Other than ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, LEGEND or GLADIATOR, he hasn't been doing great.  Much like this film, the hype is bigger than the substance.     OVERALL: You want to see a good gangster film?  See the films I listed in the STORY section.  If you want to see more on the drug trade in the 70s / 80s, I high recommend the documentaries COCAINE COWBOYS (based on the Miami drug trade that inspired movies like SCARFACE) and MR. UNTOUCHABLE (the story of Harlem Kingpin Nicky Barnes.  He tells his own story to the viewer along with his lieutenants and the cops that busted him).
0439023483|4.0|'The Hunger Games' was, overall, a great book. For a post-apocalyptic story, Suzanne Collins captured the surreality of it quite well. But, no one can replicate the story and drama of George Orwell's '1984'. Either way, 'The Hunger Games' was a good read and I would recommend it.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|First off, if you have not seen Donnie Darko you should definitely check this movie out. One of my personal favorites, and it's sincerely a cult classic. Basically this Blu-ray is a 2 disc (One Blu-ray, one DVD) Directors Cut Edition if you didn't know. This is chock full of special features, and a very insightful commentary with the Director Richard Kelly and the lead Jake Gyllenhaal.    -*Positives*-  -Great Plot  -Phenomenal cast  -Tons of special features    *- Negatives-*  - Quality is similar to the DVD release  - Second disk is a standard DVD  - Second disk is just special features    If you love a good science fiction movie, be sure to BUY this Blu-ray.    P.S I recommend checking out the #1 fan Darkomentary.
0062004352|4.0|I HEART NEW YORK, by Lindsey Kelk, was a fun and fresh romantic read. Kelk created a lovely broken-hearted heroine that readers are sure to root for during her trek to New York City to reinvent herself after a terrible breakup.    Right from the start I loved this book. I am a big fan of reading books where the characters are from the UK. Angela was the cutest NYC-challenged girl! Her bubbly, no-nonsence personality brought friends to her circle in droves. With the help of Jenny, Angela was able to build herself back up and start anew in this busling city.     All of the characters were very \\"real\\". I could see these people existing in the melting pot that is NYC, and that made this book very dear to me. Kelk created such emotional situtations for Angela, that I felt her struggles right along with her. This to me is a sign of great writing. I connected with the setting as well. I love hopping on the train and getting lost in NYC in my own life so it was refreshing to see the sights and sounds from a new perspective.     Although it was an awkward situation for Angela to balance two men in her life, I was happy with the results. I saw both of them as an experience for her that not only furthered her career but made her finally figure out where she belongs. They were both swoon-worthy and that's all I will say!    I liked the added elements of shopping and eating in this book. Other books I have read in this genre do not focus on this part of a breakup and I thought it was definitely noteworthy. I did wonder at times where Angela's shopping money was coming from but it did not hinder my experience. And I love a girl who can eat! Personally, when I am in a situation of great stress I bring on the ice cream and cookies as well. Overall, this was a great book about starting over and finding yourself even when it seems hopeless. I can't wait to read the continuation of this series.
B002ZG9846|4.0|For the value,  Kick-ass definitely kicks ass.    Great movie, great picture and sound quality, however I experienced a lagging menu, and a good 10-15 second load screen, this could have been my personal Blu-ray player, or my remote    Great P-I-P commentary to check out as well, if you saw Kick Ass in theaters this Blu-ray brings that experience home with a good amount of extras with it.

B001HN694K|3.0|The reason I like this film is that I love Lewis Carroll & just about every version of \\"Alice\\" ever made (with the exception of the Disney and one or two others) are crushing bores - annoying pieces of crap that are basically unwatchable.     This version works as a film: it looks amazing, it has a storyline, and it was helmed by a gifted director. It is entertaining & contains several really good performances - notably Johnny Depp & Anne Hathaway.    Is it perfect? No. Is it lacking in areas? Yes. Is it probably the best film based on the \\"Alice\\" books yet made? - I'd say \\"Yes\\".
B000A2RRF4|3.0|I am going to sound really shallow, but I found it difficult to enjoy this DVD to its full potential because of the yellow bikini shirt.  As the other reviewers stated, there is too much fan reaction as well.  This is one of those DVDs that disappoint because you know that MJ can do better.  I know there are better stuff out there.  I have the Live in Japan too, but it also has shortcomings.  I don't know if MJ did this on purpose so that his fans would still want to see him live.  If so, it is definitely working on me!  Unfortunately, MJ can no longer perform live, and I sure hope there are better stuff out there to show how wonderful a performer he is.

B000Q6GUW0|1.0|Hitchcock once mused how interesting cinema was, and how as humans we will vicariously live through what we watch. He said once, even if a villain was on screen in an office stealing something valuable, if say, a night watchman comes around, the audience will instinctively desire the safety of the crook. We NEED to relate to what we see -- we're simply wired that way.<br /><br />Dexter is the same way. It's illogical that we can desire the safety of Dexter as he gruesomely kills his countless victims, (the same actions, by the way, he claims to punish his victims for.) but we do. Of course we do. And if we're honest, we probably get a secret thrill by allowing him to act out our own worst, darkest, most vindictive thoughts upon the perpetrators of our deepest modern societal fears.<br /><br />Is Dexter a hero -- no. And if the series would actually force us to watch, in full, the brutal acts on which he subjects his victims, we would be much less sympathetic, and quickly see him for what he is -- psychotic. As is, the directors wisely cut away right after the burst of horrific adrenaline hits us, and we can ride the rush of endorphins into the next scene.<br /><br />If you like this rush, obviously you're not alone, and this show is for you. I guess we might gain something, on some little level, from humanizing serial killers. They're human, not aliens, after all. But I guess, to me that's small benefit to rationalizing Dexter's actions, and wishing him success in his heinous acts. Sorry fans, I just couldn't make that jump, or enjoy the ride.

The concept is so easy to understand and so well executed. Young girl must kill other children in a fight to the death that's broadcast on national television. Oh yeah--and she doesn't want to kill anyone. The tension in that book is extreme, and it's a blast to read.<br /><br />The other two books in the series are still good books, but they're just not at that same level. They start delving into other areas, areas where it's just not as believable to me that a young girl could make as big of a difference as Kat makes in these books. Plus, she starts turning into a pawn used by other people. Yes, she still sticks up for herself and makes her own decisions, but part of the greatness of the first book was that it was wholly believable to me that she'd be able to do what she did in that book. The \\"rules\\" were very clearly defined, and she played according to those rules, and won.<br /><br />The rules in the second two books got much blurrier. \\"Winning\\" became much more relative. Does that make the books worse? Not on its own, but because those same rules were what made the first book so great, the loss of them removes that potential for greatness, in my opinion.<br /><br />So the final two books are still very good, but they're just as good as other dystopian sci-fi YA novels. Not nearly as memorable as The Hunger Games. Would I recommend them? Certainly. I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout them.<br /><br />Just keep those expectations in check.till very good, but they're just as good as other dystopian sci-fi YA novels.

0374158460|5.0|If good literature teaches us compassion and understanding and perhaps expands a world a little, this book qualifies as great literature.  The opening section tells us the bare bones of the plot - what we might know if we were the neighbours of Walter and Patty.  Inevitably we construct a back story to this skeleton, the remainder of the book shows us how little we actually know and pieces together something that might approximate to the truth in all its complexity and ambiguity.      I saw a review which commented that Patty's autobiographical sections don't create a separate authorial presence and are unconvincing for this reason.  On reflection, I would have to agree that there is really no change in the style of writing, but I didn't find this diminished the book at all - because it is written in the third person I think I probably just read it as a continuation of the other narrative.  Some of the discussion of environmental issues also seems a little awkwardly incorporated but these are minor flaws and the book stands as a powerful exploration of the human condition in an age when individual and collective freedoms are more conflicted than ever before.
0316098337|4.0|(possible spoiler alert on one point, below)...............................<br /><br />Room is a big novel about important issues, which is significant when you consider that much of it deals with captivity in a very small place.  It begins in Jack's \\"Room\\", the small, soundproof building in the backyard of a kidnapper.  Placed there with the express intent to hide someone, Jack's mother is the first unwilling resident when she is kidnapped and placed inside.  In the small space is a bathroom, some basic cooking equipment, and a television.  Over a period of years, she gives birth to Jack, and he too is kept locked inside.  However, the captivity is even more significant:  he's never seen the light of day.  The only outside world he's seen has come from television cartoons and from the stories his mother tells him.<br /><br />The blurb on the book describes Jack being thrust out into the outside world, and I feel I need to say (here's my kind-of spoiler) that it means he and his mother escape.  The reason I mention this is because I am not sure I could have kept reading the book without that development.  While fascinating, it became plodding and a bit repetitive.  I was about to quit when they escaped and the story enlarged to encompass Jack's assimilation into \\"normal\\" life.<br /><br />Once out, Jack and his mother are thrown into a media storm of exposure, especially difficult for a child in his position.  One immediately thinks of a recent real-life kidnapping case with similar details, and it makes the story that much more painful.  His mother's parents are thrilled to have her back, yet learning to live in this altered reality is as difficult for his mother as for Jack.  Her parents have to learn who she is all over again, and at the same time, immediately care for and get to know this charming but difficult little boy.  The return to people and places is fraught with complications, and no one, not even the psychiatric specialists called in to help, knows the ideal path to 'normalcy' for Jack.<br /><br />Why is this book so amazing?  First, the depth of the mother's love:  she manages to create, in great detail, an outside world for Jack.  While only possessing a few old books, she spins stories, creates games, and tries to make the best of an impossible situation.  She teaches him history, science, and scores of topics.  She teaches him good and bad, and most of all, bravery.  She does this without a break, and so could be called completely self-less.  She doesn't dwell in pity, she puts her energy instead into making Jack a more empathetic and kind child than most in the outside world.<br /><br />As a character too, Jack is amazing.  His sheltered existence makes him unprepared for the complexities of the outside...even normal weather events perplex him.  Interacting with family and other people is equally difficult:  he can't understand sarcasm, innuendo, or dishonesty.<br /><br />Room is getting a ton of buzz, and was nominated for the Man Booker Prize.  It's a title that I wouldn't be surprised to see Oprah select for her book group, as it deals with a strong female character surviving tragedy.  In other words, I expect this book is going to be seen everywhere for quite some time.  In terms of content, it's worth noting that none of the unspeakable acts of cruelty by the kidnapper are actually discussed, only alluded to, which means this title would be safe for a young adult audience.  In fact, I especially appreciated that much of the horror that you know was there isn't actually detailed.ideal path to 'normalcy' for Jack.<br /><br />Why is this book so amazing?

1401223176|4.0|Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee were paired together to write the highly loved and yet at the same time hated mystery book Batman: Hush.<br /><br />The great:<br />The premise for the book is that a shadowed figure, much like the Batman, is making alliances in order to get his crazed sense of vengeance realized. Because of all these alliances Batman is forced to teamup with sometimes hero Catwoman, who was forced to work with this mysterious criminal. The two are pushed to their limits, with Batman nearly killing the Joker and using Superman's greatest weakness against the man of steel. Meanwhile the alliance that Batman and Catwoman made forms into a love story that is quite enjoyable. Batman's monologue is funner then I thought it would be, as if Kevin Conroy's voice invaded by Jeph Loeb's when he was writing Hush. Also, as always this decade, Jim Lee's art is freaking amazing.<br /><br />The good:<br />The flashback scenes that Batman had. These scenes were him and the main villain of the storyline, a childhood friend of Batman playing together and being kids. This may seem be weird to really enjoy, but Bruce Wayne (before his parents died) never really seemed to have, well, a life. This was able to show how Batman knows how to act with other people in his Bruce Wayne persona if he never had the chance to act with other people. Huntress played a minor/major part in this storyline and it helped show the idea that this was a Bat-Universe event and not just a Batman event. I also really liked what happened with Two-Face and Killer Croc, but don't want to spoil the story.<br /><br />The bad: Huntress's new costume. Huntress was given a new costume in this storyline and it showed much of her chest, for no real reason other then the titilation of the male reader. This may seem to be a weird thing to criticize, but I'm sick of good storylines involving a woman who's not a slut at all wearing very slutty clothes (search up Emma Frost if your confused about what I'm talking about). Also the mystery really isn't that hard to get, in fact it's hard NOT to get the mystery, but I was more interested in the interactions between the characters anyways.<br /><br />The ugly: At the very end of this storyline (I think to the third to last page) Batman is overreacting to the outcome of the mystery (of course), and Catwoman tries to calm him down and she accidently says \\"hush\\" instead of \\"calm down\\" and he brakes up with her over that. No I'm not kidding, she said the wrong word and he gets so pissed at her that he just wants to not see her anymore.<br /><br />So overall, even though I did have some complaints about the book they were minor and weren't too bad.that hard to get, in fact it's hard NOT to get the mystery, but I was more interested in the interactions between the characters anyways.

B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Even though the season started with a huge blow, (the death of one of the most loved characters, George)and the aftermath of it, this season was still the greatness we have come to love from Grey's. In the course of the sixth season, we lose two of our original interns and yes, it takes a while to grasp this. But we also get a new shipment of residents from another hospital. Five new doctors, five new stories, but they're thrown at us in a negative light, their back stories are withheld and we immediately don't like or want them. One in particular for me (Dr, Avery) earns his right to be there and even flirts with the possibility of becoming a power couple with Dr. Yang, who happens to be my favorite character. The rest of the season throws the characters some curve balls. Karev deals with the loss of Izzie, Cristina and Owen come to some hardships with the introduction of an old Army friend,  Meredith has to deal with her father again, Derek takes the Chief position away from, well, the Chief. If there were any doubt of whether or not we had an interesting season on our hands, the finale comes and blows everyone away. Literally. What a GREAT season finale. Personally, I never thought the 2nd finale (Denny dying, Izzie in her prom dress, Meredith choosing between Derek and the vet, all happening to the soundtrack of Chasing Cars) could be topped. But yes, yes it can and it was. The season closes after an incredibly scary standoff between a shooter and the hospital that left everyone on the edge of their seats. Out of the dust, Cristina and Jackson emerge victorious after having saved the day. Richard reclaims his hospital, some of the staff doesn't make it, and fans become a little more sympathetic toward the ones they didn't like before. Overall, an amazing finale to end a great season.
B002ZG997M|5.0|Watched it with a bunch of friends and we all enjoyed this movie.  Great action but also serious and emotional at times.  Gotta love Washington.<br /><br />Anyway seems alot of people are judging the movie on the religious overtones and not the movie itself.<br /><br />A+ in my opinion.

0439023513|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says the book was sooo totally amazing! It was a perfect ending to one of the greatest trilogies ever! As you read you feel as if you are experiencing everything right there along with Katniss, the heart break, the betrayal, the pain and angry especially at the end when she really finds out what happened to Prim, you just want to sit there and cry along with her. Yes its disappointing what happens with her and Gales relationship because the lost of such a great friendship is never an easy thing to see but in the end it makes scene why it had to happen, she couldn't have Gale and Peeta she had to end up being with the one she truly couldn't live without. And the last couple of paragraphs I mean come on NO ONE could have expected that to happen ever, but that's what made the end perfect how everything turned for the amazingly strong girl that was \\"The Girl On Fire\\". Move over Twilight The Hunger Game are coming up quick you better watch your back! P.S. can't even wait till the movies start coming out.

B0015DROBO|3.0|It took me awhile to get through this book. There is too much back story, too many Swedish names that I kept getting confused and too many characters. Also, the characters are simply not that likeable. I am not going to read the next books in the series because I don't care what happens to them! As I was reading I kept thinking \\"ok, one more chapter and it is all going to start pulling together.\\" It did get more interesting about half way through but I like a book that you can't put down and this one wasn't it for me.
B002MXA7TC|4.0|I bought this album because I loved Sweet Disposition, and I'm happy with the rest of the album. Not all the songs are terrific, but there are several others that are really enjoyable. This album grows on you after a few listens.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Really mindblowing. It isn't about political parties anymore, it's about us taking back our government from highway robbers like Lloyd Blankfein and Government Goldmans.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is the series to end all series... Maggie is amazing and this story will stick with you for the rest of your life... Sam and Grace's relationship is a dream state.. Sure they go through things but who doesn't right?
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is indeed a hugely inventive piece of work and even that sounds like a pathetic understatement. It's also the kind of superlative effort that is likely to make most authors (not readers, mind you) envious enough to suggest that he is a bit of a show-off. At the end of the day though, the work stands so masterfully on its own merit and so unlike anything one is likely to read, that it seems downright ridiculous when writers and critics just offer sort-of-a grudging respect for this book.<br /><br />The individual stories measure up to the harshest scrutiny and could have worked as wonderful novellas, but equally, there is undeniable skill in stringing all of them together and not making the reader feel even for a solitary moment that they don't belong there.<br /><br />On my part, I can humbly count it amongst the most awe-inspiring and compelling pieces of fiction I have read in over half of decade. What I think will give it true and deserving respect and cult-status will be the passage of time.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This series is to die for.. It is easily my favorite series that is out there right now.. Maggie is my favorite author and I am of course in love with Sam....lol
1601252463|5.0|Yes, buy this book if you are playing Pathfinder RPG. It is awesome, just add it to the basket and check out. You will not be disappointed!
B002ZG98UK|5.0|This by far is my favorite Resident Evil movie I've ever seen. I would see it over and over, but I'll just see it 2 or 3 times before it comes out on blu-ray since I don't want to spend $9 per ticket. I've played Resident Evil 5 alot, and online with friends and I've had it since it came out on PS3, then got the Gold Edition when mine got ruined by my little sister(talking about the disc). I would recomment any Resident Evil fan to see this movie, because its not only in 3D, but its got top characters from RE5. If you think this movie is good, say so and rate the movie like I have, cause all my friends are gonna go see it. Thats over 50 people right there. Anyways, I rate this movie 10/5, but since I can't rate that high, its a big 5/5.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I started watching this show after i found out it was done with and it was amazing! I ended up falling in love with the actors, their characters and the show it self.  For any scifi or fantasy fans i recommend you give it a chance and watch.  The plot just took me in automatically and i loved it! There is nothing else i can say but give it a try, watch it and maybe help the rest of us get a season 3 started!
B000025OG6|3.0|After the Seventh One Toto Fired Joseph Williams.  Which is a real Shame as he was one of the finest singers Toto had.  The record company then saddled them with Jean-Michel Byron.  Byron was so not in tune with Toto, With his flashy on stage antics.  He was quickly fired.  Steve Lukather, tired of searching for singers took lead singing duties on himself. They recorded Kingdom of desire.        This is without a doubt Toto's hardest album since Isolation.  Only this one is a million times better.  Right from the word go you now this a wild album.  Gypsy Train begins with Jeff Porcaro's thunderous beat.  Luke's raw vocals let you know he could have taken lead anytime.  Multiple guitars solos bring this monster to a close.  We continue on with Don't Chain my Heart, A wonderful blues shuffle.  Once Again Jeff's drums thunder in.  This album I think is Jeff's moment.  Never before has he pounded this hard.  Also Luke blisters with a guitar sound you can feel in your gut. And Mike Porcaro's Booming bass lays a great foundation.   Great tune.          Never Enough and How Many Times  Continue the pattern of hard pounding rock.  Next we have Two Hearts, Toto's first true power ballad.  It begins with pounding drums.  Multiple guitars rush in, and passionate singing and majestic harmonies follow.  A simply beautiful song.  This is why this album works better then Isolation.  The playing is better, the tunes are catchier.  Also we get more ballads with the hard stuff.  My fav track is The Other Side.  A David Paich written ballad.  A catchy Chorus and Luke's best solo on here.  A nice song to drift off too.        The album closes with the one two punch of the title track, A seven minute raw opus.  Which has mind blowing playing.  We finish with Jake to the Bone an Instrumental which is a great band showcase.  The album is not without it's problems.  It is the beginning of Toto's Long album period,  and as such has two filler tracks.  She Knows the Devil, and Kick Downthe Walls.  Two repetitive tracks.  The length is my only gripe.         Sadly this would be Jeff Porcaro's last Album.  He would die of a heart attack before the next tour.  He is still missed today.  A great drummer.  What a high note for him to go out on.  For it's minor flaws I'd still recommend this album.    Mick
B001LMU1JG|5.0|Close to 25 years after I first saw this flick, and I still get the songs from it stuck in my head!  That's what made me look up this movie just now - one of those songs just creeped into my head for some reason.  The whole film is hilarious - the physical humor as well as the more subtle things - do you really think the entire NATO fleet would be entering the Mediterranean at the same time??
0143038419|4.0|For the past few years, every time I have passed this book in a store, I have picked it up, wanting to read it. For whatever reason, I always put it down, never buying it. When the movie came out, I figured it was a sign that it was good so I bought it. I can NOT get into it. I guess the word is dry.
B003EYVY0E|5.0|I can't wait to see this in blu ray quality with the deleted scenes added in. This series is almost perfect. Love the 6th one the best so far because of Tom Felton.
0618918248|5.0|The cardinal rule of Darwinian science is `never let a Divine foot in the door'. Dawkins has violated this by insisting science should answer the question , is God real? To look for God, one must first  allow for the possibility of His existence. The current definition of science prohibits any conclusion that might include the possibility of a supernatural causative agent such as God. Scientists are actually instructed to interpret anything they see as evidence of design, intelligence or purpose as being an `illusion' of design, intelligence or purpose because if it is NOT an illusion, it might mean there really is a God!  NO evidence is allowed to be interpreted as supporting the possibility of a supernatural origin...PERIOD. So long as this is the case, science is truthfully unfit to look for God. That does not mean science can not find evidence of God, but only that, until scientists are allowed to consider all possible  implications of the evidence and actually follow it where it leads, science cannot even begin the search. As things stand today, if Dawkins found God scientifically, he would be prohibited from promoting his discovery as science. For such a search,  science would have to be re-defined , not as a search for natural causation, but a search for ANY causation, including the supernatural. Our science has become so bound up in its role as a gate keeper for evolution and a protector of Darwin's theory, that all evidence against it is routinely ignored, suppressed, or ridiculed in the hope no one will notice `the elephant in the room'. Clear science that merely has `metaphysical implications' is treated as heretical and its supporters are shunned as heretical scientists. `Real' scientists, as Dawkins states in the book, are virtually all atheists. Dawkins proposal to let science `decide the issue of God' is insincere . What he truly wants is to be able to promote atheism using science in the same way religions use catechisms. He wants scientists to  lieto students and tell them that their parents, who believe in God, are deluded because scientists `know' or `have proven' or have a `consensus'....all the usual buzz words for a politicized discipline... that God is not real! He goes even further, claiming a religious upbringing is child abuse, parents should not be allowed to `inflict' religion on their children, and infers clearly that he thinks the state should intervene to protect a child's right to decide for themselves what they believe [based,of course, on the truth according to atheists] , and after this indoctrination, which will take place in atheist  schools because religious schools will be banned, your child will be `allowed' to choose what they believe, which in his view will be atheism. Whatever else Dawkins believes, what he makes perfectly  clear and what we should all understand, is that Dawkins and those like him , want our children, and clearly want them to become atheists. Since indirect indoctrination via evolution theory has had no appreciable effect, Dawkins would like science to take a more direct approach, declare God `not real' and foist atheism on our children in the classroom. Thank God there are many scientists who disagree with Dawkins. Take notice. Every one who believes in God should read this book. Forewarned in forearmed!   I gave this book a high rating, because it exposes so clearly the true intentions of the Dawkins ilk.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I finished this film and felt in touch with most of it but still felt about twenty percent out of the loop.  I wanted to talk about it,  to unravel that final amount.  Instead. I found A. Tancredi's review here and he or she did the job for me.  Really, an incredible summation of what is going on in this film.<br /><br />I am an artist so related to the jarring movements, the fractured parts of a world in fluctuation of tense. and the pervading sense of moving underwater to try to penetrate the surface. We will only drift into consciousness for one final moment and then the film is over.  Think of the film as a life though lived in a fully Freudian sense, in layers of existence.  If anything persists after the film entirety or a life's entirety, it is not on a conscious level.  This we are SHOWN, not told.<br /><br />I've long been an Ewan McGregor fan but I must say that Ryan Gosling more than gives him a run for the money in this film as artist Henry Latham, his psychiatric patient, who says he will die on Saturday.<br /><br />This is short on plot only if you think that experiencing life and death on every Freudian layer isn't a plot.<br /><br />warning: do NOT do anything else while watching this film.  There are visual elements in every frame rendering this Freudian experience from beginning to end.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0013FSL0C|5.0|This series was truly riveting and often moving.  The acting is so well-done... I cannot wait for the series to resume, and for the second season to be available!
0380977788|3.0|After watching the film I got the novella ready for a good comparation. «Coraline» is one of the few cases where the film is much better than the book. I think that the main problem is that the original work is intended for young readers. Therefore, the development of the plot and the building of the characters is over simplistic. That is, if you are a grown up reader, probably this novel will not satisfy you. It is too short, and the characters are very sketchy. They lack depth and so does the story. However, if I were to recommend this book to a young reader, I certainly would. If you are looking to read something from this author, probably «The Graveyard Book», while still a novella, gets closer to what a mature reader expects. In any case, watch the film. You will not be disappointed.
B0038W0OHQ|5.0|Let me start off by saying I have always used headphones - not speakers. All that time though, I have always been using the 10 dollar ones you buy at Walmart. After having gone through around 100 of those due to shoddy craftsmanship and having a speaker break, or the mic cut out - I decided to aim high. I first bought a pair of Zowie Hammer - but I was really put off by the microphone and how bulky it was. On top of that, it was uncomfortable at the top of the head. It's not a *bad* headset, but I was looking for something a lot more sleek - so I finally went to Steelseries.     Putting the headset on for the first time felt like putting on a pair of my favorite broken-in shoes. First off, compared to the Zowie - they are *amazingly* light, you won't believe it. They also come with a \\"Pleathery\\" earcup already on the speakers, but they offer a foam replacement. Let's talk about the Pleather though - this pleather is very uncommonly soft - something you can't see from the pictures. Even after hours of gaming, I didn't even notice they were there. The light weight and very high comfort means they fit and feel as snug as a hat. One final touch - even insignificant to most - is how the microphone works. When not being used, it can retract back into the headset as if it doesn't exist. *However* when it is in use, it comes out *just* far enough to get good sound, but not far enough to block your mouth. So; in late night gaming sessions you can drink your Mountain Dew totally unimpeded by the microphone.     Now let's talk about craftsmanship. Right out of the box you can tell they had the late night gamer in mind. In the past, half my earphones broke because they would get caught on my chair and they'd rip off my head. Steelseries 7h is completely *modular*. From the wire that connects to the computer to the headset itself, it all comes apart. Too much tension on the wire and it simply disconnects from the headset. Now - if you're like me - you might be worried that it could be too loose and fall out. I've tested that - even on the floor, I can pick the headset up by the wire without any feeling that it might fall out. Now, if you're really a skeptic you might say \\" what about the wire itself? \\" --- and I'm going to sound like a late-night commercial, but there really is *MORE*. The wire itself is made out of very thick braided cord, and seems very durable.    Finally, the sound. To be honest, I'm no sound expert - but to say I don't notice a difference would be completely laughable. Even compared to the Zowie Hammer, you'll hear sounds you've never heard before in games. I was completely amazed by how much these earphones picked up, and you will be too.    Let me be real - if you're looking to buy a fantastic headset - BUY THESE.  After finding steelseries, I'll never ever ever ever go back to walmart.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|This movie is so good. If you enjoy thoughtful but funny and touching movies this is for you. Definitely in my top 15 favorite movies of all time.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|I didn't expect to be writing this, but Resident Evil: Afterlife might be my favorite of the series so far. Sure the plot is weak and the characters are thinly written, but each individual movie has never really been about that. It's just another continuation of one large story that will probably come to an end in the next installment.<br /><br />Aside from being easy on the eyes, Milla Jovovich (who somehow looks better than ever), still makes for a compelling action hero and Ali Larter sure looks good standing next to her. The other characters here, including Prison Break's Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield, aren't given that much to do, but they also don't get on your nerves. I did appreciate the fact that they cut out all of the needless trying too hard to be funny dialogue of the past. You know, the scenes involving Mike Epps. Wesker made for a decent villain and the big dude carrying the axe put the silly looking Nemesis creature from Apocalypse to shame. Paul W.S. Anderson returns after two sequels and the visual quality is a step up. While he's far from being a great director, his good attributes show up on screen.<br /><br />As for a few minor negatives. Like I said before, the story just links the 3rd movie to the future 5th, but there is still enough going on to hold your interest. Not only did the final fight scene borrow too heavily from The Matrix, but all those people emerging in those white outfits reminded me of The Island as well. Now as far as the slow motion goes, it looked good in 3-D, but was overused.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you're a fan of the movie series you've come to the right place and should know what to expect. You have two attractive women, good CGI, exciting fight scenes complete with rated R violence (yay!), with no shortness of B movie vibe.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D experience was worth the extra $4, even though most of the scenes, other than when stuff was flying trough the air, looked rather flat. Make sure you don't do what I did by leaving the theater too fast. I read that there is a scene about 30 seconds into the end credits that features Sienna Guillory in the Jill Valentine role once again.e theater too fast. I read that there is a scene about 30 seconds into the end credits that features Sienna Guillory in the Jill Valentine role once again.
0375854819|5.0|I purchase this book for a grandchild's birthday.  The deluxe edition made such a handsome gift!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I've been a major fan of the Dexter series since its inception, and have also thoroughly enjoyed two of the novels upon which the show is based.  Due to economics, I lost cable service after the first three episodes of Dexter's fourth season, and have been patiently awaiting the release of DVDs.  I received my order from Amazon on the same day the show hit the stores, and at a significant discount.  My wife and I have gotten so much enjoyment and entertainment from this program; the writing, acting, and cinematography are all top notch, and the character concept is absolutely amazing.  John Lithgow's addition to the season 4 cast was unexpected and marvelous, as his years experience are cetainly an asset to any film I've seen him in (and he always plays incredible \\"creeps\\").  I don't keep up with awards shows, but Jennifer Carpenter should most definitely be recognized for her work with the character, portraying every emotion imaginable to the utmost...she is just fantastic!  This program is certainly worth a watch if you like intesity, imagination, a bit of gore (necessary to the story), and seeing the \\"bad guys\\" get their just desserts, which so often does not happen in real life.  This is some truly heady escapism.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is an EPIC movie that will take a few sittings to watch, but is worth the effort! Well worth the coin.
B00005MK6X|5.0|When you write a review of a recording put on an SACD, you really have two reviews to write. One for the recording and one for the SACD abilities. I'm an old rock & roll hippie so this one is a little harder than usual.     I'm not an Earth, Wind & Fire fan so it's not fair for me to rate their music. However I do like some of their songs. Their popularity doesn't really need my rating anyway. The world knows they were a real force in the music industry. They've had 7 albums, (including this one), and 7 singles to hit the top 10 in the U.S. or U.K. . Their songs have been used in movies, commercials and such for years. That's partly what's so great about them. They are appealing to the masses but still hold a sense of personalness (?) that allows them to enjoy a vast fan base.    Now for the SACD part. I have heard some of these songs but only on a vinyl album or radio. I can imagine though that it must sound good on a regular CD, (if engineered/mastered properly). For those of you who are not as familiar with SACD's, try to think of it as high definition/resolution music. Just like HDTV. It's just a bunch of technical stuff that means it was recorded with special equipment, that requires a special machine to play it on, to give the high definition/resolution. But if you are really into listening to music and your ears can really hear the difference, (which most people do but some do not), high definition/resolution music is missing in your life.     One thing about this SACD is that it was made to be multi-channel. Some SACD's are stereo only. All multi-channel SACD's play in stereo too and some can play on a regular CD/DVD player,(but this one only plays on an SACD player). That's what partly makes this one so special along with the fact that Maurice White was involed on the 5.1 remix. \\"Gratitude\\" is made up of live and studio recordings. There is a live version of \\"Shinning Star\\" and the studio version of \\"Sing a Song\\". Check online for a complete list. This is often referred to as a \\"reference\\" disc. I agree. That simply means that if anyone wanted to hear an example of what a great SACD would sound like, this one would be used as a reference. I do not need to make any adjustments to compensate for brightness, dullness or any other abnormal sounds. Only personal preferrences which are few to none on this disc. The mix of songs is enough for any diehard fan or the passer by. I heard a couple of songs I forgot I heard before.      There's no doubt that this excellent recording on a multi-channel SACD belongs in any audiophile's collection.
B00330UFQS|3.0|I bought the entire CD based on the Need You Now and American Honey. It's alright, but Lady Antebellum is just another cultivated country music band that will only last a few years and disappear. It's alright, no classic.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|When we last left the \\"Resident Evil\\" universe, the intrepid, superhuman Alice (Milla Jovovich) threatened to band together an army of her own clones and come after the board of the insidious Umbrella Corporation. And so she does at the beginning of \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife,\\" raiding the vast superstructure that is Umbrella's headquarters buried deep beneath the streets of Tokyo. That such a structure could ever exist under Tokyo - or any city, for that matter - seriously stretches the limits of suspension of disbelief, but never mind. During this raid, we see lots of things flying around the screen in slow motion, including guns, bodies, debris, and fireballs; this, we eventually discover, is a visual technique used all throughout the film. Believe me when I say that this gets old very, very quickly.    This fourth installment of the hugely popular \\"Resident Evil\\" franchise, based on the video game of the same name, marks Paul W.S. Anderson's debut into the unstoppable world of 3D cinema, a distinction made possible through his friendship with James Cameron and the Fusion Camera System he developed for \\"Avatar.\\" We're talking about some amazing 3D, here. Was there no way to put it to better use? \\"Afterlife\\" plays less like a thrilling adventure and more like instant replay on steroids, each action scene (and there are a lot of them) slowed to an agonizing pace. Every kick, stab, blow to the head, and airborne weapon seems caught in an inescapable time warp, as if Anderson was literally trying to analyze the smallest details of every shot. On the basis of this film, he would be a good candidate for the host of an after-game sports highlight show.    The plot: Eighteen months after the events of \\"Resident Evil: Extinction,\\" Alice flies up to Alaska, where a transmission promising a safe haven for the uninfected had been emanating. Already there, she assumes, are a small band of survivors that flew away via helicopter. Upon arriving, she finds absolutely nothing ...except for a now feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), who has a strange metal spider-like mechanism affixed to her chest. Claire, you may or may not recall, led the survivors at the end of the previous film. Alice removes the mechanism, only to learn that Claire doesn't remember her, nor does she remember anything else, including her own name. The specifics of this are left a little obscure, although Alice freely speculates that the mechanism had been pumping Claire's body full of an amnesia-inducing drug. I guess she was right; little by little, Claire's memory returns.    The two fly down the western seaboard to the smoldering remains of Los Angeles. They land on the roof of a former maximum security prison, which is now completely surrounded by mutated zombies. Inside, they find a new group of survivors, one of which is an imprisoned military officer named Chris (Wentworth Miller). No adequate reason is given for why he was locked up, save for a few vague references to him having killed people. If you're intimately familiar with the video game series, then you already know something else about Chris. If, like me, you have never played the games and don't plan on playing them anytime soon, then you may actually be surprised by who he turns out to be. In any case, I have a problem with film adaptations that make no effort to explain characters or situations known only to diehard fans. If you can't go into these movies cold and still get something out of them, then you're being unfairly treated.    What, for example, am I to make of the inexplicable appearance of a gigantic hooded brute wielding a makeshift axe twice as big as a normal person? I've since learned from internet research that this character is known as The Executioner, but sitting in the theater, I had no idea who or what he was, nor could I account for how he came to be in Los Angeles. Watching this scene, watching this whole movie, is a little like entering a conversation when it's halfway finished -you're being fed details, but you're missing vital bits of information, including context, intent, and meaning.    All leads up to an inevitable confrontation, which in this case involves Albert Wesker, the chairman of Umbrella. He's played by Shawn Roberts, whose low, monotone voice, stony expression, and dark-suit-and-sunglasses getup suggests he was channeling Hugo Weaving from \\"The Matrix.\\" There's even a point at which he dodges bullets in invisible bursts of speed; when caught in grip of the film's slow motion, we can clearly see the bullets as they whiz past his face, leaving behind a trail of rippled air. Couple that with scenes in an underground cave that play like a cheap imitation of \\"The Descent\\" and elements from every zombie movie from \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" to \\"28 Days Later\\" - this movie doesn't merely exist in a closed fanboy universe, it's also a rip off. \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" will almost certainly not be the last film of the series, but with any luck, it will be the last to be so blissfully unmindful of movie audiences.
0316067938|5.0|The book was awesome!!!  I was thrilled to receive it in only three days!!!!!  Best buy yet.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Laid back, psychedelic, drugged out (ok, that maybe pushing it), blues infused straight up rock... whatever you wanna call it, The Black Keys have mastered the art of... whatever it is they do! They're doing it right... great band... got into them after hearing they're single of 'Black Snake Moan'... then picked up 'Attack & Release' which was pretty good. Brothers however is a cut above. Less experimental than the former, the formula they've conjured up here works well. Every song has got a catchy hook to it and the whole album is very very listen-able.
0767020308|5.0|Kate Beckinsale lends her talents to a definitive portrayal of this beloved Austen character. The casting for the rest of the story is equally satisfying. Thumbs up to this version.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Again, like I stated in my review for Phobia, there were zero problems receiving the item.    Most of the Breaking Benjamin songs on my iPod are actually from this album, as I have many favorites, like \\"Fade Away\\", \\"I Will Not Bow\\", \\"Crawl\\", and a few others.    This is definitely an album you should get.
B003INBOEM|5.0|IVE HAD THIS MOVIE FOR AWHILE, IT IS BY FAR INCREDIBLE-- TO THE PEOPLE THAT GAVE THIS BELOW A 4* DONT NEED TO WATCH A FIGHT MOVIE AGAIN IN THEIR LIVES CUZ IF YOU DIDNT GET THE STORY AND JUST GET WOWED I DONT SEE HOW. GREAT MOVIE PURCHASE THIS!!!!
0811876373|5.0|I had my first cake pop about a year ago at work. I wanted more but when I found out how much the person was charging for them, I decided no. Forward to January 2010 - my niece was getting married and I was helping host her bridal shower. She wanted Red Velvet mini cupcakes...and do you think I could find a baker that did mini cupcakes? Nope! Then I remembered the cake pops...and the price, so I googled \\"cake pops\\" and somehow came upon Bakerella's blog and was in cake pop heaven!! Needless to say, the pops that I made for the shower were a hit, and I had all kinds of requests for more pops and people wanted to pay me to make them! If I do charge anyone, I pretty much just charge to cover my expenses (not much!), but mostly I just make them and share them. Bakerella's book is so inspriational - I love her creative ideas.   Don't skip over the tips she lists throughout the book either - they will give you all the hints to make cake pops successfully. I have made the baby chicks and the Easter bunny cake pops. I have also made dice shaped ones for my Bunco girls (that one was my idea).   Even though I already make cake pops, the book is great for her ideas. They are just too cute. The photography is a delight as well. I can't wait to make more of her ideas and use them as a bouncing off point for my own. I know that I am going to gift this book a few times! Buy this book, make cake pops, and check out Bakerella's blog (there is so much more than just cake pops there!)

B002F6FQGK|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard - start to finish. It truly cannot be missed. I think Florence and the Machine is going to become huge here in the US - in fact in the few months since I bought the album, I've heard her songs featured on everything from movie promos (Eat, Pray, Love) to TV show commercials (not sure which one??), to So You Think You Can Dance. All of which is truly deserved! Every song is amazing! I am flying to NYC to see her in concert because she isn't performing anywhere close to where I live (at least not any time soon).

And my husband enjoys watching the show as much as I do. So don't understand all those people criticizing us loving Glee being gay or whatever. Can't wait to get my blu-ray version scheduled to release next week!     With all the vampire stories and movies going on (don't get me wrong as I enjoy True Blood just as much!) I think Glee is very refreshing and relaxing, perfect for a Tuesday night after a long day work. I get to watch a great show with an actual plot and story line, let alone all those wonderful songs performed by the Glee cast who's got great talents! Everyone in the show is funny with its own distinct character. It has stories, music, acting, and humor. What's not to like the show? I actually listens to all the songs in my car too. This is how much I love the show!    People can say whatever they want but if you love the show don't be shy to voice out!
B00004YYDI|5.0|My review is for the theatrical cut. Haven't seen the extended version. The casting is excellent. The acting, writing and directing are superb. Can't say enough about Natalie Portman's performance. It is just beyond words. Her performance is intelligent and mature. Her and Jean Reno make a believable pair and that is what makes this movie click. Gary Oldman's performance is way over the top, but so what? It's sinfully entertaining and the hell with subtle. The movie is far fetched but it believes in itself and it's conviction to its story and characters make this worth a look. It's not going to be everone's cup of tea because of the issues it deals with, but you can't please everybody. The action is great and we care for the main characters. If you are politically correct, avoid this.
030745455X|4.0|I think the second one is with better writing (or translating) compared to the first one, but the story itself is not as good in terms of suspense to the first book. The second book is all about Lisbeth Salander, which the author is apparently putting her as the center of the trilogy and unmasking her past to the readers. In a way I love the arrangement as in book one she just looks too mysterious and omnipotent to me. In this book I get to understand her better, all her flaws, weaknesses, and of course her amazing abilities which all linked to her past. However, I do think the story line is weaker in this one, with less suspense probably comes from the fewer characters. The first 100 pages are pretty much wasting of time if you ask me, and it didn't pick up the speed until Dag and Mia were murdered. And I think the book needs some serious editing too. I understand the author is trying to explain about Salander, why she's acting in certain ways and where she comes from, I get it. But he doesn't need to repeat himself for the 15th times. The reader is not that dumb! The constant repetition and going into unnecessary details (such as what Salander bought from 7-Eleven) is simply annoying, like we really care about each item she bought from the store. It's to the point of absurd if you ask me. The book can easily takes out some 200 pages if the editor does his/her job better.<br /><br />Even with all the flaws I still think this book is with some good efforts to continue from the first installment. I'll finish the last one and hopefully it can be fulfilling.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Listening to this brings back the movie.  It's also fun to listen to while reading Twilight.   The first cut was a bit rough -even on my Bose - but the Soundtrack is outstanding overall!

B003UYUR10|3.0|I have been a long time fan of the Prince of Persia series and am of Persian origin myself.  Before its release I crossed my fingers and hoped that it would deliver an exciting taste of the East to the West as well as honor the Prince of Persia game franchise.  After seeing the film, I walked away with a very doused sense of excitement.  Sure it had enough swashbuckling action to rival Pirates of the Carribean but its scale still seems to fall short of the original Sands of Time tale.<br /><br />The casting should have more or less worked in this film.  Kingsley had done a character of Persian decent in The House of Sand and Fog with minute detail and care.  While there were those out there who claimed that Gyllenhaal is not tan enough to pull off a Persian prince, I do not believe that criticism was valid.  The Persian people were originally an Aryan race and often light skinned.  To this day you will find Iranian citizens with fair skin tones and even blue eyes.  Even the other featured players like Molina were bringing enough to the table to make this work.  Sadly with all the careful consideration made for each character though, they all gave some of the most lackluster performances of their careers.  Everybody just feels like they are joking around and mostly embracing campiness.<br /><br />In regards to the other elements of the film like costuming, locales, and cinematography; I still have the same unimpressed feeling.  Much of the movie cries more of Arabian Nights rather than Prince of Persia.  While the narrator heralds that the Persian empire stretched vast lands including the far reaches of China, all we are given is the same desert scenery.  Even the game broke up the desert feel with lush palace interiors or amazing exotic exteriors.  The camera does do some nice sweeping shots of the desert ironically but was far too rushed and haggard on the action scenes.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this film is pretty much the equivalent of an action B-movie rather than an award worthy epic.  Sitting through it was not a boring affair and the special effects will still grab your attention enough to say \\"WOW\\".  However, in regards to its adaption of the actual game, it feels much too watered down.  I'm not sure how a sequel will fair at this point as this movie was quite a slow start.  I still remain optimistic though that perhaps Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2 might improve on the mistakes of its predecessor and come closer to paying homage to the amazing game its based on.thy epic.

B003L0VJF6|5.0|I absolutely agree with everything said by the first reviewer.  Except, and I think they would also agree with me, one of the fascinating things about her less than perfect Grieg Concerto is to hear how Julia solves the problems that she has with this piece.  If you ever wondered how an absolutely top-rated musician might give a virtuoso musical performance on another instrument in which they are not quite as much a virtuoso, this is where you find out.      The great Russian Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich was also a very fine pianist, but like Julia, it really was his second instrument.  He also gave concerts, though primarily in chamber works, such as accompanist to singers.    Here, Julia is attempting to take that second instrument and make music through a masterpiece of virtuosity, and one that she had longed to play for much of her life.  The result is stupendously musical playing, drawn out with as much attention to every detail as we are accustomed to hearing in her violin playing.  Her's is very much a controlled performance that stays within herself, yet captures surprising insights simply because she cannot always play quite as fast and fluently in some parts she might otherwise like.    In some performances where the performer is not at the very top of their game with a work, you can hear them struggle in passages beyond their abilities.  Julia never struggles like this.  Instead, she solves all the problems to which lesser performers succumb by finding a convincing approach that loses no time, misses almost no notes, and makes a complete statement in every bar and across the bars.  She plays with extraordinary clarity, superb voicing, and connects every idea so that there is no doubt of her intent.  Words are, indeed, difficult to convey the wonderful point that she makes with this successful effort, because other perhaps more full-time pianists do play this work in a more familiar and exciting way.  Yet, her's turns out to be a remarkably exciting performance in its own way.    All-in-all, one is left with the sense that she understands and has communicated something special about the piece that one might not have heard before.  In her terms perhaps, she tells a compelling story throughout, and it is both a fascinating and moving story to behold.    In short, the entire DVD is an extraordinarily unique document that, if you are at all musical, and may be even if not, should reward and compel your attention in a way you might not have experienced before.  I cannot, therefore, recommend this DVD highly enough, especially to students, or anyone who has wanted to peek into the mind of a remarkable musical talent.

B000002LAB|5.0|I love Miles Davis. On this CD, he mixes various jazz styles and funk together to create this awesome CD. My favorite song on this CD is called \\"Tomaas\\". As a musician, I have always appreciated Miles Davis style of music. Some listeners my find his style of music \\"too deep\\", but this man is certainly a musical genius in my opinion. If I were you, I would definitely buy this CD. Don't base your opinion on the 20 second sound samples that you hear on amazon.com. Dare to be song satisfied!

0393072231|5.0|I both cried and laughed my way through this book. It's all about a bunch of really shrewd people that used their brains to bet against the fraud of the century. Granted they where part of the melt down but I would, had I had the knowledge, done exactly the same thing. It's a detailed description on how to turn $110,000 into 105 million by betting against the big banks and the CDO/CDS bull crap they got us into.<br /><br />You'll totally enjoy how a fellow by the name of Steve Eisman took Wall Street to the cleaners.

B000002N25|5.0|This is a great debut solo album by Dire Straits' frontman, Mark Knopfler titled \\"Golden Heart\\" released in 1996. The album is full of hits/classics/gems \\"Darling Pretty\\", \\"Don't You Get It\\", \\"A Night In Summer Long Time Ago\\", \\"Cannibals\\", \\"I'm The Fool\\" [ sounds similar/some resemblence to another great song \\"Ticket To Heaven\\" from 'Dire Straits' last album in 1992 titled \\"On Every Street\\"], \\"Je Suis De'sole'\\",  \\"Done With Bonaparte\\", \\"Are We In Trouble Now\\" & of course the most beautiful title track \\"Golden Heart\\" : excellent guitar work, sound & lyrics that is reminiscent to his other great songs in his band 'Dire Straits' heydays like \\"Romeo And Juliet\\"! If you like 'Dire Straits' music & Mark Knopfler's magnificent guitar playing, you'll be blown away by this great CD \\"Golden Heart\\", highly recommended listening.
B003A03RRU|4.0|As a younger man I've never had the opportunity to actually read the Sherlock Holmes stories before. After picking this up I must say I am THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED. I can not put this \\"book\\" down. The only reason that I give this four stars is the fact that on my android kindle ( I can not say if this is a similar issue on other devices) some of the illustrations and diagrams which can be so crucial to the stories, are missing, poor quality, or replaced by some cover of a different novel. Other than that though THIS IS AN UNBEATABLE PRICE for such a collection. These stories are brilliantly written (although some of the \\"olde english\\" vernacular can be a little difficult to get through) and I can see why this is a classic which stands the test of time. Whether you are a fan (which I now have become) or never read a Sherlock Holmes narrative I strongly recommend that you purchase this.

0439023513|1.0|I hate buying a book that turns out to be a disappointment so I will usually wait until I can check it out from the library. I bought The Hunger Game series because I was convinced that it would be one to enjoy again and again, and even lend it out to others with a strong recommendation    Suzanne Collins is a fabulous writer.  She just forgot what made Hunger Games so fantastic (Hope and Courage) and went for an ending that depressing and numbing.  The ending so discouraged me that I will be wary before starting a series that has not been completed and left an overall bad taste for the whole Hunger Games series.  I truly hope that the movie turns out better than the book.      \\"The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.

B0000A1HQP|3.0|Francis Veber's Le Diner de Cons/The Dinner Game has been on the slate for a US remake for so long that Bollywood beat them to it with Bheja Fry/Home Delivery. It's not Veber's funniest film by a long way and at times it plays like a filmed theatrical farce (which, in fairness, it is), but in a good way as Thierry Lhermitte's arrogant publisher tries to find the perfect idiot for his friends' weekly dinner for schmucks, where each brings an idiot they hope will be even more idiotic than those the other guests bring. Faced with heavy competition from a friend's boomerang collector, unfortunately the idiot he finds - Jacques Villeret's Francois Pignon - is TOO perfect, and promptly sets about inadvertently destroying his life with the minimum of effort. Lhermitte is the perfect straight man for Villeret's puppydogish performance - at one point he even hides in the corner like a puppy that's just peed on the rug - though the biggest laugh goes to Daniel Prevost's tax inspector who is drawn into the maelstrom with an ill-advised favor that has disastrous consequences. Veber is smart enough to mock the obvious moral of the tale, and at a brisk 80 minutes it never stretches the thin material to breaking point. Perhaps not a classic, but a very pleasant and frequently delightful diversion.<br /><br />The Region 1 DVDs from Universal and LionsGate both offer the French soundtrack with English subtitles; the PAL French DVD has both subtitled French and dubbed English.
B002RI9A4U|5.0|Not too many books have me up till 4am. This one did.  I read it in one sitting. The regret, the humour, the emotions, are done with style and beauty.  Hornby gets into the heart of our emotions.  It's flawless.  The characters are real people and I pulled for them all though the novel.   (the last three pages on kindle are cut off, so this might be best read old style..I had to make a trip to the book store the next day and read them off the shelf which was a bit frustrating)
B001YLWOI0|4.0|Dany Boon's Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis/Welcome to the Sticks became France's biggest box-office hit in record time when it pulled in over $184m in France alone, although it's made barely a ripple in the English-speaking world - a shame, because this good natured culture clash comedy is a lot of fun. Kad Merad is the post office manager who gets caught pretending to be disabled to secure a transfer to the South of France only to be given the worst punishment in the post office's power: a transfer to the cold north of France, the Toxteth or Detroit of France. Once there he quickly discovers that (unlike Toxteth) it's not the backward disease-ridden inbred peasant slum of popular ridicule, but finds that comforting his imagined suffering cheers up his depressed wife back home, so ends up persuading his new friends to live down to all the horror stories when she comes to visit...     It's not the most original plot or treatment in the world, with much of the wordplay built around the local accent that adds chti to every other word straight out of Abbott and Costello's Who's On First routine, but while predictable it's still very funny more often than not. The early scenes are among the funniest, be it Michel Galabru's Dickensian (or should that be Hugoian?) horror stories of a childhood in the north to the sympathetic traffic cop who tears up a ticket when he finds out the condemned man's destination, and the end is rather abrupt, but it's a confident feelgood comedy that delivers the goods. Kudos to Michael Katims' excellent subtitle adaptation that manages to pull off the tricky alliteration, puns and wordplay that a lesser translator might decide were simply untranslatable.     The French PAL 2-disc set offers a wealth of unsubtitled extras, from a few deleted scenes and outtakes to lengthy documentaries and a themed French episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionare, but the film itself boasts both optional English subtitles and a very good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.
1588167461|5.0|This book is well written and is an easy guide to building a man's wardrobe. It leans on the conservative side of dress. Don't expect any new trends here, the book covers what works and what doesn't. I've referred to it a dozen times in the past month. Esquire has been doing this for years, so you can count on their advice. The state of todays dress is terrible and I hope this book was read by every American male. Are you tired of men in cargo pants with Ed Hardy shirts? Then buy this book. I highly recommend it.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|Seen today, Touchez Pas Au Grisbi seems like Jean Gabin's last great role, but in 1954 it was seen as his comeback after a slew of disappointing post-war films that were generally fairly average on their own merits even when not compared to his remarkable run of pre-war classics. Certainly he was the right actor at the right time when his career, like the old-school thief he plays, was beginning to look like it was over. The old Gabin is still recognisable but the rot has set in, and it's that combination of a class act that has outlived his time that makes his perfect casting performance so remarkable. He's a bit of a moaner and feels his age: constantly weary, he's got to that time in his life when he wants to go to bed early because if he stays up after midnight he feels like he's working overtime. Far from the doomed romantics he specialised in during his Thirties prime, he's a faded man edging into the shadows - in one remarkable shot even a lit match casts no light on his face - in a film that takes a lot of the glamour off both its star and its genre. He and his longtime, not too smart partner have pulled their last job before the film even starts, and the inevitable violence and tragedy come from his attempts to keep his newly acquired `pension' - the grisbi (loot) of the title - from rival crooks.     There's no romance or honour among thieves here. From the clubs where the `dancers' do little more than walk across the stage to the restaurants that shun the slumming socialite crowd, it's a mediocre, artificial world they inhabit, where packs of criminals aren't loyal unless it suits them, where almost everyone either expresses disappointment or hides behind insincere clichéd expressions of admiration and loyalty. For director Jacques Becker how his low lives go about the everyday business of living is as important as the plot, and strangely it's surprisingly compelling too despite what is happening often being so mundane. You can feel the cold of the rarely used apartment he and René Dary's Riton eat their crackers and pate in before breaking out their pajamas, brushing their teeth and going to bed early just as vividly as you can feel the crisp night air of a roadside hostage exchange that goes disastrously wrong.     If that sounds perhaps too grim and austere, the film is anything but. Beautifully directed by Becker, whose reputation has sadly faded over the years - indeed, for a long time this, perhaps his most famous film, was out of circulation in English speaking territories - and featuring Lino Ventura in his first role and an early appearance by Jeanne Moreau, it's one of the best French thrillers ever made and it's easy to see why it's been such a huge influence on the crime genre. The UK DVD is a good presentation as is the original StudioCanal French DVD, but not unexpectedly, Criterion's Region 1 NTSC DVD outdoes it as far as supplements go: a lengthy extract from French TV series Cinéastes de Notre Temps, an entertaining and insightful 2002 interview with supporting player Daniel Cauchy, who reveals why his character really didn't make it to the film's finale, a 1972 interview with Lino Ventura, a 1978 interview with composer Jean Wiener, the original French theatrical trailer and detailed liner notes.
1401302378|2.0|Maybe this was a groundbreaking book when it first came out, but the subject it addresses makes its shelf life rather brief. Today (2010), most of what the author says is pretty self evident to anyone who hasn't been living in cave last few years. Very repetitive, get's really boring. Perhaps the author is addressing a niche audience of daft readers deep in the long tail, who enjoy being told the same thing over and over again.

B003L16FAE|4.0|I bought this blu-ray of Predator half because it came with a free ticket to see Predators in theatres in summer of 2010.  At the time, my home setup was just on a large 720p display and a PS3 player.  Long story short, I watched the movie, and was blown away by how awesome the movie looked!  Crystal clear picture as far as I was concerned.  I expected something less than perfect from a movie filmed before there even was \\"HD\\".  Granted, I don't have a world class setup....just a \\"real world\\" setup...the kind of setup an average Joe would have on a budget.  For a movie decades old, I was stunned by the picture quality and the awesome surround sound.  Until this time, the only times I had seen this movie was on VHS and on a standard definition 4:3 TV.      As far as I am concerned, for the average movie watcher, this is the definitive version of Predator to get.  For the rest of you, keep in mind at one point, you all swore that LASERDISC was the end all and be all of home theatre...and we know how that worked out.

0374158460|5.0|The best novelists draw readers into someone else's world, at least for a time, and closing a novel by such a writer is like leaving, reluctantly, a place you've really enjoyed, even if you know you'll never live there. \\"Freedom, \\" the world of Walter and Parry Berglund and their two children, is that kind of novel.<br /><br />I'm not going to offer a synopsis of the plot, as there are plenty of those around, but instead just a few observations on what makes \\"Freedom\\" such a pleasure to read.  Jonathan Franzen really knows how to tell a story, and the novel is plotted--expertly--in ways that will make you put the novel DOWN at a natural stopping place, the better to not reach the end too quickly. The use of different voices is one way this happens, but the insertion of a \\"memoir\\" written by Patty is another. How perfect a device this is for the age of memoirs we live in.<br /><br />Franzen's use of detail is another thing that will grab you. He sees it all. There are, for example, the rural West Virginians stomping on Walter Berglund, who has arrived to help open a factory intended to bring employment to an area in which there is none. The stompers are wearing \\"Chinese-made\\" sneakers, of course. Oh irony. Later in the novel, when Walter's solicitude for songbirds murdered by cats annoys the striving Minnesotans of \\"Canterbridge Estates,\\" the ugly little community built on cheap loans that has sprung up on the shore of the lake where Walter lives, he has his driveway choked with mounds of snow swiped in by the local plow guy. Thus is exactly how revenge is enacted in rural townships.<br /><br />And then there is the ending. It caught me off guard.  (Its busybody Evangelical lady made me laugh, too.) It's a pitch perfect conclusion. Having read a few things recently by good writers who lazily consign over-fifties to assisted living or describe sixty-somethings as having been on Social Security \\"forever\\" (not today they're not!), I took extra pleasure in how Franzen takes his leave of Walter and Patty. He knew a thing or two about his elders when he wrote \\"The Corrections,\\" but now that he is closer to those years himself (Franzen is 51), his natural empathy is deepened by his remarkable gifts of observation.<br /><br />\\"Freedom is a lengthy novel, but it pulled me in and had me reading straight through to the end. However, it wouldn't be satisfying to read it in bits and pieces or to buy it just because it's gotten a lot of press. If you're not sure if Franzen's style is your cup of tea, save\\"Freedom\\" for when you know you can give it a chunk of time. You might even begin with his other great success,  \\"The Corrections,\\" which has been out for more than a decade and is easy to find in paperback, in audio format, and in libraries. \\"The Corrections\\" is the way we lived then. 9/11 hadn't happened. \\"Freedom,\\" with its text messages, iPods, and plasma TV screens, is  the way we live right now.<br />M.

B000002H3E|5.0|I just saw them live with the Scorpions...not the best show. Don was struggling with the high notes. But with the return George Lynch, that was worth the cost of admission alone. The show reminded me of how many great songs Dokken has. I've always been a huge Dokken fan, but never purchased this CD because it had more of their main stream \\"hits\\" and isn't as hard as 'Tooth and nail' or 'Back for the attack' However, with songs like 'Unchain the night', 'Its not Love' and 'The Hunter' are strong enough to carry the album, and Lynch's guitar work & killer solo's shine through out.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|This version is very well cast and well acted.  Unfortunately it struggles in two ways.  First, it is very abridged and seems so.  Second, the cinematography frequently devolves in to stupid, \\"reality\\"-show-style camera waggling.  There is even one point near the end where the camera strangely vibrates.  What are things coming to when Masterpiece Theater abandons the principles of visual beauty and coherence?  We truly are in a dark age of cinematography.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|First off, I loved the TV show...liked the first movie.  However, there wasn't enough material for a second movie, let alone 144 minutes worth.  The thing I hated the most about the second movie was Samantha.  The character and the actress are too old to be dressing and acting like she's still in her thirties.  The whole scene in the Dubai marketplace towards the end of the film was just awful!  I wish they would have made New York the only location. Also, lose Steve Brady.  That character is so totally wrong for Miranda.  What a loser he is!  And poor Charlotte!  Reduced to crying over her spoiled brats!  Even Big didn't get enough screen time to make me happy.  Please, do not make a third movie!

B0040QYROA|5.0|Ever since I saw a diced up version of Metropolis in 1983 - I've been waiting for this release.

B002ZG999U|3.0|It has to be said that you either have to admire Sylvester Stallone or laugh at him, either way he's a like his most famous iconic creation, Rocky Balboa he's never been one to go down without a fight and although in more recent years age and diminishing box office clout has forced him to retread old ground by revisiting old territory with both \\"Rocky Balboa\\" and \\"Rambo\\", once again he more or less does the same thing with \\"The Expendables\\" a tribute if you like to the loud, slam bang, action films of the eighties which with he made his name with. Gathering around him a mixed bag of old pro's some of which made their name (which is now somewhat dubious given where their careers have ended up)back in the day, \\"The Expendables\\" could be seen as an old man's affectionate if some what shallow, back slapping look back on past glories. And while satisfying enough in a superficial it won't win any wards innovation. For to be honest, the movie had it not had Stallones stamp upon wouldn't have seemed out in a direct to DVD bargain bin, a place where a certain Dolph Lundgren has found himself relegated to. Fortunately , Stallone to his merit Isn't without some writing or notable directorial attributes which is what manages to raise it slightly above the hackneyed tripe that Lundgren is now forced peddle.     An elite team of mercenaries, the Expendables of the movies title are hired by government bigwig, the enigmatically titled Mr. Church to bring down a corrupt South American dictator who runs a small Island country with the aid of former CIA agent gone rogue James Munroe (Eric Roberts). Barney Ross (Stallone) and his number two Lee, (British action star Jason Statham who is the baby of the bunch at 38) travel ahead to scout the territory and meet with their secret contact and local rebel Sandra. But when things go awry, Ross and Lee are forced to flee with Sandra being left behind to face the music when she is captured. With the choice of walking away from the entire mess,Barney's conscience tells him to do otherwise and he assembles his crew to go back in, rescue Sandra and finish the the job. Like I said, pretty routine and shallow.    One big celebration of bygone days and of the action genre, it's hardly a surprise that Stallone has assembled a cast that includes Jet-Li, Dolph Lundgren et al Of course, you can't have slam-bam action throw back to the eighties hey day without the obligatory cameos from a certain Bruce Willis and a certain governor of California, the latter's being so fleeting, gratuitous and heavy handed it borders on offensive. Subtle this film Isn't but then what were we to expect. Lundgren seems to mainly inhabit  a role that might as well be an extended cameo and is left with a character that conveniently sits upon a moral see saw and results in eventually being nothing more than  a tool utilised to briefly kick some ass and forward the films leaden plot. The rest of the Expendables seem with the exception of Statham who unsurprisingly is lumbered with the hackneyed minor romantic sun-plot, seem to be their mainly just to make up the numbers while Mickey Rourke is on hand to offer some \\"sage\\" counsel as old friend and former team mate, Tool.     But for all the requisite cliches that abound Stallone does seem to be having fun on and off camera and as he has proved in the past that while he has a habit for at times being a tad trite and all too crowd pleasing, putting spectacle ahead of substance. His direction is never the less fluid and he manages to never let the pace of the film drag. The action sequences are fairly impressive and although neither he and Statham aren't the greatest of actors they gel well together and have a likeable chemistry in their scenes together, leading me to wonder if their was as much camaraderie off camera as there is on. It is too Stallone's merit that he even managed to film some of the movies more hands on, fight sequences. And It's to some credit that it's a film that never takes itself entirely too seriously, although it does of course lapse in to the odd moment of dramatic gravitas, to some extent you can't help but think that with every explosion and obliging one liner you would come to expect, that Stallone is wallowing in the absurd and superficiality in it all. He knows basicly knows what his core audience wants and is unashamed to deliver.    As arguably the main villain, Eric Roberts a fine and undervalued actor once again is left with the typical sneering bad guy that he has become mainly known for playing. Although solid you can't help but think he deserves better than being forced to play two-dimensional villains.     As hollow as what it would be on paper, \\"The Expendables\\" is something of a guilty pleasure. It Isn't the most inspiring and original of projects that Stallone and yet considering most of his career, it's just another one of a number of glossy action pics that he can associate himself with. You might say It's an affectionate look at a period with which Stallone and others like him made their name. And while I'm in no doubt there is affectionate intent when It's all said and done It's just another dumb, loud action pick all be it a solid one at that.
0439882826|5.0|The book is very well made. It feels like it will last through the riggers that a 6 year old will put it through. The book has lots of information about characters, planets, ships etc. from the original Trilogy. The pop-ups are very detailed from the small flaps to the largest 2 page pop-ups. My son and I will be spending a lot of time reading this book.

All of these 1 and 2 star ratings are from the wacko jobs of the far right who are trying to ruin our country. Maybe sista Sarah will have a comment sooner or later.

B000RZIGVS|3.0|The discs are labeled poorly, the text being tiny, almost unreadable. Also, there are errors on a select few discs where the show titles are wrong. For instance, there are two \\"Cause and Effects\\" on separate discs. Obviously a factory screwup.     The quality is somewhat grainy. Quite noticable on a larger screen.     The plastic disc containers are cheap and mine were even broken.     All in all, a very nice set. But you're paying for the discs only. The disc holders are pathetic and the poor labeling make the set an overall disappointing package.    I paid $280 for my set and in my opinion, it wasn't worth that much to me.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Teachers do the most interesting things these days and teaching doesn't seem to be one of them.  Breaking Bad is an about a Chemistry Teacher who learns he has lung cancer.  He wavers on treatment but doesn't waiver on learning a new line of work to help his family after he is gone.  It's called drug dealing and he makes crystal meth.  He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor.  The show is absorbing and very interesting.  It is low key and not showy but doesn't hesitate to see humor in the man's predicament.  His wife is pregnant with their second child.  Their first child has cerebral palsy.  His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent.  The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil.  So much for role models.  Good show with a lot going for it.

B000683VI4|5.0|History is riddled with lovers who overcame the odds, be they social or cultural, to be with each other. Think Romeo and Juliet, Pride and Prejudice, West Side Story, Beauty and the Beast, and now, love it or hate it, Twilight. It's their courage and faith in their love that makes these stories so memorable to billions down through the centuries. It's a story that's been told a thousand different times with a thousand different variables thrown in. And yet somehow it never gets old. The Notebook is nothing new. It's been done before. But somehow it captures the essence and passion that goes deeper than mere obsession into the real purpose that lovers find in each other. To quote a main character \\"Our love can do whatever we want it to\\". With society's rising skepticism and disillusionment with real, true love and commitment (demonstrated by the decreasing number of relationships making it to marraige and the staggering increase of divorce), it's stories like these that lend a glimmer of hope and belief in a darkened world. There is such a thing as love and there is someone out there who's made for you.   This is an unambitious, simple film about love but it's that very simplicity that makes it so charming and extraordinary. The story centers around Noah (Ryan Gosling) a quiet, simple Southern small-town boy, and Allie (Rachel McAdams), vivacious Southern belle born into Southern money. Their improbable summer romance might be viewed as mere infatuation by some, but watch these two scenes: the beach scene where Allie insist that she could have been a bird in another life and Noah delivers one of the film's most memorable lines. He might not know about reincarnation but he knows this much: \\"If you're a bird then I'm a bird\\". The second is the first love scene in the old house when the tell each other \\"I love you\\" for the first time. You can feel it's true. Such an emotionally rich scene. But at their age, there's just too much to overcome and Allie's rich and protective parents put an end to the imprudent match. The rest of the movie tells how their live's path led them in different directions but ultimately wound up bringing them back to each other. However, in the seven years that have past there is now a fiance in Allie's life and she must choose which path to follow. Apparently a very difficult decision to make. In my opinion, if you're having trouble deciding between two men it's not likely that the right choice lies with either but I've never been in Allie's position. Regardless, the storyline is great, music is effective, beautiful without being cliche or predictable. The script could have used some revision I thought. I couple of key scenes are golden, but some would have been better if the lines were different. The acting is good, especially Rachel McAdams with her convincing portrayal of the wild, impulsive, but carefully brought up society belle in emotional upheaval. This was her breakthrough film that opened up her career to movies such as Wedding Crashers, State of Play, and Sherlock Holmes. Ryan Gosling does a good job with the homeboy role. Even though I'm a guy, a romance film is very difficult for me to enjoy if i don't like the guy (How to Lose a Guy.., The Proposal) but not only is he a heartthrob with my sisters, he's an unpretentious and honest performer.    So while this film will not be received with tireless enthusiasm by everyone (especially us guys) simply for the fact that it's such a common Hollywood theme, it's so beautifully crafted that I would recommend at least viewing it once. You don't have to like it, but I did, my sisters did. And I think, if you keep your heart open, then just like love it might catch you by surprise.

B003OF3R0S|4.0|I got into A7X back in high school, and they were nice just to listen to whenever, and even better when you're working out. All their albums though I must say have been very decent with keeping consistent in their albums. Even though their drummer died, the new drummer they have (from Dream Theater I think), does a good job replacing a good percussionist sound.<br /><br />However, this consistency is the reason I gave it four stars. I guess the beginning album was a little different, due to the increased aggressiveness, but this album's mood and tone seems pretty similar to their couple albums before this such as their self-titled album and waking the fallen. I mean, I guess there was a little change you notice as they go on, but I just didn't see the change much, but if you are a metal head or A7X fan, check this album out. I'd say it's worth a listen
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This is the Best of the Best of Leonard Cohen. He has left the world with this treasure of himself for us to remember him by and enjoy, long after he is gone. You can feel the emotion from his heart when you listen to it. A true #1 Class Act.
B001FB55L2|5.0|Contrary to what the trailer would have you believe, this is not a modern day, hedonistic Jane Austen novel with love triangles and pseudo-incestuous relationships.  Save that garbage for Lifetime and A-Lister female celebrities who either want a time piece under their belt, or think they have the chops to translate a classic piece of chick-lit onto the big screen with more than a modicum of success.  Looking at you, Kate Winslet.  Instead, this movie instantly gains a star when it avoids the cheap and the obvious, delving into the rampant Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) cases resulting from wars in the Middle East rather than an actual love triangle.  Allowing the superb cast to channel emotions ranging from joy to despair, elation to psychosis, was a much wiser choice.<br /><br />Just as Jarhead Captain Sam Hill (Tobey Maguire) is strapping on his LPCs and heading out to BFE, Afghanistan where he'll get sleepless nights in the sandbox and the 4 fingers of death for dinner, leaving his beautiful wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and their two daughters behind, bidding his Marine Corp father an Alpha Mike Foxtrot, his soup sandwich brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is being released from prison for an undisclosed crime.<br /><br />All is well in the MMFD until Hill's chopper flight goes Tango Uniform, hit by enemy fire.  Thrown to his fourth point of contact with no time to pop smoke, his situation is a FUBAR Charlie Foxtrot and he's taken prisoner by the Taliban.  Captured with a Private, Cpt. Hill reminds the lower enlisted Marine to remain disciplined and strong.  He is assumed dead, and his family is informed of the travesty.  Before the dress blues have left the driveway, Sam's brother Blue Falcons him back home, playing the role of Jodie with Grace.  When he's rescued, however, the movie heats up as PTSD hinders the reacclimation with his family and causes him to engage in the mental goat rope of infidelitous thoughts.<br /><br />Military lingo aside, this is a very compelling film dealing with timely subject matter.  The three leads are wonderful, but Tobey Maguire really stretches his legs in his role as a traumatized Marine back from war.  When he begins to go bug-eyed - aided by his gaunt appearance - it's genuinely disturbing.  The pacing away from war is a little slow but manageable.<br /><br />I give very high praise and recommendation for director Jim Sheridan's work in this film.  He made the right choices, let the stars dominate the screen, and created a wonderful, albeit imbalanced movie.dealing with timely subject matter.

Truly they did not promote this album the right way, it reaches out to every age group,the music is awesome and the last song salute is amazing.  It is a must get, I wish that she could re-promote this album and use the last 4 to get the attention of the world that she still has it.  I hope she can regain her confidence and try again!! I am ready and waiting to buy the next album.  Whitney Houston never disappoints!!

B003O86MY8|5.0|I was watching PBS via OETA (Oklahoma Educational Television Authority) during their August fund raising campaign, and David Garrett's concert from Berlin came on.  I had never heard of him, which embarrassed me, quite frankly.  His orchestra was 60 strong, performing before a crowd of 18,000 Berliners.  I was totally blown away by this man's god-given talent.  His rapport with the audience was immediate, infectious, and mesmerizing.  Again, immediately I decided I just had to have the CD.  My only regret is:  the CD does not include his performance of Tommaso Albinoni's \\"Adagio\\", which is one of my all-time favorite symphonic pieces ever written, which I never get tired of listening to.  As far as I'm concerned, owning a copy of either the DVD or CD is a \\"must-have\\", and should be included in your DVD/CD library.  Doug Spriggs

I definitely feel comfortable enough to use the blade shop again. The knife was razor sharp out the box. I had researched camping knives a lot before buying this one and it lives up to it's reputation (so far anyway, I havent put it through any real hard use yet). Well, that's it...liked the knife, liked the seller, five stars.

B001E45XT4|3.0|1) I bought these for $50, and I was pleased with them overall. Now under $50, they're a great value.    2) Primary gripe is they snapped in half with only light, normal use: wearing them, taking them off and setting them on the desk, repeat = snap. The break occurred 1-2 years after purchase.    3) They are comfortable, with only some heat issues during marathon gaming sessions. That's probably true with any headset though.    4) The foldable mic boom is nice, and the sound coming from it is good.    5) Sound quality is nice, but nothing to write home about. You won't go \\"Wow!\\" but you won't be disappointed, either.    6) I'm choosing to replace this product with a [[ASIN:B003VANOFY Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]], so look into that if you want something nicer in a higher price bracket, that *hopefully* won't be as fragile.

B00000E4OJ|5.0|Kertesz makes good use of the Vienna Phil. and its ability to add an aura of charm to anything  (even Alban Berg).  As one of the earlier reviewers notes, this charm bathes the first few symphonies.  As much as I admire Harnoncourt in these works, and of course Thomas Beecham, the lilting insouciance of the Minuet in Sym. #1 would melt any heart. How strange that Kertesz, with such natural good humor and effortless rhythm, later became something of a difficult conductor, to the point that he parted early from the London Sym.<br /><br />From Sym. #1 to #4 we are in the innocence of a pastoral paradise (Kertesz isn't interested in the teenage composer's tougher side,which Harnoncourt brings out in quasi-Beethoven style.) There's also a sweeping momentum to these readings -- they don't lapse into the dull impersonality of Bohm or the reticent propriety of Colin Davis -- and the large orchestra, recorded vividly in Decca's classic analog sound, adds a sense of occasion. Hard as it is do to, Kertesz turns these into \\"event\\" performances. If only Decca would remaster these recordings to remove some digital rawness and glare.<br /><br />Sym. #5 and #6 are still loosely organized, but he has gained in assurance about what he wants to express. I'm not implying a major change; until the \\"Unfinished\\" appears, the composer seems to mine the same sunny terrain, with some passages of Sym. 4 excepted  these are the only two minor key symphonies. I wish Kertesz had been more attentive in Sym. #5, which feels too generic. This is too familiar a work to amble through with a leisurely smile; something has to happen to catch your attention.  Kertesz responds well, however, to the larger ambitions of Sym. #6 whenever Schubert becomes more forceful. In other hands the lighter parts can sound mincing, but not here. So far, five symphonies out of six have been superb, and if you already own great readings of the \\"Unfinished\\" and \\"Great\\" C major, these joyous early works will justify at purchase.<br /><br />Does a cycle need to have outstanding accounts of the two unquestioned masterpieces in Schubert's symphonic career?  Kertesz's \\"Unfinished\\" i more than professional, but at times he shies away from the music's undercurrents of mystery, and the dissonant eruptions in the first movement feel disturbing.  They're just loud. Perhaps others will feel very differently, because there's plenty of force and power here. The second movement benefits from perfect Viennese poise; it fares very well, I think, on its own terms, but there really is more mystery and melancholy to be expressed.<br /><br />The Scubert \\"Great\\" is a major enterprise compared to all that preceded it, and here Kertesz competes with Bruno Walter, Toscanini, Furtwangler, and Klemperer, to name only a few renowned conductors whose Ninths are acclaimed. Since Kertesz's premature death in 1973, there have also been fine performances from Sinopoli, Harnoncourt, and (for many British critics) Solti. Kertesz's approach is forceful, with strong accents punctuating the first movement. Yet I'm not quite sure it soars, and the brisk second movement, at a pace older conductors would never have favored, lacks repose. Clearly he feels more robustness in this music than I do. The Schrzo is straightforward (not a compliment), leading to an exciting finale that nonetheless fails to communicate the joy that this music should impart.  The three overtures added as fillers are stylishly done -- I love the old-fashioned whiny oboe in the \\"Over. in the Italian Style.\\"<br /><br />Because the best things here are almost incomparable in their charm, I can see buying Kertesz's cycle as a first choice without hesitation, and if you enjoy his No. 5, 8, and 9 more than I do, noting can possibly go wrong.chase.<br /><br />Does a cycle need to have outstanding accounts of the two unquestioned masterpieces in Schubert's symphonic career?

B00005AR3G|4.0|The Emperor's New Groove is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on December 15, 2000. The films tells the story of Emperor Kuzco who has and ego as big as his kingdom, self centered and does not like to be touched. Emperor Kuzco fires Yzma, his advisor, mainly for making decisions without his approval. Also Emperor Kuzco has invited Pacha over to his palace to give him advice (unknown to Pacha at the time) where to build his summer home. Later that evening Yzma invites Emperor Kuzco to dinner to show that there is no hard feelings. The truth of the matter is she is planning to kill Emperor Kuzco and makes herself ruler. Something goes wrong with the plan and instead of killing him, turns Emperor Kuzco into a llama. Kronk is told to finish the job, but looses Kuzco in the process. Kuzco is saved by Pacha unintentionally and is brought to his village home. Kuzco discovers that he has been turned into a llama and orders Pacha to take him back to his village. Pacha refuses unless the Emperor moves his summer home somewhere else. Kuzco heads back to the palace himself against the warnings Pacha that there are jaguars in the jungle. Kuzco winds up being chased by the jaguars and is rescued by Pacha. When Pacha gives him his shirt to stay warm Kuzco begins to have a change of heart, but is back to his old self when the two head back to the palace. Kuzco goes back on his deal with Pacha but when he saves Pacha he realizes that he needs him to get back to the palace and as a friend too since he has none. The race is on to get back to the palace to make Kuzco human again. In the end the two manage to outwit Yzma, turn Kuzco human, and Kuzco and Pacha become great friends. Kuzco does not build a palace but a small hut next to Pacha's hut. The Emperor's New Groove does not have the same Disney magic as past Disney movies and the only song in the movie is during the end of film when the credits are rolling. The film only profited sixty-million dollars while past films grossed more in profits. The Emperor's New Groove did get favorable reviews from movie critics.

B003J27WFW|5.0|I've been a fan of RUSH since the 2112 album. No, I can't claim to have been there for the first album but I managed to make it to the 2112 tour and have been a fan ever since. There were some albums that I didn't care for but I always tried to attend their shows if I could since they were always great.<br /><br />There is a major lesson here. In reviewing the evolution of RUSH through this documentary one comes away with a new look at success without excess. It seems counter to what we think we know about a successful rock 'n roll band and that point is abundantly clear in this film. How can these guys be so cool and yet so modest and earthbound? The answer is deceptively simple: They stayed true to themselves and they rocked their asses off. Here's a band that did what they wanted to do, when they wanted to do it and critics be damned.<br /><br />It's a great film and a wonderful look at a truly awesome rock band.

1400079276|5.0|This was the first novel that I had read by Murakami. It was recommended by a good friend and I found that I couldn't put the book down. I love authors that really tap into their imagination. Murakami did that. He kept you interested in the characters and engaged your inner self about things maybe you hadn't thought about in a long time or for some people, maybe never. Very deep and engaging. I look forward to reading another novel by Murakami.

B003TXSF5C|3.0|I was very much looking forward to this new book by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.  I was hoping to learn something new about the current state of the art in cosmology.  Instead, the book is basically a defense of the anthropic principle as an excuse for the failure of string theory, and it's progeny, M-theory, to predict anything about the properties of our universe.    Basically, the anthropic principle states that we don't need to understand why our universe seems to be uniquely hospitable for the development of sentient life.  The logic is that our universe, no matter how improbable, can be explained as long as it is possible.  That we are here to ask the question means that, by definition, our particular universe is hospitable, and any theory that makes our universe possible is acceptable.  The fact that M-theory predicts an almost limitless number of possible universes (10 E500), and can only predict our universe if all the physical laws and constants are \\"dialed in\\" is not a barrier to it's acceptance.  All one has to do is postulate a multiverse, in which every universe that is possible will be created eventually, in order to accept M-theory.  The fact that M-theory, as well as string theory, have never been supported by a scientific observation, and require 10 spatial dimensions (the 7 we can't see are small and tightly curled up, supposedly) is pushed aside.    The purpose of the book seems to be to counter the idea of \\"intelligent design\\".  M-theory leads to the conclusion that our universe is certain to be created eventually, therefore God is not necessary in order to explain the peculiar, yet necessary, details of our universe.  I am not a fan of the idea of \\"intelligent design\\". I believe that it is a thinly veiled attempt by religious fundamentalists to insinuate God into secular world of science.  But to pin one's hopes on a theory that is untested seems premature and ill-advised.    I was somewhat off-put by the authors' rather lame attemptsat humor. I suppose they were put in there because this book is intended for a more mainstream audience than me, but they seemed condescending.  In the book's defense, it is well written, and I thoroughly enjoyed those passages concerned with the history of science.  There is no math at all, and it does present the most popular ideas in current physics, some of which are pretty mind-blowing to the uninitiated, in a very accessible fashion.     This book would be a suitable introduction to current mainstream ideas about cosmology for lay audiences, but if you are a physics junkie, you would be better served looking elsewhere.
0553805371|1.0|There is some enthralling stuff here. And Hawking is very eloquent, persuasive, and intelligent.  But if we are to judge the book on one of the most reported aspects of it, that is, that is claims to have the answer to the question \\"why is there something [in terms of the Universe and our existence] and not nothing\\" then this book is a miserable failure, because it does not even begin to propose an interesting or believable answer to the question.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|This was a good quality, balanced fan.  Moved considerable air but was at the same time a bit loud.  The sound wasn't an issue given the application but in retrospect I might have connected it to 5V instead of 12V to slow/quiet it down.  Plus at 5V it would probably last forever.  Screw holes are counter-sunk to allow for shorter screws, which was a plus since the fan I was replacing indeed used shorter screws.

0439023483|1.0|when i first started reading this book i was so engaged, and could not put it down, then towards the middle i started to become somewhat uninterested and i skipped through the last 50 plus pages because the love story was stupid and corny, i was very disappointed with the plot and it just was not good.  the story revolves around katniss, and i cannot describe her personality becasue she doesnt really have one.  the story is about a bunch of kids who get sent to this island and have to kill eachother and the last one to die can go home and live. someone said before that kids killing eachother is sick and i would have to agree. when i found out that they were going to the island to kill eachother i thought that they would rebel against the government and all the kids would escape the island but that didnt happen, all the kids brutally die.  katniss also meets a red haired girl who she saw running for her life in the forest and i thought that was going to be an interesting mystery but then we never hear from the girl again.i though that the girl would tell her a way to escape or something like that.  it was a fast read but honestly not good.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I bought this Triggers to see If they really make the Controller and when they arrived and I tried them on, and they actually DO make it better. Now the R2 & L2 Triggers are more Comfortable and you have more Grip on them. I really like them. I read a few Customer Reviews in here saying that they may fall off or jump out sporadically but they haven't done that to me, not even once. I don't play \\"hitting my controller\\" or smashing with my fingers, I play calmed.     But overall, it is a Very Good Enhancement for the PS3 Controller    Go for it!
0385504225|2.0|snooze.    essentially its a less interesting version of the Davinci Code. It really boils down to plot - which there really is none. None that is original. Change of character names, change locations, and motivations of the villians, yes. Plot, no. I was more irritated than intrigued, knowing exactly what was going to happen literally on the next page of this predictible snoozefest.     Justin Lee's description as Character A vs Character B is brilliant - in fact reading it was more interesting than reading The Lost Symbol.    If you liked the Davinci Code, don't ruin it by reading the sequel.

It's not ground breaking, not though invoking, won't improve my self worth, influence me to change my religious beliefs or to hug my dog, kid and husband.  What it did was entertain me.  Isn't that the main purpose for most movies, especially summer blockbusters?  Here is hoping for a sequel.  Oh and SHAME on the person who called Gemma CHUBBY!  What is wrong with you?  Just because she is not a size 0 -2?  You are the reason so many young girls become anorexic, to please narrow minded individuals like yourself.

B002IVLH60|1.0|Everything on this album goes wrong, starting with the actual sound which is terrible. Production is horrible, it sounds like low quality mp3's, and the songs are pure crap except maybe for the lead single. One positive aspect of pearl jam up to the album riot act was that they combined superb production, heavy atmosphere, creative guitars, depth, and Eddie's very expressive voice. All that seemed to fade on the 2006 album, and on this one, it's finally gone. It's very odd because Eddie's solo album for the movie Into the Wild was very good in comparison, I just can't understand what went wrong here...  My guess is that there was a marketing team involved saying something like, guys we need something raw, a \\"return to roots album\\", mixed with a couple of songs similar to those on the Into the Wild soundtrack, and since people listen to cheap mp3's  we don't really need to spend that much time on production or mastering.   The overall issue going on here is that generation X is having its midlife crisis, and generation X only worked as youth, we were told to never trust anyone over 40, and now we are over 40...
B001NXDSLG|5.0|Anyone who knows Woodstock through the audio releases or the original video will find this a great update.  The performances are enhanced with Blu-ray quality, the sound is greatly enhanced and the extras are a sweet addition to the package.      If you're like me you've probably owned several versions of this recording.  This is likely to be the definitive version, with lots of extra footage that included performances and footage I had never seen before.  It was a bit pricey, but all things considered, this is probably about as good as it will ever get and I couldn't pass up on the opportunity to have this in the superior Blu-ray quality.    Woodstock was the event of a lifetime, certainly one of history's defining events that deserves to be enjoyed again.  This is the perfect way to do it.

B0017CW5J4|5.0|The Blue Man Group epitomizes entertainment.  From their opening salvo to the final restrain of the last song, this disc shows exactly how entertaining the band can be.  Their unique approach to playing, combined with their slightly twisted humor, draws the viewer in and captivates them.  While this IS an extension of the act started during the Complex Tour, this disc is much more than just a rehash with a few new songs thrown in.<br /><br />By the time the show ends, you too will know how to be a megastar.<br /><br />But the real enjoyment of having the Blu-Ray disc is in the extras.  There you get to meet the guys who started it all, hear them explain how they approached their unique creative process and how they strive to be more than just an entertaining act.  Each of their shows is an experience, and this disc spills the beans on how it is all done.  There are several videos in the extras that enhance owning the disc even further.<br /><br />You'll never believe that grown men in weird costumes, beating on some plastic pipes while catching marshmallows thrown from incredible distances and then spewing paint onto a canvas could be so entertaining, but start to finish this disc is filled with one pleasure stacked upon another.<br /><br />This disc, just 1 among the hundreds of performing art discs that I own, is by far my most favorite and the most entertaining.  I can, and do, watch this one over and over and over.  You will to.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|Time to get in the mud. Director Paul W.S. Anderson - or, as I like to call him, \\"Mr. Jovovich\\" - lands a bigger budget, and the visual effects flourish accordingly. Someone should've paid the writers, though. The acting? No, there's no acting here. But a lot of zombies get all tore up. If you've come to this flick expecting good acting performances from this cast, prepare to get your feelings hurt. This is cinematic junk food where the scares are few and character arcs break down to either the character's still alive or he's zombie snack. Whenever there's a pause for exposition and the participants try to act, the venture collapses or drags or whichever terms of discontent you want to apply. But, look at it this way, at least the director makes the plot seem unoriginal and muddled. Uh...<br /><br />Four years after the first outbreak of the T-virus, and the zombie apocalypse has ravaged the planet and reduced the human population down to not a hell of a lot. Whoever said the meek shall inherit the earth needs to get savagely punched in the face, because the world now belongs to the undead and the mutants, and these assclowns are meek in the same way that starving Avon ladies are meek. The story picks up many months after Project: Alice and Claire Redfield went their divergent ways, with Claire and her charges off to Alaska and the elusive promise of haven. Alice - and this all happened at the back end of RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION - discovers clones of herself and she right then and there vows to take the fight directly to the Umbrella Corporation. RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE opens with our girl lviing up to her promise as she raids the massive Umbrella complex in Tokyo. And Project: Alice, she brung her doppelgangers.<br /><br />So I harbor mad love for this film franchise, even if I'm not as familiar with its video game source - but I know they don't share continuity and that Alice was created specifically for the film adaptations. Milla Jovovich has kind of snuck up on me in that I don't know exactly when it was that she took over from Angelina Jolie as the pre-eminent western film action heroine in my eyes (I say \\"western film\\" because I feel Michelle Yeoh can still wipe the floor with Jolie and Jovovich). The writers do a clever in this sequel. Over the past series of films, Alice had gradually grown stronger and stronger and had even achieved telekinesis, which to me is just damn unfair for all the beasties out there. This is addressed in this sequel, and so we soon find a depowered Alice who still manages to handle her business with more finality and flair than anyone else.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, Alice and Claire Redfield reunite. Claire has suffered memory loss but has gained some wicked action hero moves. In Los Angeles, Alice and Claire run into a few other survivors holing up in a prison facility except that, outside, hordes and hordes of teeming flesh-eaters pound the walls. The survivors - comprised partly of Hollywood actors and a film producer - had hoped that Alice and Claire had arrived to rescue them. Alice lets them down easy... well, the gist of what she says is in effect, \\"No, this isn't a rescue operation. Get over it.\\" At this point, if you already hadn't suspected that the zombies would somehow eventually find a way into the prison fortress, then you are some kind of innocent babe in the woods. For these few survivors, it's not remotely comforting that, off on the horizon, they can glimpse one last hope for safe harbor.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE reserves a segment for its little stabs at Hollywood tropes, and of course the film producer would have to be an assclown. Languishing in a cell, one character finally shows up whom I'd been waiting for. If that's not enough of a hint, he's got a personal connection with one of our two heroines.<br /><br />The action sequences are big and crazy kinetic and live up to what you'd expect from this franchise, and the 3D feature does fun wonky things to your depth perception. The best action bits are the prison breakout and the Alices storming the Tokyo Umbrella headquarters. Alice - except I like calling her \\"Project: Alice\\" - towers above everyone else in sheer badassery, and if she's cheesed at you, it's best that you don't hand her a pocketful of change. I will say, though, that Alice's showdown with Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), the formidable Umbrella boss, is vastly underwhelming (and, okay, I officially have had it with bullet-time effects). Wesker desperately craves Alice's DNA because, so far, only Alice's genetic code has safely accommodated the T-virus. I also had a problem getting past Roberts' obvious channeling of THE MATRIX's Agent Smith and with his coming back from the dead perhaps too many times. At first, the man's sturdiness is chuckleable, and then the groaning.<br /><br />Some parting stuff: As far as featured new creatures, I think the monstrous hooded executioner steals the show and the hell hounds exude that ick factor. Not so familiar with the video game source but not entirely ignorant, either, I think it's cool that the Japanese in the film refer to the zombies as \\"Biohazards\\" (which is what the Resident Evil video games are titled in Japan). Concerning AFTERLIFE, there are bits here lifted from THE MATRIX, DAWN OF THE DEAD and others. It is what it is. Is it wrong that I actually think it's cool the film ends on a cliffhanger - because I want more sequels?  And do I recommend this one? Despite its flaws, I think I do. O where have you gone, my standards?ngs to your depth perception. The best action bits are the prison breakout and the Alices storming the Tokyo Umbrella headquarters.

0553805371|3.0|The current book of sensational discussion is Stephen Hawking's \\"The Grand Design,\\" written with fellow physicist Leonard Mlodinow.  Hawking is the Superstar of Science, and Mlodinow wrote scripts for \\"Star Trek.\\"  The book's release has fueled resurgent discussions about the question of God's existence, owing to the authors' claim that the existence of the universe, including the \\"why\\" questions formerly reserved for philosophy and theology, require no positing of a divine, creative intelligence.             The book is filled with fascinating descriptions of the strange and wonderful ways of nature.  Although the discussion is \\"dumbed down\\" for the sake of generating a lay-audience for the book, it is still difficult for the non-specialist to get a wrap on some of the more weird aspects of Quantum physics.  This review will attempt a dumbed-down interpretation of my own tenuous grasp of what Hawking and Mlodinow are saying.             Hawking and Mlodinow are very smart guys, for sure, and they know lots and lots about physics.  As I understand their presentation, we exist in a universe that is just one of an unimaginable number of universes (10/500) that have been created spontaneously and simultaneously out of Gravity.  Out of so many universes, it is highly likely that at least one of them would support life, and we just happen to be in that one (or one of those).  In this context, it should not surprise us that the universe we are in should look like it was designed especially for us and our understanding.                  This vision constitutes what Hawking/Mlodinow identify as \\"M-theory,\\" which stands for the idea of multiple universes (or a \\"multiverse.\\")     The authors make interesting and provocative claims, such as: \\"the universe does not have just a single existence or history, but rather every possible version of the universe exists simultaneously in what is called a quantum superposition.\\"  And this \\"has passed every experimental text to which ithas ever been subjected.\\"     What I get out of this is that just about anything is possible somewhere in the universe or somewhere in the multiverse, because different sets of laws would pertain, depending on where you were (if, in fact, you could exist at all).  What is certain, however, is that the reality of God is unnecessary to explain any of this.     I'll concede that the authors unfold in entertaining fashion a vision of \\"how\\" things came to be, but I am not at all convinced that they have handled the \\"why\\" questions very well at all (\\"why is there something rather than nothing,\\" \\"why are we here?\\")  What I did notice is that along the way, Hawking/Mlodinow resort (rather typically, in discussions of this sort) to rather unscientific concepts, like \\"luck,\\" \\"lucky,\\" and \\"good fortune\\" when addressing the apparent \\"fine-tuning\\" of our universe to the support of intelligent, carbon-based life.  We've seen all that before, from lesser minds than Hawking's.  But where does it all come from in the first place?  Hawking's and Mlodinow's answer is Gravity, which seems to be an ultimate, eternally existing reality that allows something to proceed from nothing.  That Gravity is a \\"something,\\" however, seems to be skipped over, and \\"why\\" there should be that power is not explained.  It is the given law, eternally and absolutely existing. \\"Because there is a law like gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.  Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist.\\"       But this is not the sense in which human beings ask these existential questions, which come from meditation on the human condition.  This rootedness of the \\"why\\" question provides the context for the significance of the question in the first place, but the authors seem not to recognize or even realize this.  The authors here smuggle a \\"how\\" in as an explanation of a \\"why\\" question, all the time rather arrogantly declaring that \\"philosophy is dead.\\" Their final shot at this is to say that \\"we human beings . . . are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature.\\"  But we already have that from Bertrand Russell and Jacques Monod, et. al.  It's just that now, with The Grand Design, we get it with less pathos, accompanied rather by some amusing cartoons, colorful pictures, and some very flat attempts at humor in the narrative.

0553386816|5.0|I picked up this book about a month ago from an airport bookstore, eager to settle into the latest Grisham novel. Alas, my eyes missed the \\"Stories\\" in much smaller print beneath \\"Ford County\\", so I was slightly shocked to find that I held in my hands Grisham's first short story collection. I'm not quite sure I would have picked it up if I had known this in the first place.     After plodding through the first story, enduring its subtle humor, I resigned myself to the ordeal of finishing the rest of the book. (No way would I allow my money go to waste). Before long, however, my perseverance was rewarded. As I moved from one story to the other, I was treated to the best of Grisham. The stories were captivating. One, even while retaining some humor, moved me to tears and had me choking on them for a while. Others were gripping and refreshingly off Grisham's well worn law thriller path. Each story was excellently crafted.    When I put down the book later that day, I had to agree with one reviewer who said that this book, perhaps, is Grisham's finest work. And I wish it were longer. It ended way too soon!

B001HN6940|3.0|This movie is an interesting blend of excellent professionalism in production and acting along with a very personal interpretation of the Wonderland venue. The execution of the component parts of the film are all first class and very competent; it's just the overall result is rather grim and excessive.<br /><br />Johnny Depp does his usual remarkable job of being strange; his versatility continues to amaze me as he shifts roles and appearances like a real pro from film to film. The sound and video quality on the Blu-ray version left nothing to be desired.<br /><br />As one reviewer pointed out this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland; the first one was initially forgotten by Alice but comes back to her toward the end of the movie where she begins to remember bits and pieces of her first trip.<br /><br />I watched this movie as a rental and I'm glad I did; I will probably never seek it out to watch it again. Although it's rated PG I would caution parents of small children about the threatening and rather dark ambience of the film.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of this movie may likely depend on the extent of your enthusiasm for Tim Burton's style of directing; if you are a fan you will probably love this movie. If you're not sure whether you're a fan or not, rent it first.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|I found this adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion included an interesting take on Ann Elliot played by Sally Hawkins.  Physically, she is the plainer of the three sisters but obviously the smartest.  The two incidents where the characters rely on her for medical help (her nephew falling out of the tree and at Louisa's fall from the causeway in Lyme)suggest that in another time, this woman would have gone to medical school and been quite happy as a local rural physician.  Happily, the costume designer has Elizabeth Elliot in wonderfully awful wigs and Mary Musgrove is played as a person on the cusp of a nervous breakdown, so the beauty of sensibility and sanity shine through Hawkins' Ann Elliot.  I also thought the captains' stolen glances of Ann added another element of desire and made one want him to do something other than what he does which is to hurt Ann.  Well scripted, high production values.  Another BBC gem.

B002M2T1UO|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3R9XA5UNQBC3F]]Just wanted to make a quick video to show what it looks like.    Rated it 4 stars because of the way the discs are a little difficult to remove in the dvd book, but the series is 5 stars and the best show I've ever watched.    All episodes are widescreen which is different than if you bought them separately which has it in full screen, which will take me getting used to.    Although a little tricky to remove from the sleeve, each disc is protected by the white insert, so its not as prone to scratching as the other reviews said when there was no protection for the disc.    If you don't mind every episode in widescreen then it is worth it to buy this complete series booklet since they fixed the disc scratching problem for the most part.

It is so full of weak writing I almost called up Mr. Sanderson to beg him to use a thesaurus or, alternatively, to have his publisher drop him from their repitoire.  The dialogue was laughable.  Period.  The characters are flat with development only by cliche; their only reaction to any emotional stimuli was to roll their eyes.<br /><br />And they rolled their eyes quite a bit.<br /><br />I simply cannot believe so people recommend this book.  If this review keeps just one person from wasting money, and more importantly, their time, on this book my life will have been a success.<br /><br />I did not finish this book, but I know how should have ended: his editor should be fired.

With professionalism, expertise, patience, and sensitivity, these photographs capture a spirituality of these gorgeous creatures, every single one.  How lucky we are!  This photographic experience is transporting.  The decisive moment.  Thank you, Nick Brandt!  Let us hope that these beautiful creatures will long remain.

030745455X|5.0|Amazon had a better price on the book than other vendors I checked with, including Costco.  Free Shipping makes it even better.<br />The story line in Stieg Larsson's 2nd book in the series, moves quickly and is very engrossing.  You will not want to put it down.  It is a shame that the world has lost such a good novelist just after he puts out three best sellers!  I also learned a great deal about Sweden.<br />Good read.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|I have purchased about one thousand dollars woth of earbuds since purchasing my ipod four years ago. I strictly use earbuds and while they are great for on the go daily use, every earbud i have purchased has always left something to be desired. Recently i purchased the senn IE8 in ear monitors. For any audiophiles out there you know these are suppose to be top of the line and for $425 I was expecting to be floored. To my surprise they did not floor me! Remember my point of reference is a windows in line computer jack and a ipod classic 30gb, so the best components i do not have. Purchased the E5 as a joke as I hope this $22 \\"snake oil\\" amp makes these headphones sound better. Got the amp today and i must say that I had no Idea my ipod and computer could sound this loud and clear. Its so loud now that I could possibly loose my hearing if im not carefully. There is a audible hiss in very soft passages in music and when switching between songs however for the 3x the power im getting to my earbuds i see it as a far trade off!

6302642175|4.0|It is nice to look back at your old pictures or revisit where you have been. Every time I see the poster of Disney's sci-fi action film \\"Tron,\\" I remember the \\"light cycle game\\" I enjoyed in the video arcade in the 1980s. The digital world of \\"Tron\\" looked very cool back then, with its \\"Metropolis\\"-like costume designs (nominated for Oscar), and even now the film has imagination and creative ideas. After all this is a film Roger Ebert gave four stars (out of four).    But let's face it. Some people say the visuals of \\"Tron\\" look dated. Of course they are because it was made about 30 years ago. The real problem of the film is not that part, however. It is the pace of the film that really damages the otherwise excellent film. Director Steven Lisberger's storytelling lacks momentum and clarity especially toward the climax that could have been more exciting.     There is not enough interaction between characters including the hero of justice \\"Tron\\" (actually a computer program) played by Bruce Boxleitner, and \\"Yori\\" by Cindy Morgan. David Warner playing multiple roles is effective, but his \\"villain(s)\\" isn't as strong a menace as he should. We need a Darth Vader or Grand Moff Tarkin at least.    Of more interest to me is Jeff Bridges, who plays Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer (called a \\"user\\" here) trapped in the world of computer. He is humorous, young, and looks a bit like Matthew Maconahay, but with the same voice of the great actor who went on to win much deserved Oscar 28 years later. It's nice to see him in this unique sci-fi film with its sequel coming out soon.

B0019NB9A2|5.0|If you already have a DVD of \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" should you buy the Blu-ray version?    I have watched the DVD version of this many times; it is the \\"50th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition.\\"  I consider its picture quality as excellent (4).    The picture quality for the Blu-ray version is the same.  When watching it, there were moments when I thought it might show a tiny bit more detail.  To make this an objective evaluation of its resolution versus the older DVD version, I picked out two scenes with difficult-to-resolve detail.    In Dr. Morbius's study there is a blackboard.  Upon it he has chalked a diagram of the enigmatic pointed arches, Einstein's famous energy equation, other equations with possibly alien mathematical operators and symbols, and a drawing of the celestial sphere marking altitude and azimuth of something.  On this last item, there is a word written in capitol letters:  on the DVD, it is unreadable;  on the Blu-ray, it reads, \\"EQUINOCTIAL\\".    In the chamber with the plastic educator, there are several blue panels in the distant background behind the educator.  In the scene where Doc Ostrow is seated at the educator:  on the DVD, the panels have no detail;  on the Blu-ray, the panels are perforated like a pegboard.    If you want the best possible resolution, then this Blu-ray is it; however, since the differences are so minute, I suspect most will be satisfied with their DVD version.    Overall, this movie is outstanding (5).  Its story has mystery and an ample supply of wonder.  Visually, the scenes on the surface of Altair-4 are believably alien.  And once you have heard the eerie soundtrack; you will never forget it.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I bought this CD on the basis of one song. The Kill.  I was hoping it would not be the only song worth listening to on the CD, and I was not disappointed.  The music is dark, brooding and stirs your soul.  I found the majority of the songs as compelling as The Kill, and ended up with a new favourite - A Modern Myth.  I love the fact that each song has its own individual flavour, not the typical similar sound from song to song that one can usually expect from an artist.  The music is rich and engaging, and as a writer, I found it very inspirational.  Certainly music to dream by...
1931559317|5.0|Although very new to astronomy, I am somewhat familiar with how technically daunting some guides can be. I was pleasantly surprised with this book.    Now to be certain it takes a little looking through it to get aquainted with it, but once one understands the format and how it's arranged it's really a nice guide for exploring the night sky.    What I like about it is that rather than the whole sky, as usually shown in guides like these, it is broken down first by time of the year, time of the night and then it's charts are sectionalized in a very easy to follow format that allows you to focus on the area of the sky you're exploring with detailed indications of stars, double stars, clusters, nebulae, Messier objects, etc.as well as what adjacent maps to go to for further expanded views.    I am very pleased with this guide and would highly recommend it to anyone starting out in astronomy.

B0040QYROA|5.0|Have not seen this yet, but am eagerly anticipating it.  I do own the previous restored DVD of METROPOLIS put out by Kino, and that one was excellent (by what I read, I will probably hold on to that one for the excellent special features).<br /><br />Now if only someone would give the same treatment (please, please, Kino...?) to the 1925 silent classic THE LOST WORLD, a film that has been similarly gutted of much of its original footage, and has only been seen as a shadow of its original running time. While the Image Entertainment DVD released in 2001 [[[ASIN:B00005ABVF The Lost World (Restored Edition)]]] is an improvement over previously-available versions, much of the original footage is still missing. I understand there are several individuals who have been involved in a quest to gather fragments of unseen footage from that film for the last 15 or 20 years, and while the complete version may never be reconstructed, it seems for a landmark film that was so influential in the history of cinema, little attention has been given to presenting the public with a deluxe treatment of this important film. While it's true that you can't find what no longer exists, it seems to me greater efforts need to be made along these lines, and soon, as the self-destruction of film stock from this era is inevitable (it's like a ticking time-bomb).<br /><br />Much effort has been devoted to seeking out better and more complete prints of the films of Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, Louis Feuillade, Georges Melies, and others, but I can't understand the seeming lack of interest towards THE LOST WORLD.
B000P12LWY|5.0|My wife and I started watching the Tudors during the last part of the final season. We enjoyed the episodes so we decided to purchase the first season from Amazon. After watching about two or three episodes of The Tudors first season we were so hooked, we ordered the second, third and fourth seasons, too. Our biggest problem now is trying to limit ourselves to one episode per night. What an excellent series. We could not recommend it more favorably! Be advised, if you are hearing impaired, there are no subtitles.

0375842209|5.0|This book was one of several books on my 14-year old grandson's summer reading list. Though I had heard of The Book Thief before, I hadn't read it. I bought two copies, one for him and one for me to read so we could discuss it together. He didn't finish it - I think its a little overwhelming for that age, unless they are reaaly bright and into reading.       Once I started it, I was captivated by the writing and the portrayals of the characters.  I only took me about 5 days to read it, and I began sneaking a few pages in whenever I could.  I have actually begun rereading it to absorb some details I may have missed in the first read.         It gives you insight into the plight of average German citizens in the WWII era (similar book \\"For Those Who Save Us\\" by Jenna Blum).  It still amazes me, however, that regular people like you and me could have accepted being told that the Jews were inferior! It's scary actually.         It is incredibly thought-provoking and being narrated by 'Death' gave it a unique twist. The book is so worth reading as you will think about its message and characters long after you finish that last page.       Hope this is helpful.

3257229534|5.0|I saw the second part of the film \\"the reader\\" on television while doing some channel hopping and got stuck in the absorbing story.  I decided to read the book in the original German, in stead of watching the beginning of the film (the part that I have missed) on the following day.  I was also eager to know whether I would be able to understand the German text, as it is my third language and I have not used it for a long time.  So I ordered the book from Amazon and it arrived a week or so later in perfect condition. (The outside box was, however, secured by the SA post office authorities, as it was found open and damaged. Fortunately the book was securely packaged inside the box.)    I found the first part easy to read and could not put it down. I was fascinated by the boy's behaviour. I tried to understand Hannah's reasons for behaving the way she did. I enjoyed the part where they traveled by train for their holiday. It was such an impossible situation and yet the author made one believe it is perfectly normal. In the end I was sad for the way life often turns out.     I also became quite interested in the philosophical undercurrent in this book - it adds to the value of the novel - not merely a simple story.  (this part was more difficult to read, however.)    It was a good experience to read the book. In fact, I do not think I want to see the first part of the film any more.

I don't understand the griping I've read here in other reviews. I will be listening to this disk for a long time to come.

B002WY65W4|5.0|If Shaun of the Dead showed us how ridiculous a zombie apocalypse would be, Zomebiland shows us how fun a zombie apocalypse would be.<br /><br />  Zombieland has more to do about four people finding a family than fighting zombies It's about how people learn to trust each other. Even before the zombie outbreak occurred the characters were damaged. Columbus didn't have a family that was worth a darn. Talahasee had lost his kid. There's not too much backstory given for Wichita and Little Rock. We can only assume from their grifter ways before the zombie plague showed up that they did not have an idealic life.<br /><br /> That's one thing different about Zombieland compared to other zombie movie-We never know their names, only where they come from or where they are going ( except for Wichita, who reveals her name at the end of the film. You'll have to see the movie to find out what her real name is because I'm not telling). Names are connections to things and places and people. So, it makes sense that in a land full of zombies getting attached to someone that may end up as an hors d'oeuvres doesn't make too much sense.<br /><br /> Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Columbus, is right at home playing the nerdy-insecure-sensitive-guy. It's a role that we have seen him play before (Adventureland, The Hunting Party). In fact, it's the only type of character that he has played and he excels at it.  This isn't a knock on Eisenberg. Some actors have the range to play a wide variety of characters, like Viggo Mortensen, while other actors have a limited range. Eisenberg happens to fall into the last category. He is a talented actor, no doubt about that, but he can only play one type of character. He's so good that Michael Cera (Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist, Super Bad), who plays the same kind of characters as Eisenberg, had better be looking over his shoulder.  He might have had the market cornered on these roles in the past, but it won't be too long before he is going to have to audition against Eisenberg.<br /><br /> I've been a Woody Harrelson fan since Cheers. I can't recall a film that he has been in that I have not enjoyed to some degree or another ( Maybe Surfer, Dude really did stink, but I chalk it up to everyone on that movie being so high they didn't know it stunk). In Zombieland, Harrelson doesn't fail to deliver. He's believable when he is being serious and even when he is spazzing out, like he does when the group makes it to Bill Murray's mansion.<br /><br /> But, what's up with the way he sounds lately? For some reason he sounds like he has something stuffed in his mouth. Doe he have cotton balls stuffed in there? Is he chewing on tobacco constantly? I've been to Tallahassee. I know people that are from Florida and none of them sound like they have a sock stuffed in their mouths.<br /><br /> Emma Stone (The House Bunny, Super Bad) tries to play Wichita as a bad @ss chick. The kind of person who doesn't need anyone (Well, other than her little sister. Come on, all tough guys and girls are softies when it comes to the younger siblings) or anything. She's an island unto herself. Unfortunately, Stone can't pull it off. She comes off more annoying than anything else. She becomes more believable when she eventual drops the bad mofo.<br /><br /> Abigail Breslin is...well...cute in Zombieland. She's a kid. Kids are cute. What else can I say?<br /><br /> There are a  few things in Zombieland that we don't see in other zombie films that separate it from the pack. One of theses things are the rules. The rules, such as Always Wear a Seatbelt, are the creation of Columbus. It's how he has stayed alive for so long. I don't know what the other characters did to stay alive, but whatever it was it worked; they're just as alive as Columbus. The rules are displayed on the screen to remind us which ones have been violated and which one have not. There are about 10 or 12 rules in the film (you can find 32 rules the movies website) that are incorporated into the film. It's fun to watch even if the writers blatantly ripped off The Zombie Survival Handbook by Max Brooks. Another fun element is the zombie kill of the week. It's a funny little edition even if we only hear about it once or twice in the movie. It's good for a laugh.<br /><br /> The pacing of the film hits a serious speed bump when Bill Murray, playing himself (naturally!), is introduced into the film. I'm just as big of a fan of Murray as the next person, but introducing him into the movie was pointless. It was enough, if not cheesy, to know that they were staying in Murray's mansion. We didn't actually have to see Murray. It doesn't add anything to the film. Introducing Murray into the film added a layer of cheese to the movie that wasn't there before. There's good cheese (watch The Army of Darkness ) and then there is bad cheese. Bringing Murray into the movie was bad cheese. Fortunately, Murray is not in the film for very long. Columbus shoots him dead thinking that he's a zombie. It seems that dressing up as a zombie is not the smartest thing to do during a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br /> Even with a few hiccups here and there Zombieland is worth your time.atantly ripped off The Zombie Survival Handbook by Max Brooks.

B0002KVULG|3.0|Here we have another bag of reviews where we have to separate out the VHS reviews and the DVDs. I had the VHS and enjoyed the magnificent cinematography as much as the adaptation and stellar performances. In the DVD, you will be watching it in black and white. I do not understand why, in 2002, they could not capture the color. It reminds me of what they did to a fairly recent release of Pride and Prejudice: totally washed out. Since I foolishly tossed my vhs's to replace them with dvds, I am now left to search the secondary market for the VHS.<br />This film, based on a play, shows a romantic, erotic, love story while still keeping to the general theme of the the classic vampire genre.<br />. In the novel, the Count is loathsome;in this film he is the supreme seducer -- handsome,intriguing,and very, very sexy. The ambivalent ending will satisfy almost everyone, those who see him transformed to escape, those who feel sadness for the lost man, and even those who feel, after an incredible lovemaking scene, that he lives on through Lucy and their unborn child!<br />I hope someone will wake up and issue a remake of the film. What a travesty the dvd is.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Most of the critics hated this movie. A lot of audiences hated this movie. I have no idea why. The combination of Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett could make paint drying fascinating. There is not a poor acting job in this film, the script was solid, the story was compelling and it was directed well. Seriously, what more do you want?? Go into the movie with a willing suspension of disbelief and don't compare it with any movie you've seen before about Robin Hood because that's not what this movie is and you will enjoy it. I think we have all just seen to many movies that we forget how to enjoy the ones with merit without being groundbreaking. Ridley Scott's vision for Robin Hood is well-executed, well-acted, and well-directed. Enjoy it while knowing it's not going to change your life.

Rebecca Skloot did an amazing job of making sense of technical, scientific language while capturing the feelings and emotions of the family of Henrietta Lacks.  She told a story that everyone should know.  We need to better educate ourselves about science, medicine and technology.  This book opened my eyes to how what is happening behind the scenes in medicine--the whole research process, and how we can be unknowing guinea pigs!  Skloot also made Henrietta Lacks a real person.  Without ever meeting her, Skloot was able to capture the essence of one of the most important people in the medical, scientific community!  Again I say, A MUST READ!

I have yet to buy the Berlin trilogy, but I have high expectations.    This is most definitely my favorite Bowie album.  His style of songwriting truly shines here, and the piano embellishments by Rick Wakeman add even more.  Overall, a classic, you cannot go wrong with this one.

Meanwhile, the separate editions of Calvin and Hobbes, in various formats, are easier to enjoy with comic strip irreverence.

1897299214|4.0|Drawing on his experiences while in North Korea the author has created a book that really gets a feel for what it's like in the last of the hard-core communist states. Things that wouldn't have raised an eyebrow in the days of the USSR stand out in this 21st century throwback of a failed economic model. The illustration is not overly realistic yet conveys a sense of place, including many of the landmarks of Pyongyang. Proof that you can find humor even in a giant labor camp (\\"those are volunteers, right?\\").
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Lost my origional copy was glad to see it at a affordable price ,got it just like described!
0553805371|3.0|Disappointing.  I read the book in just a few hours - it is definitely lightweight reading.  Most of the book is, as others have noted, a review of introductory modern physics, but not with much depth.  I too was stunned at the ending which sort of pulled a rabbit out of a hat with \\"Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.\\"  It may well be that M-theory leads to that, but I didn't feel prepared at all for that leap.  The missing preparation is the book's problem for me.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|I remember hearing this recording on lp my parents had the mono version i used to listen to Born to Lose i couldnt get enough of that song.The cd version has Modern Sounds in Country & Western Music 1 & 2 together and it doesnt let up.From song one till the last one Ray Charles poured his heart and soul doing this music.This a classic for all time very highly reccommended to all people i miss Ray more when i hear this he was a one of a kind for sure.
B0034G4OU4|3.0|My friend Pati read this book and was bowled away by it, so when my friend Madeleine decided she wanted to see the movie I willingly agreed.  After seeing it, my impression of the movie's message is that \\"the meaning of life is guys.\\"  Wow, what a concept.<br /><br />The heroine started out the film with a perfectly nice guy, went through a mid-life crisis and dumped him to eat her way through Italy, meditate and scrub floors in India, and find another guy in Bali.  She just came full circle.  It seemed to me she'd have saved herself a whole lot of money--let alone scrubwoman's hands--by simply staying with the first guy.  Oh well, what do I know?<br /><br />It's not that I didn't understand where she was at; God knows I've done my own world travelling trying to find happiness and meaning, and I've done my own fair share of soul searching in the process.  Heaven knows I've certainly tried finding the meaning of life in one guy or another, but the truth is, there is no meaning of life beyond what you yourself give it.  If guys are your thing, then guys it is.<br /><br />The fairy princess notion, however, that guys are the \\"meaning\\" of it all places a huge burden on them, and it's one that no human being can or even should attempt.  It's doomed to failure from the outset, which is probably why so many marriages collapse.  The whole notion of \\"happily ever after\\" in which people, especially female people, are encouraged to believe is very unstable.  That happy couple in the wedding photo will probably be the grumpy pair arguing over breakfast about some trivial difference of opinion.  Our society's answer to the disappointment is to discard one relationship for another that will be \\"better\\" than the last.  In the end marriage becomes \\"all about me.\\"  While this makes big bucks for the billion dollar wedding industry, I doubt it does anything for anyone else.  It certainly doesn't help the children sometimes caught up in the discord.<br /><br />The most important thing that people need to remember is that romance novels rarely have sequels that feature the same lovers.  This is a telling detail.  Once the \\"happily ever after\\" arises out of the turmoil of frustrated love, the lovers cease to exist for us.  After all, did the movie go on to tell us all about the boring details of the lives of the new \\"happy couple?\\"  Nope.  Unfortunately it's the boring details that constitute most of life.  The couple may cease to be lovers, but they don't \\"go on\\" as they were before.  Either their relationship matures, or it doesn't and they're both back where they started again.<br /><br />The most important things I learned in my own odyssey were about me.  I'm still learning them, too, because like most people, I don't really think I need to change.  I just know you can't run away from yourself.  You're always there, where ever it is you go, and you need to learn to live with the person you are no matter where you are!  As the heroine says midway through the movie, \\"Ruins are life's way of teaching us something.\\"  Yup, it's \\"live with it!\\"<br /><br />By the end of the film I felt like the producers had foisted off another romance movie on me.  I felt that they said, \\"Yup. It's all true; all you need to do is find the \\"right guy,\\" and you'll live happily ever after. And that's the meaning of life.\\"  How sneaky.er is that romance novels rarely have sequels that feature the same lovers.  This is a telling detail.

B000YAA68W|5.0|viewed this for the first time in a Lit. class in college, and actually fell in love with it... came home and looked all over the internet for it until i finally found it here (i had forgotten the actual name!). Very interesting story, but what got me was the fantastic animation! It was interesting to see animation used to tell an mature and adult story. Very good for any Lit. class, Creative Writing course, Art course, or even History class! i hope to use this in my own classroom. Great film!
B00408AN5A|5.0|This is the first time I am writing a review and I read a lot!!!. Do yourself a favor and buy this book....is amaizing, it will change your life. Dont wait, BUY IT!!!
B001K98MFA|1.0|In the Amazon discription , it says english audio ... so where the heck is it ? I know the history behind the film , but you'd think by know there wpould be an english version by now.<br /><br />If you hate sub titles , avoid this dvd . Amazon didn't list it right !
B000MV8AE0|1.0|I would have rated this movie zero if this possibility had been offered. This film is an insult to the memory of Beethoven, man and genius. The historical inaccuracies are too many to name, so here are just a few:    * Depicting Beethoven as a brute. Beethoven certainly had a strong personality. He refused to be treated as a servant and therefore did not adhere to the mores of the time which expected musicians to have their meals with servants or to enter homes through the back door. He also suffered from constant stomach complaints and pain, apart from the distress of losing his hearing. He had a difficult childhood and family problems. He did not find lasting love. All these issues had some influence on his personality. But he behaved according to the norms of civility of the time. He would never have reacted as shown in this biopic (shattering a bridge model or \\"mooning\\")    * The character of the female copyist is completely fictional. There was no female copyist, let alone one who would alter Beethoven's scores, or who would be treated in such a way by the composer.    Films are works of art in their own right and, true, they may not adhere to reality. But when the name of a great man is used to lure audiencies to the cinemas, a depiction of real events is to be expected. Agnieszka, please, create a fictional composer and make a film about him, but don't drag Beethoven's name through the mud.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I love Dexter. It's become my favorite show. Even though I hate Rita and Deb Morgan is the most annoying on the show. I think I don't like her because the actress that plays her is not very good. This is definitely the best Dexter season so far. And he has a awesome adivisary in Lithgow. Lithgow is simply amazing in this show. Although the season gets sidetracked with silly relationships of the supporting cast. It's still pretty bloody. Warning though. The first couple episodes are exhausting to watch.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Contrary to what it may sound like, \\"My Fair Lady\\" is not one of those girly romantic musicals (not that there is anything wrong with that), but is very very funny with some hilarious acting and singing and an overall good plot. I got the two disc special edition and would highly recommend it. I watched the documentary on how the film was restored as well as on the history of the movie, and would say it adds alot to the overall experience. this movie is worth 5 stars all the way
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom and the boys take their music in a new direction, but everything evolves to some point...  I previewed it on Amazon before buying and liked what I samples enough to buy it.  The more I listened to it the more it grew on me.  I really like their older stuff so I was a little skeptical at first.  Some folks may hate it.  Those with an open mind will probably like it.  I listen to a very diverse spectrum of music: All types of blues & jazz, classic rock, metal, some reggae so I'm not vested in only one genre.
B0029DKK4M|4.0|The book is a series of letters, so you don't have to worry about carving out large spaces of time to read a whole chapter. You can easily get through the next letter in 3 minutes or less; but you probably won't want to put the book down in that short of a time. Annie Barrows has created a thoroughly readable novel with lots of references to classic English literature (and even Catullus!) It's a perfect book club selection for those interested in WWII and/or English history from the 1940s.

B0039UTDA6|5.0|This is an amazing series. Perfect for kids and, although I may not learn as much as I would with the Attenborough version, I still learned more than I could effectively remember. Besides, Oprah's \\"ooh, here comes the fox\\" and other \\"dumbed down\\" sentences (as some reviewers claim) are perfect to catch my kids' attention and are enough explanation.  5 stars!  BBC Rocks.

B000W1758C|5.0|Been a KISS fan most of my life, and for those who bag on this for not having Peter and Ace, so did the majority of KISS albums.  It's not Gene's and Paul's fault that Ace and Peter are such screw ups and can't play to the level they once did.  Great songs, but I can't stand the slow ballads.  Great tour as well.
B002LZDSVU|5.0|SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) is a pure delight!<br />All of its songs were composed by that prolific team of Arthur Freed and Nacio Brown, and not just the few sung by the main characters. There's references here to dozens of familiar tunes written by these talented men back in the 1920s and '30s.<br /><br />Kudos to Jean Hagen, who is simply remarkable as the always repulsive, forever screechy Lina Lamont. The character is based on Norma and Constance Talmadge-- Their star-rank careers came to a sudden end with the advent of talkies because both had heavy Brooklyn accents and unpleasant voices.<br /><br />A description here of the movie's most famous sequence, \\"Broadway Melody.\\"<br /><br />In this extended number, the new-to-New York Gene Kelly enters briskly from stage left. He wears a straw hat, striped jacket and black frame glasses and carries a valise as he gaily calls out the opening phrase, \\"Gotta dance!\\" Kelly is then ushered into a fast-paced NY world. He quickly rises from burlesque clown to baggy pants vaudevillian to a tuxedoed gent in the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Kelly becomes infatuated with the beautiful girlfriend of a gangster (Cyd Charisse in a stunning green gown) and the two perform an elegant fantasy ballet. From here it's all downhill. The small town boy ends up as he started: on the street. Although now clad in a fine suit of evening clothes, the enthusiasm is gone-- he looks mournful.<br /><br />At that moment, another new arrival strides rapidly from stage left. He's dressed just as Gene was when he came to Broadway and he sings out the same \\"Gotta dance!\\" Gene's spirits revive. He happily calls back and the production ends on a high note.<br /><br />The entire story is most entertaining and like all great films, it holds up well. The above sequence is nothing less than stunning and if you've never seen it before, you are in for the rarest of treats. Highest recommendation to Comden & Green's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.<br /><br />Also recommended--<br />The \\"American in Paris\\" suite from the [[ASIN:B001BHI0JE 1951 Gene Kelly/MGM musical of the same name]] may just be the most beautiful ever committed to film.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.4) Singin' in the Rain (1952) - Gene Kelly/Donald O'Connor/Debbie Reynolds/Jean Hagen/Millard Mitchell/Cyd Charisse/Douglas Fowley/Rita Moreno (uncredited: King Donovan/William Schallert/'Snub' Pollard)HI0JE 1951 Gene Kelly/MGM musical of the same name]] may just be the most beautiful ever committed to film.

0452295548|5.0|What are the chances of a Harvard-trained brain scientist experiencing a massive stroke in the left side of her brain and making a recovery to tell (and write about) her story?  Although all strokes are unique, Jill Bolte Taylor's eight-year struggle to gain normal brain functioning again appears to be similarly traumatic.  This is not a manual to care for a stroke victim, but it does have some suggestions and -- in her opinion -- helpful hints.<br /><br />In addition, this books goes into the incredible dichotomy of the two hemispheres of the brain -- via her recovery.  Jill Bolte Taylor lost an incredible portion of her left-brain due to the stroke leaving only her right-brain functioning.  What she describes borders on a spiritual experience.  In fact, her 'feeling of oneness w/ the universe' is strikingly similar to what experienced meditators or Buddhist monks might describe their non-dual states.  Holding her experience and her views lightly one will find this book fascinating and absolutely incredible.  However, if one is looking for a stroke recovery manual or is completely turned off by any spiritual language, look elsewhere.<br /><br />For an 18-min primer, you can check out her TED talk:<br />[...]
0307592839|4.0|Filled with interesting and flawed characters, sympathetically portrayed, Goon Squad does not have the arc of a novel.  This can't be considered a failure on Ms. Egan's part, but it left me a bit dissatisfied and feeling a little duped.  This book is more a group of interconnected short stories than a novel.  But of course, stories do not sell as well as novels, so it has been marketed as a novel.    In a few stories, closure is provided by quick summaries of what would happen to a character over the next 20 or so years.  I presume the goal here is to satisfy the reader's need to know.  But I found these truncations somewhat annoying, because they seemed too pat and easy.  So at 28 he killed himself.  Why?  Did his father's dominant personality crush him?  Perhaps he was a disappointment?  How could that be? He seemed so wise at 13.    That said, the stories are for the most part elegantly constructed with surprising twists and sly wisdom.  And the major characters are people who made the time I spent with them worthwhile.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I own an obscene number of dog training books. This is the one I recommend to everyone!<br />Clear, concise and well written, it's a must have for everyone with a dog!
0374531269|1.0|The reviews fooled me into thinking this was a great read. The story is obviously very moving, the hardship and adversity of children and women in a war struck zone where very little hope remains is almost hard to believe in the 21st century. Nonetheless, as the story unfolds, you start to realize how poorly this book was written.    The author tells the story in a very lackluster way and clearly has no creative writing skills whatsoever (which renders the content contrived and complicated). While reading it I was often baffled by its repetitiveness and actually skimmed the previous pages to figure out whether I had already read them. I simply couldn't finish the book because I felt like it did horrible injustice to a story which could have been told beautifully.
0061537934|2.0|This book just made me cringe.  I read it for a book club, about 2 weeks after my own dog died, and I thought I would have trouble reading it because it's for \\"dog lovers.\\"  I am certainly a dog lover, but I'm also a book lover, and this book was outright painful to read.  It is merely a mediocre story.  The gimmick as you know is that it's from a dog's perspective, but unless you like reading such trite statements as \\"I wagged my tail and licked his hand,\\" you'll be groaning.  If you love dogs, sure, give it a read.  But if you actually like books, skip this one.  The only saving grace is that the pacing is rapid, chapters are short and concise (think Dan Brown) and the book was thankfully finished in about 4 hours.

1400052173|5.0|This is a remarkable book, and particularly relevant for those of us in the medical field.  I remember one of my professors telling me that where he trained, in order to treat patients, you had to first convince them that you weren't trying to kill them.  I understand that sentiment much more because of Skloot's book.  Henrietta's family and many like them grew up fearing that if you stayed out too late, the Hopkins would kidnap you and experiment on you--not the perspective of Johns Hopkins I had in training (especially because one of my best teachers trained with Dr. TeLinde), but understandable under the circumstances.  The story of Henrietta, her family, and their experience with medical care and the HeLa cells was eye-opening.    Skloot also brings up questions about medical research and informed consent.  I have conducted clinical and laboratory medical research and also participated in medical studies for extra money.  I found it heartbreaking that Deborah thought that she was being tested for cancer when in fact her blood was being collected to get more information about HeLa cells.  Skloot's book underscores the importance of providing patients understandable information about treatment and research, and provides an example in Cristoph Lengauer, who took the time to show Deborah and her brother their mother's cells and explained how the cells were used and the enormous contributions to medical science made through that use.       The White Hotel by D.M. Thomas reminded us that all of the victims of Babi Yar were individuals with a life and a story; Skloot's book reminds us that the same is true for all who participate in medical research.
B0039V8NJC|1.0|I am very disappointed. Have still not received this book. I complained once with no response. I gave it one star because the program does not allow one to give it no stars.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand is much deeper than its first episode would have you believe. Over the course of 2 days, I watched all 13 episodes. Like many others, after seeing the first episode I thought the show would be little more than an excuse for excessive violence and sex. I was wrong. Spartacus is so much more.        The story is incredible. It starts out very simple and easy to follow, but quickly evolves into something very complex. Every character is well-written and perfectly played by its respective actor. The characters are also incredibly dynamic, and by the end of the season, you will find yourself rooting for and caring about characters you never thought you would have (as well as hating the guts of some you initially liked). The visuals are well-done, the action is intense, and the nudity is plentiful. It can be gut-wrenching and downright disgusting at times. I've seen things on this show I've never seen in R-rated movies, so be warned if you have a weak stomach, or are easily offended by violence, sex, or coarse language. If you're not give Spartacus a try. Just be sure to watch the 2nd episode after you watch the first. From that point, you will likely be hooked.

B0036TGSR6|4.0|This movie was recommended to me by an anglophile colleague with an interest in British politics.<br /><br />My first reaction was to the miscasting of Kim Catrell who provides an unconvincing portrayal of a British aide with a foreign accent.<br /><br />Overall the movie held my interest with the viewer trying to pice together the clues before the revelations near the end.<br /><br />Anyone with any prior knowledge of parliamentarian protocols would understand the creative licenses utilized by the film makers permit the story to start. No stuffy civil servants or intelligence offices to scan the text for breaches of the official secrets act or divulge any policy decisions.<br /><br />The dramatization involving Ewan Macgreggor was excellent. His bedroom scene with the ex-PM's wife where he calmly removes his clothes and gets into bed with her before she suddenly pounces was comical but typically British.<br /><br />My greatest admiration comes for the British actor who portrays the stuck up Harvard professor with an excellent New England accent extremely well.<br /><br />The ending was really overdone. Like the RSC version of Romeo and Juliet which involved death by hypodermic, the death of the ghost writer at the end seemed stupid and pointless, not because you saw it coming but in the manner of it, highly improbable to say the least.<br /><br />Polanski sometimes overdoes his movies with too much music and in this case with too much overbearing dreary music, very much so in comparison with Gorky Park for instance.<br /><br />All in all, a reasonably good effort despite February looking like October.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I didn't know about Supernatural before April 2010.  I was in Germany with my daughter and her family for a vacation and got stuck there because of the Iclandic volcano.  We started with season one, which they had previously watched, but wanted to introduce me to.  Popcorn, grandchildren and fortunate to watch the entire season one and two before I finally got a flight home, I took their season three home with me.  When they finally arrived at my house inbetween stations (Air Force family), I had not only watched season three, but had bought season 4.  We all enjoyed season 4 again at my house and I just bought season 1-3 and 5 and can't wait to watch everything again, but am anxiously wanting season 5 immediately.  Jared and Jensen are awesome in their characters.  The writing is excellent and whoever puts it all together does a hell of a good job on the research.  Their entire team should be congratulated. I've read some of the other reviews and I think there are many more seasons ahead.  At least I am one fan who is really wanting this to not be over for a long time.  I give it a solid 5 stars and 1 out of 10,...definitely a 10.
B00008DDXL|2.0|I never received it!  I paid for it, and never got it in the mail.  So my issue is not with the movie but with the fact that I never got it!

B0015DROBO|4.0|The book is definitely worth reading.  The Swedish names contained therein are sometimes hard to pronounce, it was sometimes hard to keep track of the members of the Vanger family, and the first 35 - 40 percent of the book was rather slow.  But beside  that, it takes off somewhere near the middle of the book and was quite entertaining.  It wasn't the best book that I have ever read, but it was worth reading and I will read the following two in the series.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|There was a little bit of a delay but all in all it was worth the wait excellent condition and was just perfect.
0439023483|4.0|Before wrapping [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law, I read a few pages of it, and was instantly intrigued. However, the book is labeled on the shelf at Wal-Mart as for \\"Young Adults,\\" and as a 57-year-old man, I wondered if it could sustain my interest beyond those few pages. Phenomenal sales aren't necessarily an indication of anything, but I love dystopian fiction, and so I sprung for my own copy, thinking there might be something to it. Well, Collins managed to keep it constantly interesting, and I ripped through it. Considering the brutality of the setup, Collins was careful to limit her heroine's capacity to kill in the arena, framing it instead as an innocent extension of her survival instincts, while depicting the villains as relishing participation. By fleshing out her characters in this fashion, you had people you could root for and others you booed against.<br /><br />Collins begins with a few scenes from Katniss' life in the district, where the reader is supplied with a bit of history and descriptions of the current social strata. Participation in the annual games is mandatory according to a wealthy ruthless elite living in the splendorous Capitol. Contestants are picked from the oppressed and abject districts (a teen-aged boy and girl from each) by a ceremonial lottery, that's ballyhooed on television with lots of fanfare. The contestants are treated like stars, and the pampering and coiffing begin immediately during the train ride, which works also as a press junket, to the city. All of the contestants are formally introduced to the public in a live pageant, with grand entrances in sensational costumes. Once the games begin, the audience watches the event live via cameras placed throughout an arena of thick forest, streams, fields, a plateau, and so on. Over several days, as the games progress and some of the teenagers die, sponsors are lined up for their favorite contestants and bets are placed. Sponsors sometimes provide gifts that might help their favorite contestant, so a contestant has to be a bit savvy. The last contestant standing will return to his or her district relatively wealthy. Here's where conflict comes in for Katniss: The other contestant, Peeta, from her district is a boy she knew nearly all of her young life, and one who'd shown her compassion back home at a very desperate time. To avoid spoiling anymore surprises, I can sum it up by saying that Collins introduces a lot of cool stuff that had me turning the pages. There was a clever twist to the ending, resolving the central conflict in a rewarding way.<br /><br />There's not a lot of emotional subtlety here, but if you need more depth, there's a level of moral complexity that makes it a worthwhile read.

The last contestant standing will return to his or her district relatively wealthy. Here's where conflict comes in for Katniss: The other contestant, Peeta, from her district is a boy she knew nearly all of her young life, and one who'd shown her compassion back home at a very desperate time. To avoid spoiling anymore surprises, I can sum it up by saying that Collins introduces a lot of cool stuff that had me turning the pages. There was a clever twist to the ending, resolving the central conflict in a rewarding way.    There's not a lot of emotional subtlety here, but if you need more depth, there's a level of moral complexity that makes it a worthwhile read. But for the most part, this was a FUN read.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|Of all the Greek Classics I have studied, there is nothing that would point to this stupid re-make....The screen writers should be embarrassed by this shallow, idiotic film.
0307266303|5.0|Christopher McDougall's 'Born to Run' provides several fascinating insights on modern running. Up to eight out of ten distance runners suffer from injuries each year. Prompted by this knowledge and some personal injury problems, the author set out to find a reclusive tribe of ultra-long distance runners, the Tarahumara. Surprisingly, the Tarahumara don't get running-related injuries, despite running more and longer than almost everyone else. In 'Born to Run' McDougall tries to solve this apparent paradox by finding the Tarahumara in Mexico's remote Copper Canyon.    Along the way, we are introduced to an eclectic cast of ultra-runners, running coaches and scientists. McDougall has a great talent for putting the quirks of these characters to paper. Most of them are ultra-runners, used to running 100 miles or more in some of the worst conditions imaginable. Several of these races are used as a background for introducing the characters that ultimately come along for the Tarahumara expedition. Running such extreme distances certainly exposes one's soul and McDougall's accounts of the races are exciting and humorous at the same time. The main narrative of finding the Tarahumara really comes alive as a result. The side stories touch on equipment, nutrition and evolutionary aspects to explain what is wrong with modern running and how we can do better. These stories are extremely insightful and had some counterintuitive findings as well.     If you are even remotely interested in distance running, this book is highly recommended.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I always love Nora's books so I'm not at all surpirsed to have loved this one to.  And the end is great.  You can really tell that she is a dog person.  Love it!!!!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Some of you one and two star reviewers need a life, badly. The show was good for what it was, and season 6 definitely explained everything about the earlier smaller plots and side stories. And those crying about the cereal box toys this box set comes with, I would like to ask you, \\"WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GOING TO COME IN IT!\\" This box set is the type of thing a fan buys, watches one more time or so, than it sits on a self or in a closet; which is fine by me and I'm pretty sure plenty other fans  feel the same way.
0439023513|2.0|I loved the first two books. This one started of alright. About halfway through the book I started to realize that there wasn't enough book left to adequately wrap up the storyline. This got worse and worse the closer I got to the end. In my eyes, the storyline was no more resolved a few chapters from the end than it was at the begining of the book. The last few chapters seemed like they were thrown together in ten minutes. It was like the author found she had dug herself a hole too deep to write herself out of, so didn't even try. By the end, you barely know what happened, or why, and are sorely disappointed. This was nothing like the first two books; if I didn't know otherwise I wouldn't think it had been written by the same author.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was awesome and everything I was hoping it would be! I look forward to reading the next two books!
0307454541|3.0|I did like it, but I think there was too much hype around this book. It was entertaining, but \\"exceptional, unique and fascinating\\" as the reviews from the cover read? I'm not sure.<br />Although Lisbeth Salander is an amazing character, it didn't become a page turner for me until I had finished the first half of the book
B002N8A14M|5.0|Very nice, especially for the price.  It may not be a water proof type of protector, but I like being able to easily access the rotary control area.  I had others with plastic covers over the controls and that made it difficult to use.  This is easier. It's like getting 3 in 1.
0061808121|4.0|I won't comment or analyze the book itself, as countless others over the years have already said everything there is to say.  But I will say that this is an excellent audio edition.  Sissy Spacek narrates the book in a slow Southern drawl that enhances the story line and the characters.  Highly recommended
B001N26GFC|5.0|This movie made me smile, and sometimes laugh, not only as I watched it, but as I described it to others thereafter.  The basic plot revolved around the heroine's neverending good humor and optimism.  The British understand these kinds of movies, I believe.  Also I will say that friends of many ages and political persuasions have had similar positive experiences.
B000056HE9|5.0|The Bishop's Wife is by far, my all-time favorite Christmas story over all the others.  Love Cary Grant and David Niven in this movie. Also, the cab driver, Sylvester is a cute comic character.  I get chills when Dudley, the angel recites the bible passage. The story itself, explains the true meaning of Christmas, how we should cherish one another, and the only important Christmas gifts are those of the non-material variety. Two thumbs up!
0439023513|1.0|SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!              ....that's how I felt reading the last book to this fantastic Trilogy. Katniss is a whimper of her former self and spends most of it cooped up emotionally... constantly and pathetically arguing with herself almost every paragraph. The results of the war are all but written in the past tense, as if the real action was blocked from you and you were forced to watch the book through edited news clips. A huge contrast to before, where you felt like you were with Katniss on the field. All the characters were stiff and pathetic, especially the main characters. Truly a disappointing end to such a triumphant start.
0316098337|5.0|I heard a piece on NPR about \\"Room\\" yesterday, so I used my magic Amazon Prime and received the book this morning.  I just finished it.  I am writing this review now because I am trying to capture how different I feel after having read this book.  I feel like I am somewhere else, things look very different to me.  Much like Jack when he returns to Room and it is no longer familiar to him.  Using Jack's voice, Donoghue makes it not so hard to understand how something so horrific could become normal and safe to someone.  Everything is about context.  There are some mixed reviews on this book.  Regardless of how you feel after you read this book, you will feel something.  That is pretty spectacular in itself.
030745455X|4.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire is a fast read and starts out at an exciting pace. It follows The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and continues with the exploits of Lisbeth Salander and the other characters. Larsson weaves details of the first book into this one so that you pick up on the continuation but he does not make it obvious or boring. We learn more of Salander's history that was not revealed in the first book. This book contains humor, mystery, love story, crime, sex and a good plot. Like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it leaves you wanting more.
0439023513|3.0|[[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] was a very entertaining and engaging book.  I really anticipated the next installment, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire]], reading The Hunger Games again to make sure I remembered all the \\"whos\\" and \\"whats.\\"  Thank goodness that author Suzanne Collins wasn't going to take years to finish the trilogy!  And here it is...[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay]], the final book.  It is... underwhelming.<br /><br />In Mockingjay, Katniss Everdeen doesn't have to face the Hunger Games again.  Instead, however, life itself is a giant arena, and President Snow wants his revenge. However, Snow is killing people right and left, and not even the Capitol is safe, with nefarious \\"pods\\" full of all kinds of diabolical death traps scattered throughout the city.  Were the citizens of the Capitol never trusted?  Are the new rulers to be trusted as well?<br /><br />This story is darker, and bloodier, than the first two installments (and that's saying a lot!).  Katniss is front and center in this final book, but she questions her sanity.  I question her sanity as well!<br /><br />Civilization never becomes normalized in The Hunger Games trilogy.  If you were expecting it to, you will be disappointed.  If you were looking for more adventures in the Arena, you will be disappointed.  This final book is ready to be made into a X-Boxisque shoot'em-up game.  That's my prediction.
B0015DROBO|5.0|All three books in this series were outstanding.  It was hard to put any of them down ... I read all three within a month.  I recommend you do the same.
0553805371|2.0|I'm not even sure where to start on this book.. It certainly won't live up to the Hawing name...<br /><br />On philosophy, he takes many out of context. An example of this can be given on page 22, \\"Epicurus (341 BC-270 BC), for example, opposed atomism on the grounds that it is \\"better to follow the myths about the gods to become a 'slave' to the destiny of natural philosophers\\". Yes, Epicurus certainly says that; but, he was also a staunch materialist. He certainly didn't reject atomism -- he even created his own special kind. Again, on page 135, \\"Over the centuries many, including Aristotle, believed that the universe must have always existed in the order to avoid the issue of how it was up.\\" Aristotle believed God created the universe and set it into motion before retreating to self-contemplation. Above and beyond outright confusing statements, there are also many statements that are left without support, and kind of feel out of place. Claims that \\"[Pythagoras] did not discover the theorem that bears his name\\"  -- then who did and what is your point?<br /><br />There are plenty of rich illustrations that demonstrate nothing: such a Cathode Ray which is only talked about in so far as being the inspiration for J. J. Thomson's corpuscles; unexplained Ptolemaic Universe sculptures that look more like a Bohr's electron model; random scribble; and, even a butterfly. On top of that, the drawing pertaining to the texts are amazingly poor: straws in cups of liquids (showing the light refraction which has nothing to do with the message). The only genuinely good illustrations are the ones on Page 150, of Binary orbits and Eccentricities -- those are in fact very good and stick out for it. Keep in mind, I'm not attacking illustrations without reason: this book is only 181 pages, a solid 25 of them must be wasted on illustration and white space.<br /><br />The science explanations are also exceptionally poor. In the description of quantum mechanics it says at the bottom of Page 74: \\"That means that particles that would have landed in the area of the dark band if, say, only slit one was open, do not land there when slit two is open.\\" Why is that though? The whole purpose of the chapter is to tell is you can't predict where the particles will land. How do you then *know* where they won't land? And, on special relativity the jump from the example with the plane and the ball bouncing to the clocks is extremely nebulous. I fully understand one, and don't understand the other at all. It says on page 96, \\"Since speed is distance traveled divided by the time taken, this means that if they agree on the speed at which the pulse travels -- the speed of light -- they will not agree on the time interval between the emission and the reception.\\" I'm not sure why they would agree on the speed of light to begin with... If I was in a plane unknowingly going 10mph and you threw a ball going 9mph, I'd be inclined to say the speed was 1mph. I wouldn't agree that the speed was 10mph. Especially, if we're throwing out the idea of an objective observer.<br /><br />On speaking of Ptolemy's model being poor \\"it contains dozens of adjustable parameters whose values must fixed to match observations, rather than being determined by the theory itself\\". I'm just not sure I can conclude that M Theory or String Theory aren't fixed to match observations. It sounds like from the text they are.<br /><br />I'm not sure what this books domain is -- it is poor in history, does a poor job explaining the science, and does a poor job concluding you don't need God to explain the Universe. And, I say this as an Atheist that loves science texts. I don't understand relativity, Feynman Paths, or Feynman Diagrams, or Quantum Theory, or M Theory any better than when I purchased this book. That's sad. I just can't in good faith say this book is much good at anything.particles that would have landed in the area of the dark band if, say, only slit one was open, do not land there when slit two is open.\\" Why is that though?

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I can't say enough good about this game. My son got it for his 11 birthday and our entire family loves it. It is a fantastic strategy game. It takes a while to play but if you like board games you will be sucked into this one.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I'll start by saying that I grew up playing (and loving) Monopoly, Chess, and a slew of card games among other board/outdoors games that aren't similar to this game (Boggle, Scrabble, Taboo, Scattergories, jigsaw puzzles, etc.).  I definitely come from a game-playing family.  I see aspects of Monopoly and Chess melded into Settlers of Catan as one, cohesive and fantastic, board game.  Settlers of Catan is an awesome game for people who enjoy strategy and enjoy the suspense associated with not knowing who will win until the end!  (I still love Monopoly and Chess and hold them in high esteem.)<br /><br />Key Differences:<br /><br />MONOPOLY: It was always pretty easy to determine the winner well before the end of the game based on property holdings and cash-in-hand, this is not the case with Settlers of Catan.  You begin the game with one free settlement (\\"house\\" equivalent in Monopoly), one city (\\"hotel\\" equivalent in Monopoly), and two roads.  Unlike Monopoly, there are no set \\"property blocks\\" in this game.  You place your pieces and build roads between them.  This is how you built more settlements and cities!  It takes thought and strategy since you can block your opponents and/or try to build on resources that fit your needs.<br /><br />CHESS: If you wish, you can anticipate your opponents next move and plan in advance, this is not the case with Settlers of Catan.  The next move can be guessed, but not necessarily likely depending on what resource, development, and/or progress cards you hold.  Players may know the NUMBER of cards you have, but not their contents (unless you show them).  You win the game by attaining \\"victory points.\\"  At some point, the game usually becomes neck-and-neck between a few players.  You never know who will get the necessary number of victory points, or if the underdog comes back with one or two strategic moves!<br /><br />OTHER POINTS TO CONSIDER:<br />1. The board game is comprised of puzzle-like pieces (hexagons).  You put togetherthe board game each time, shuffling the hexagons, and laying them out in new, unique orders each time.  In my opinion, this is great.  Every time you play the game, you start out with a new layout.  So every time is different and ever-changing.  (Imagine playing Monopoly and shuffling around the properties before each game, you never know where anything will land and no one has an advantage going into it!)<br /><br />2. Similar to Monopoly, you start off with building a settlement, which you can turn into a city, and later a Megalopolis.  Only 3 Megalopolis' can be built, however, and this is one competitive/strategic angles of the game.<br /><br />3. You start off the game with one \\"free\\" settlement, one \\"free\\" city, and two \\"free\\" roads.  Later on, you will have to purchase those items with the resources that you earn from your lands where you build your settlements and cities.  So, this game is definitely based on strategy.  HOWEVER, the game runs off the roll of the die.  You never know what numbers will be rolled, and therefore you don't necessarily know if the properties you chose to develop will return any resources.<br /><br />4. There are \\"expansion packs\\" for the game.  The expansion packs add new dimensions to the game with new possibilities and new threats.  I don't think they are required for advanced players and I highly recommend starting off with one.  I've only tried the Knights expansion pack so far, but I cannot wait to try others!
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies and I'm so glad that we were able to find it at such a deal! Thank you so much - great product. Couldn't be happier!
B003V9OCIS|5.0|It's easy for me to determine if a foreign film is good.  If it is good I forget that what I am watching is subtitled.  I definitely forgot in this movie.  I would say that 40 minutes in I forgot it was subtitled and was totally into the movie.<br />I was a climber once, never ever at this level, but I was good enough that I recognized the feeling of when someone was climbing around us that wasn't or shouldn't be where we were.  So somebody who wrote this movie knew something about climbing and captured at least one aspect of climbing very accurately.  At that point in the movie is probably when I lost consciousness of the subtitles and suspended disbelief.<br />They attempted to capture the attitude of climbers, but that can never be conveyed.  Up is the only way.<br />I liked the give and take between Toni and Andi, it was kind of the inter conscience of most climbers. In the climbing world though Toni's and Andi's decisions were the right ones.  Glad I never faced them.<br />I'd just add that even without a knowledge of climbing this is an excellent movie.<br />I especially liked the way the love story was intertwined. I don't want to spoil it, but it was an excellent touch to the story.<br />[Semi-spoiler]<br />Pay attention to her appearance as the story progresses.
0061438294|5.0|This book gets down and dirty with the limbic system. Once you know how the limbic system governs our body language -- you will be set... I mean it, this book is great and informative. I finished the book pretty quickly, and then I lent it to a friend. When I get it back, I am going to reread it. This way, everything that is contained within this book will be reinforced into my head... Very good read.

1843794411|5.0|Frankly, Richard Armitage could read the phone book and I'd probably be entertained.  But reading Heyer's complicated story of a marriage begun for all the wrong reasons to two people who haven't a clue how to have a real relationship, he is genuinely wonderful. His characters come to life in such a way as to keep one riveted. His interpretation of the heroine's brother, the Viscount, was so hilarious that I liked him better than Rule - obviously, Armitage does comedy very well.  I would buy any other Heyer that had Armitage spinning the tale!
B001LF347E|5.0|After more than a 20 year hiatus, the BBC brings one of their shows to a major American network. Merlin is that show, and how very much worth the wait it was.    Based on Arthurian legends, Merlin is the story of a young man destined to become a great Sorcerer. Merlin, both blessed and cursed with incredible gifts of magic, is sent by his mother to the legendary Camelot to seek comfort and like-minded people. Once he arrives, he finds out that all magic has been banned from the kingdom by the cold-hearted King Uther Pendragon and anyone found practising will be immediately sentenced to death. He is taken in by Gaius, the Court physician, who quickly becomes his mentor. After saving the life of Uther's son, Arthur, Merlin is hired as the Prince's manservent. He quickly becomes echanted by the King's ward, the beautiful Lady Morgana (who has \\"gifts\\" of her own), and befriends her servent Guinevere. As the series progresses, Merlin becomes increasingly more powerful and it becomes difficult for him to hide his gifts from those around him. Only Gaius and the wise Great Dragon (behind held captive in the castle's dungeon, to whom Merlin often goes for wisdom and guidance) know his true self.     This is a beautifully shot, brilliantly scripted, wonderfully acted show. The actors are phenominal in their understated style and are all so very talented, and deliver their material flawlessly with immense grace, so much that you forget they are acting. The production value is superb (that is one awesome, fearful dragon). The story every week has heart, humor and shows the evolution of the characters in a poignant way. In every great legendary story is tragedy and heartbreak, and Merlin is no exception. Each character goes through a personal tragedy in some way, giving the show a serious Shakespearean quality.    Now, onto the DVD set itself. The transfers are high quality, meaning you get sharp & clear video and crisp audio. The packaging is standard (the cardboard \\"booklet\\" is a tri-fold and the show discs slightly overlap one another). The real gem about this set, however, are the special features! There are hours of fantastic featurettes featuring the entire cast in candid moments, in all stages of production. I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed features as much as these. I laughed out loud more times than I can count!    To summarize, if you haven't seen \\"Merlin\\" yet, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this DVD set. Take several hours and immerse yourself in a land of myth and a time of magic.
006145205X|2.0|The book has many good, interesting facts about the history of human development, innovation and benefits of commerce.  However, Ridley's biases and opinions overshadow the points he is making, which largely creates a lack of credibility.  He masterfully uses selective statistics so a person that may not be educated on the many topics he presents will easily be snowed.  There are also contradictions that will cause readers to dismiss the points Ridley is attempting to make.  For example, since he is an anti-environmentalist, he points out the marvels of fertilizer, GMC, etc., which is valid, but only uses facts against why organic farming is bad rather than apply the same principles of innovation to environmental issues that were used to improve agriculture as we know it today.  Lastly, the book is too long, often repetitive and jumps around too much.  The bottom line is that is just isn't worth the time.
B003EYVXSC|4.0|When his father was killed by a landmine it drove his mother insane, so Bazil grew up effectively an orphan.  Now an adult, he works in a video store and is obsessed by old movies whose lines he learned by heart.  When a stray bullet ricochets into his brain and the doctors are afraid to operate, he loses his job and ends up on the streets, finally to be adopted by a bizarre band of tinkerers and circus-style \\"freaks.\\"  He decides to enlist their help in his personal quest to take inventive revenge against the CEOs of the weapons manufacturers he believes responsible for his personal tragedies.<br /><br />Think something like [[ASIN:B001QOGYBI Fantastic Mr. Fox]] - and the cocky and quirky enemies they're up against did remind me somewhat of Boggis and Bean - but here the stakes are larger.  It's both whimsical and poignant, silly and serious.  Each of the members of his new ragtag family has something unique to offer, that turns out to be exactly what they need in their efforts to strike a blow at the military industrial complex.  There is the contortionist and the human calculator, the human cannonball and the collector of cliches; these and others allow him to infiltrate the lives of his nemeses, and create unpredictable havoc, all in the service of a brilliant scheme.  Things don't always go according to plan, but it's never less than hilariously inventive - even where it's clear that the stakes are deadly serious, and that Jeunet himself has an important agenda.  In its whimsy, and its resemblance to classic silent comedy, and for its visual inventiveness, the film feels like a return to the lighthearted dark comedy styling of [[ASIN:B000E8NRUS Delicatessen]] (and there's a wonderful moment here that is a very direct reminder of that film), but there's more at stake here and the fantasy realm he invents is embedded in a reality that is manifestly that of our world.  Highly recommended for lovers of inventive cinema.

0316067938|3.0|Twilight and New Moon were great reads.  Eclipse gets better with each rereading. Breaking Dawn is a whole different animal.  The first portion (wedding and honeymoon) was great . . . assuming you're a romantic at heart and that your interest in the novels is Bella and Edward's love story.  So, part 1 was great, and I plowed through it between breakfast and lunch.  Part two, Jacob's perspective, was refreshing.  He's funny.  The tone is more tongue-in-cheek, mostly.  And Meyer really out does herself when things get heavy (as Bella is about to have the baby and its killing her) when Jacob really finally gets that Bella is not his girl and never will be.  He is heartbroken and talks about how all that's left for him now is to swim this personal ocean of grief alone.  That's beautiful!  And now, part three, again from  Bella's perspective:  I'm gonna give it to you straight here.  There were way to many zany character's with funny names and wacky, superhero powers that didn't add one iota to the real story, which is our love story.  Meyer parades in a bunch of unnecessary vampires with exotic names and abilities, but nothing really happens.  The Volturi come sweeping in, in all their majesty, just to talk . . . a lot!  The build up to this is tense and Meyer handles it well.  I was caught up, speeding through book, waiting for the battle to begin, but it never did.  I hoped that at the very least the two big bull vampires, Emmett and Felix, would lock horns and duke it out! But, nope. Just Aro, talking . . . a lot.  Then the Volturi fade into the fog, and everyone lives happily ever after.  Now, I don't have a problem with \\"happily ever after\\".  Being a romantic sap at heart, I actually liked it.    My problem is the novel seemed to suffer from the author's indecision.  She ultimately decided to just throw in everything, including the kitchen sink.  A huge cast, sprawling sets, a lot of build-up, but no delivery, no thrilling climax.  For example, as I mentioned, Felix and Emmett are both always itching for a throw-down.  I'm saying, \\"Let's get it on!\\" Take off the gloves and rumble.  Likewise, Bella talks (lots of talking in this novel) about fighting Jane, taking little Jane out with her newborn vampire strength.  She even gets Edward to train her a bit in the Vamp-Fu fighting style.  But, you guessed it, it never happens.  The wolves don't even get to ravage anyone.  Basically, with all the talking and mounting-suspense -that-goes-nowhere, and all of Bella's stream of consciousness thoughts, this book could've been a hundred pages shorter and better off for it.  Summary: Part One - great, romantic, sexy but classy and understated, ends when it should with a cliff-hanger phone call ...  Part Two-good stuff, Jacob is funny at times, but his sadness and loneliness are beautifully rendered.  His voice is refreshing,  Part Three-Bella's conversion is compelling, her moments alone with Edward are great, but all the weird characters and their weird histories and the fight with the Volturi are a let down.  Highlights: Charlie's first encounter with the new Bella, Jacob's realization that he can't save Bella, the understated leave-it-to-the-imagination love scenes, the cottage, and Bella letting Edward into her mind are all great.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" paints a grimly detailed super-realistic picture of the frayed fringes of the American Dream in the rural Ozarks where every family is a Gypsy tribe and blood loyalty determines fate and character. These are the ferociously proud and private poor of \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\" and a Post Apocalypse tone sets the stage for a achingly tense odyssey of 17-year-old Ree Dolly to find the truth behind her father's disappearance into the dirt roads and primordial forest where meth-labs and violent secrets always stand just out of the camera's frame. Guns are drawn only once. There is one terrible beating. But the real violence is a viscous landscape in which dirty cops and family treason are second cousins in a No Exit land-mine riddled maze through which the amazing Jennifer Lawrence as Ree Dolly must fine a way to keep her mentally ill mother and beautiful little brother and sister and homestead alive. Lawrence's 100% real unforgettable performance is the center-of-gravity of a film that proves that American cinema about America can LOOK like a foreign film our own dark places are so unseen on TV. It is a frightening trip to another world in our own backyard. There are also moments of ghastly humor. Go out of your way to see this one.<br /><br />By the way, Jennifer Lawrence will play Mystique In X-Men: First Class.
0446613444|4.0|An apparent suicide of a narcotics officer, who leaves behind a brief note saying, \\"I found out who I was,\\" sends Harry Bosch poking his nose where it doesn't belong or where his fellow cops choose not to go.  Bosch refuses to believe this is an \\"open and shut\\" case, while his fellow officers prefer to bury it.    Black ice refers to a mixture of heroin, cocaine and PCP which originates from Mexico.  Another dead body and a missing detective, who had abruptly retired, adds to the complexity.  Although Bosch, never a team player, isn't \\"officially\\" on the case, he's tenacious in pursuing it.  Of course, the case takes him to Mexico.    Almost halfway through the book, Connelly writes, \\"Bosch had parts of the whole.  What he needed was the glue that would correctly hold them together.  Facts weren't the most important part of the investigation, the glue was.  The glue was made of instinct, imagination and sometimes guess work and most times just plain luck.\\"    In the final 30 pages, Connelly reveals the glue that holds the case together.  The Black Ice is one of Connelly's early Bosch novels. Like his other works, it's well written, thoughtfully plotted, interesting and entertaining.

B000UZPIAW|3.0|I would have much rather read a story of Nikki Sixx's life not a picture of one year. It was the same story for the most part day by day for a year.

I completely appreciate the struggle that Nikki went through and appreciate that he shared his story but it would have been so much more interesting to hear more variations of his life story.
0439023513|5.0|Oh, Mockingjay. Where do I begin? This isn't going to be an easy review to write.    District 12 is gone. Decimated. Blown up. Burned. All the refugees have been relocated to District 13, the elusive District that's completely underground. 13 is the epicenter for the rebels. Katniss and Gale are there, and Katniss is in recovery from The Quarter Quell. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol and nobody knows much else.    Beyond that, I can't say much more, story-wise, without spoiling the book for you. But here are my thoughts.    It was brilliant. It was beautiful. It was a masterpiece. I will confess... I'd been counting down the days for this one, but even so, I couldn't bring myself to read it. It took me a week. I had to read it piece by piece. I just couldn't stomach it all at once.  You know how it is, your expectations are so extremely high that you're afraid the real thing will disappoint you. Plus, people's Tweets were scaring me.    Good:  - Peeta. Everything that happened to him was horrifying and scary, but it made him so interesting and dynamic. I loved him before. And I love him even more now. What an impossible obstacle to overcome. What an intense struggle.  - Gale. It was nice to see him as he deserved to be seen. We didn't get to know him very well in either of the previous books, but Mockingjay gave us that chance. I didn't love every part of him. There were times when I was frustrated with him for pushing Katniss to choose, or for forcing her to dwell on things. But really, she did need to face the issue of Gale vs. Peeta, even though it was hard and I didn't like him forcing her to.  - Katniss. Wow. She made some leaps and bounds in her self-awareness and discovery. I've always admired her for her ability to survive and do what needs done, but when she realizes that she's becoming the cold, calculated survivor, and that both Gale and Peeta know she'll choose whichever one she needs to survive... that was a big moment. I was so hurt by that discussion. I hurt for all of them. But it needed to be said, and Katniss needed that \\"Aha\\" moment, even though it was painful. She's matured, and now she can see that she can't do everything alone. Help is not something she's good at requesting or admitting she even needs. But she really grows and learns to humble herself.  - The \\"Wasteland\\" period. When Katniss has had so many terrible, painful things happen to her. I was so glad that Collins didn't shy away from the pain. Real people don't just spring back from everything, and neither should fictional characters. When Katniss says, \\"I am a wasteland.\\", it hit me hard. I've felt like a wasteland before. The wording was perfect.  - The Epilogue.    Not as Good:  - I miss Panem as it was in THG and CF. True, it was completely corrupt, but it was such a rich world, so fully developed and intriguing.  - It was depressing. Beautiful, and I don't think it honestly could have ended in a more perfect way, but it was still so dire and hopeless at times.  - Annie and Finnick. I'm actually glad that Collins didn't go into any more detail about this at the end. I wouldn't have been able to cope.     In so many ways, I feel that things couldn't have gone any other way. Each time I think, \\"Well I didn't like this, I wish it could have turned out differently\\", I realize that no, this is what had to happen. Like it or not, this is what needed to take place.    As I'm re-reading this, it sounds like I have a negative outlook on the book. I don't. It was gorgeous. It was perfect. I'm still wallowing and digesting it. Mockingjay was beautiful and hopeful even while being ugly and hopeless. If you haven't read it, you are missing out. Big time.    5 out of 5 stars.

B003J7HOKU|3.0|This album just doesn't doesn't cut it. It is a bit disappointing. I don't know what they were trying to do with this album, but it didn't work. Horizons on the other hand is amazing.   CONS: As for this album compared to Horizons, the vocals are way worse, the technicality of the guitar work is anything but technical, the overall production of the record is worse, and the breakdowns aren't as good.   PROS: anybody who has listened to the killing with a smile album or horizons will see that there is still a hint of the parkway drive essence put into this album, but it is anything but great. The album is still somewhat heavy, and the vocals are a bit more crunchy if you like that....It's just not as good as what I am used to expecting out of these guys. They still deserve respect for what they have already accomplished though.   BOTTOM LINE: For the best Parkway drive experience buy Horizons over this, or even their killing with a smile album...This album is just ok, but not NEAR the best they have made.
B000058983|1.0|I recently purchased the re-master of \\"Forever Changes\\" to upgrade...The re-mastered sound is dreadful!

This is a brilliant, timeless classic.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|I'm not going to lie to you...while I enjoy watching and collecting all the Batman animated features that I can(especially the DC Universe ones), I haven't really felt every last one I'd purchased was worth the money I paid for it. That being said---I can honestly say I got my money's worth with Batman: Under the Red Hood. This animated feature, to me, is the animated equivalent of The Dark Knight. It's gritty, dark, action-packed and has alot of atmosphere.<br /><br />The story, itself, deals with the death of Jason Todd(the second Robin) at the hands of The Joker. The Joker, as you find out in the feature, started out his criminal career as The Red Hood, which you find out in flashbacks. Fast Forward sometime to Gotham City, there's a turf war going on between The Black Mask and a new criminal named The Red Hood. The Red Hood, you see, is trying to clean up Gotham by controlling criminal activity on the streets(like The Black Mask) but his methods aren't respectable, to say the least. That comes to the attention of The Batman, who quickly figures out who The Red Hood is and why he is doing things the way that he is. Without giving too much away, let's just say things are rather complex in this tale.<br /><br />I was especially impressed by the voice talents of Bruce Greenwood, John DiMaggio, Neil Patrick Harris, Jensen Ackles, Jason Isaacs, and Wade Williams. They made this feature quite believable. I disagree with others about Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill's missing their respective roles this time. I don't know if they could've pulled off quite as believable a story.<br /><br />At any rate, I loved the animated feature and I look forward to Warner Premier and DC's next project.
B000000Y87|5.0|This is not a technical review of Bill's amazing finger work, or Paul's brush technique, or even the beauty of Scott LaFaro making melody from a rhythm instrument.  It simply, with \\"simply\\" not \\"simple\\" being the key, is a beautiful reflection of a mood of of three pros., music making.  Like \\"Waltz For Debbie\\" (\\"Cannonball Adderley With Bill Evans - Know What I Mean\\"), this is not straight ahead jazz or music you will hum; it is just a wonderful experience to sit  quietly and absorb.

0439023513|2.0|The first two installments of the Hunger Games trilogy were about an independent young woman who sparks a rebellion against an oppressive regime. The third novel finds our heroin the pawn of the rebellion and District 13, which is readily seen for what it is - another regime nearly as oppressive as the Capitol it seeks to overthrow. However, rather than exploring this uncomfortable and intriguing situation, Mockingjay is more interested in the atrocities of war and its effect on its veterans.<br /><br />Departing from the themes of personal independence, equality, and freedom for all, this book focuses more on the suffering and loss encountered in war. While the first two novels provided scenes of hope, unity, and freedom in the midst of horrible situations, this book is filled with uncertainty, hatred, and unforgiving, gruesome reality as we approach the victory we've foreseen and hoped for since book one. Ironically, in the midst of the rebellion, Katniss and Peeta are subject to more control than ever, and as a result, they are helpless, adversarial victims rather than complimentary, independent actors as we once knew them. Rather than seeing these characters develop, we see a sort of devolution from who they were and what they once symbolized to emotionless pawns in a deluge of death and madness.<br /><br />While Mockingjay is effective in conveying its uncharacteristically depressing themes, its unexpected departure from the story of freedom and hope we loved in the first novels is too much to handle. If you're expecting an exciting justice-filled climax to the Hunger Games series, you will be disappointed to read an increasingly hopeless resolution filled with defeat, confusion, and ultimately, emptiness.
B0000009SI|5.0|With over 80 albums, 20 live releases, and tons of archive concerts, it can be a little overwhelming for someone wanting to be introduced to the crazy world of Frank Zappa. But I think if you're gonna start somewhere, you should start with the most accessible & best albums he ever made, Overnite Sensation, and especially, Apostrophe. Both of these albums contain everything great about Zappa: The quirky humor, the ridiculous instrumental passages, the blistering jams & guitar solos, and the overall fantastic musicianship of his big band.<br /><br />With this album and Overnite Sensation, Frank Zappa became a household name; the freaky long-haired daddy with a strange sense of humor and a love of all things quirky. With this album, Zappa tackles the over-indulgent song cycles of progressive rock bands, and turns it into something over-the-top, and yet at the same time, catchy and poppy. The Yellow Snow cycle contains some of the funniest lyrics you'll ever hear, and at the same time, it's instantly recognizable. Zappa goes on about an Eskimo named Nanook whose mother always warned him not to eat the yellow snow, but one day he witnessed a strictly commercial fur trapper beat up his favorite baby seal with a lead filled snow shoe, so he picked up some yellow snow and rubbed it into the fur trapper's eyes whereupon the latter went blind, and then he got angry and did likewise to Nanook, and then suddenly he remembered an old legend that said if Nanook rubbed your eyes with yellow snow, you should cross the tundra in search of the parish of St Alfonzo where Father O'Blivion bakes his incredible pancakes and...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />Along with that, there's some fantastic music to go along. The fusion-rock of Cosmik Debris, the free-form jamming of Apostrophe, the doo-wop parody of Uncle Remus, and the dark funk of Stink Foot...it's all over the map, but it never loses your attention or makes you scratch your head, unlike previous Zappa albums. This is the first one where everything clicks.<br /><br />If you're interested in this side of Zappa's work, check out Overnite Sensation, the album previous to this one. It contains Zappa's best known song, Camarillo Brillo. Check it out if you're a fan of the bizarre.rything clicks.

0553805371|2.0|I was hoping to see some physics here to support all the hype.  His conclusion is based on M-theory.  An old old theory that hasn't been accepted.  He starts out telling us that philosophy is no longer relevant in the modern world and then spends much of the book discussing philosophy of ancient cultures.  The physics that he presents are better stated in the 10 year old book by Brian Greene, The Elegant Universe.     A lot of attention is spent on how everything is exactly right for life on earth and changing the laws of physics a small amount would prevent out existence.  I mean, like so what.    Its not all his fault.  Anyone has a right to write a book.  Why not?  The media was saying that the book shows how the Universe could create itself out of nothing.  Hawking doesn't say this.     This probably came from his conjecture that M-theory proves that there are a near infinite number of Universes and ours is just one of them. (And of course ours is the only one that can be detected.)  However what is stated as conjecture in the beginning is treated as fact in the last pages.  That's a problem for me and I wish I had my money back.

0439023513|5.0|This book is painful. It is hard to read. Most will have to put it down and take a break. The things that were fought for in the first two books fall apart as if they were nothing of consequence. Characters, people we love, disintegrate among larger horrors, as if they were unimportant. The whole reason for Katniss's appearance in the first Games, Prim, is brutally murdered, becomes \\"a human torch.\\"     All we can do is read on and wonder why Collins would do that, why our characters are acting the way they do, why Katniss is essentially a whisper of her former self for much of this book, and her life.     The answer is the whole point of the book. Because this is what we are. Because we are unimportant. This is what happens. No matter how desperately we want a \\"character arc,\\" or resolution, or to see our girl grit her teeth and rally, that is not real. In real life, people are drained of their purpose and cast away. We can only endure so much before we crash. A hero falls and another takes his place. A villain is assassinated and another rises. There should be horror in that, but there isn't. Instead, masses of fresh people will simply take the next place. The same day that thousands are murdered, the sun shines, and children play. Humans are cruel. War is cruel. The book is cruel. The book is real.
1853268968|5.0|A similar collection was given to me as a child and started a life-long affection for The Great Detective - and reading in general.    This volume gives you just the text as it was published, un-annotated, un-varnished.  A treat whether you are a fan or just want to see how it all began.    The best thing about the Strand illustrations is they show Holmes and Watson as \\"regular\\" guys. Intense, focused and above all not \\"pretty\\". Holmes is a callused, chemical stained and definitely flawed hero. Even a bit of an arrogant jerk by modern standards. He certainly does not suffer fools gladly! He is also honorable, loyal and kind to those in need. A character with depth!    This characterization (the original) and the somewhat \\"less flattering\\" depiction of Holmes in these illustrations make for a much richer and, dare I say it, \\"believable\\" Holmes.     For me, this makes for a more enjoyable Holmes as well.    An excellent value and a welcome addition to my shelf.
0307269981|4.0|Second novels 99% of the time always go a bit off track and never grip you the way the first one does. This novel follows that trend and goes a little off-track, but it is a good follow on to the first. I had no trouble staying interested and I enjoyed it all the way through. When I was finished I was ready and really wanted to read the third novel. I recommend this novel highly. As with the first novel, there are mature subjects and graphic sex and violence. It is not for immature readers. I also recommend you read all three novels before you see the Noomi Rapace movies, you will be happy you did. You will not believe how well she brought the character to life.
B001JV5BIA|1.0|Genuinely bad acting, atrocious camera work, an ignorant script, wildly miscalculated attempts at humor, and a cringe inducing music score make the directing debut of Wes Craven a truly unbearable experience.  All the more puzzling is that this film has gained classic status in the horror genre.  It never produces anything that remotely resembles a scare and the only thing genuinely disturbing about it is its reputation.  While it does contain some memorably bizarre sequences, they lose all impact when accompanied by wildy inappropriate music and amateurish editing.  This one really isn't even grindhouse worthy material.  It often comes off as quite stupid as all the characters act in irrational ways.  Their actions never resemble those of actual human beings and because all the characters are so ignorant (both the villains and the \\"good\\" guys) it is impossible to work up any sort of sympathy for any one in this film.  The script is filled with plot holes the size of the grand canyon and has to rely on coincidences of the most improbable sort.  It never feels even vaguely realistic.  It is also grotesquely dated with references to women's lib etc.  In some films this can be a charming thing but here it only showcases just how inept the original concept of the film was.    This edition of the film contains a fairly dull commentary track from the three male leads in the film.  There are also a couple of documentary features with Wes Craven pontificating and giving this dubious effort far more respect than it deserves. While Craven has gone on to do some genuinely effective horror films, his talent is nowhere on display in this ridiculous production.  The print used for this edition is anamorphic widescreen and contains a fair amount of damage, although the film will never look good under any circumstances as it was shot on cheap film stock and contains several out of focus shots.  There is also some \\"silent\\" deleted footage that contains lots of nudity and blood covered lesbian oral sex. Does WalMart know what they are selling (for five bucks)?    Why this is a classic film will remain a mystery to me.  I love bad films but this one is so bad I coudln't find anything to enjoy about it.  It isn't shocking or groundbreaking in any way.  It isn't fun or funny.  It isn't frighteing.  To me it just seemed stupid, pointless, amateurish and dull.  From looking over the reviews here on Amazon, it seems as though most people feel the same way.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|Having not seen the original Karate Kid for many years, the content, story and overall feel of the original is simply lost in the annals of time as a result of my terrible memory. So with that, I'll say that my review will be written as if the original Karate Kid movie had never been made and this was an entirely original piece. For me to try and make a comparison would create a review based on false ideas and comparisons, which is not what I want my reviews to be.<br /><br />The film came as a surprise as Jackie Chan took on a role which I am totally unfamiliar with him playing, and that is the serious role of a man who is deeply traumatised by his past, and looking for something to make his life better. Jaden Smith, son of the fantastic Will Smith, is a young actor I wasn't entirely impressed by with his role in the remake of \\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\", but also surprised me in his role as Dre Parker.<br /><br />The film focuses around 12 year old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his Mom who move to China to start life anew. Struggling to settle in, Dre encounters maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan, and also an entirely unintentional rhyme) who saves Dre from a beating by a gang of Kung Fu bullies. There's nothing more dangerous than a Kung Fu bully I'll have you know. After saving Dre, Mr. Han agrees to help train Dre in the art of Kung Fu to prepare him for a tournament which will get rid of the bullies once and for all.<br /><br />The false advertisement of calling it \\"The Karate Kid\\" aside, this is actually a really good film. They acknowledge that it is not Karate but Kung Fu that Dre is learning, but whatever the martial art, it is still done really well. The setting of China couldn't have been more perfect for a number of different reasons. The fish-out-of-water plot, the cultural and scenic perspective the film is told from works perfectly and allows the plot and its characters to truly flourish.<br /><br />Jaden Smith, from a family of acting royalty couldn't have been more perfect for the role. He's clearly a kid who feels comfortable in front of a camera and has a bright future ahead of him; some of the beatings he received from the bullies in the film were a bit too harsh to be comfortable viewing considering he's a 12 year old, but he's a very good actor all the same. Chan performed well as the quiet, tormented and mysterious Mr. Han and this is without a doubt a great stepping stone to a more serious career for Jackie Chan.<br /><br />Overall, the film was great. It dragged at times and I didn't really feel the chemistry between Smith & Chan, although they performed well individually.

The supporting cast, including Dre's love interest, were a simple tag on to the main plot and help you become more emotionally invested in the young life of Dre Parker.for the role. He's clearly a kid who feels comfortable in front of a camera and has a bright future ahead of him; some of the beatings he received from the bullies in the film were a bit too harsh to be comfortable viewing considering he's a 12 year old, but he's a very good actor all the same. Chan performed well as the quiet, tormented and mysterious Mr. Han and this is without a doubt a great stepping stone to a more serious career for Jackie Chan.    Overall, the film was great. It dragged at times and I didn't really feel the chemistry between Smith & Chan, although they performed well individually.

It gripped me and did not let me go til the end.  Masterful and entertaining... I'm glad I gave the Larsson trilogy a try; it's great stuff!

0439023483|5.0|this is not typically my genre of choice... AT ALL.  but i overheard someone speaking about MOCKINGJAY and it peaked my interest.  upon investigation, i found out that THE HUNGER GAMES was the first of a trilogy, borrowed it from a friend, and after the first few pages, i had difficulty putting it down.  it reminds me of a cross between shirley jackson's THE LOTTERY, the popular t.v. series LOST, and william golding's  LORD OF THE FLIES.  it is a clever story that makes you think beyond the last page.  and having stumbled upon this so late, it is sheer joy that i do not have to wait another year for the next book to come out.  i have already started.  just another life lesson... try something new.  you never know until you try it!
B00021R7CG|5.0|\\"In the early months of 1990, during ethnic unrest in the southern part of the Soviet Union, insurgent units attacked a Soviet Army facility.<br />Western intelligence received reliable reports that nuclear weapons were `compromised.' \\"<br /><br />This is a \\"what if\\" speculation film. What if the rebels had carried this one-step further? At one time, we were inundated with such films such as \\"Fail-Safe\\" and \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" Each of these films had their own strength and weakness. However I consider \\"I Donne's early light\\" (1990) to show more human interaction adding to the intensity of the film. This would have made a great play. This film will keep you on the edge your seat speculating as to what you would have done in the situation.<br /><br />As with many movies of this type, you will notice that popular actors play most of the characters from the time. However, you will also notice that they do not overwhelm the characters that they play. I was especially interested in how Martin Landau as the president desperately tries to maintain peace however mainly not any price. Powers Boothe and Rebecca De Mornay add most of the human interest that was missing from the other films.<br /><br />Remember this is a 1990 movie a different era and a different mindset. However, you will not regret watching this film and speculating on the future.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0399127771 Trinity's Child: A Novelby William Prochnau]]
4789009637|4.0|This is probably the most commonly used Japanese textbook on the market for college students, and it has earned that status. The organization is good within each chapter, things come in reasonable chunks (vocab, grammar or phrases), and the end-of-chapter exercises are enough to keep you busy if you choose not to buy the workbook (which you should buy if you are taking a class!) My only complaint was the fact that chapters have themes that really don't fit with their content -- barbecue, for instance, is a chapter, and really does not focus on that. Also, words like \\"this semester\\" and \\"last semester\\" may well be found in different chapters (true example). Lastly, if you are going further in Japanese and want to learn some kanji, you will need to look at the back of the book for each chapter's kanji list. They are organized by chapter but are not included in the chapters themselves, which I find strange and annoying, and they may or may not be vocab words from that chapter. The question word \\"what,\\" for instance, is randomly placed and learned much later than is useful, even though it is relatively easy to write.     If you are taking a class that uses this book: Buy it. Used or new shouldn't matter, but familiarize yourself with its organization and read all the grammar sections carefully. Some situations (like using a noun where an adjective is commonly used in a particular structure) are written but easy to miss if you skim.     If you are not taking a class but want to learn Japanese: You might or might not find this a good match. If you memorize quickly and forget quickly, forget it. If you want things in context so they have somewhere to stick in your brain, forget it. It's really formatted for a formal classroom setting.

B00006GO9Q|5.0|For those who have never really clicked with Miles Davis this delightful, ambient and most interesting musical experience might be the key to the door you've never been able to open.<br /><br />\\"In a Silent Way\\" is great late-night jazz, perfect in mood for those small hours after midnight, though it also works on a long, slow afternoon. Beautifully complex with overlaid keyboard playing from Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul and Herbie Hancock (difficult to tell which of them is playing when, but hey who cares?) and virtuoso guitar from John McLaughlin complementing Miles's restrained trumpet and Wayne Shorter's soprano sax (credited on the cover of the CD as tenor, but in fact it's soprano), the ensemble weaves a spell so captivating and yet so accessible that even those normally left cold by Miles's experimental journeys into improvisation will be drawn into the magic.<br /><br />\\"Shhhhh/Peaceful\\" sets the tone, ambient but just a little edgy with its minor-key melodic overlays gently inviting the listener's attention to the virtuoso playing, but never too insistent. The title track is a sparse, slow, late-night stretched-out mood-piece; relaxing and wonderful. \\"It's about that time\\" moves into a fuller but still-ambient space more adventurous in tone with a driving, positive bass line overlaid by trumpet and sax, again in the same minor key, before a reprise of the \\"In a Silent Way\\" theme returns to conclude the final minutes and bring the journey to a satisfying close.<br /><br />The album is really one long piece with four sections, where one moves not-quite-seamlessly to the next, weaving an ever-more bewitching mood where the spell of early-hours intimacy is never broken. It's truly sublime.<br /><br />Give it a listen. You'll like it.
078322737X|5.0|This movie will take you back to the fun times of the early 1960s.<br /><br />Director George Lucas lived it in the early 1960s in Modesto, California.<br /><br />If you were a teenager or young adult during the late 1950s and early 1960s, then you're sure to remember the kind of fun that teenagers and young adults had back then - going to drive-ins, drive-in movies, drag racing, cruising, etc.  It seemed like everything that was fun seemed to revolve around cars.  Well, maybe that's an exaggeration, but there is some truth to it.  People back then worshipped their cars just like people today worship their computers, blackberries, and other technological gadgets.  In this era society was cleaner and safer.  The middle class prospered.  Jobs were plentiful and paid well.  Wealth was distributed more evenly.  A person could work at the same company for 30-40 years and retire with a pension.  Generally speaking, most people were decent people with morals and values.  People weren't nearly as greedy as they are now.  Illegal drugs were rare in society.  Radicalism was at a minimum.  America was still in an age of innocence.  To quote Bill Maher, \\"The early '60s were the '50s.  There really wasn't much radicalism going on\\".<br /><br />My mother was a teenager in the 1950s and in her early 20s in the early 1960s.  She always used to talk at great length about all the fun times she had as a teenager cruising Woodward Ave. near Detroit, going to drive-ins, drive-in movies, going on dates, the rock music of that time period, etc. and how the young people of today missed out on all the fun and can't relate to what she did as a teenager.  She always said that she met guys as a result of cruising.  She was a fan of American Graffiti and used to mention it quite frequently and said it is an accurate depiction of what cruising was like in the '50s and early '60s.<br /><br />If you're someone who lived these fun times back then, then you can relate to this movie, as this movie is set in September 1962 in the area of Modesto, California.  Even if you weren't alive back then, you can appreciate this movie.  The basic plot is this:  It is September 1962 and it is the last night of summer before everybody goes to college.  There are actually four stories that are all happening simultaneously (classic George Lucas style - think of the Star Wars movies), but in this movie, they're not related to each other.  You'll see scenes showing cruising, school dances, drag racing, drive-ins, and many mischievious acts.  Kids out to have a good time before they enter the real world and go their separate ways.  The movie takes place almost entirely at night, from sunset to sunrise the next day.<br /><br />This movie stars Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfuss, Suzanne Somers, Mackenzie Phillips, Paul LeMat, Candy Clark, Charles Martin Smith, and legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.<br /><br />This movie is LOADED with rock 'n roll songs from that era.  The music starts at the beginning of the movie and never really ends.  There are a total of 41 songs that can be heard throughout the movie, and all are big hits from the '50s and early '60s.  There is no actual musical score, no background situational music.  Instead, the rock songs ARE the soundtrack.  Everything from Buddy Holly to Bill Haley & The Comets to The Beach Boys to Chuck Berry, this movie has it all.<br /><br />This DVD comes with excellent extras, particularly the documentary called The Making Of American Graffiti.  It has in-depth interviews with director George Lucas, executive producer Francis Ford Coppola, and nearly all the cast members.  It runs about 1 1/2 hours.  The stories are very interesting, particularly the stories about the mistakes that were made in the movie, but were kept in the movie by George Lucas.  There are also production photographs, the theatrical trailer, and never-before-seen screen tests of the cast.<br /><br />I can relate to this movie, at leastsomewhat.  Every year near my hometown there is an event called the Woodward Dream Cruise, a car cruise on the third Saturday of every August where people cruise down Woodward Ave. near Detroit in their classic cars from yesteryear.  It's a huge event that easily attracts over a million people and is even televised locally.  I've been to all 16 of them, from 1995 to 2010.  This event was invented to bring back the nostalgia of cruising down Woodward Ave. in the '50s and '60s.  Radio stations play songs from that era all day long.  Myself, I listen to my hard rock and heavy metal while driving.  Generational gap!<br /><br />But you see?  People yearn for this sort of thing.  People want to at least pretend to escape back to a time when America was more innocent, safer, more prosperous, cleaner, more secure, had nicer people, far less greedy, and when people weren't so obsessed with chasing the buck as they are now.  That's why we've got a national drive-in chain called Sonic.  People want to be taken back in time, even if it's just for an hour.  I even went to a drive-in movie a few years ago in the parking lot of the now unused Pontiac Silverdome.  I hadn't done that since the '70s, because they all disappeared.<br /><br />So, if you're somebody who lived what is portrayed in American Graffiti, this movie should bring a smile to your face.  If you're a younger person, you need to see this movie, and I'll bet you'll like it.eam Cruise, a car cruise on the third Saturday of every August where people cruise down Woodward Ave. near Detroit in their classic cars from yesteryear.

B00122MBY8|5.0|More than 40 years on, \\"Astral Weeks\\" sounds as fresh as the night it was recorded. Many reviewers have pointed out that this is one of the greatest musical statements of all time: a true musician's album, impossible to categorise, standing out distinctively even from the rest of Van's voluminous and consistently excellent body of work over 40 years. All played in one inspired spontaneous burst, in a 12-hour studio session by musicians who had little or no experience of playing together: in the can, done and dusted, a timeless classic created in one night in NYC.<br /><br />Bursting with youthful energy, musical originality and jazz-improvisation, featuring some of the most inspired poetic lyrics ever committed to song, the whole beautiful, timeless marvel is carried along by strings, brass, flute, acoustic guitar and the most delicious driving bass playing you'll ever hear. And then there's Van's voice, articulating those poetic lines with such power and conviction you feel he's baring his very soul.<br /><br />Someone said of this album many years ago: \\"You can't really say why it's so great. You have to listen to it to understand that. It just is.\\"<br /><br />Words like \\"seminal\\" seem somehow inadequate to describe \\"Astral Weeks.\\" There's nothing else like it, nor ever likely to be. It's gorgeous, rich, delightful, transformative, inspired, a one-off. If you've never heard it, then it's time you did.
B0000029J5|4.0|I very much enjoy this albulm. After seeing Keb Mo for the first time at the Telluride Blues festival a few years ago, I have listened to his music. He was one of the artists who was sung by his songs versus just performing, in my opinion. His music is simple and easy in it's expression and his voice rich and deep in the telling of the tales.

B003J27WFW|5.0|GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT Video!  If you are a real Rush fan you need to see this film & the extras on the DVD.  Buy it, borrow it or steal it, you won't regret it!  (& if you get caught stealing it, it will give you something good to do in jail :)    Seriously, it is a fantastic film documenting one of the best bands in the world.  We all grew up listening to them, going to the concerts, watching the videos & playing the music, but did we really know where they came from besides Canada?    Well now you can know it all!  The film follows each member from early childhood to today & the challenges they faced growing up, working in the band & after they became the sensational band they are today.      Guest cameos include Gene Simmons, Tim Commerford, Billy Corgan, Taylor Hawkins & many more!     It is worth the money you shell out for this film & it will be in your collection for years to come (unless you loan it out, in which case you'll never see it again!)    Don't die wondering...........BUY THIS DVD TODAY!!  & turn your amplifiers up to 11 & ENJOY.........You'll thank me :)
B00009R86L|5.0|I haven't weighed my loaded bag (an expandable Case Logic PK), but routinely I carry two lunches, a laptop, a small camera and a small video camera. It's quite heavy, and the bag came with a bare nylon strap with no padding.<br /><br />This pad does what it advertises. I'm quite happy with it; the weight of the bag is distributed a little more evenly over my shoulder.<br /><br />I leave my strap long enough that I can either throw the bag on a shoulder, or over my head \\"messenger\\" style. Unfortunately, the pad is contoured in a wedge shape (so the thinner part of the wedge ideally sits close to my neck; the fatter part closer to my shoulder). Flip-flopping between how I wear my strap, the wedge ends up \\"backwards\\" when I throw the strap over my head. Not a biggie (and I could quickly turn the pad around by opening the two velcro straps that secure it).<br /><br />Overall, a very nice, solid, well made, comfortable shoulder pad.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Lisabeth, the ill-used, unusual heroine of Larsson's three books, lies half dead in hospital awaiting trial after her almost mortal battle with her father.  Her father is also in the same hospital in critical condition.  As Lizabeth lies in hospital, around her swirl the events and people who figured prominently in her life and her father's life.  And the answer to many questions lies buried deep in the files of the most secretive spy agency in Sweden. Former spy personnel come out of retirement to cover up the truth about Lizabeth and her father.  They rally to protect the State and their personal interests. Behind the scenes, Lizabeth's friends work furiously to tell her story, which has been obscured with disinformation to protect the nefarious workings of counter intelligence agencies.<br />Lizabeth's life is complicated by her work. She is an incredibly talented Internet hacker, earning a living exposing the dirty side of high profile Swedes. She has made enemies, but she has also made friends despite her offhand treatment of people close to her.  You either hate Lizabeth or you love her.<br />Lizabeth is accused of attempting to kill her father. Will she ever be free from her past?<br />Dozens of agents and her journalist friend and protector are working to free her and publish the truth about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father and the Swedish government.<br />Larsson's characters are superbly woven into the story in believable fashion. The morals and way of life in Sweden are sewn into the rich tapestry of the novel.<br /><br />Some of the writing may seem heavy going with the pedantic descriptions of Swedish political and commercial life. The reader made feel irritated at being dragged through descriptive writing that does not appear to move the story along.  The reader would do well to perservere to the end and read the finale of the Larsson triology.<br />The original book was published in Sweden in the native language but the English version, in general, will sing to the English reader.g to the English reader.

0451196716|5.0|Apparently set in a alternate history United States, and originally published in 1979 under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, The Long Walk follows a group of 100 teenage boys as they participate in, you guessed it, The Long Walk.    The Long Walk works something like this: On the morning of May 1st of each year, 100 boys, chosen by lottery from all eligible applicants, gather on the Maine/Canada border, and at 9am start walking down the road. They need to maintain a speed of four miles per hour, and if they fall below that limit for a total of 30 seconds, they get a warning. After their third warning, 30 more seconds under the limit and they get \\"ticketed\\".    There are no breaks of any sort, and they're not allowed to interfere with each other, or leave the road. The last boy to avoid being ticketed is declared the winner, and receives The Prize, anything he wants for the rest of his life.    You might wonder how interesting it could be to read about guys walking down a road for 384 pages, but if you're a fan of King's style, you'll like this one. The interaction between the walkers is great, and even though the world the Walk takes place in is only explained in conversational tidbits, enough is revealed to rank it fairly high on the list of twisted dystopias.    In any case, it's short, easily available, and a pretty fast read, so if you're in the mood for something other than the usual action-packed spectacle, I heartily recommend this one.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Watch it! You will like it a lot. I suggest you not read or try to hear anything about the movie before watching it. I saw it with no idea of the movie beforehand. LOL!, yeah, a lot of new, weird and thought provoking things happening here.

Overall, this movie promises to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I will sure keep an eye on this DVD.    UPDATE: reading the other reviews I suddenly realize that I believe it's a great movie because I am a diehard fan who has read all the books, watched all movies and most importantly played most games, and that is why I did not need an explanation for most of the storyline. If this is your first Resident Evil movie, I suggest you first get familiar with previous movies and/or books. I am not going to go into details because I do not want to spoil. For fans this movie is not a let down in any way and the best thing is that an afterlife is not the end for this installment :D
0375507256|5.0|I've been wanting to read Cloud Atlas: A Novel ever since I heard that part of it takes place in post-apocalyptic Hawaii. I've lived here since I was three, and have always wondered what it would look like if we were cut off from the rest of the world for an extended period of time. So when I came across the audiobook, I grabbed it.    It's basically six separate stories or novellas, each only slightly related to the last, and the structure of the book is fairly unique in that the first five sections all just stop, right as they're getting interesting, in one case in mid-sentence. Then after a complete sixth story, you finally get the endings of the first five in reverse order.    And the stories themselves couldn't be more different from each other. Of course my favorite part was Sloosha's Crossin', the post-apocalyptic section. It's told in a corrupted pidgin English, similar to that of Riddley Walker, but not quite so hard to understand, and I recognized most of the geography and place names, and even some of the cultural aspects of the various tribes on the island. Way cool.    But even though that one novella is worth the price of admission, the other five stories are all really interesting too, particularly the story of Sonmi 451 in a future dystopian Korea. They're all told in a different narrative style, and each has a bit of a twist toward the end to keep you guessing.    Cloud Atlas: A Novel is technically 1/6th post-apocalyptic, and 1/6th dystopian, so overall only about a third of it is related to the genre. But even so, I give it my full recommendation; it's a really cool book.

0765318741|3.0|I first read I am Legend by Richard Matheson just a couple of years ago.  My notes from back then  say that I liked it, but didn't understand the ending.  I saw the audiobook at the library the other day so decided to give it another try.<br /><br />I Am Legend regularly shows up on lists of the best post-apocalyptic novels of all time, but I have to say, even after reading it a second time, I just don't get it.  It was ok, but had way too many glaring plot holes to make it really enjoyable, and there's no way it ranks up there with the real heavy hitters of the genre.<br /><br />The story centers on Robert Neville, apparently the only survivor of a plague that turns it's victims into vampires. Yup, honest to god, need to drink blood vampires.  Matheson does a good job of coming up with a scientific explanation for vampirism, but it feels like he spent all his time thinking about that, because there are lots of other elements in the book he could have worked on.<br /><br />The story, and its final revelation, work from a very high level, as long as you don't dig too deep and question how or why things happened the way they did.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't read it yet, I don't want to give too much away, so for now, suffice it to say that if you don't like stories that make you ask \\"why?\\" and don't give any explanations, then you might not like this one.  But as I mentioned, lots of other people do like it, so proceed at your own risk.

0439023483|4.0|I've been hearing good things about The Hunger Games for a couple of years now, and I always meant to read it, but never got the chance. Now that the final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay, is about to make its way into anxious fans' hands at midnight release parties across the country, I figured it was time to start the series and see if it lived up to all the hype.    The story takes place in an undetermined future where Panem, \\"the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America\\", and its central Capitol rules over 12 outlying Districts, each of which is required to send one boy and one girl each year to participate in The Hunger Games. Broadcast nation-wide, the Games feature the 24 \\"tributes\\" battling to the death, with the winner being set for life, and bringing wealth and glory back to their District.    We follow Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District 12, as she is thrust into the games, and fights, literally and figuratively, to stay alive, and to somehow show the Capitol that the people are not totally at their mercy.    On the positive side, I read three-quarters of book in one day; it's written that well. The story moves quickly, and had enough action and little \\"twists\\" to keep it interesting. The world of The Hunger Games, and it's 12 Districts, is well fleshed-out, even though most of our interaction is with just a few characters.    The negative side isn't so much a negative per se, it's just a matter of perceptions; it's very much a \\"young adult\\" novel. Don't get me wrong; I love YA fiction, some of my favorite post-apocalyptic books are YA. But you have to realize going in that some of the details of the story may be \\"smoothed over\\" so to speak, and there may be elements of the plot that don't seem very realistic, but are necessary for the story to progress.    For example, the District where Katniss lives has been sending two of it's children to die every year for 75 years. But there's no talk of families trying to flee, or anguished mothers wailing in grief as their child's name is called at the Reaping. And after being chosen, Katniss, and the other tributes, don't seem to be really taking the situation seriously. If I knew I had barely a few weeks to live, and was likely to die a horrible death, I'd be haunted, and would devote every waking moment to planning and strategizing. Katniss and the other characters acknowledge that they're not likely to win the Games, but almost seem to brush off that fact. And the interaction between Katniss and the Gamemakers and the Capitol is a bit simplistic and contrived.    But like I said, as long as you know going in what you're likely to get, none of that really matters. Even though you know the chances of a 16 year old girl challenging a long-standing dystopic government hover around zero, you can still cheer for her each time she's able to stick it to them, however unlikely it would be. You can enjoy it simply as an action story where the underdog makes good, and where personal independence trumps the evil Big Brother government.    So even though I doubt that when I get to book 3, I'm going to think of it as \\"the end of an era\\", I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series, and seeing what happens to Katniss and those around her.

In addition, the story line is great too so it keeps you entertained and interested along the way; one of those books that makes you laugh and cry.
0439023513|1.0|Unfortunately, \\"Mockingjay\\" brings the creative, exciting, fast-paced adventure of the first two novels to a screeching halt and knocks us into the underground bunkers of District 13. In a sense, this is the command base for the rebels who fight the Capitol and aid the uprising among the districts. They have rescued Katniss from the games and plan to use her as a symbol of the rebellion. Her now deceased stylist even designed a Mockingjay uniform for her to wear when the rebels broadcast shots of her all over Panem.    What is lost from the first two novels is never found in the third. If Katniss is not drugged up, hating herself, hiding in closets, hating everyone, recovering from an injury or being sedated, then she is fighting with Gale and Haymitch. Katniss turns into a horrible, intolerable, miserable, sulking, self-loathing character in \\"Mockingjay\\". She lacks all the spark and self-assurance of the first two and when Peeta is rescued from his torturous prison at the Capitol, she essentially abandons him because he has been mentally hijacked and poses a threat to her life.     Without giving away the specifics to those who will not heed my warning and read the book anyway, the war does come to an end and we assume the right person was voted into power. However, the author sums up that bit in about a paragraph. (Okay...) Additionally, the senseless killings seemed pointless and a pathetic ploy to drive a point home: war is bad. If the author's weak writing and sluggish story were attempts to deliver a diatribe against war, then she succeeded with an \\"empty\\" character in Katniss, lack of rich descriptions, and a plot void of heart. Of course war is hell, but sometimes when the world is at it's worst, people are at their best. The author forgot to add these qualities to her characters in \\"Mockingjay\\" in an effort to get her message across.     Do yourself a favor: Read the first two books and the last two chapters of \\"Mockingjay\\". Then sell your books and buy \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" where you will read an author who knows how to end a series with a war, yet maintain her credibility.
B002ZG983M|3.0|OK to enjoy this movie you need to turn off your brain and just well, sit back and enjoy it.  This is a riotous, hyper-violent movie where the bad guys don't just lose, they get their butts kicked.  The characters are lame but then again that is the point.     The downside is that the characters are two-dimensional and almost lame they are so pure and righteous. The acting is dreadful and the script is just so lame that the good story telling is dragged down by the need to drop an F-Bomb every other word.  I mean that this script seems to be written by 14 year old boys who think it is cool to swear. While that drags down the script, the performances do rescue it.     All in all this is a fun movie. Watch it, but like I said, turn your brain off to enjoy!
B000UJ48O0|1.0|I purchased the complete series of The O.C. from this seller.  It arrived promptly, which says a lot since I am in Afghanistan.  After I opened the box, the case had fallen apart and looked as if it were glued back together.  Instead of a heavy duty plastic case, it was a flemsy piece of crap.  This however is not the worst part.  Some of the DVD's do not work and that is in any system I have tried them in.  The DVD's that do work are terrible quality and I think it is because the seller probably ripped the DVD's, made cd labels and then pawned off a \\"new\\" collection on me.  I had brought The O.C. collection before from another seller and it was in perfect condition.  I recommend buying The O.C., I do not recommend buying anything from the seller I did.  Planet on sale, Inc. was the seller.  I will never buy from them again.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|Wow... I recently had a friend get me back into the NRG sound and went back through relistening to Patrick Cowley, Until December, et al. and then I heard this. Attemptng to follow through on the continuum of that sound, the album succeeds as an exploration of \\"what could've been\\".  Now hopefully a new generation can be inspired by this and take the sound into the next level- if you don't know what I am talking about read the amazon bio explanation for the album.  Scissor Sisters have always had a gift for doing party music tinged with sadness- if people want to get lost in the beat, then they must have something they need to go away from, and what better way to explain that than they day post-disco sound of the eighties.  This album takes that idea and injects it with life- that the people who created the sound are gone but the sound itself can live on.  What a tribute!  Oh, and someone without a clue at aolradio recently said that the cover was one of the worst of 2010- it's a Robert Mapplethorpe and ties in with the concept of the album itself.

0061537969|5.0|I work in a library. At five o'clock this afternoon, I locked the door of the library and walked outside. I had a few books in my hands. I glanced down at the cover of The Art of Racing in the Rain. The cover art interested me because I have two dogs. Curious, I opened the book and read the first sentence. Then I sat down on the library stairs and read non-stop for an hour and a half. I was so spellbound by this wonderful novel, that I had to force myself to walk to my car, so that I could drive home and finish reading it.<br /><br />There is a poignancy to this book that brought tears to my eyes when I discovered that the narrator, Enzo, was a dog whose dearest wish was to transcend his canine existence and become human. Enzo's life is defined by his loving relationship with his owner, Denny, who works in a luxury car repair shop and also dives race cars.<br /><br />Through Enzo's eyes, we experience his entire life, including the day Denny picked him out of a litter of pups, his introduction to Eve, Denny's future wife, and his presence at both their wedding and the birth of their daughter, Zoe. When the family's lives fall apart, and Denny is hit with multiple hardships, he has only Enzo and Mike, another friend, for support.<br /><br />I read a few other reviews that claimed that Denny's troubles were melodramatic or formulaic but I disagree.  Sometimes horrible things do happen to good people (and to good dogs).<br /><br />Author Garth Stein's prose really brought home Denny's essential decency, and the nobility and beauty of Enzo's soul. I was impressed by the beautiful lessons of the book. No matter what hardships Denny and Enzo faced, neither ever had a victim's mentality. Both kept positive mental attitudes, neither ever lamented anything they'd lost, and like any good driver, they kept their bearings and stayed the course. Most importantly, Enzo and Denny showed how vital it is in a true friendship, to put your friend's well-being before your own.<br /><br />I don't have the writing skills or the talent of Garth Stein, and I don't want to ruin The Art of Racing in the Rain for future readers by spilling too many details.  I can only say that I read a lot of books, but this one is something out of the ordinary. It is one of the finest books I've ever read.the talent of Garth Stein, and I don't want to ruin The Art of Racing in the Rain for future readers by spilling too many details.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|Very pleased with the product. Have been using for a couple of months now. Lighting fast position acquisition is excellent when using with topo software in the field with a laptop. Position can be acquired, marked, then hibernation for power savings. Software was easy to load. Once \\"Comm Port\\" was set up - it was off and running.  Works flawlessly with other application software using GPS.  You can't go wrong with this product.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Cannot adequately express how outstanding the whole Supernatural saga is.  It should definitely receive more recognition for its excellence than it has received so far.  The acting, writing, production values, story lines, and overall perfect meshing of character and story is unparalleled on TV right now.      Sat down to watch the entire Season 5 set of DVDs in preparation for the premiere of Season 6 on September 24. I will be incommunicado the evening of 9/24 -- everybody just back off!  It's the new season of Supernatural!     Rejoice, and be afraid, very afraid.... Ha!

B00009YUPY|5.0|This is the de-facto mouse if anyone has every worked at place featuring Lenovo workstations. I worked at Best Buy where all the computers used this mouse and I fell in love with it. It's A MOUSE, it's the most basic, functional wonderful shape you can get and has the build quality of the Autobahn.     The scroll wheel noticeably clicks for an easy, accurate scrolling experience.     As with any USB accessory worth a crap, it doesn't require a driver and works pretty instantly. It's accurate, comfortable and despite what the picture says, doesn't say IBM, but is identical in every other way.     Clicking is pleasurable, satisfying and the mouse feels great on the hand. I've used it for gaming a bit and find it to be slow, definitely must boost sensitivity in the game and Windows to give a worthy experience.    This is a five-star mouse in every way, fails nowhere, succeeds everywhere. I use this on my laptop and lack of extra buttons for page navigation is negligible at worst and programmable buttons, it's the same story.    Gets the job done every time.

B002N5N5M0|4.0|I am completely hooked on Dexter, good, bad and ugly.  Can't give this one five stars because I did not like John Lithgow in the Trinity role at all. I generally don't like him as an actor period, but I tried view his Dexter role on its own.     The first half of the season moved too slowly.  My husband and I always bet on what's going to happen but like most people we did NOT see the ending coming.  The running theme of Harry's advice through the whole season was for Dexter to walk away from his family or they would pay the price for who he is. So far, Harry's always been right, so maybe we should have anticipated the ending. We figured Frank Lundy would buy it at some point but were disappointed he wasn't in more episodes.    Debra's and Vince's dialogue continue to be great.  The storyline between Batista and LaGuerta was weak and added nothing to the show. The relationship between Christine and Trinity wasn't fleshed out enough to explain how Christine got so twisted.    One thing that was bothersome about this season: from the beginning, Rita was a minimally employed worker that already had 2 kids to support.  Dexter's income can't be that much, so with 3 kids and Rita not working, how can they affort a house like the one in this season plus the rent on Dexter's old apartment?    For those who haven't read the Dexter books yet:  if you plan to read them, keep an open mind.  At best, the show should be tagged \\"Loosely, LOOSELY based on the books.\\" Some of the characters have the same names but they are very, very different. The books also have an... interesting... and quite disturbing subplot involving Rita's kids. Have always wondered if that subplot would make it to the series but it might be a little much for viewers. You know something's bad if it could be too creepy even for the Showtime Dexter series!    The biggest disappointment? Now having to wait SO long for Season 5 DVDs
B0035V35P8|5.0|This is a great movie for any action movie fan.  It has anime style fight scenes that are actually well done.  If you like action movies, martial arts movies, or animes this is a movie for you.

B0036EH3X4|1.0|What started out as a great series eagerly followed by fans was made into a mockery by this last season.  It is as if the writers all quit and then the producer told everyone to wrap it up in a hurry and they developed a quick, unsatisfying ending.  Rather they had made a 2 hour movie if that was the intended way of the ending.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|Amazon wants me to review this so here it is. I love the show so 5 stars.
B003JTHETY|4.0|I bought the new Maiden disc as soon as it came out like I usually do.  After a \\"Matter of Life and Death\\" (which I think is the best album of the \\"reunion\\" era) I was very excited to dig into the follow up.    Now, I (like most Maiden fans) had downloaded the free MP3 for \\"El Dorado\\" and watched the advance video for the \\"The Final Frontier\\".  First impressions from those two offerings were positive although I wasn't exactly floored by what I was hearing.  Of the two, \\"The Final Frontier\\" hook stayed with me (and my six year old son too!) while \\"El Dorado\\" didn't quite make it (initially that is).  In any case though, I was still very much looking forward to the latest effort put forth by my favorite band.    On hearing the opening section of \\"Satellite 15\\", I was struck by the atypical approach taken by the band here.  The relentless and rhythmic pulsing of the intro is vaguely familiar while simultaneously a departure from the norm for Maiden.  This to me is pretty cool.  When Bruce's vocals kick in though I am left with the thought (after a half-dozen or so listens), \\"What is this?\\"  It's not that the section is bad but, based on my impressions from the video, I expected something else here.  Something more consistent with the feel and attitude of \\"The Final Frontier\\".  What I am saying here is that it's still difficult to wrap my head around the melody here.  I suppose the slow, subdued, and mournful sounds are consistent with the lyrics but they do contrast with where things eventually end up.  I'm sure that I will \\"get it\\" at some point (like I did with \\"To Tame a Land\\" many years ago) but my point is that the two sections of the opener are decoupled from one another.  That is probably what they're going for here.    As for \\"El Dorado\\", it has \\"clicked\\" for me and is a better song than I initially thought.  I find myself singing the chorus in the shower and elsewhere now (that's a good thing).  As an aside though, I really could have done without the \\"endingfor the beginning\\" here.  The same thing with the signature larger than life \\"Iron Maiden ending\\" (as some like to call it).  Sometimes it is appropriate while other times it isn't.  Obviously in this case, I believe in the latter sentiment.  The same thing goes for \\"The Final Frontier\\" while I am at it.  I mean granted they're Iron Maiden so they can do what they want.  My undying allegiance always remains.  However, I do feel kind of shortchanged here.  Those parts could have been approached with more imagination thus improving those songs.  Please pardon my little rant here.    I won't go into a \\"blow by blow\\" on the remaining tracks but will share my general thoughts and impressions.    Overall, the album is rather much to take in entirely on the first listen in my opinion.  It is all there though and it is all good but appreciating that fact will likely take repeated listens.  For Maiden fans though, that clearly isn't a problem.  Ultimately we are all rewarded here (as always).    A word or two on the individual musicianship on \\"The Final Frontier\\" if I may.  As we've come to expect, Maiden do the utmost to put their best foot forward in whatever they do.  In general, this is certainly the case on the new album. I do feel let down in dissecting a few of Nicko's parts though.  Nicko is far and away one of the best in the business (and that is not blowing smoke up anyone's a**).  Rarely does he disappoint but it does happen on rare occasion.  Without being specific, some of the drum parts weren't up to par with what was going on in a given song.  Now it would be fair to say that about anyone and that's fine.  My point is that had the parts in question been composed using an alternate perspective, then the songs would be improved.  I gave this album a 4 out of 5 review directly in part as a consequence of this.    As mentioned earlier, I got the sense listening to the \\"Satellite 15\\" intro that we're venturing into new territory here.  Others have said and I mustagree that with this disc the usual Maiden standards aren't here in their usual guises.  The first time through for you will, I'm pretty sure, support this assertion.  One might even very well get the impression that Dream Theater slipped some \\"prog\\" into Iron Maiden's tea when they weren't looking.  I know that I certainly did when I heard certain passages within the album initially.    The second time around things start to unfold and unleashes that \\"AHA\\" feeling.  Light begins to emerge from the shadows and recognition begins to dawn.  Songs that at first left me scratching my head suddenly become familiar.  Melodies begin to burn their way into my being.  I realize the cleverly intricate yet perceptually simplistic intstrumental prowess threaded and present throughout each song.  This is an Iron Maiden album and a pretty damn good one at that.    A third listen peels back the layers of the onion even more further infusing these compositions into my soul.  I start to see what Maiden is aiming for.  A fourth listen reinforces things even further.  The fifth time through my appreciation really begins to solidify.    After the sixth auditory saturation it's clear to me that Iron Maiden are going for something different here.  A departure of sorts from their tried and true path.  They have accomplished that and I am sure that further listening will forge greater understanding and appreciation for that goal.    The question is left though, does \\"different\\" equate to \\"good\\"?    After several spins, I believe it's safe to say that Maiden have offered up a worthwhile and significant effort.  It is definitely a step outside of the normal comfort zone but it certainly seems to work for them here.  Simply put, a damn fine Maiden album!
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Robin Hood definitely got a bad wrap by several critics.  It was well directed and well acted.  Yes, the movie meandered a bit the middle, but otherwise it was a good reimagining of a classic story.  One must keep in the mind that this is essentially a prequel to the robin hood story.  It sets up the elements for the story that we all know and love.  My only problem with the film came in the climatic battle.  Maid Marion enters the fray and brings along all of the young boys from the forest riding on their donkeys.  Very irresponsible of her and also unrealistic.  Other than that apparent misstep, I enjoyed the film quite a bit.  It does retain some elements of the superior Gladiator, but it still works in it's own right.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I've always liked this movie, and I was very happy to find it on DVD. It's a great version and I find it very true to the book.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|The original Iron Man was a very good film that didn't necessarily have the weight of a Dark Knight, but was still a good movie in it's own right.  It was just plain fun.  The acting across the board was very good and Faverou's direction was good as well.  Iron man 2 on the other hand suffers from the same problem as many superhero sequels have over the years, too many characters.  The film seems to lack focus.  Several characters pop in and out of the film without much development.  Don Cheadle as well as Mickey Rourke's characters were given little to do.  The Iron Man and War Machine fight was so poorly conceived that it just felt forced and contrived just get another fight scene into the film.           The editing of the film just seemed off as well.  Scenes that should have been cut just went on and on.  In several scenes, it seemed to me like the actors were just improvising their dialogue.  It's almost as if Faverou was a little too hand's off with his direction.  The story just seemed to amount to little more than a precursor to the eventual Avengers film.  The few action scenes in the movie were well done but the rest of the film just didn't measure up.  Essentially, Iron Man 2 was a decent film, but it just felt a little hollow to me.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Picked this up at Toys R Us recently after much reading about how this was going to help Xbox 360 owners transition over to the PS3.  I love the PS3 except for the Dual Shock 3. It was great growing up with when my hands were tiny (Dual Shock 1&2) but now that my hands are big and fat and also now that I've been spoiled by the 360's near perfect controller, the stock Sony controller doesn't cut the mustard. It's the one single thing that makes me buy multi-platform games for the 360 instead.<br /><br />So much to my delight, the Pro Elite sought to right these wrongs and life would be wonderful... until I used it.<br /><br />It is similar to the 360 controller in weight and the analog sticks ARE reversed, which are both great. But look at the picture and eyeball the \\"Texure grips\\" on the sides.  These things *HURT*!<br /><br />After playing for 10 minutes my hands looked like I had grabbed the wrong end of a pin cushion! And I'm sure some humble readers would say, \\"Well just loosen up your death grip and you'll be fine.\\" Not so. The controller is so big in girth that your poor hands have to wrap around this painful \\"feature\\".  One other thing I should mention is that my hands ached just from the sheer girth.<br /><br />Nice try 'Power A' but next time leave out the sharp Porcupine Grips.
0199535639|3.0|A fairly easy read given the time period in which it was written, but too long; it just kept going on and on and on.  By the time I was ready for it to end, the ending was still hundreds of pages away.  Nevertheless, very much appreciated the strength of the heroine Marian, and was equally irritated by the weak and excessively \\"fragile\\" victim Laura.  Overall the character development was quite good and clearly defined the role of each.  For a mystery I found there to be some early foreshadowing that I thought made for some predictability in latter parts of the story, causing perhaps later plot twists to lose some of their impact.

142313494X|4.0|Percy Jackson has a lot in common with Harry Potter - both are youngsters who discover they have special powers, both are teamed with a male and female friend to form a trio for going on quests. Percy Jackson is a more modern tale than Harry Potter, but still manages to weave in the lore of the Gods of Olympus. I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to others. Although it is written for young adult readers, adults should find it equally exciting.

1402217722|5.0|This book was an unexpected treasure! Almost a full year after reading it I find myself still thinking about it. The young heroine is flawed and likable despite her naivet&eacute;, and her husband is an intelligent, sensitive man who can easily find the humor in things. Their developing romance is absolutely charming- and the dialogue is hilarious! In response to the reviewer here who wrote they were disappointed because our heroine \\"married for money\\" I have to say you need to look a little deeper. She married him as a sacrifice- to allow her sister to marry the love of her life. It was never about the money FOR HER, though her mother did need it to support her family. And in light of the fact that the married couple fell deeply in love with each other the money became little more than a minor character. Wonderful, humorous, FUN reading! You will love it!

B002RSDW80|2.0|We have two movies here. One is a superbly-acted, well-scripted piece about a fascinating couple, one of whom is now deservedly a household name. The other is a sub-soap opera effort about a couple of nobodies and their straight-out-of-Cosmopolitan-short-stories friends, given lines that nobody in real life would utter unless that person watched too much daytime tv. I guess the film maker thought we wouldn't be interested in Julia Child unless her story was somehow linked to the kind of tv drivel that passes as entertainment today. It was just about worth sitting through all this for the Julia Child scenes. Child (Streep) and husband are as spectacularly good as the other two are spectacularly bad. Hopefully there will be a future dvd edition that will allow one-touch navigation through the movie, deleting everything involving the nobodies.
0553805371|3.0|As someone with a fair background in quantum mechanics, I found this book to be excessive in explaining basic quantum aspects that most people either know, or easily accept without the need for several analogies. The double split experiment was brought up countless times to describe the probabilistic interpretation of a particles position. While that in itself didn't bother me as the book is catered to the masses, when it came to controversial or complex quantum theory like Feynman sums and using them to explain how every possible history that can occur is, has, or will, the authors seemed to either assume people wouldn't get it anyway so \\"why bother\\" or they didn't understand it or believe it themselves enough to explain it any further and instead left the reader with a one or two paragraph general statement that often caused me to go back and ask, what? How did they just make that logic leap? Most people read this book to learn how M-theory answers all of the question the previous reviews refer to, me included, but what I got instead was an overly simplified view of quantum mechanics that I already knew.
0439023513|5.0|Well, reading some of the reviews on Amazon for Mockingjay have honestly more depressing than reading the book itself.  I bought it last week and let it sit in the bag for a few days while I psyched myself up for the trauma - and the Hunger Games isn't even the most traumatic YA SF trilogy I've been reading (that would be Chaos Walking, which I still haven't read the last instalment of 4 months after release..!)    In the end, I picked up Mockingjay this morning, intending to read the first couple of chapters, spread the misery over a few days... Heh.  I sat there and devoured it in about three hours or so, all in. It's not a perfect book, but the fabulously compulsive narrative voice that has carried the trilogy along is still damn near intact. It's gruelling, but the ending didn't leave me feeling hopelessly depressive. Katniss is still a great character, and we've already seen how she's been progressively more brutalised and used by both sides in a war she doesn't totally understand or necessarily want to be a part of.  It seems realistic to me that by the time she's survived yet another Games at the end of Catching Fire, had yet more people sacrifice themselves so that she could live, knew that Peeta was being tortured somewhere and that her whole District had been firebombed... yep, beginning the next book being labelled mentally unstable seems perfectly reasonable to me. And her behaviour the whole way through stems from there, as uncomfortable as some readers seem to find that.    Mockingjay isn't a portrait of a war in the traditional sense; we only have one narrator so it's still just Katniss's story, even as much as she spins in and out of the centre of what's happening.  Her position the whole way through the trilogy has been lacking information; not understanding the situation and reacting the best way she knew how - Peeta has been the one deliberately controlling situations and trying to keep her safe that way.  While he's absent for much of Mockingjay,she has to take responsibility for her actions in the bigger picture without his back-up for the first time - so, yep, she doesn't always do the sensible thing.  But she still had my sympathy the entire way through.    It's not perfect - there are a hell of a lot of characters introduced just to be killed off, to the point where I can't even remember who just died where (and there are obviously a huge amount of deaths involved).  But it's an absorbing, immersive book. I think it captures perfectly the strained claustrophobia of living underground and surviving the kind of war/rebellion being waged. It's not structured traditionally, because (as I understand it) Katniss's attention is necessarily fractured and restless, and it's her damn story.    It probably benefits from being read fast, because it's still an adrenaline rush in parts.  It also probably helps if you're not totally hooked on the love triangle aspect, because the people playing this out by the end of Mockingjay are not the same characters they were; have changed so dramatically that much of what they want becomes irrelevent when faced with their current situation.  It was sweet, and sad, in the previous books, but the choices that end up being made are bigger than that (and the author even states as much near the end).    But hey, you know what - the ending is far more positive and satisfying than I expected it to be. The fate of Prim and her mother's decisions make Katniss's attitude in the epilogue seems fair enough to me; it certainly seems in keeping with the rest of the book, and brave enough not to try and sugarcoat something that just skirts the line of all-out tragedy without being nihilistic.  Good stuff - intelligent and interesting and still compulsively readable.
0439023513|1.0|One of the most miserable, futile books I've ever picked up. If you wondered why Collins--after nibbling at a larger story--scurried back to the safety of The Arena in her second novel, well you've got your answer: she's way out of her depth doing anything else. Like, say, attempting a full scale military/political novel.    The \\"strategy\\" of the different warring factions here is scream-at-the-sky stupid.  Huge chunks of technology established in previous books (stadium sized force fields for starters) are simply omitted.  And to think I had a problem when Katniss ignored her night vision advantage in the first book....Ha! If you are male, it will physically hurt your Y chromosome to read this.  Sorry, someone had to say it. There should be a warning label or something.    But wait, it gets worse!  Collins is all about creating emotional scenes, and everything else is sacrificed to that end. Plot, characters, logic--all expendable.  So what's the emotion for which all is sacrificed?    MISERY. Unending, unbroken, frequently suicidal MISERY.  With little bits of extra misery thrown in for texture.   For god's sake, read something else.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|Apparently abandoned on a passenger ship, Nell, a four-year-old girl, manages to travel by herself from England to Australia where a loving couple claim her as their own.  Until she is twenty-one, Nell believes that she is the daughter of this couple.  After learning that she is a foundling, Nell's personality shifts from bright, warm, loving to taciturn, aloof, and unsympathetic.      An elderly woman, Nell is on the brink of discovering more about her origins when Nell's daughter who is in pursuit of a man, dumps her child at Nell's house. Nell finds an unexpected kinship with her grandaughter, Cassandra. In order to care for Cassandra, Nell ends her search.    Following Nell's death, Cassandra, emotionally stunted by her own sorrows, takes up Nell's investigation.      The story moves back and forth through time.  Two stories are told.  One story happens during the turn of the century.  It tells about the life of a young woman who becomes an author of fairytales and her relationship with a grand English family.  The modern day story focuses on Cassandra's efforts to discover what brought Nell to the ship.    If you like mysteries and literature about life at the turn of the century, then you will love this book.  While I agree with the reviewer who stated that the male characters in this novel are not well drawn, I think that the limited third person point of view in much of novel prevent a complete understanding of the men.  For me, that flaw did not detract from the book.  I found both stories equially compelling.  The minute I finished \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" I went out and purchased Kate Morton's first novel, \\"The House at Riverton.\\"
0786915749|4.0|I thought this was a fun and action packed book. I like the fact that there are a lot of characters because I get sick of the follow one character routine. Not that it is bad but it does get boring after a while. The reason it is 4 and not 5 stars is because there are a couple of plot twists that are rushed and my 3 year old could predict. Even with that I would recommend this book.
0307463745|5.0|Wonderfully written. I'm recommending it to everyone that runs companies or is thinking of running them. Simple, clear and to the point.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|The other movie for date night.  A lot better than YEAR ONE.  Focus is on the younger years of Queen Victoria and her struggles to gain the respect of her elders.  I thought the love story was best.  Romantics might even cry but not even tough guys like myself. ;)  Be sure to stay until the very end to read epilogue of her 63 years and 7 months reign.  The costumes, hair styles and background are \\"A\\" quality.  WHEN WATCHED: 09/09/2010; MY GRADE: B plus.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|With The Old Breed has to be one of the most remarkable accounts of war ever documented.  The pages are not simply an account of the horrors of war, but an invitation to an interpretation of human behavior.  This book needs to be used as a means to remind us of the sacrifices made by our ancestors and the depth of choices and reactions that are made under the most astounding circumstances.  The work of E. B Sledge is a true study of the capabilities of humankind, both promising and acrid.  WIth The Old Breed is as much a text book of American history as it is a lesson in the psychology of human behavior.  It is a must read, for all.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|This film does what I love horror films to do: rather than trying to shock and startle the viewer (although it does do a little of that) it instead gradually builds a sense of unease... a feeling that \\"something is very wrong here.\\" A true classic, darkly funny and bizarre. I thought the  blu-ray looked great!

0374158460|5.0|This book is timeless in that it will be a valuable time-capsule of the first decade of the Twenty-first Century, to be read and understood by those who are not yet born but will read this novel several decades from now.  This is one of many reasons why I am compelled to compare this novel to Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates.  Yates was able to capture the post-WWII to pre-1960's era for future readers like me who were born in the 1970's or later, just as Franzen captures 2001 to the present.<br /><br />Another comparison to Yates is the way Franzen sympathetically creates many complex main characters in this novel.  For example, Patty Berglund is a depressed middle-aged woman with a lifetime of emotional scars and poisonous relationships with family, friends and lovers.  She's necessarily in therapy, so Franzen constructs part of this book in Patty's third-person narrative as a therapy assignment.  That is, Patty's therapist makes her write an autobiography of her life, in hopes that it will help her understand why she's so screwed up. Franzen includes these chapters in Patty's voice, but with Patty referring to herself in the third person as the autobiographer to give a detached reliability to her sorry without compromising the authenticity that is usually strengthened by first person narrative (I'm not sure that I'm explaining it so well here, but anyone who reads this novel will be quite impressed with this technique).<br /><br />This books loads the reader many moral lessons without overloading, such as the dangers of corporate greed, the futility of placebos as cures for depression, how to strike the right balance between environmental ethics and the necessity of industrial development, the importance of family ties and fidelity in relationships, the superficiality of idolizing musicians/entertainers, and the long-term destructive effects that outweigh short-term benefits of enabling those who are emotionally fragile.<br /><br />Ultimately, this novel warns us to be careful about how much freedom we really desire, as in with the following examples.  SPOILER ALERT:  Joey Berglund desires the girl of his dreams, and when he finally gets her he doesn't know what to do with her.  Walter and Patty Berglund want to be free from their marriage, but when they're finally free they are miserable.  Richard Katz wants to be free from the perceived constraints of family life but his freedom is the very source of his misery too.  Franzen tells us to be content with what we have, just as Yates warned post-WWII adults that the revolutionary road leads to nowhere.bout how much freedom we really desire, as in with the following examples.

B003VS0CYC|1.0|Hi!,      i did purchase the first movie on BR some months ago. The reviewers said the quality of the conversion was bad, i also have some \\"olds\\" movies like Predator, wich also have bad quality reviews, but the quality seams ok to me, certainly isnt Transformers o IronMan quality.      However, the quality of Robocop is terrible, ist worst than my \\"old\\" DVD, or even air TV, i say: DONT BUY IT!!, so, be carefull with this one, and wait till it is released for rent. The only good thing, the BR has some new scenes on the movie...
0316067938|1.0|Back in 2008, my younger sister recommended I read Twilight because I am in love with vampires and she thought I would enjoy it.  So, I read it.  And guess what?  I was transported to Forks, WA where a clumsy girl named Bella fell head-over-heels for some tall, brooding boy with topaz eyes.  Why?  Because it mirrored my own memories of the first guy I dated (except he wasn't a vampire).  So, I read New Moon and bought my own edition of Eclipse.  And for my 25th birthday, I asked for Breaking Dawn because it was going to be the final book to end all books.  Finally, the book release date came along and I rushed out and got my copy, feverish to read about Bella and Edward's wedding.  The first \\"book\\" (Bella and Jacob have their own \\"books\\" in the book), they get married and it's all cute and funny with Edward's bachelor party with Emmett and Jasper.  And then came the wedding night.  The moment I'd built up in my mind that was just going to be amazing, if it was anything like the teases in Eclipse.<br /><br />I was majorly let down.  They get naked, frolic in the ocean, Edward kisses her, and you wake up in bed with them the next morning.  The most alluring part about the whole honeymoon sequence was Edward bit some pillows to keep from biting Bella.  Then you go through Bella's annoying whining because Edward doesn't want to hurt her more than he already has.  And then, Stephenie Meyer decides to throw the largest curveball in the history of novels and makes Bella pregnant.  Never in the history of any vampire movie, book, or TV-themed anything has a vampire been able to procreate.  It all took a huge dive down that cliff Bella jumped off in New Moon from there.  The baby grows at break-neck speed, Bella does some pretty nasty stuff to satiate the baby's hunger (without spoiling anything, the baby is half vampire), and Rosalie suddenly begins to like Bella.  Also, Jacob (A.K.A. Mr. Whiner) and Edward (who becomes a monster, in my opinion) form an alliance...about the baby.  And then, little Renesmee decides \\"I've incubated long enough, it's time to mess up Mommy.\\"  The birth scene is something that no one should read under the age of 13, which is odd, because that's the demographic that reads these novels and eats up all merchandise related to the saga.  Jacob goes all weird, wants to kill this baby for killing his woman, and Edward ultimately has to do what he never wanted, which is turn his quickly-dying wife into a vampire.  End of Bella's \\"book.\\"<br /><br />Now, we get Jake's POV.  He's pissed.  He wants to kill baby and man who helped make the baby.  He wants to kill the blonde who protects this baby.  Boo-hoo-hoo.  Bella lies dead on a table, venom coursing through her veins, for several days while she \\"dies.\\"  Finally, she is vampire.  She thinks she's hot.  And she has no trouble controlling her thirst, much to the dismay of other members of the Cullen clan.  She is also a \\"shield.\\"  And has more superhuman strength than Emmett.  There is more innuendo of her and Edward having sex, but not much more than that.  The Volturi hear about Renesmee, and afraid of a pandemic of vampires going and making babies all over the world, decide she must be destroyed.  So, for the first time in what is most likely centuries, they venture out of Volterra to make a visit.  Bella sends her kid away with the creepy shapeshifter who's imprinted on her.  The Volturi arrive, along with every other vampire coven that exists, all ready for the vampire showdown of the ages.  Bella shields everyone, says \\"Bring it on,\\" and the Volturi back down and say adios.  Lamest ending ever.<br /><br />Like a few other posters on here noted, the book had a fanfiction feel to it, and it was just mediocre in writing style.  I will admit after re-reading Twilight and Eclipse I have found Ms. Meyer's writing somewhat lacking.  But this book deserves every piece of negativity it has written about it.  People who praise it must skip all the crap in between, because it was painful to read once.once.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I was so excited to see that Pride and Prejudice has come out on DVD. I own the 5 hour VHS version and just love it. I'm such a fan of this movie and as technology is moving to DVD format I'm in the process of finding movies I already own on DVD. I can't say enough praise of Pride and Prejudice. The characters, the actors, the story is all so well done. For any woman who is a true romantic at heart she'll love this one. If you've read the book then you won't be disappointed by the movie. BBC has done an outstanding job at reproducing the story. I love to hate Mr. Darcy and then to fall in love with him along with Elizabeth as she sees him for who he really is. The escapades of the younger sister Lydia show how foolish some young girls can be. The charming and dashing Mr. Bingley creates the desire to find such a man who is so amiable and fun. And the riduculous mother with all her ailments makes me laugh. I would recommend this to everyone who is a true romantic. Find a comfortable chair or sofa, brew a favorite drink, sit back and enjoy yourself.
B00000099Y|3.0|Sonically and instrumentally this is a pretty good CD.  If the singer would just sort of step aside, like permanently.  Hovering around on top, he literally ruins a good bunch of guitar, bass, synth and drum ideas, otherwise very workable in the metal/techno field.  Trying to front these guys, he hasn't a clue about putting up a listenable melody.  As far as lyrics, well, he can't seem to help being incoherent and venomous at the same time. But he knows how to use the f-word real liberally, though. Too bad.  And the \\"lost soul\\" artwork does not help toward understanding in any way.  Oh, well, maybe next time, if there is a next time, here in 2010.
0618918248|1.0|I was very fascinated when I first found this book in a bookstore.  I was interested to learn how Dawkins could possibly refute my firmly-held belief in god.<br />  I BTW see no contradiction at all between a belief in god and a belief in evolution.  It frankly is a great struggle for me to see any conflict between these two beliefs.  I firmly believe the theory of evolution is an accurate description of how our bodies formed.  I also firmly believe that a god exists.  That is, I believe that the entire universe is an enormous, consciously aware entity.<br />  I believe that the most accurate way to describe god is \\"an experience\\" (that is, the experience of the universe).  Amazingly, I can find no words in this book or any other book by Dawkins that addresses the possibility that any human being on earth could think about god the way I do. Dawkins seems to think that the only kind of god anyone on earth believes exists is a kind of god focused on human beings, who has lots of opinions about how human being should act, who has given statements to us expressed in scriptures, etc...  When I searched for what he thinks about \\"pantheism\\", what I got instead was simply atheism.  Dawkins calls \\"pantheism\\" a \\"sexy\\" kind of atheism.  He implies that those who think god is being described by the laws of physics and other scientific discoveries necessarily cannot believe the universe is consciously aware.<br />  I was also surprised to read his harsh condemnations of \\"religion\\" (implying: ALL religions are objectionable).  My beliefs are basically Buddhist, and I eagerly searched through Dawkin's books for any kind of complaint or refutation of any Buddhist belief.  What I found instead was another dirty trick he pulls with basic definitions, like the one he does that re-defines pantheism as atheism.  Dawkins says Buddhism is an \\"ethical system\\".  My gosh, how many people worldwide would agree that \\"Buddhism isn't a religion\\"?.  I would be amazed if even %2 would agree it's fair to say that \\"Buddhism isn't a religion\\".  Author's should obligate themselves to use definitions their readers use.<br />  He however does have a complaint about Buddhism.  In the endnotes of this book he quotes a researcher who while in India observed a mother and her deformed infant, and when the researcher expressed sympathy about the infant's deformity, she was criticized by the mother, who said the child shouldn't get pity because the child deserved it: the child's deformity was due to something it did in its previous life.  We should therefore disapprove of Buddhism.<br />  There are three serious errors with Dawkin's claim here.  (1) The mother's response is in no way implied by anything Buddha taught. (2) Even if we regard reincarnation as true, surely we don't need to believe that we are responsible for decisions made in previous lives (just like criminality is in no way implied by atheism), and (3) The karma-payback theory is contradicted by evidence.  Scientists have collected evidence relevant to the question of whether we get any kind of karmic pay-back for bad deeds, and the evidence so far suggests that, if anything, what is passed on to a future life is effects of being THE VICTIM, and NOT the perpetrator. For example, in a recent book summarizing evidence for reincarnation (in the form of memories of prior lives expressed by children) one of the children claimed to have been murdered in his prior life by a wound to his head, where in the current life he had a very obvious birth mark.  A death that exactly matched the child's testimony was found.  The prior-life death was caused by a bullet wound to the exact spot where the child had the birth mark.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|My husband and I watched the dvds in 3 segments ... it's so addicting!  Now I wish we spread it out more.  I'm so bummed that we have to wait another year for the next series.  This one really had us glued to our seats.  The ending took my breath away!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am someone who works out hard six days a week, so sometimes I am disappointed by exercise DVDs, but this one is really challenging and worthwhile!  I will say that I typically do two of the 20-min workouts together, so that it's a 40 minute workout, because 20 min just doesn't seem long enough.  But I noticed definite results after a few months (doing it every other day and running on my off days), and I love that many of the moves are a combination of toning and cardio, which seems like a much more efficient workout than tackling cardio and weights separately.  You really don't need much space, and only need one or two sets of weights, so it's very easy to do at home.  My one gripe with the DVD (in case anyone on the production team is reading!) is that you can't skip the intro to go straight to the workout menu, and after doing the workouts for several days/weeks, you really don't want to sit through that long intro anymore.  Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a solid workout at home!
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I have been a fan of backstreet boys more than 10 years and they never disappointed me, of all the albums they have released over the years have promise of statisfication to their fans.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|The feature that they won't tell you about in the Nikon Hype or on forums is the most important feature for wedding photographers vs. the SB800.  The SB800 could only swivel backwards in 1 direction.  Meaning if you went from bouncing flash over your shoulder, you would have to spin the flash when moving from vertical to horizontal OR hold your camera upside down!  Not the case with the SB900.  This flash almost does a 360!  So less wear and tear out on the dance floor and more photo taking with this.  Do yourself a favor and get the SD9a with it also.  1 second recycle time for $200 vs. buying something double the price.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|Audio was very good. Quality of the live performance, including songs sounding very true to the original with a bit of live flare and runs, was outstanding. Video was also very good.  A definite buy!
B000N6UERK|5.0|It is one of my favorites of all time! It is the top2 movies of Denzel's (the other one is Out of time). The idea (or people science) might not be possible/real in today's world, but the movie makes it believable - that the the most important part as many movies have too many holes prompt too many questions during the movies. But the two most important things about this movie are that the director does a great job (1) filling any possible holes and (2) keep the movie going quickly so there isn't anytime for you to sit there and look for the flaws. That is why this movie is soooo good. It is very fast paced, great cinematography, great character development and great acting. I loved the movie when I saw it in DVD, but the bluray disk just kick it up another notch. It is one big roller coaster that at the end of the movie you will be like \\"wow\\". They really need to learn to make movies like this nowadays instead of making garbages like the Repo Men to name a few..
0553805371|5.0|'42' is the answer to the question about 'life, the universe and everything', according to the Encyclopedia Galactica as quoted in \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". The authors of \\"The Grand Design\\" too believe to be pretty, pretty close to an answer to 'the question'. They believe.<br /><br />Having read both the Brief and the Briefer Histories of Time, Hawking's style and the topics discussed are quite familiar: the 'how' questions and the 'why' questions, the scientific method, the world as seen by I and through instruments. This is a truly brief (it took me 3-4 hours to cover the 180, rather large typeface, illustrated pages) entertaining, not so hard to follow history of science - especially physics - and our thousands-of-years effort to make complete sense of ourselves and our surroundings. A high school graduate would probably feel most comfortable reading The Grand Design but my 9th grade kid is reading it right now and he seems to enjoy it.<br /><br />The 'how' questions are nicely presented. The Hawking/Mlodinow team produced a readable overview of humanity's quest for the ultimate knowledge, complete with nice illustrations and anecdotes. By the time the reading is over, the reader should have a pretty good idea of where 'cutting edge' physics happens to be these days: super gravity, 10- or 11-dimension string theory, the emerging M-theory of 'everything'... The book has a pretty good, introduction to quantum physics and, understandably only hints at the harder to grasp 'string' theories and the attempts at producing unified theories of everything. This would be the 'how' part.<br /><br />And then we have the 'why' questions. Quoting from the book:<br /><br />- Why is there something rather than nothing?<br />- Why do we exist?<br />- Why this particular set of laws and not some other?<br /><br />Surprisingly, the authors make an honest effort to at least address if not fully answer the above while staying as much as possible within the realm of science because, 'philosophy is dead' and religion, as far as the authors can see, is no longer necessary at a time when physics promises to produce the long awaited 'theory of everything' or something close enough. The authors expect that, eventually, we will find proof that things are simply 'because', that nothing besides the 'scientific laws' is needed to explain the creation/existence of our universe, one among of a near-infinity of universes, each possessing histories not only of everything that happened but of everything that could have possibly happened. The anthropic principle is mentioned but a few more pages of explanations and some illustrations might have helped with the understanding of 'why' all these numerous improbable coincidences conspired to make our existence possible but a lot in a book this small is bound to be a tease and a challenge to the reader to.. read more.<br /><br />I would not call this book 'a must read' - not surprisingly, nothing new is revealed here and nothing new can be revealed on what is a work of popular science. I would enthusiastically call it 'a good read', even 'an excellent read'. Hawking/Mlodinow gave me a pleasant, often thought provoking afternoon-evening and, I don't doubt, the kids and I are going to talk about it after they finish reading it. In the end, the answer to the grand design question is not provided. The authors clearly believe that everything came out of nothing, naturally and nothing else is needed to eventually fully explain it all. But... we're not there yet.<br /><br />I hesitate between 4 and 5 stars but, in the end, five stars it is for the book challenging us all to think big and stay curious and for Hawking being one of my intellectual heroes.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;ence because, 'philosophy is dead' and religion, as far as the authors can see, is no longer necessary at a time when physics promises to produce the long awaited 'theory of everything' or something close enough.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|Who would have thought that Hollywood could produce a taut murder-thriller without slamming every plot point down our throats? But there you have it: that's THE AMERICAN.<br /><br />George Clooney, whom I usually enjoy more in his comedic or semi-serious roles ([[ASIN:B00003CXRM O Brother, Where Art Thou?]] and [[ASIN:B001JIE7JM Burn After Reading]] being two of my recent favorites) pulls in a dark, interesting, and dangerous character as Jack, a weapons man/hitman who's retirement from his chosen profession is proving extremely difficult.<br /><br />Making friends is risky to both Jack and those he likes, as we witness early on in the film what he's forced to do to a woman whose innocence means nothing when Jack is discovered in a Swedish hideout. Forcing Jack to leave, he travels to Italy where he's told to lay low and wait for instructions. And when the instructions come, the audience can feel those pin-pricks of caution raising on their necks.<br /><br />The great thing about The American is that Clooney is truly the only recognizable face for many U.S. film-watchers. But the rest of the cast are just as intense as Clooney's character. Great silences and moments of boredom are punctuated alongside moments of terrible aggression and death. And there's also sex, love, and priestly friendship intertwined.<br /><br />It's rare nowadays to find something like The American showing in U.S. cities, but most of us should be very glad it's here. Harkening back to Hitchcock days (but with a modern bent), this movie almost certainly would've never seen the light of the Western hemisphere had it not been for Clooney's pretty-boy face taking front and center stage. But as recognizable as Clooney's face is, it is NOT a typical Clooney role. Here we get the actor stretching himself into new (and greater) territory. I swear this movie had the fewest lines I've ever heard in a major Hollywood production; and I'm thankful for that because it helped up the tension.<br /><br />Indeed, it is the film's tension that drives the entire plot. We see and feel the battles raging within Jack as he's forced to decide whether to kill someone he's growing close to, or to let them live and risk his own life ...again. We also believe we know what's going to happen, and most of the time you'll be correct, but that it doesn't take away from the tension/impact of the movie shows how well put together this film truly is.<br /><br />Those looking for a kind of [[ASIN:B00023B1LC Bourne Identity]] style flick are going to be sorely disappointed if they think this is in-line with that action-driven drivel. So be prepared for something very different. And very good.es the entire plot.

B001USHRCK|5.0|This set has a great price tag of $100 considering all that is included with the approximately 1700 pieces in the set.  This set is loaded with details such as the fish market, the water wheel, as well as all of the animals included.  The buildings are easy enough to assemble that a 9 year old could assemble, however still a fun and enjoyable build for an adult collector.  Another nice feature of the buildings is that once you are done playing with them, you can place all of the miscellaneous loose pieces into the buildings and close them.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|Hawking has tried admirably to bring complex and erudite theories of cosmology to the masses who we are consistently reminded, especially in the US, are completely illiterate in science and mathematics! To criticize Hawking for this effort simply serves to criticize those whose mathematical background is lacking through no fault of their own! Anyone wishing a more robust treatment of Hawking's theories could simply read his \\"Large Scale Structure of Space-Time\\" instead of chastising him for trying to explain these esoteric yet fundamental concepts of our universe in a way that doesn't require a doctorate in physics or mathematics!!
B00005JNQS|5.0|Great movie. Bought it for my son and he loves it.  Quick delivery, and in great condition!
B002UJIY7A|4.0|\\"A Perfect Getaway\\" stars Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich as newlyweds \\"Cliff and Cydney\\" flying off to Hawaii to hike to a remote and romantic beach.  Upon arrival in Oahu, they buy supplies and rent a jeep and soon come upon some surly hitchhikers.  After a short conversation and some anger the hitchhikers decide to go on their own, however, they seem to be following the newlyweds.  Cliff and Cydney go on their happy way, but soon hear talk from tourists  of a recent murder involving a just married couple on the island they just left -  Ohau.  Soon everyone brushes the scary story off and decide to have fun.  Again they run into the pair of menacing hitchhikers, Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Kiele Sanchez).  They seem to be following them and slowly but surely a cunning unexpected plot evolves.<br /><br />The movie plods along at first, but adroitly  moves from being a happy honeymoon to a nightmare of suspicion and violence as we realize who the real  killers are.<br /><br />Don't give up on the movie too soon, it is worth watching for action-packed surprises.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This series does not disappoint!  The storyline is rock solid, the characters are lovable and the actors are superb!  Not to mention the beautiful scenery and period costumes.  Lark Rise to Candleford is officially my favorite television show.  I pray that this series continues for many more years to come!
0553565915|1.0|I finally got around to reading this book. I was not impressed, in a nutshell.<br /><br />As a person who has had numerous interactions with the spirit world, what Ms. Eadie describes as her near death experience does not ring true. I don't know if she was having a very vivid dream, a drug reaction or something else, how she describes life on the other side comes across as phoney and unbelievable. I was very disappointed with this book. A waste of time and money (I borrowed this copy from the library, I'm glad I didn't pay for it).
0439023513|4.0|Let me start off by saying I am a huge Twilight fan.  When I started reading this series I fell in love with it and told everyone I know about it.  I liked this series better than Twilight by far.  The first two books were great.  They kept me on my toes and wanting to read through the night.  This last book in the series however was VERY predictable.  I knew what was going to happen two chapters before it actually did.  The only thing I didn't expect was the climax.  And of course the suprize at the end.  But after the suprize the book just petered off.  It just ended.  I would give the series a 5 because I love the first two but this last one just stopped. But the book I give a 3 so I put the stars as a 4 in between.  I would still recommend this series to anyone wanting to read a great book I'm just a little disappointed in the end.
B00111YM5G|1.0|I bought this film for $7.50 and that was too much. I liked the mythology behind it, but the execution is so derivative it is not even worth a watch really ( and to think I picked this, over JENNIFERS BODY at the time).  I hope the key players can use it for their careers, but if you must pick a film that rips off other better films so very much, then there are other better films to buy. The lead bad guy is very like a cut price Rutger Hauer, and may find work in that mold ( or is it mould ? ). The start of the film is a low budget version of the start of CONTACT ( it actually states that on the DVD featurettes), and the links to other films are mostly accidental; where you get the clearest link to another film is in the CROW mythology,but  without the Charisma, quality fight scenes, and the Directors skill in the CROW. This pastiche is like PROPHECY series in name only. Only if you get as drunk as Uriel does ( the guy on the bus) would you ever voluntarily watch this film after knowing how bad it is.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I was a young teenager when I watched the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Shows - I remember them like they were yesterday.  These DVDs allowed me to step back in time and enjoy all the performances, over and over again.  The added addition of the commercials reminded me of simpler times.
0374158460|5.0|Jonathan Franzen has a masterful understanding of the nature of family relationships: how they change over time, the ways in which love and hate can intermingle, the repetition of emotional themes and conflicts across generations, and the ways in which individual struggles play out in family contexts. The characters in \\"Freedom\\" have considerable emotional depth.  I was repeatedly surprised at how a character I found hateful in one chapter would be sympathetic in the next, as Franzen explains the same events from different vantage points.    All in all, a superb, absorbing and well-written book. Highly recommended.
1400052173|5.0|Written using exact words of Henrietta's family.  Very moving and touched my heart.  I will give it to others to read.  Everyone should take a look into the lives of the Lacks family.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Best camera case I have seen, well padded, can arrange to your liking and needs.  The price is less than half other bags I have looked at which were not designed as well and has easy access to your equipment.  Not much more you could ask for.
030726999X|4.0|Another great read by Stieg Larsson! I'm so sorry that this is the last book in the series.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I could not find this anywhere. I bought it primarily for the MUSE track, Supermassive Black Hole, but the entire CD is great. Brand new as advertised still in cello wrap and hologram sealed.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! For all brothers who have gone there separate ways due to unforgiveness or self interest or just a game really need to watch this movie. It dissolves the harden heart and brings reality into focus again. It's a simple movie but one you will not forget especially when the two brothers at the end the movie look up into the sky and wonder at stars above. Unforgettable! Included in my collection.
B002KAJ0AO|4.0|To the album's title \\"This Is Us\\", I reply, \\"Nice to meet you.\\" The BSB had the wisdom to depart from the formula of their previous albums, and the result is their most even recording since their first one. The most striking thing about the first 6 tracks is that they remind me of vibrant, glittering, mid-to-late 80's dance music, and they are done very successfully: a current rendering of an established, recognized style. The next 3 tracks sound like more recent pop music, but still very melodic. One of them, \\"She's A Dream\\", sounds very much like 'N Sync, which is funny because I remember the The Boys used to complain that 'N Sync imitated them.  Maybe this is their revenge, since 'N Sync is now defunct. After all of these upbeat tracks, we find the only 2 songs that could be considered ballads, \\"Shattered\\" and \\"Undone\\"; they have more of an adult \\"feel\\" than the earnest ballads on which the Boys built their fame and reputation. Don't get me wrong, I love their early ballads; but time passed, we got older, and so did they, so.... In fact, \\"Undone\\" is quite remarkable, unlike anything I have ever heard them do before. Throughout the CD, their solo voices sound just as good as they ever did, and the harmonies are, of course, excellent. The production includes inventive backup vocals and creative use of instrumental elements. Some provocative lyrics too. Another thing worth mentioning is that this album is very much a team effort; the soloists alternate so frequently that sometimes it is difficult to know which one is doing the singing. It all comes together beautifully. Frankly, this took me by surprise. I had thought the BSB were a thing of the past, until, on a whim, I played the samples.  Fans of pop and A/C, try it, you'll like it.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|One of the best black and white movies about the depression era I have ever seen. All characters in the movie were superbly acted out especially the rolls of Heny Fonda, his mother, and the preacher. The movie will bring you to tears. I especially like Heny Fonda's concluding statement in the movie at the end. You will not forget it. It's about justice, bravery, hope and a deep longing to survive in the worst conditions.  Brilliant!!!!!
B0000X61UU|5.0|I bought this in VHS years ago and liked it so much I bought the DVD when it came out a few years later.  Years ago I lost about 30 lbs, mostly using the treadmill but I really noticed a change in my body when I did this workout 3-4 times a week.  After only 3 weeks people starting noticing and I got alot of comments and questions on what I was doing. Still, 10 years later and having tried many other DVDs I always go back to this one when I have the time (its an hour).  It is a longer workout than many others out there but if you follow this you will see results.    I think what I like most is there's no perky trainer smiling and saying \\"you can do it\\"... especially in the morning all I want is to follow the steps and get it over with.  Many lunges, squats, kicks; you will need hand weights and a floor mat for ab work will come in handy but not necessary.    I remember I saw an interview where Cindy was asked about the tapes; I think they criticized her for the first tape she did that it was dangerous for the back.  And she said, people are always asking her what she does to stay in shape and thats what her DVDs are.  I believe it since I saw those same results.
B003JTHETY|5.0|Anything said is rewriting the obvious. This is another awesome Maiden record. Iron Maiden is one of the few bands that can keep improving its music talent and maintaining the energy and passion from the early days. Bands raise in technical elements. They play better individually and together as they age. But just a few preserve the passion. Maiden does that. The outcome for us lucky fans is that the new records keep getting better and better. The main proof to this is the new generation of fans. Young folks are showing up at Maiden concerts by the thousands. These guys were not around during the early days. They were driven there by the outstanding quality and passion put into the new records. The final frontier is no different.
B00136Q2EI|2.0|Folks, you really can't have a true Pink Floyd album without Roger Waters.  They can call it what they want, but this is Gilmour and Crew and it's not all that good.  Not nearly as intellectually steeped as real Floyd and not as passionate.  They do a nice job creating the Floyd sound at times and the production/sound quality is fine, but this is just not the real thing.  Gilmour's latest work \\"Smile\\" is far better and it also features Rick Wight (RIP.)  In my opinion, Smile works much better because Dave is not trying to be Pink Floyd, but is just following his creative instincts.  This is the last album any Floyd fan should buy.  The best reason to own it is to have a complete collection, which is why I have it.  For those just getting into Floyd, I'd recommend Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here.  Division Bell is one of the very few ways one could go wrong with Pink Floyd.

1400079276|5.0|As of this writing, 212 people have written Amazon reviews of Kafka on the Shore.  Why am I bothering to add review 213?  Only for the chance to give it the 5 star rating it greatly deserves.  Murakami has written a beautiful, moving story about mostly empty people (one is so empty, in fact, he is unable to cast a full shadow).  The strange events that Kafka Tamura experiences during the course of the novel give him a chance to fill his emptiness by coming to grips with the forces that have shaped his young life.  The novel defies categorization--not quite fantasy, not quite magical realism (two styles I don't much like), certainly not straightforward narrative--but it isn't necessary to categorize in order to enjoy the rich prose and the deeply felt, captivating story.  Five Big Stars for sure for Kafka on the Shore.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Not recommended ... at all... under the genre of comedy so i expected at least a couple of laughs (i understand you have to watch this with a certain point of view, but i think i might have smirked once or twice (sort of laughed when the horn wouldn't stop blowing).

B002RWKSII|5.0|\\"If I were forced to name the two most beautiful pieces of music that I have ever heard, I think that I would have to declare that my most beloved pet sounds would be the melodies of 'Rhapsody In Blue' by George Gershwin and 'God Only Knows' by Brian Wilson.\\" ~ David Wild, Liner Notes ~<br /><br />\\"Imagining American music without the towering contributions of composer George Gershwin and his lyricist brother Ira would be like imagining Los Angeles without Hollywood, or a burger without fries. At his untimely death at age 38, he was almost certainly the best-known American composer of the day.\\" ~ Dave Kopplin, Hollywood Bowl Performances Magazine ~<br /><br />After watching \\"Gershwin Across America,\\" a marvelous tribute concert to the music of brothers George and Ira Gershwin, on August 25, 2010 at the Hollywood Bowl featuring Nancy Wilson, Monica Mancini, Patrick Williams, Dave Koz, Gregg Field, Shelly Berg, Bebe Winans, Jason Mraz, Annie Clark and Phil Ramone, from among others, I am still in the mood for more and more Gershwin music with freshly and splendidly charted arrangements. So Brian \\"Beach Boy\\" Wilson's latest gift to his long-time fans, myself included, is just the perfect CD to listen to. The timeless beauty of this album is that he has selected a material that is also some of my very own favorite gems from George and Ira Gershwin's body of work particularly \\"Rhapsody In Blue.\\" Its everlasting charisma lies in the way he reinvented the songs with fabulous twists that only a seasoned artist such as himself can interpret in the grooviest fashion. I love the ingenious way he injected snippets of \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" in \\"Someone To Watch Over Me,\\" \\"I Got Rhythm\\" and \\"Nothing But Love.\\"<br /><br />Released on August 17, 2010, \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\\" also boasts two unfinished Gershwin music that Mr. Wilson has set his own lyrics into, \\"The Like In I Love You\\" and \\"Nothing But Love.\\" He was given the exclusive endorsement by the Gershwin Estate to complete the songs which he astutely collaborated with Scott Bennett to make them very memorable and unforgettable most notably \\"The Like In I Love You\\" (with snippets of lyrics below).<br /><br />You reached into my heart<br />And found the music of my soul<br />The melodies unfold for you...<br /><br />...The pain in painting<br />The muse in music<br />The like in I love you...<br /><br />...It's more than harmony<br />When you sing with me<br />It's an entire symphony...<br /><br />...The great in grateful<br />The faith in faithful<br />The like in I love you<br /><br />With his latest album, he takes the listeners back not only to the Twenties and Thirties--that Glory of Gershwin era, but also to the Sixties and Seventies--that era when the Beach Boys music were dominating the airwaves and the Beach Boys were the \\"in-thing.\\" That same era when young people were thinking...\\"You're hip and cool if you're listening to the Beach Boys records. You're not corny. You're groovy.\\"<br /><br />So why didn't Brian Wilson do it when he was still with the Beach Boys? They could have done it before and made a breakthrough to the Great American Songbook. They would have been one of the first few groups that paid tribute to the timeless standards, i.e. [[ASIN:B000008K97 Diana Ross and The Supremes: The Rodgers & Hart Collection]]. But then again, it is better late than never, as the saying goes. After enjoying the albums of standards by Linda Ronstadt, Carly Simon, Rod Stewart, Smokey Robinson, Gladys Knight, Art Garfunkel, Boz Scaggs, I have been looking forward to the Beach Boys regrouping and recording the Great American Songbook. I am so ecstatic that he finally made his way to the Great American Songbook. And Gershwin music is such a charming way to start. I hope he will explore the music of other brilliant composers such as Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter, Harry Warren, to name a few.<br /><br />I love to create my own Playlist from a particular album in the order of my top favorite to the least favorite.

B00171NZE4|5.0|Korn Live at Montreux 2004 is typical Montreux quality, like Soundstage stuff.    I knew at the check out counter it wuz gonna be good as the young kid  checking out stuff got all excited when he saw the title 'Korn'.    So, it's 16:9, DTS and excellently produced in all reqards. The title wuz only 75 min in length, but seemed much longer and wuz thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. In essence, I found their music quite exciting and very complex. This title will be played again soon!    You got to remember, their music is a mix of rock, metal and hip hop, so, for ppl unfamiliar expect mostly metalish.     Why I picked up this title? bc I liked their performance in Woodstock 99. :)
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I have to confess, i bought this cd because i was starting to be intersted on trip-hop, so on internet i've found that their are a trip-hop band.  So i found the cd really cheap in a cd store and when i put it on the cd player i was in shock !  \\"this is definitely not trip-hop\\", i do not what kind of musical style is the album cause a lot of people call it \\"alternative\\", others call it \\"kraurock\\", I just can tell you my experience.    It was really hard for me to digest the complete album thinking that i was not expecting this kind of sound, but when i started to listened it more and more i now i just LOVE IT !!! All the songs are dark,cold and desperate, the voice of the vocalist is really nice, sometimes sweet and sometimes aggresive, just as the melodies of the disc.    It has that \\"krautrock\\" or \\"alernative\\" songs like SILENCE or my favorites like THE RIP and PLASTIC:  You will find also electronic songs like WE CARRY ON, it is definitely one of the best songs i have heard in all my life !!!! you must listen it !!  And there is another one called MACHINE GUN, really dirty electronic and maddening but really great.  The three last song are SMAL, MAGIG dOORS and THREADS, all of them are really great and sometimes maddening too because of the vocal attempts of the lead singer and some electronic and extra dark sounds.    This is definitely, a must have, one of the best albums i have heard; i can understand that a lot of Portishead fans are dissapointed just because this is not trip-hop or something like that but if you are \\"oppen mind\\" you will enjoy this album.    About the booklet, it has no the lyrics sadly and is really really simple, with an strange picture of ...a factory maybe?, is really minimalist the artwork but stil great, i also love it.    Buy it, you will not be dissapointed
B0000261TE|5.0|Hi, The Cd\\"Beyond The Thunder\\" is awesome,love it, some of the most grooving and seductive music today. Neal Schon is the man, along with the band they bring the fire that give all the songs heart and passion any music enthusiastic out there this is one cd you need to check it out.      ThinkingMus.    Thanks
B000006047|5.0|I have always listened by a lot of people that this is according to them the best MA album, so when i saw it in a cd store i bought it.    ANd i have to say that the cd is really grat and awesome !!!!    The fist song is ANGEL, is trip hop mixed wit a little bit of rock, it grows magically with the passage of minutes.    RISINGSON is the 2nd and is trip hop-hip hop, really cool mixture and really nice song    TEARDROP is an ok song, maybe you will like it cause a lot of people love it, i think that is only good    INERTIA  CREEPS is Perfect, if i have to chose a word to describe that song it was definitely that, is magical very drum and bass and Robert del Naja voice is really suggestive, seems that the song is veru sensual o sexual, nothing bad, do not worry... is an excellent and perfect song ! awesome.    DISSOLVED GIRL is also PERFECT !!!! definitely excellent and very well singed, it is tri hop with a very rocker interlude (hearthbreaking electronic guitar sounds), is simply unique.    MAN NEXT DOOR is a good song, by Horace Andy    BLACK MILK, MEZZANINE and GROUP FOUR are similar to me, but all of them are great, sometimes drum'n bass, sometimes trip hop, all of them ar good.    The last son is EXCHANGE but it appears at first as the 5th track just instrumental and later closes the album singer by Horace Andy, is an ok and ejoyable song.    This is definitely a great album, a must have ! Fan or not you have to listen it and buy it !! Highly recommended.    10/10
B000PDYVVG|1.0|With so much fanfare surrounding this book and as someone who has traveled (as a woman solo) to Australia, Bali, Thailand, Japan etc. it was so lacking to the point of nausea.  And, to add insult to literary injury, the writing style was so elementary that it actually detracted from the already mediocre storyline.  Maybe a better writer could have done the story more justice??? Maybe!?!?

It is wonderful!<br /><br />Book One spans a period of about 14 years, beginning in 1911 and covering the period before, during and after World War I. In this installment, five families: American, German, Russian, English and Welsh, all related in some way, must endure the effects of both the First World War and the Russian Revolution.  Without going into all the characters (I think I counted 12), or the entire plot of this mammoth work, I'll just mention a few of the key players. There is Billy Williams who is just 13 when he is off working in the mining pits of Wales. Grigori and Lev Peshkov are orphaned Russian brothers, whose lives take dramatically different paths in life. There's the Fitzherberts who are wealthy aristocrats, and Lady Maud, finds herself falling in love with a Russian spy. Ethel, (Billy's sister) is the housekeeper for the wealthy Fitzherberts, challenging class distinction by having an affair with the earl for who she works. Gus Dewar is an American Law student, and son of a US Senator who finds himself in the War Room of Woodrow Wilson's cabinet.<br /><br />I'm extremely happy I didn't let the nearly 1,000 pages of this novel deter me. The pages practically turned themselves, and I was not disappointed. The review copy had a lengthy list of the cast of characters which was very helpful to refer back to. I am sure the finished copy will have something similar as well. There is a lot to take in with this novel, but I especially enjoyed reading about the underdogs of this novel: servants, miners, factory workers, and peasants alike. Class distinction is vividly portrayed. I thought all the info on WWI was interesting, and a lot to take in, as I am very rusty on this time in history. I liked that the author used some actual historical names in Fall of Giants: President Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill, Kaiser Wilhelm, Lenin and Trotsky. By doing this, it made the story all the more engrossing and realistic. Another sweeping Follett epic, set in another place and another time - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br /><br />This novel's release date is September 28, 2010. This book would be a great choice as an eBook selection for those who have an eReader. It can be tiring on the hands if you read and hold the 3+ inch thick book for long periods. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!. I liked that the author used some actual historical names in Fall of Giants: President Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill, Kaiser Wilhelm, Lenin and Trotsky.

B000M53GM2|5.0|After the end of the Roger Moore era I drifted away from the James Bond films, but Goldeneye well and truly brought me back into the fold.      The combination of the arrival of Pierce Brosnan in the Bond role, and the wonderful Sean Bean's characteristic charm and great portrayal as the only Bond 'villain' I was sad to see meet an end, made for one magic movie.  This particular outing of Bond showed a vulnerable side of him that we may not have seen before, in that he was torn between the good Alec Trevelyan 006/evil Janus characters.
0596805888|4.0|Not really a cookbook although there are some recipes in it.  More a book on the science of ingredients and the chemistry of cooking.  I thought it to be very interesting.
1439181780|5.0|This book is jus excellent, easy reading, beautiful graphic. A must read for all ages.
B001GCUO52|1.0|First of all I have been a fan of all of the Final Destination films. I was excited when this one was available on blu-ray. I popped it in my blu-ray player and within 30 minutes I was thinking about shutting it off. It was so fake and the special effects looked just ridiculous.   I would only recommend this movie if you have money to burn.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|a beautiful series, the scenery, the period dress, the personalities, headed by the great Judy Dench.  An insight in to the manners and class distinctions of the day.  I loved series 1, series 2 was not quite as moving, but enjoyable just the same.
B003INBNXO|4.0|This is an excellent action Movie. Not to mention the price I bought this for was ridiculously cheap. What a Bargin!!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Simply, it is one of the best TV sitcoms ever to air. It is witty, smart, incredibly intelligent, fast-paced, and above all...it has a wonderfully talented cast.
0545123283|4.0|I wasn't the biggest fan of Shiver. It's not that I didn't like the story...I just didn't really think it needed a sequel...at all. I thought the story resolved itself in quite a satisfactory way and, while I love Maggie Stiefvater's writing, I was almost disappointed to see that she'd jumped on the series train with Linger. That said, I was still very excited to have the opportunity to check it out before it ever hit stores.<br /><br />Linger is written from multiple POVs, including Grace, Sam, and the new wolf in town, Cole. I love the idea of this, and I think it's extremely effective and clever for authors to use this tactic, but I also think voices have to be completely unique when this is done. Yet again, as much as I really enjoyed this story, if I didn't know exactly who was talking, I'd be very confused because the voices were so similar.<br /><br />Either way, the pace of Linger is steady, flowing, and definitely entertaining. It was a worthy sequel, and while I still didn't love Shiver, I was quite taken by the story of Linger...it is very, very captivating. I give it a 4 out of 5, and I would recommend it to everyone, regardless if you loved Shiver or not!
030726999X|4.0|Didn't enjoy it as much as the other two -- too much background detail at the onset, however still caught up in the story and now wondering about a Book Four.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones are fantastic. The range on them is phenomenal. They fit my head perfectly and they look very good too. I had to play around with the software a few times because it was being a little touchy but other than that they are worth the price. The voice morphing is very fun to use and the Dolby surround sound will rock your socks.
B002N8A14M|5.0|Product was exactly as described.  Far superior to most Armbands on the market.  No fear of oversweating causing moisture to seep into the iPod.  Very functional.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Love Mumford so much! Best of all, \\"Sigh No More\\" was created with the intent of a capturing the spirit of their live show, an ambition that was a total success.
B000002J1M|3.0|3 1/2      Often considered the best of early Genesis, there still clearly sounds like a thematic and compositional evolution was right around the corner, leaving Foxtrot an often brilliant but splintered springboard unto sheer perfection.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I love this movie and the entire show! I can't wait to own the 2nd movie! I loved it too!
B002ZCDR88|4.0|There are a lot of good songs and also some that just drive me crazy-too repetitive or just not my style.  I really like the influence of bluegrass and blues in her music.  No cd will ever match Tigerlilly in my eyes.  Worth buying.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a handy tool.  Its well designed, easy to carry, doesn't feel flimsy and does a good job at general knife sharpening (both straight and serrated edges).
B003ODL004|5.0|I have loved Hans Zimmer's music for years.  This soundtrack to Inception blew me away.  Such a perfect compliment to the wonder that is Inception. I have some favorite tracks: Dream is Collapsing and Mombasa stand out for me the most.  What bugs me is that the album is missing some music that you can download at [...] and those tracks are incredible, too.  Why they chose to leave them out, I will never know.  I saw the movie in the IMAX format and it was loud.  So I often listen to the music a bit on the loud side to relive the experience.  The danger when I am driving is listening to Mombasa and finding myself exceeding the speed limit.  I wish they would release the whole movie score as a Composer's Cut.  I would definitely buy that, too.  But for now, this will have to do.  It is excellent.  Don't forget to check out [...] to download the additional tracks.  I listened to them over and over.  They would also increase my driving speed.  Good thing I don't yet have an MP3 player.
1416914285|3.0|I admit that I found this book to be entertaining enough that I wanted to finish it, and that--unfortunately--it's is definitely not the worst book I've read (although that's because I just read a truly awful book that was TERRIBLY written). I will also admit that there were items and ideas of definite interest in it. However, I cannot honestly say that it was at all good or that gave me any sort of satisfaction.<br /><br />The writing in this book was not the best, but it wasn't the worst, and it wasn't the Dan Brown type of overly-simplistic prose--there was a style, it just wasn't particularly impressive. There were some typos and some misused words, but not so many that it made me angry. The world the author created was interesting, visually and in terms of the mythology, the history, and the way things were done, and in some ways it was well thought out. Unfortunately the workings of it and the magic in it it were unstructured and didn't seem to follow real rules. The teenage characters were, well, teenagers. They didn't have much depth and didn't behave very consistently, but they weren't too offensive, and their characterizations by the author weren't too bad. The dialogue was mostly interesting to read, although cliched, but was at times unnatural--sometimes I really felt like the author had set up a whole scene just to have a place for a line she thought up and wanted to use. Or a line she had heard somewhere else...in fact, the most problematic issue for me was how much of this story came from other stories; how much of it I recognized.<br /><br />Clary Fray, a fifteen year old girl, discovers that she is not the mundane girl she'd always thought herself to be: she is a nephilim, has special abilities, and is part of a world with magic and creatures she never before knew existed, because her mother refused to acknowledge any existence of the supernatural. It turns out that within that world had been a dangerous group of people with the goal of trying to keep the world pure by wiping out all the Downworlders, the leader of whom was supposedly killed when Clary a baby, and her heritage was hidden from her for her protection. Unfortunately, it seems like Lord Valentine is back in the picture, and it's up to Clary and her new companions, other nephilim being trained to become Shadowhunters at the Institute (which is disguised from the sight of \\"mundanes\\"), to prevent him from getting what he needs to regain his power and complete his genocidal goal.<br /><br />Hmmm, that sounds kind of familiar...a bit like [[ASIN:054506967X Harry Potter (Book 1)]]. Wait, actually, it sounds exactly like [[ASIN:0439064872 Harry Potter (Book 2)]]. And amazingly, the similarities to [[ASIN:0439136369 Harry Potter (Book 3)]] don't end there: throw in a red-haired mother who sacrifices to protect her child, a flying motorcycle, a teacher who knew the protagonist's parents and their friends and a lot about \\"The Circle,\\" parents turn out to have been with the bad guy but got off easy after his downfall, a conveyance that recklessly travels city streets--even driving right up and over cars--yet is bizarrely unnoticed, and a number of other things that are way to specifically spoilery to mention here. This basically IS [[ASIN:0439139600 Harry Potter (Book 4)]], with a change of setting.<br /><br />That's not to say that there aren't similarities in themes, ideas, characters, dialogue, and plot points to plenty of other books, movies, tv shows, et cetera. There are, and they are numerous and obvious. But the similarities to [[ASIN:0439358078 Harry Potter (Book 5)]] are too huge to go uncomplained about. It was ridiculous. I guess this shouldn't be too much of a surprise, since the author was a well known [[ASIN:0439785960 Harry Potter (Book 6)]] fan fiction writer before being published. I should admit that, having known that before reading this book, it's possible that I was actively looking for similarities to [[ASIN:0545139708 Harry Potter (Book 7)]], but that doesn't change the fact that I found them--in, as you can see, spades.the fact that I found them--in, as you can see, spades.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|We have loved the movie for years and hum the songs all the time.  We have the soundtracks for some other Miyazaki movies and my 15-year-old son asked me if there was one for this movie.  I know Spirited Away had a wide release due to their Oscar win, but Howl's Moving Castle did not and you have to buy the import.  Other than not being able to read any of the tracks in Japanese, it plays beautifully.  My son listens to it on the laptop while he programs.  It keeps his brain happy.  I enjoy it, too, as I sit at another computer keeping up with the world.  Joe Hisaishi composes the most beautiful music for most of the films Miyazaki has made.  It is truly \\"moving.\\"
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I have been following the Planet Earth chapters from the beginning. I ordered the set on DVD, but now I saw this LIFE available on Blu-Ray and I did not hesitate to place an order. Be careful when you order, the US version is narrated by Oprah and I have read awful reviews about this. Stay with this version which is the one narrated by David Attenborough and it is great !!!
B000059Z8J|5.0|The only bad thing about this film is the Superman's spinning the Earth backwards scene which was unrealistic & dumb. Other then that, it's first-rate. I give this film a 9 out of 10.
0307454541|5.0|This series of 3 books was marvelous.  The \\"Millinium series\\" held my interst from page one to the end.  It had mystery, a love interest,and intrigue.  I enjoyed every page I read.  I'm having withdrawal systems because the author has passed away and the series willnever be finished!
1400063736|5.0|Seriously, who doesn't love New York. Sure, maybe on the surface we sometimes think it's too much. Too \\"out there\\". Too \\"if only they would behave\\". But deep down, aren't we all a little proud that there is such a thing as New York. With all its quirks and bravado. This book is an amazing feat, as it takes you to Manhattan on the day that guy walked between the Twin Towers. Then the symbol of nonsensical capitalism, now the symbol of freedom. The book guides you through different stories (much like the movie 'Crash' does) of different people. One more gripping than the other. They all have the 'Man on the Wire' in common - but also much more. I was gripped by the book.
0783225903|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in the 80's.  I was visiting friends, when they said, \\"We're going to a movie, want to come?\\".  I said, \\"Sure\\".  After all, they knew something about me, and i trusted that they'd know what I'd like.  In the car, they said it's called \\"Brazil\\".  Fortunately, this doesn't give anything away.  It's the title of the theme song.  It's not what the song is about.  It's not what the main screen writer and director Terry Gilliam thought the song is about.  For all intents and purposes, it has nothing to do with the movie.  And, they said that it's directed by Terry Gilliam.  I didn't catch the reference.  Maybe it was because movie directors isn't one of my big interests.<br /><br />Just before it was released, the movie was presented to a group of film critics.  This group votes on the year's 10 best and 10 worst movies.  Brazil was voted the #1 best movie, and significantly, the #1 worst movie.  That is to say, everyone had a strong opinion about it.  You'll either love it (as i do), or hate it.  I've not seen it at the video store for rent.  But there's a good chance you'll love it and want to see it dozens of times.  So my advice is this: buy it.  If you hate it, put it up on eBay.  Or, since it's cheap, just keep it.<br /><br />There.  I've told you everything you should know about it before watching it.  Especially if you don't know who Terry is.  Have fun with it.
0061537969|5.0|Lat year I was asked to name my favorite book and I couldn't come up with one. Sure, there are lots of great books, but I just couldn't put my finger on \\"the best.\\" That all changed when I read The Art of Racing in the Rain. Don't let some of these reviews fool you; this is not just a book about a dog's life. This is a book about LIFE and how to live it fully, graciously, and with dignity. It is truly inspirational. After reading it, I found myself telling strangers in the bookstore that they really should read this book! I hope you will read it, too, and add it to your list of favorites.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Persuasion is not one of my favourite Austen stories, but it's a good story and I enjoyed the 1995 version of the film. This version, however, is absolutely horrible. Many of the more recent (made in the 2000's) BBC adaptations to Austen novels have been more... artsy than previous interpretations of the novels, and to date I've enjoyed them. Sense and Sensibility was really well done, the older version of Emma was better but the 2000 one was still good. But Persuasion is where they drop the ball. This is more of an art film than it is a period piece and was almost painful to sit through. I found myself so bored at some points that I would think back to how the 1995 version did it and compare them just to keep occupied. There are so many over played emotions that are lost to the plot because the cameraman was given too much artistic liberty and you get lost in the angles and lenses instead of the plot and characters, and not in the good way.<br /><br />All I can say is that, if you have watched this film and haven't seen the version with Amanda Root as Anne, go watch it. She is not as pretty as the actress in this film, but Anne isn't supposed to be a world renown beauty, she's rather plain. It's a much better adaptation than this one.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This is the best album ive heard in a long time.   every song is a hit her voice is unique !    i wish ppl would give her a chance with her album.  i dont like her to be just a singles artist.
1563890119|4.0|I haven't really seen this addressed (although I haven't waded through all the other reviews).  Gaiman's storytelling is fantastic but some of the early art is very clumsy. I have to assume it was Sam Kieth since it improved as soon as he left.  It's primarily in the character design and execution, the overall layout is beautiful.  The art is often cartoony, characters' features seem unstable, looking different from panel to panel, their heads are often ridiculously large (I'm talking about human and human-shaped characters) and proportions, in general, are out of whack and not in an intentionally artful way..  There are some panels of Lucifer, in particular, that just look ridiculous and amateurish. Among other things he has a normally shaped head in closeup and a bobble-head in the full-body shots plus he appears to be wearing sweatpants!  The cartooniness often undercuts the moodiness.<br />Fortunately this settles down after the first 5 issues/chapters and by the time we get to \\"24 Hours\\" the art is appropriate to the story.
B0000542D2|5.0|I know, I know the sound is poor (for the music) and the formatting cropped so that it looks like a picture my kid took - off balance and as if we're missing something just out of sight - but for me the boys are the thing - john, paul, ringo and george - so young, so energetic, so adorable and, so audible and intelligible in this version you have to admit.  If we lost something in the music and it's depth and resonance we gained a lot back in the clean-up of the dialogue.  Personally I can't get enough of these 4 clowns/geniuses/legends and will enjoy them in whatever format I can get them as long as I have breath in my body.  The \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" sequence just slays me to this day no matter how often I watch it.  And George with his  \\"I'd be prepared for that eventuality,\\" or \\"She's a Drag. A well known drag!\\" just classic. Not to mention the precedent setting art direction and creative direction in this film.  For anyone that hasn't seen it and is interested in pursuing a career in film or music this movie should be required viewing! It's slick, clean and so hip!
B00005KARK|5.0|In the first week of having Dumbo, I think my daughter watched it about 20 times.  She loves it.  She's actually watching it right now.  It's one of my all time favorites and quickly becoming one of hers.
0061122416|5.0|I was not put off by the simplistic language and story--they are little more than a medium to convey the author's ideology and do a fine job of that. Read the book to be inspired to take charge of your life.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|There's actually another more complete cut called 'Superman II - Restored International Cut' - a 146 minute cut - which uses footage from the Donner, Lester and the ABC-tv extended cut versions.      Check out the details, pics and script dialouge from the re-inserted scenes in the comments below...
B00406UK7S|4.0|Neill Marshall knows how to make a genre movie. From the 'Squaddies vs Werewolves' carnage of [[ASIN:B000RW5BZ0 Dog Soldiers]], through the 'Cavers vs Underdwellers' horror of his best film [[ASIN:B000IHY9TS The Descent]], and on to the 'Lara Croft versus Punk-Rock Cannibal Scots' remake/homage of Escape From New York, the under-rated [[ASIN:B00195FUDC Doomsday]], Marshall has cheerfully hacked and slashed his way through many a limb on his quest for B-Movie excellence.     Centurion is no different, focussing on the mythical Roman 9th Company as they were sent into the wilds of Scotland to tame the Picts, and on Marshall's reading, face their annihilation. The soldiers are little more than British Squaddies in Roman Garb, replete with English accents and mano-a-mano bravado that wouldn't seem out of place in modern War movies. Any faint trace of political analogy with the invasion of Iraq that some critics have detected (Dominic West's General is sent into Caledonia for political reasons, and against his military assessment of the situation) is swiftly dropped after a first-act battle that leaves the Company decimated and the survivors on the run from the Picts, who are themselves surprisingly fleshed out, and dealt with somewhat sympathetically.     As Devin Faraci at Chud has pointed out, the last two acts of the movie are then basically a more violent version of the middle section of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and the viewer barely has time to get to know the outstanding Michael Fassbender and his motley crew before they are picked off in a chase across the mountains of Scotland by the unshakeable Pictish trackers. Shooting in the extremes of Scotland, Marshall excels in capturing the landscapes, and this is a beautiful looking movie that makes full use of mountain tops and foreboding forests.     There isn't a lot of originality on display here, but then, Marshall clearly isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. It's clear he isn't working on a budget anywhere near what Ridley Scott had on Gladiator, but he manages to squeeze every drop of money and get it on the screen. (Anyone interested in a more existential/arthouse movie of 'viking vs nature' should check out the lower budget, but equally beautiful [[ASIN:B00429MLXY Valhalla Rising]]). Centurion is recommended then for viewers who don't mind accepting the B-Movie parameters that Marshall embraces from the get-go.
