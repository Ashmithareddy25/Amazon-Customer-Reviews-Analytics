B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Cassandra Clare is the next J.K. Rowling/Stephanie Myers in my opinon. The magic, suspense, the heart raceing feeling you get when you read her books is well worth it. I cant wait for the movie to come out. I hope the stay on story line with this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I bought season 1 on my daughter's recommendation and was hooked.  High quality production, a splendid cast, a compelling story and a real sense of the place and time in history all made it addictive.  I thought Season 2 was great too but couldn't imagine how they could keep it going for a 3rd season without getting &#34;old&#34; but they did!  I was totally taken with every new installment.  I laughed, I cried and I felt part of all the action.  If it had been a book I would not have been able to put it down.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and this App, in my opinion is well worth it. It is exactly like Bingo Blitz on face book..
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Again it is agood game for my grandchildren but it does challemge you as you progress thru the levels -what else can I say.
B004HD61KE|2.0|I could not relate to this book and deleted it before finishing. Perhaps just a personal preferrence.  It did not keep my interest.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THIS BOOK IS SO AMAZING. I LOVED IT AND HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE WHO HASNT. ITS SO SAD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
B006LSZECO|1.0|the writing was tight but the subject was just a total waste.  I guess I just don't care for such destructive dysfunctional characters in my books.
B005COO1X6|5.0|You never cease to intrigue and amaze me.<br /><br />How do you suck me into a short story so quickly, that I feel I've know each character for a lifetime?<br /><br />You ARE the Master (as always)<br /><br />Respectfully,<br />CR Shannon
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am completely fascinated by these stories and am so sad it's now come to an end.  What an amazing ride with many twits, turns and of course a compelling love triangle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Wish the energy restored quicker. And the collections scrolled easier. but I like the friend assist  but it can really get you out of a bind.  all and all very amusing game to play.
0307341577|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Certainly different to anything I had read before.  Now reading the next book and note a pattern from the author of writing about troubled characters.  Both books took a little to get into but then I was captured.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I will preface this by saying, I love Chihuahuas. Never thought I'd say that, but I recently adopted and older rescue dog, and she has been wonderful. So now I'm on a Chihuahua kick and love all things Chihuahua.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and watched it twice. Even though there are some stereotypes (the Mexican gardener, the poor little rich girl), I actually thought the film is cute.  Chloe is a rich little Chihuahua from Beverly Hills who is taken to Mexico on vacation by her rich owner's niece. While she is Mexico she becomes lost and befriends a dog-fighting German shepherd who helps her out.  She learns a lot, but ultimately must be rescued from dognappers by the male dog Papi.<br /><br />There are some silly bits, like the Chihuahua rebellion and some of the rat/lizard antics, but nothing that I felt was over the top or had me reaching for the remote.<br /><br />Oddly, the only character I didn't like was Papi. I thought that he was an odd looking Chihuahua and the romance and his voice acting was too stereotyped.<br /><br />This was a cute film though. I liked Chloe a lot. Yes I ordered the sequel.
0307341550|3.0|First book I had read by the author.  Now reading Dark Places, which so far I prefer.  Both main characters are troubled individuals.  I had heard of &#34;cutting&#34; but this was extreme.  The ending left an opening for another book I suspect.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Nice pictures, relaxing music.  Options for number of pieces make this a fun app for myself as well as for my five -year -old daughter.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I love doing puzzles, but don't always have the space for them. This tablet version is a great replacement. The pickers are beautiful and varied. You can select the number of pieces for more challenging play. I did have a few problems with pieces getting stuck or hidden under the puzzle, but those were minor issues. Works okay on my Acer Iconia 500.
B009AP2G26|2.0|Story line is deteriorating seriously.  Emma's abandoning her wedding made no sense.  Characters in NYC disconnected from characters in Ohio.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I love mahjong games, but this one takes the game to a whole nother level with the 3-D view. The app works well on my Acer Iconica 500, with all the flipping and turning I had to do to find all the tiles. I was glued to it for at least 2 hours straight! I highly recommend this for mahjong addicts (like me) who are looking for more of a challenge.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a little slow at parts and your feeling kept changing between the two main characters.  I loved the ending.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|love amanda bynes this was a great and funny movie.<br />if you love these type of movies you will love this one.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Bones are forever reminded me a bit of an episode of Law & Order in that the initial crime led to an even more complex crime that the story primarily focused on.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A very enjoyable read with very interesting characters. Not my favorite book ever, but I would recommend others to read it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think it is a very great game it will make you think and want to make a high score u will love it.
B0007PALSE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for one of my children.  They loved the movie.  It's futuristic, lots of action, Will is always great and was fun to watch in this film.  The package arrived securely wrapped, the movie was in great shape and played flawlessly.
B00338QENI|5.0|A friend recommended this book to.me.  I. Can't believe I had not already read it.  Its very interesting and a great page Turner.  How far we've come in medicine in a few short years
B005LAII80|4.0|Wasn't quite what I expected.  Not as much fun as the first.  The original has light moments in it.  This one is totally serious.  Lots of action, cool futuristic weapons and computer technology.  Liked the movie but disappointed with the ending (can't say why since that would be a spoiler).
B0053TMP24|5.0|The book answers many questions asked previously but then adds on cliff hangers to keep you reading to find out, perfect book
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Since Songcatcher and Phantom of the Opera I have been thrilled every time I heard Emmy Rossum sing. She has a marvelous voice and isn't afraid to sing songs and make music that isn't in the sometimes bland &#34;mainstream.&#34;
B00821OX98|4.0|In the past I've found shows that I really enjoy, that have been canceled before coming to a logical conclusion, like Jericho. I hope this is not one of them. This is a great show with great acting and I hope the network lets it come to its conclusion.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Grandchildren love it.  Good material, well made, shipping was fast, easy. Cleaned up good after a spill, material doesn't<br />come off when played with.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|A Very Bloody & action packed Kung Fo Movie, The best thing about it is the 2 very noteable Stars. Russel Crow & Lucy Li, Our just out of this world.
B006LSZECO|2.0|At first I enjoyed this book, but the more I read, the more I realized how crazy these two were. I've never felt so disconnected from the main characters in a book before.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story plot starts off with an easy catch and difficult to figure out where the story is going as to what keeps you reeled in.
B000BISBDY|4.0|I got this for my grandmother and she loves it. she watched the walk the line movie, then requested as many CDs as we cold fine. one happy grandmother!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This app is so much fun but better than temple run not temple run two but just temple run OMG love it ........like amazing...............GET THIS APP!!!!!!! Get this app.....this app is so much fun!!!!!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Great price, and excellent model, I am an adult collector, this piece is a great build, and I enjoyed it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy playing with it. It always makes me laugh and giggle. that I think that many people would like to play this game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kept me interested after the I managed to get through the first few chapters. The ending was ridiculous & I truly hated how it ended. Sure it's different but anticlimactic & disappointing. Expecting so much more after the great reviews!
B004D20JP2|5.0|This version of Peter and the Wolf is a bit different than what I was familiar with, but I love it.<br />My 3-yr-old granddaughter and I have watched it several times, and although there are a few tense moments, all-in-all it is a great story for kids, full of compassion and peace-building ideas.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show and watch it every week. After an episode I'm always anxious for the next week's. great series!
B000002GYG|5.0|This is the second Tom Waits album I bought (the first was SMALL CHANGE) and I saw him live about a year later at Music Hall. He was just as brilliant that night as he was when this superb album was recorded. A must-buy if you're a fan or Waits novice.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|A satire on the modern post-9/11 world: the US feminized chaired by Sarah-Palin-like character exercising the Star-War-sort powers defend the Earth (and own secret energy storages) from the descendants of Nazis survived and built their state on the Moon nearby these Helium-stored towers mentioned already...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is a page turner. Full  of excitement and mystery. Extremely well written. Can never guess the ending. good read
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|there are only 14 games per type (4) as opposed to almost triple on the phone app. Color is vibrant if you like that type of thing
B0054JELS4|5.0|Just became an NCIS fan.  Watching the first eight seasons helped me understand what was going on in this current season.  They are all great seasons.  Was so involved, couldn't watch anything else until I had watch it all.  Go Bucks!!!!
1427210241|3.0|Story was of course great, but over 8 of the CD's had skips in multiple areas.  Get this book its worth it.
B009MO5ES8|1.0|I think bike delivery people in New York are the only ones who would appreciate this movie.  I kept on waiting for the good part to start, it never did.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton doesn't disappoint! Prepare to set aside most of your day, becuase you'll want to watch the whole season in one sitting!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If you are taking notes and want to see your notes on almost every device than evernote is a must. I have been using it mlre than a year and I dont know what else can give me the same rich functionality. They absolutely know what they are doing. One missing thing abiut this would be highlighting selcted text. I am not exactly sure why they don't implement such a feature but I am waiting for it to come.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Totally awesome.  3-D is great.  Something is flying off the sreen alll the time.  Great story also.  I highly recommend
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book is well written and is in the form of a scholarly format complete with footnotes, appendices and bibliography. Additionally the book draws one's interest to the story. My sister thought it is the best thing since sliced bread.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Four of the best voices ever in a beautiful venue with acclaimed orchestra.<br />Simply fantastic. Oustanding value and addition to your collection.
B009P13RQY|5.0|The Sword RULES enough to make me say in print that something rules.  Hawks and Serpents is this album's Arrows in the Dark.  Just buy it.
B00AA0U05A|2.0|Not a good voice, she sounds weak. Really bad syrupy arrangements. If you like overly sanitized high-school theatre talent quality show-tune style, go right ahead, but otherwise I wouldn't advise it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this program is better than any movies playing today in local theaters. The acting is outstanding<br />and the story line gets better and better each session.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Excellent movie! I liked the plot. The special effects were very professional and vivid. I would love to see Thor 2 and 3 Etc!!
B0055OK2T0|3.0|The Adjustment Bureau is the latest in a growing list of posthumous film adaptations based on the works of Philip K. Dick; my review will be terse. Right off the bat, I've never seen a screenplay more outright derivative of other far better films -- I'll let YOU reckon which ones. (It might be a fun game!) Toward the end I kept saying to myself: Please, PLEASE don't make this be like The Graduate! (LOL)<br /><br />Also, a major annoyance was the sheer number of overtly deliberate contrivances to \\"adjust\\" the narrative and give our hero a possible out. C'mon people, a little subtlety goes a long way. Still, the ending was unexpected and somewhat satisfying and Matt Damon sold his character well enough, yet this could have been SO much better. (sigh)
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Nice button added to existing Mag Lite.  It is much more convenient than having to turn the head on the light.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Highly recommend it to anyone.  Great addition to any movie lover's collection- from one to another.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Bought it for my grandson to watch. He enjoyed it alot. I have yet to sit and watch it. Thanks
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this film!  Great children's film, but also a nice addition to an adult film collection as well.  great service.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As with the first of the trilogy, I could not put this down. The end of each chapter just keeps one wanting more. Can't wait to start the final book.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My two year old daughter loves it!  I cannot tell you how many times we have found ourselves walking through the house singing &#34;All the Birds of a Feather&#34;!
B006OEPITO|1.0|This book is horrible . Way to boring is endless and meaningless i definitely do not recommend it for anyone to lose their time on it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME its fun great for kids and simple the only complaint I have is it crashed the first time I bought it! BEST GAME EVER!!! FELL IN LOVE WITH IT IN TEN SECONDS FLAT!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Superb acting, great story lines, this show never lets up and after each episode you wonder how it can stay so strong and relevant after four years but it does!  The only &#34;problem&#34; is that you really need to watch this show from season 1 onward as there is so much character development throughout that picking it up in the middle would leave the viewer without a ton of necessary backstory.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Worst book I've read in a long, long time.  Poor writing, ridiculous and naive story.  I can't believe I wasted my time reading this garbage!
B0071NLG0W|5.0|Perfect story! suspense,  laughter and a great ending ! Ms. Hodge never fails to deliver the best. She leaves me wanting more Amber Fox antics.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Who does not love Bob Marley.  He transends all ages.  This is a no brainer.  So pony up and get it.
B00B2166BS|3.0|The  one and only reason to pay $25 for this cord is how easy is to connect. The indention on the front of this cable makes it easy to align, and the reasonably strong magnets snap right into place once you place the connector in the general location. I have had no trouble connecting this cable in a pitch black room.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just didn't find the cord comfortable while I was holding my tablet. In portrait mode, I have to hold uncomfortably low. In upright landscape, I can't rest the tablet against anything, and flipping the tablet over puts my hands where they muffle the speakers.<br /><br />I wish the manufacturers had spent a few more cents on plastic to turn this into a charging stand, but  after weeks of use, I still consider this charger the best option for bedside recharging.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Enjoyed this movie. The cast was a list of many favorite actors and the plot lived up to my expectations.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We cannot wait for season four season one and two and three were absolutely unbelievable I want to eventually buy the whole thing so I could watch it a number of years down the road!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series even though I was 40 years late in starting it.  Love being able to go back in time to see great programming.
B001IMR7RS|5.0|There was a time when I could go to the local record store, plunk down my hard earned cash for a new album, and listen to every song, over and over. There were no weak tracks, no \\"filler,\\" no wtf moments.<br /><br />I experienced that feeling again with The Blackening. Metalcore mixed with old-school thrash (like Puppets-era Metallica.) It even has two killer covers, Iron Maiden's \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" and Metallica's \\"Battery.\\"
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Interesting to learn how this couple resolved their differences and found some sort of common ground.<br />I still find it hard to imagine that lifestyle no matter how much love is actually felt.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Our family enjoyed this movie.  We have 3 boys and they all really liked it.  We like a lot of the actors that are doing the voices.  It is worth watching.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I only had it for my grandsons and they have outgrown it.  It is fun for the very young, I think.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Do rent this movie. It's worth watching, with some gripping moments and stellar acting. I just didn't expect to dislike Denzel Washington's character so much...and so soon. It's a credit to the writers that they cast him in such a derelict, though charming, role so quickly. And though there were only a few logical endings possible I really didn't know how it would end until the last.
6305754969|5.0|A good old fashion cowboy movie with John Wayne and a great supporting cast.  I believe the Director was also an award winning one in his time.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Pretty good book I will read this book again Kate. Morton is a very good author I give it thumbs-up
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very surprised how this went.  This will definitely go on my read again shelf. Anyone over the age 13 can read this but a parent should read first because of sexual content for any questions they may have. Characters were really strong and I would like to see a novella about Brecken, he sounds like someone I would like to hang out with. Will definitely read more from this author.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I've read critiques of Skyfall and I don't get it. This is clearly the best of the Daniel Craig Bond films--the last third of the film as compelling as any in the franchise. It was great in HD and the sound quality was exceptional. Great movie and great instant video viewing experience!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is way better than temple run 1.much more action and fun. I recomend this game for every1. it should be 5 stars.
B0093DNRY6|5.0|I'm lucky to be in St. Louis and be able to hear TBP every January for the last number of years.  I love the way they've evolved.  This album shows them at their best.  I wanted to hear every song multiple times.  They still keep the basic trio sound, but some other sounds have been added occasionally.  They work well.  Satire and irony are detectable in the song titles and the music itself.  &#34;in Stiches&#34; is certainly not, but may be their masterpiece.  What thoughts come to mind with &#34;Re-Elect That&#34;?  This album will continue to be played for a long time.
B00005JPSM|5.0|I so the previews of this movie before I watched it, I've always enjoyed Catherine Zeta-Jones, which is why I knew I like this movie.
3795753384|5.0|Great vocal score.  Good paper and binding.  Readable print size.  Table of contents.  The only way it could possibly be improved would be to have the translations included.
B001TODCII|5.0|I absolutely loved this suspense filled movie.  Every girl wishes she had a daddy like this.  He did just what he told her he would do, which was to find her and bring her home.
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|This movie was so bad it made me laugh at times where I think I was not supposed to. I mean I honestly believe there was great vision here and you could cherry pick some amazing imagery through-out the film, but the actual movie between those still shots was quite horrible.<br /><br />I think if the movie had fewer characters, RZA could have focused on developing more of a story. Not to mention, there seems to be a lack of details plaguing the entire film. Like bad guys who could act, for instance. Bautista was the only bad guy who could act worth a damn and he barely spoke. This is sad, because that's not saying much as he's a goddamn WWE wrestler. attention to detail in all of the scenes tying the movie and story together was needed tbh. This movie could have and should have been better. This was supposedly the product of what the RZA learned after &#34;studying&#34; under Tarrantino. I mean WTF were you guys doing?<br /><br />The CGI effects were mostly halfassed and mostly not needed. Bautista's brass body effect , for instance, could have been done much better or at least more sparingly with some imagination to greater effect.(I would have warned spoilers, but this turkey is already rotten)<br /><br />The greatest crime to the cinema here was the sound track. At times the music just did not match what was happening on film. Instead of helping you immerse into a scene, it only further disconnects you and that's just bad. And I don't mean the hiphop; that stuff was actually good. I mean some of the other music was just wrong for the scenes they were placed in. I expected more than this from RZA.<br /><br />All said and done. I hope RZA works on more movies and learns from this. I saw a movie I could have loved if it had been done right and I hope to see more that come closer in the future. This is a genre that needs help.
B002APU580|4.0|I like this movie, I'd seen it on television and when the opportunity presented itself, I bought it.  I think that Keira Knightley was great in this movie.
B002776NS2|5.0|Most soothing music I'll buy more like this! Recommended for anyone who stays wound up with stressers. Thanks for the destressor.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am addicted!  Great variety. They can be done in what ever size  you prefer for relaxation or a challenge
0545265355|5.0|Brought this book set overseas to satisfy a colleague's teen aged daughter's appetite for reading.  Seems both girls (13 and 20 years) devoured it over that first week. When put on the phone to thank me, the younger one could only explain that the stories were, &#34;Indescribable!&#34;  We are all very satisfied with this product!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great book.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  This is a book that you don't stop reading until you have read all of it.  Great suspense with a happy ending.  Every person who has been through this kind of trama needs a happy ending,
0756405890|5.0|I really loved reading this first book...after about 125 pages.  It's not that the first 125 pages weren't good, they were just kind of aimless.  Luckily a friend sort of warned so I pushed on and it truly wasn't long before I was hooked.  I just recently started reading The Wise Man's Fear and I am equally as engrossed.  Well done Mr. Rothfuss.  I can't wait for the third installment.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|One of my all time favorite anime shows. First watched the episodes when i was only 7 years old and watching it now, as a 22 year old, brings back good memories as well as still keeping me captivated and interested in the plot and characters.
B004RR5HQO|4.0|I like this album,not as much as The Power and the Glory but it holds my attention in some places more than others. I was just going to buy [Black Cat]because i really like that song but then i said \\"i don't want a taste\\" i want the whole album! Glad i got it too,if anything Gentle Giant's Acquiring The Taste is a good listen,as always.[[ASIN:B004RR5HQO Acquiring The Taste]]
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I enjoy Steam, I buy all my games on Steam, my gf shares my account and we can both play Skyrim side by side on our computers at the same time using one account. We buy co op games and have LAN parties because Steam is pretty simple to set up games with. The layout is easy to navigate, annnnnnnnnd yeah. I guess the only one negative thing I can think of is sometimes Voice chatting through steam can be wonky. I use skype instead. That's about it.
B002SXXGBC|5.0|The power and the glory[[ASIN:B002SXXGBC The Power And The Glory]]is a wonderful musical ride. If you love listening to music,music of any kind...you will enjoy Gentle Giant's 1974 masterpiece ! The album cover art work is the cherry on top complimenting the musical art that's inside. Some call this progressive rock [maybe] all i know is whatever they've conjured up it works period.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting, costumes & staging are excellent. The story line is slow at times, but is Appropriate for the time period. Looks great on my kindle fire HD 8.9.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was pretty good.  I've read better, I've read worse.  It kind of reminded me of a weird soap opera.  *SPOILER ALERT*  She was with Holder, and they found out that she was kidnapped when she was around three I think.  (it's been a while since I read the book, so bear with me!)  Then they found out that they knew each other and they were really good friends.  They also find out that she was raped by her dad.<br /><br />Other than the fact that I thought this would make a good soap opera, the book was relatively good.  It was pretty good. I enjoyed it overall.  I would recommend it to my friends.  If you dislike a lot of drama, and soap operas, I don't recommend this particular ebook.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't think I would get into this book. I started reading it 2 days ago and could barely put it down. Never expected the plot to turn out as it did. This wasn't predictable by any means, which I hate when watching a movie or reading a book. I recommend this book highly.  You won't be disappointed.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child's books have a lot of twists and turns and keep my interest.<br />Jack Reacher is quite a character, and there's always a mystery<br />to be solved.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This is a fun game and all but it's a little too short but way better then all the ones that scam you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You have to add this game to your watch list.  Great game to unwind to.  Fun game to play and enjoy
B008TMA1LY|5.0|It took me alittle while to figure it out..I should of waited for my grand-daughter to show me..But I got it and it is fun.. Now I have to share with them.<br />Looking for more apps like this one for my kindle. Thank-you
1250006341|5.0|I just love this book.  It have passed it around to all my friends as we all love Downton Abbey.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Did not watch this movie yet..Still downloading. Our internet is so slow it will take 24 hours to get it here.  Good thing I have a month to watch it. and I can't wait!!
0345529057|5.0|I just love this series and am going to order the next one which is out in hardback only at this time, but I can't wait since I am almost done with book 4.  The HBO series is unbelievable too!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love the ability to check when I am away from home, hate to miss anything at my age!  Also a quick way to check weather when needed.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Entertaining!  A little predictable at times but Denzel Washington does an excellent job.  The flight scene in the beginning is fantastic!
B007N8RULO|4.0|So handy to have when in doctors office waiting and a quick time filler when waiting at school for grandchildren, keeps the brain active
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I can't complain. I bought this such a long time ago, but never got around to use it. I can't say it works, but I did recieve it and it was brand new in the package.
B005PK56TA|5.0|If you like a good Horror flick; this is it. Mind bending! I have completed the season; will watch again.
B00136JT3Y|4.0|Usually there are several songs on a CD I don't care for but not on this one. An excellent collection of songs...especially Dear Mister President
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Don't worry about losing the pacifier anymore with this awesome product. We have two different ones and my baby loves them!  At just 2 months old he figured out how to wrap his arm around the animal and push his binky in his mouth, and now at 7 months old he loves to hold the animal while he sucks on the binky.<br />We also used one of these for my older son, and when we were ready to wean him from the binky we cut the tip of the binky off and he still had the animal to comfort him. It really helped him with the transition.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked it but got bored with it, it was just okay. I did not like the ending, wish he would have left her.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This app works really well, and people who say it doesn't are being a little negative. I can create videos, and best of all, it devides the pictures from different games into sections, which means I have a section for each game's photos.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I downloaded this album on a whim because A). it was $3 and B). because it had almost nothing but 5 star reviews. I was not a bit disappointed. Nearly every song is great and catchy and I've been thoroughly enjoying it ever since downloading it. I'd definitely recommend the album to anyone who likes punk rock and just good music in general. Buy it now before the price goes back up!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I originally got this for my mom for Christmas. She loved it and I definitely got hooked on the show.
B00683JK9K|5.0|My husband and I have both been enjoying doing these puzzles. They are a great way to unwind at the end of the day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The pinterest app works perfectly on the kindle fire. It 's fast and the photos are clear. I love organizing my digital life!
B00846F1YW|1.0|I decided not to install this app after discovering that it was created by a group of developers in St. Petersburg, Russia.  It may be fine, but I didn't care to chance it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Clever, exciting, Downton Abbey makes all other drama series seen infantile. I truly enjoy the roller coaster of interactions the characters have with one another. Tension is created between them, then resolved then created again and the witty humor gives a lovely lift at the right time during the stories. I thoroughly recommend this show.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is app has given me no trouble. it's nothing fancy;just does what it's supposed to do. I like that I can have multiple alarms set
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is fun and keeps me busy for hours on end. It also keeps my brother off my back for hours
B00A4SJ61W|4.0|Good movie that gave my family some good laughs. Plot kept us interested throughout movie. Nice music choice and would recommend.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The story was fascinating and the characters were even better!  Moyes never succomed to sappiness.  The relationships were all very believable.
B008DL466C|2.0|Does this guy know how to talk about anything other money and smokin? WOW and this guy is rich huh. Anyways I only bought 2 songs, Work Hard Play Hard, I love the beat and Remember Me, this song actually would have been better off without him, his part pretty much has nothing to do with the song and guess what, he talks about money and smokin again. I work so hard for my money and live pay check to pay check but people like him are rich, it really bugs me sometimes. I am glad I did not buy the whole album, I was excited for Rolling Papers because I loved Black and Yellow and that album was complete trash and from what Ive heard off this new album its pretty much the same other then the 2 songs I like.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Make no mistake, the zombies provide plenty of gore and action.  But what really makes this show tick are the interpersonal relationships and internal struggles the characters deal with while facing nearly impossible odds.  The series is well produced, beautifully shot and well written. The actors do a great job of handling the Georgia accent, too...a rare accomplishment!
1419705849|5.0|Our family loves this series and reads them as soon as they come out. Hilarious as usual with age-appropriate awkward situations like bad dates and parental conflicts. With a 10 yr old and 13 yr old it always hits close to home!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|If you watch this expecting an intelligently woven tale, you'll be extremely disappointed. But if you expect goofy, throwaway lines, references to past films the actors have been in and lots of things being blown up, you'll be satisfied. It's worth an evening of guilty pleasure, action and laughs. Watch for a hysterical scene with Chuck Norris!
B004HD61KE|4.0|Rollins is still at the top of his game. I get a little impatient with the romantic elements, but I also know that publishers are always telling writers (inaccurately!) that nothing will sell without romance in it, so I understand why writers are afraid to leave it out these days. A shame though -- think how much more action could be packed into a book if the mushy stuff didn't have to be there!
B007SNFTAI|5.0|This was a very well written and detailed account of the lives of its protagonists. The storyline moved along effortlessly and held my interest throughout. Lots of twists and turns. Some have found it to be too long and detailed but I felt it was a story sensitively and compellingly told.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Grabbed this as the free app of the day. Wouldn't buy it for myself, but would recommend it for kids. It's very cute, and not too challenging. The level of difficulty can be chosen in-game, so it would be appropriate for someone with kids of varying ages.  At the &#34;professional&#34; level, it provides brief, mindless entertainment for an adult waiting in a grocery line.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|The appearance of the case is very nice.One thing I find that I don't like is the difficulty of turning the kindle upright in the revolving part. It is very stiff and doesn't appear straight. It is tilted somewhat.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|heart warming and funny. Mark and Mia make an awesome team in this movie. Plus Patrick narrating it is hilarious
0441013597|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite books. Anyone who enjoys scifi should add this one to thier reading list.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a wonderful classic of English literature. Besides, it is a really good novel not only about love, it is also a criticism about an English age.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is far and beyond one of my favorite books of all time. Anyone who enjoys scifi should read this book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Catching up on Amazon Instant Video, all but the 5th season free with Prime membership, has been a great deal.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The movie arrived in the correct time frame, and it was brand new (still in the plastic wrap). It had no problems playing.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to navigate through and find what you need.  Not as good as online but easy to see what is going on.  Again touch is very sensitive so things pull up that I don't want.
0792844890|4.0|The movie came on time, and it played. However, the disc was one of those two-sided ones, and I'm glad it was, because one of the sides was messed up. There were scratches on the tape that caused it to skip large sections of the movie. I flipped it to play the other side, and it worked great. So, not a big problem, but it was an inconvenience.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|In his usual fashion, Carl Sagan has crafted a story that explores what would really happen in all spheres of influence if alien life were to make contact with the earth. This idea is conveyed by thrilling performances from Foster and the rest of the cast. This is an enjoyable film for lovers of science as well as anyone who enjoys a good story. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this book and was just amazed at what you can keep deep inside and just shut it away in a dark place because it is too painfull. Amazing!
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|I am already paranoid about the government and I already think the senators think they are gods. this confirmed it for me once again.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This complicated book requires attention and the rereading of many passages.<br /> I have recommended it to others and will read it again.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Skyfall lives up to the Bond tradition with non-stop action and suspense. I watched it on a non-HD TV out of curiousity and the stream adapted to the technology with no obvious limits and avoided the reloading that I would have expected. The movie is a bit long, but I loved every minute of it:)
B00846F1YW|5.0|This a good hidden object game.  I lose track of time everytime I play it.  I haven't had any bad issues with this App.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I bought this used and was afraid the digital copy wouldn't work but it worked just fine. Very happy with my purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun challenge, especially as you get more squares and more dots. Now I have my husband hooked on it, and we challenge each other.
1401310672|5.0|Whenever I am in a sour mood, I pick up this book and laugh at the expense of others.  I find these auto corrects hilarious and they always bring out the biggest of belly laughs in me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book told his story and I believe he was a great man, that had to do a great service for are country
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I began reading this book not knowing what to expect. I had never read Nicholas Sparks before. I had seen The Notebook but not read the book. This book was highly rated, so I thought I would give it a try. I won't say it wasn't a &#34;readable&#34; book because it was. The chapters flowed easily enough. The main problem that I had with it is that it was way too predictable. I felt like I knew what was coming the whole way through the book. To me, this is a story that has been told time and time again. Also, the only true bit of spontaneity in the book, which happens at the end, was totally unbelievable to me. I know there are many fans of the book out there. I just left disappointed.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Held you in your seat couldn't be any better great story line and the action was the best bond yet
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I like it. Great graphics and fun to play. It's not free (3.14for full game) but compared to free hidden object games it 100 times better and I suppose worth the money, and you get no adverts which is good but of course would be great if it was cheaper.
0800141660|5.0|For more than 50 years Jane Austen has been one of my favorite authors.  This novel is second in my hierarchy of her novels.  My favorite is Pride and Prejudice.  I find the others dissapointing and will probably not bother to review them.<br /><br />At the time of this writing there are over 500 reviews alredy on Amazon.  Why do I bother you with this?  Simply to add my praise.  The plot of the movie is already very well told in other reviews.  The background on Austen is likewise well covered.  I will only add my praise of Thompson's excellent speech at the Golden Glove ceremony.<br /><br />If you like Austen, you will love this movie.  If you are unaquainted with Jane Austen, try this movie and you will undoubtedly read her books.<br /><br />Watch or read or both and enjoy yurself immensely.  Thank you for your time and attention.
B004KU832S|4.0|it is little pricey but it is a good little toy. Creative. Little too small, the train cars and the people but my son likes it and played a lot with it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Show me anything with a post apocalyptic theme and I'm hooked. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Of course, there are always small inconsistencies in any science fiction stories. Just let it go and enjoy!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is a movie that was made about the hardships caused by the great dustbowl, and the people who survived the hardships caused by the poor practices in using the land.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|Loved this movie from start to finish. Did not like some of the language but other then that it was great.
0307719219|5.0|got this book in about 2 days. i love reading it. it has so many great historical examples and the book itself is great, aesthetically. I got it in hardcover, and when I discuss the issues mentioned in the book, I can recall them with ease because they are presented so well (like anecdotes in a conversation)
B00846F1YW|2.0|I was enjoying this app but it all came to a halt when I got to the third level and the game would not let me progress.  I think I was supposed to log into one of two social apps to progress.  I chose not to do this and the game stopped for me and I could not get back in.  I tried twice.  This is a shame because I was enjoying it.  Perhaps some changes can be made in order for the players to fully enjoy the game.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I got this for my husband he loves this movie and watches it frequently  he likes the action and he is a fan of Clive Cussler  books and has most of them.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This app is offers a wide selection of radio stations all over the world.  I like it.  It is easy to use.  You can be entertained by many different kinds of music.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Since I really love Downton Abbey, I decided to watch Upstairs Downstairs and see what it is all about.  Good!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This new Bloons is great! The new upgrades make it challenging but fun! Works great for the Kindle Fire Tablet.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I had never watched this show before, but since I love Downton Abbey, I decided to give it a try.
1455523550|5.0|Hands down, one of the most heartfelt novels I've read! Nicholas Sparks does a wonderful job with the plot line of the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecaft is cool. It is so fun that I could play it all day!!! I love minecraft.It rocks. I love it. If you get it you will love it for ever!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show, good quality! Definitely worth the money you pay. Can't wait for season 3 to come out!
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I have read most of her books.  It will be a sad day for me when I have read them all.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It is thought-provoking, with a vivid account of the author's experience as well as his scientific assessment.  For a good portion of the book, the content flips back-and-forth between the authors near-death experience and the things that are taking place in regular life (among his family, friends, and doctors) during the same time period.  I found myself skimming the &#34;regular life&#34; sections and focusing more on his experience and, later, scientific assessment.  The message of the story (besides that of convincing the reader that his experience was real) is about love in its purest form.
B002C949KE|5.0|This book is full of examples of how people think, backed up by the research performed by the author.  At times, I would find myself critiquing the bias in a research experiment, only to find in the following pages that the author identified the potential bias as well and responded by conducting variations on the experiment to rule out the bias potential.  I left the book feeling that the research was sound.  For me, the book was more of a &#34;skimmer,&#34; as each section is very detailed, with lots of technical information and lots of suggested applications of the knowledge gained for each finding.  I found myself more drawn to the technical/research side than to the application portions, as I enjoyed drawing my own conclusions.  This book could easily be sat down for awhile and come back to or read alternatively with a different book as the chapters are independent for the most part, though there are brief references in some chapters to previous content.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I enjoy this game... but get annoyed that it is only free for a level... then they want $5.00 to continue. I paid the $ only to get about another hour of play!!!! Not worth it!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is SO awesome! I'm home schooled and when I can't find my calculator for algebra it's always nice to have this with me! The only bad thing is I wish it had more things on it. But other than that it's great!:)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it and loved the ending of it. I suggest if u watched the movie that u also read the series.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|In the dystopian alternate present that  Lauren Oliver has crafted sixteen year-old Lena haloway lives in a world where love is eradicated and forbidden but finds herself catching the disease Amor delira nersova from the charming Alex. Wistfully crafted and beautifully written with twists in the plot as well as some heartstopping action delirium is a good $9 spent. It is similar to the hunger games and the divergent series.Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is a a game that is easy to understand and play,though it still has some challenges. I just got it yesterday and I already love it! The game has amazing 3D graphics and lots of stuff to do to keep you entertained. It's perfect for any horse lover out there. Thanks for the game Amazon!
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Coping with Alex`s disappearance alone and hungry in the wilds Lena struggles to survive  both physically and mentally as she seeks comfort in new friends and companions ans well as new losses that come with them. Told from two different  time frames Lauren Oliver yet again crafts a dystopian thriller that will keep you reading late into the night
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Good movie. Lots of funny parts and good graphics. The story was good and wasn't really any slow parts.I would recommned to my friends
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book made me laugh and made me think, and I couldn't put it down. John Green has a knack for writing &#34;Young Adult&#34; books that are really not just for young adults. The themes tackled in this book are relevant for adults and stick with you after you have finished it.
034580404X|5.0|I started reading this novel by a friend suggestion... As soon as I started reading I couldnt stop. I loved it! It is a well written love story with erotic tone...
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I had several laugh-out-loud moments while reading this book and it was truly just one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. In spite of the unusual setting (a boarding school in Paris) I found the way it dealt with teen friendships, relationships with parents and with the opposite sex, angst, and school life very believable and true-to-life. This is one I will definitely read again.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|While the procedure to save the plane and passengers were with in the realm of possibility. Under the circumstances I don't see how the pilot would be in any condition to fly the plane. That part is unreal and scary.  I think any person taking drugs and alcohol would be disoriented as to not be able to handle a situation like that let alone fly,
6305313687|5.0|Norton plays the role like he's been  starved to reveal his true character. This movie is one to remember. The messages it sends are horrific yet revealing about the real world. I will watch this movie more than twice to complelely digest the story as I do with all my movies. I received the movie before it was promised and the DVD is in tip top condition. I will use this seller again. Thankyou Melvin
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this to supplement the weather app that came on my iPhone. It gives me all I need to worry about and more.
0446343129|5.0|This is another book I read about 20 years ago and found it to be insightful and mind-boggling!  Again I wanted to give it to a friend and thought it was out of print.<br />But, Glory be, I found it on Amazon.com.<br />Another book I think everyone should read.
B001IF252M|5.0|I bought the Macbook Pro with the 13.3&#34; monitor. Since I am on it 95% of the time at home, I purchased this adaptor so I can use my big monitor instead. This way I can keep the Macbook closed on my home computer desk - and the external monitor which is much easier on my aging eyes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love curling up with my ipad, headphones, and a warm cup of tea to run away to England with this lovely family!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unexpected surprises. Good, slow, deep storytelling style. Makes me want to learn more about that day and age. Highly recommended show!
B0036UW09U|3.0|Streisand is amazing!  Kristofferson is funny in a sad sort of way.  The film is overall only ok.  But all in all, this is a fun blast from the past!
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|As a student of the Holocaust, I  try to read many of the books on this subject. This true story is a quick read. It was amazing that the stars aligned for her and her daughter to live through the Nazi Holocaust married to a Nazi! I recommend this book for high schoolers and adults.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun &amp; addicting game! I love it! I recommend this game for all ages! great game to pass time with.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was so straight forward and unassuming by the author. I believe honest and humble words flowed like a waterfall to provide the reader a clear picture of a SEAL, and what they do for this country. As a Vietnam combat veteran, my hat is truly off to the author and his brothers.
B006G3MZRQ|3.0|totally unbelievable storyline and was exaggerated to such that I felt sick after the movie ended. Don't waste your time watching this garbage.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Awesome!  One of the best writers of our time.  So worth the read, take the time to read The Time Keeper!
076790592X|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book for many years and I just decided to buy it.  It is wonderfully thought provoking and it lends a certain amount of joy that comes with knowing that we are all going to meet our maker someday; we should enjoy every moment that we can and above all tell those that you care about you love them as often as you can.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|amazing movie - the music is incredible and haunting, the story heartbreaking. i will watch it over and over again.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|So disturbing but addicting. Like watching creepy murder mysteries on TV. Or a train wreck about to happen. Loved it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's is the best television series I have ever watched!  Can't wait for next season! Have told all my friends about it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The last temple run wasn't really  fun but when they made this one  they added lot of really fun stuff to it and this never gets old
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss makes you feel like your back in high school!<br />I loved all the characters.<br />I wish it was longer.  I will definitely be purchasing Lola and the boy next store and Islamic and the happily ever after!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait to read book two of the trilogy. I didn't care for the ending but at the same time I think the ending was necessary for the trilogy to continue. It's definitely got a kinky kick to it. I definitely give it  a good rating. I read the whole book anxious to flip the page and had a hard time putting it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awsome amazing fun and its like having a real horse to take care of
B005H29GSI|4.0|This game is like a real world version of the Angry Birds everyone knows and loves. It's a more complex version of other build-and-shoot Angry Birds games, because you use cards to decide how to play. There are a few other sets that use include the building pieces, birds and pigs that may be easier to use for younger players - all you do there is build sets and then use the catapult to knock them down. My 5 year old loves that one, but thought the cards in this set weren't as fun. May depend from child to child (or adult to adult), but I'd recommend the other sets without the cards for younger players.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have found the Weather channel to be easy to use for different areas and very accurate. (for weather predicting)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this a perfect app for my kindle fire! I use it all the time. We have it on both of our kindles!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it is so fun I try harder and harder to get to the first place in the game. But I wish they get rid of the jumpy shoes
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|There's really not much to it but what's there is very smooth and polished. Love the black and white look. Reminds me of the game Limbo.<br /><br />Ignore the reviews about bad controls. Those people just didn't think to hold the phone flat or check the control setting menu.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I did not like the language or sex acts.  A very disturbing book that I would never have chosen to read.
B00B2QA646|3.0|Storyline quiet mixed up and hard to adjust to the way it was presented. And what about Judd Law - he must have needed the money to walk through his part.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Have read all the books, and have really have enjoyed watching the movies. They really keep you involved in the movies, and I'm really looking forward to see how they end it in Part 2.
B004C0WVP6|1.0|I purchased mine on 12/14/2011 form a large retailer to store and back up files.  Once I got it installed and formatted and loaded files it worked well for a month.  I travel a lot and might only use this machine a few days a month.  Next time I booted up it would lock up but after several tries I could boot and run and access files.  But had trouble getting to all files and did not remove them until to late and now the drives locks up the system anytime it is connected and the files are lost and can not access them.  It now set in a drawer waiting until Seagate admits a problem and comes up with a repair.<br /><br />Might want to use a different brand for large storage.<br /><br />Paul
0529060892|1.0|The print was so small I couldn't read it without a magnafying glass.  The paper was so thin, I could see through several pages.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|She's intense and her voice is from another time, but she spoke to me directly. Her way with words is profound.This is prose, not poetry, but still the vivid images are clear and revealing of her insights into growing up with clinical depression. She lived in a time before drugs were available, and her description of shock treatments given to her as a young girl are painful to read.<br /><br />THe Bell Jar is only for people who understand the pain of depression and want to read a first hand experience.  It is not a &#34;happy&#34; book, but it is truthful and honest, and very well written.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|After reading the reviews, I decided to buy it. I have been satisfied. Many of my negatives are 30-40 years old. Being able to scan them into my computer has been very rewarding. I would recommend the product if you have negatives or slides that you haven't seen for some time and wished to make them more available.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|I'm not able to view my night sky and find constellations. It is too general, not point and voila!<br /><br />Maybe it will improve as my understanding increases, but I don't think it is great. I wouldn't buy it again.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|just like playing pictionary.  Lots of fun.  But don't unterstanf the point system and who is actually winning...<br />Fun, fun, fun all the same.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|It's hard for most of the current world to think about the major events that took place during the course of their lives without thinking about September 11th, 2001. It was a day that marked a turning point for the whole world and the way they thought about their enemies. There was no declaration of war; there was no indication that there would be an attack, and perhaps most importantly, there was no one specific country that the world could point to say, \\"This is our enemy\\". This is part of what Kathryn Bigelow's ZERO DARK THIRTY is all about; it's about a quest of epic proportions to find the one man the world knows is responsible for that horrific attack, but it's a man who is hidden from the world with no real country to call his own and a seemingly endless hidden network that could and did strike at any time all over the world.<br /><br />This quest is given a human face in the personage of Maya (Jessica Chastain), a CIA case officer who has been working on one assignment since her beginnings at the Agency: Finding and killing Usama Bin Laden. Her quest begins in 2003 in the Middle East at one of the CIA's many \\"black sites\\", a series of undisclosed locations where terror suspects are held in secret for interrogation. The chief officer for many of the interrogations is Dan (Jason Clarke), a man whose scruffy exterior belies a cool, centered intelligence and a man who finds himself with the very unpleasant job of applying whatever pressure is necessary to get the information he needs. Throughout the first act of the film, there are incredibly unsettling scenes of what the Administration of the time so successfully rebranded as \\"enhanced interrogation\\", but some bits and pieces of information begin to form a pattern for Maya which brings us into the second act of the film, which is largely the pursuit of these leads and pulling on each possible thread until it comes undone to reveal the last pieces of the puzzle. The third act then gives us the fateful day that the authorization came down to utilize Seal Team Six to assault the compound in Pakistan that UBL had been hiding in.<br /><br />It is an incredibly hard thing to craft a suspenseful and non-melodramatic film around one of the most important moments of the last few years, and make it an incredibly tense, vital, and unromanticized film, but Bigelow and writer Mark Boal (the same team that gave us THE HURT LOCKER, the deserving winner of Best Picture at the 2009 Academy Awards) give us a film that throws the audience and its protagonists all around the world as the pursuit intensifies, then seems to fall apart, but then picks right back up. As the film opens, we see that this film is based on \\"first-hand\\" accounts of the incidents portrayed within, and you get the feeling right from the outset that what you're seeing on-screen not just looks, but feels totally authentic.<br /><br />Behind the camera, Bigelow gives again a very documentarian approach that worked so incredibly well in THE HURT LOCKER and also works well telling the story of Maya, and only really shifting points of view when major events take place. It never strays away from her story, but it allows the other key players on the board to give testimony of sorts of the jobs they're doing, whether it's awaiting the arrival of a key informant, to the tracking of one cell phone in a crowded marketplace, to the assault on the compound itself. The camera movement is jerky at times, but only in service of the story its telling. The rhythm of the editing by William Goldenberg and Dylan Tichenor works in total concert with the visual story that Bigelow is telling. Boal's writing is crisp, sharp and smart with a real ear for dialogue and interaction.<br /><br />This is a much more sprawling tale than THE HURT LOCKER as we get numerous characters in a number of different duties, and a who's-who of terrific character actors in these many roles: Jennifer Ehle (CONTAGION, THE KING'S SPEECH) as fellow case worker Jessica, Kyle Chandler (the TV FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) as a section chief, Mark Strong (SHERLOCK HOLMES, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) as one of Maya's superiors, Edgar Ramirez (the TV Mini-Series CARLOS) as an on-the-ground CIA operative, James Gandolfini as the director of the CIA, Stephen Dillane (SPY GAME, GAME OF THRONES) as the National Security Advisor, Joel Edgerton (WARRIOR) as ST6's lead, and even Harold Perrineau Jr. (LOST, THE MATRIX RELOADED), Mark Duplass (SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED) and John Barrowman (TORCHWOOD) in small but important roles. When all is said and done, however, the film is owned by Jessica Chastain. Her portrayal of Maya as someone who is confident and assured of her abilites and her intelligence, but often seems to be made to feel out of place in a political and covert world of powerful men. Her mostly unshaken faith in her mission, the intelligence she's received by hook and by crook, and the personal losses she's suffered at the hands of Al-Qaeda, is what drives her to an obsessive need to complete the mission. One of Chastain's strengths as an actress is that she's able to say so much by saying so little. This is a role of disappearence; while she may sport her beautiful firey red hair, she's unrecognizable and unconnectable to any of her previous work. It's a very non-showy performance and is the main reason that it works so incredibly well. Boal could have added more dramatic embellishments to her character by giving her more of a life outside the walls of the intelligence community that fall into the standard dramatic traps (Is she obsessed because she lost someone in 9/11? What's her home life like? Does she have a high-functioning autism? Does she fall for one of her co-workers? The list goes on and on), but thankfully, very little about her is revealed. We only learn about her through her words and deeds, and it's an astonishing performance. I remember predicting after her work on THE TREE OF LIFE that she was a woman who would have an Oscar before the decade was out, and it seems like it's going to come a lot sooner. Her final moment is absolutely devastating without being showy.<br /><br />The film is long, and it has a lot of information to digest. One major criticism I've seen of this film time and again is how \\"boring\\" it is and for the life of me, I can't understand that point of view. This is not your standard \\"manhunt\\" film. There is no ticking clock; there's no ace operative who takes it all down single-handedly; there's no ham-fisted attempt to amplify the natural drama of the material by dumbing it down to fit with a more conventional thriller. But even without those traditional Hollywood flourishes, this is an incredibly exciting and tension-packed film because despite knowing what's coming, unless you have times and dates committed to memory, you never really know what's going to happen. But even if you might find the first two acts dull, you cannot deny the final act of the assault on the compound which is, for all intents and purposes, a blow-by-blow recreation of that night, and it's stunning, heart-stopping, and brilliantly staged.<br /><br />ZERO DARK THIRTY is not the end-zone dance that so many expected from a political point of view, and from a cinematic point of view, it might not be as well-rounded as THE HURT LOCKER, but this is an important, vital and exceptionally well-made film that deserves to be at the top of accolades for 2012's year in film., Kyle Chandler (the TV FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) as a section chief, Mark Strong (SHERLOCK HOLMES, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) as one of Maya's superiors, Edgar Ramirez (the TV Mini-Series CARLOS) as an on-the-ground CIA operative, James Gandolfini as the director of the CIA, Stephen Dillane (SPY GAME, GAME OF THRONES) as the National Security Advisor, Joel Edgerton (WARRIOR) as ST6's lead, and even Harold Perrineau Jr. (LOST, THE MATRIX RELOADED), Mark Duplass (SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED) and John Barrowman (TORCHWOOD) in small but important roles.

B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Great acting by all, the plane sequences were exhilirating, and the portrayal of alcoholism very well done.  Unfortunately, the movie begins to plod on towards the end, running too long, and then has a really lame ending, as if everyone making the film suddenly got tired and just ended it.  Still very much worth watching.
B000J670ZI|5.0|Quirky and funny. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are always a joy to watch. Cary Grant has some very comedic scenes where his facial expressions are priceless.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I got this book to read for book group. I'm far from being a prude, however, I found that after the first few chapters I was done with the crassness and the crudeness and the vulgarity. A little goes a long way. The real life stories were funny and didn't need all of the vulgarity. In fact, nobody in my book group could get through it.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Great ensemble. You can't get better than Cary Grant , Katherine Hepburn, and James Stewart together in one film. Truly delightful.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Everybody who is dissapointed in the movie because of the book are entitled to their opinion. Since when has a movie ever been up to the book? The only thing I wish they would have put in the movie is Bob not knocking the antlers off of the deer. Otherwise it's entertaining.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|It was a well written book, and have been to Sweden and knew all the places , very nice when know the country
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Not as great a novel as Mary Shelley's &#34;Frankenstein&#34; but fun to read.  Here are ill-fated Lucy, her friend Mina and her husband Jonathan, and, that scourge of vampires, Prof. Van Helsing. The story can be irritating at times. For example, when Van Helsing holds back information or plans from his vampire hunting partners, it doesn't seem to make sense, and I'm not sure that the story requires it. But it's Bram Stoker's story!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|We enjoyed this movie my sons are big fans of Iron man and this one did not disappoint . I would recommend
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent revival of the quintessential masterpiece.  Great suspense. Cumberbatch is weird looking, but you get over it quickly.  Highly recommend.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|These were just fun books to read.  The characters were enjoyable and I liked the ending too.  Which counts a lot for me.
1400069289|5.0|This book has impacted my health and business life. Very practical and sensible guide for anyone who wishes to get better control of health. Has made me re-think the way I run my business. One of best self-improvement books I have ever read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once you start watching you will not want to stop.  Interesting story, with even more interesting characters. One of the best series in a long time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this ap. great way to pass time and challenge your mind for short spurts. wish earning each game didn't take so long.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|All my favorite actors in one fun movie. Nice to see something light for a change instead of all the heavy drama in other movies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so cool i love it its the hardest and funest game i ever played i think its the best game ever if u have a kindle or kindle fire or ipad u have to get it so its like the alsomest game ever play it now  cuse if u dont ur missing out  cuse this is the best game ever
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't get enough of this season, never knowing what is around the corner. Steady acting by the cast members. Norman Reedus is awesome and I hope he returns to the group!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super awesome game... addictive. love how you can change characters and boards, also love the jetpack and mystery boxes. Overall I can't stop playing it!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|A totally different story that made me want to read every word and to get to the finish line!  Totally different piece of work , it kept me interested .  A very well written work.
B008PNBU30|5.0|three days grace continues to rock!!! love, love, love this cd.....can't seem to get enough of it! highly recommend!!!!! you won't be disappointed!
B0040I09RM|5.0|If you like your comedy on the dark side, can put up with a bit of the old ultra violence, and enjoy interesting characters, you want to watch this show. Katie Segal is outstanding with the rest of the cast not far behind. Quit reading, start watching!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The best new drama series of the year from someone who watches a lot of TV.  Actors play off of each other perfectly.  Whoever cast LUCY LIU is a genius !
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My toddler (son) absolitey loves this movie. I had to buy another copy for the car and his Nana's house!
B008M34INW|2.0|I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more if I would have watch it on a larger TV.  the movie has sub-titles and they were very hard to read on a 21&#34; TV.  I missed a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed this book and series.  Also liked Bared to you book.  It was about same but with more of a story
0143120530|4.0|I was interested in the cultivation of memory and this book was more than I anticipated. Foer, who writes like Malcolm Gladwell, created a story that holds attention by serving up strange and weird anecdotes about his foray into the bizarre world of Memory Olympics. I had no idea.<br /><br />There's pathos involving the people who populate this unusual sub-culture and the single focus of their lives. Revealing techniques on how to memorize vast amounts of information, Foer takes us back to the Greeks and the conscious development of memory strategies. Regrettably, with today's technology, we don't have to remember but this book makes me want to study more about the ancient tradition of memorization. Really, memorizing two decks of cards isn't what I want from this book but I'd sure use palace of loci technique for a shopping list.<br /><br />Good read. I rated four stars because some of the story continuity is a little difficult to fathom. Otherwise, he's adept at capturing the details with an amusing style and I did read this book in a scant two hours. Keeping it on the shelf for another reread.
B004ZKVEE2|4.0|As always Nalini not only provides a great and passionate love story but she also continues to weave an interesting and addicting story.
0307950689|4.0|A fun read.  I'm not sure the book needed to be this long.  I borrowed a friends copy and hubby and I read it.<br />He wanted one for his library, so we stole our friend's copy and bought her this new one.  She's happy.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|His story is pretty good, but the writing's pretty much like a high school English Comp assignment - he said, she thought, etc.  A light read.
B00499NHLC|4.0|If you're fascinated with the &#34;fantastic gift of deduction&#34;, this is a &#34;worth watching&#34; remake of the dynamic, if dysfunctional duo of the go-to consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson's adventures in 21st Century London.
B004G600A4|5.0|My granddaughter loves it and has memorized most of the dialog by now.  It's a big hit.  Thanks a lot.
B009HTPMNK|3.0|The movie is incredible and shipping/delivery was great. The only problem is that the Batman figurine has wear. It's probably not worth the extra money for this edition.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is probably the best game I have ever played. So much fun! And ive had no problems (: I really love it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am not usually into romance novels, but this book had my heart racing not just because of the romance but because of the thriller element too . . . . . read this book in two days!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|You don't  have to be an artist to really enjoy this game. All kids (and adults)love this and I'm only 10!!<br /><br />[My daughter's review.  Draw Something really is a fun app that she enjoys a lot.  You start with a few basic colors and \\"earn\\" more colors and options the more you participate, by both drawing and identifying pictures.  It's very easy and self-explanatory, with different skill levels to choose from.  My only objection?  Occasionally you get a cretin who likes to draw obscene pictures or write expletives for fun, which is particularly disgusting in a game where so many kids play.  Not the fault of the game, but be warned you can't control who's sending what pictures or words to your kid's Kindle.]
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been looking so long for an app that would let me listen to my local stations. I finally found this app. I am more than thrilled with it.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I started reading this book wondered what could there be next? I have to say that I did go and skip a couple chapters at first because the beginning took so long and it was all about  Nasuada's problems and I wanted to see another battle after the end of Eldest but it was worth it all in the end of Brisingr! I strongly encourage people to read this book but to read the two other books before it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Some sad times this season, but they always leave you wanting more. Can't wait for next season to start. I love the English family drama and the Abbey.  It's so big and so beautifully decorated.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was looking for a cross platform note taking app, I have a kindle, iphone, and use the PC. Evernote is perfect for this. It works as it should. If you don't like the permissions, don't download. If you don't download, you don't have merit to review, pretty simple concept. We live in a technologically invasive era. Get over it, it will only get worse.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show. My husband has even started watching it with me. Can't wait to see what happens to this family each week.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold set off on a walk to visit an old friend and along the way discovers his true self.  His encounters along the way help him to deal with his grief over a life seemingly wasted.  And his wife also discovers herself and in the end they find each other and begin to heal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I cannot stop sneaking away to play instead of grading papers...I catch students playing all the time during class...it hurts me a little to make them stop...and not take over:)
0984999302|3.0|While this book does contain some valuable information, it fires that information at you in nearly the exact same language ad infinitum.  It should have been one hundred pages long at most instead of nearly five hundred -- a real time-waster.  For the next edition, I hope the authors will hire a good editor.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and addicting.  I can play it for hours and don't realize the time has gone by.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is vary entertaining when u are really bored. hours of fun. it keeps you wanting to play more so u can get more games unlocked.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's an easy way to pass the time! well worth the space it takes up on your device and the games aren't super hard
B009VB97EY|4.0|Fun movie with all the right &#34;moves.&#34; Enjoyed it. Very entertaining. And it was FREE. Got to watch it on my iPad.<br />Thanks!
B007HACDLK|2.0|Not what I expected - thought in might provide more cross referencing between the books -so just book excerpts didn't work
B006MW3UZW|1.0|Tried to view Downton Abbey and several other shows, I could not even get the preview to load, left a preview loading for a half hour, or more fixed and ate dinner came back and it was at the same spot for a preview I have not idea how many days we would have to wait for an hour show. My reaction to this would be that the internet speed is lousy, but Netflix, and Hulu work on is just fine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! The love that Holder has for Sky is so pure, that it will make you melt. This is by far One of my Favorites. You will be in tears by the end!!!
1449410243|5.0|Love this book!! Very funny and true.  I love all animals and have probably had just about every kind of animal there is but cats are definitely funny, crazy and entertaining.  This book is great for anyone who has ever had cats before.  They will be able to relate and laugh!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is more than just a simple matching game since there are matches inside the cube.  I really enjoy competing against myself for a better time.  The background music is great, too.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Wonderful cultural movie on so many levels.  Different view of Middle East. Loved the sheik and especially his men in kilts, trying to adapt to Scotland.
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander's \\"Near Death Experience\\" (NDE) was an incredible story - both his unprecedented earthly comatose as well as his spiritual journey.  Only a complete jack-ass or a closed-minded scientific materialist could deny that SOMETHING authentic and unexplained happened to Eben Alexander. Basically, the odds were nil that Eben Alexander could have survived a gram-negative bacterial meningitis attack that puts one in a 6-day coma and come out of it without being in a hopeless vegetative state.  Not to mention the hospital staff still can not explain how he got the meningitis in the first place.  Unfortunately for most skeptics and scientific reductionist', their critiques are fatally undermined when it is learned that Alexander's higher brain function (the neocortex) was basically flat-lined throughout the entire experience.<br /><br />Now, how one interprets what happened to him is in the eye of the beholder.  In a situation like this, I typically look for a convergence of (anecdotal) evidence and hold that broad interpretation very loosely.  I can live with that, many others however can not (see 1 or 2 star reviews for further proof of that discomfort). I suspect that these experiences are interpreted through the lens of the NDEr's developmental level of consciousness and their culture.  As a non-dualist, I need no further proof that there is something larger than the world that we experience here on earth.  What that is and what it all means, I'll find out one day.  Until then, I'll just keep enjoying the stories and optimistically hope the truth is half as good as it sounds.  And Eben Alexander's story is more illuminating and optimistic than most.
B0063M22QO|2.0|This does not include traditional layouts. I did not care for the new layouts that it did include (too easy).
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The actors are all wonderful and bring life to the characters. Even the characters that tend to be evil can surprise you when they show compassion. It is an interesting and entertaining program.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|I was rather surprised at how much I liked this movie! Oh yeah, another Dracula movie, blah, blah, blah :-) I thought. But the great thing was the REASON for the hotel in the first place, and the REASON the Count is so protective of his daughter. Lots of humor thrown in, and great voice-overs made this a really fun movie!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book.  I was a little disappointed in the ending, but I understood why she ended this way. Maybe a sequel is coming out.  I was so very impressed with Ms. Strayed's courage and determination.  She was a true inspiration.  Got me off  the couch and into the woods. Thank you Ms. Strayed.....
B00943SQCI|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this movie. I enjoyed the funny parts, but other than that it just came off as silly. Fun to watch once, but I doubt I'll ever have a desire to watch it a 2nd time.
B000PAAH3K|3.0|A talented writer can make any topic interesting and Gladwell is definitely that. However, in comparison to Tipping Point it pales in the revelatory value of the science. So, it is a good read but I expected more from this author.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Okay, I will admit I'm not a huge Batman film, but hey it's Christian Bale, I couldn't resist. I was not impressed with the last Batman movie...it was just too dark for me (pun intended). This one had shades of dark, but also shades of light which came together to create a very good movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful surprising captivating ERMAGHERD! I cant say enough about this book. I will be reading the other two titles listed a.s.a.p
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have a confession...this is my first Nicholas Sparks book. It will not be my last. This was such a sweet story, with some good humor, drama and a little scary thrill thrown in, that I was hooked, quite literally, from the first page. I wondered if this would just be a remake of &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy,&#34; but Sparks worked his magic and developed beautiful, charming and delightful characters. Can't wait to see the movie, but unless they use the actual book as the script, can it ever be better? I think not! Everyone should read this book!
B000JML7EC|5.0|A chapter a night before bed provided nighttime adventure and a memorable shared experience with my seven year old boy.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|When I happen to watch James Bond films, I usually like them, but I'm not at all a HUGE Bond fan. I was, however, very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I really liked the larger part Judi Dench played and the &#34;story within a story&#34; glimpse given of Bond's childhood. In my opinion, this movie deserves 5 stars, and I highly recommend it!
B000IAZ5HK|5.0|I really like them and this is my second time to order them. They are easy to clean. Nice and cool!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book made me appreciate the amazing life story of Adam Brown. It also inspired me to be thankful for what I have and the country I live in and to never be afraid to be the best and to give all you have.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Insightful.<br />Into the mind of a boy of curiosity and wonder. Looking for answers and learning to stay true to one self.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Funny. This movie made me laugh. The antics that the two got up to were original, particulalry those of Ted.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I thought this book was great.  It is thought provoking and lovely.  I'm excited to see what happens next in the story.
B00846F1YW|5.0|fun and easy. great time waster.  nice graphics.  works great on my kindle fire. variety of puzzles with different levels of difficulty.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series keeps you guessing and always surprises.  The characters are great and the casting is the best.  Love it.
B008EKOO46|4.0|he spends a lot of time on detail but the comparisons and insights are woth it.  I especially liked the risk avoidance strategies of the traditional societies and the lessons for modern societies.
B003EYVXXW|2.0|I  gave this two stars because the production value is amazing, however, it is historically inaccurate. The movie demonizes Christians, namely Cyril of Alexandria. The movie makes it seem as if Cyril called Hypatia out by referring to her as a &#34;witch&#34;, conjuring up stories of the salem witch trials in the minds of the viewer. This word would have been completely foreign to the people of Egypt and if Cyril would have been referring to her as a pagan or priestess, well, that was not all that uncommon and certainly would not have incited mob violence against Hypatia, in fact, Cyril was trying to make amends with Orestes who was without a doubt influenced by Hypatia, as Socrates Scholasticus makes clear. The mob violence against Hypatia was due to her influencing Orestes against the Christians.<br /><br />What actually happened was that the jews had Orestes publicly torture and kill Hirax because he was an alleged spy. The jews blamed him and Cyril for the closing of their theater, which caused all sorts of public drunkeness and violence in itself. Cyril, knowing that the people of Alexandria would react swiftly against the jews, personally had the majority of them removed before any massacre could happen, despite what the movie shows, Cyrils intentions were undoubtedly to protect the jews from massacre and yet appease the masses who were tired of being persecuted and plotted against by the jews. For instance, the incident in the movie where the jews lured the Christians to the church to kill them is actually true.<br /><br />It is sad that Cyril is portrayed as some religious fanatic hell bent on murder and destruction, none of which can be proven with valid historical sources, and none of this is seen in his letters. Even when writing to his opponents he shows the utmost respect and love towards them. This movie could have been so much better, however, it is an offense to any student of history, let alone Christians. These are not typical mistakes, which happen sometimes, many of these are blatant falsehoods used to lead the viewer to a specific conclusion. That conclusion? Religion is opposed to science and reason. For instance, there is a part in the movie where the Parabolani are speaking about the earth MUST be flat, this is another blatant lie contrived to make Christians look like backwards simple minded fools. This &#34;flat earth&#34; was last believed before Christ!!! It is a foolish movie full of lies to try and make Christianity look bad. Shame on the writers, producers, and director.n sometimes, many of these are blatant falsehoods used to lead the viewer to a specific conclusion. That conclusion?

B007EECSFA|5.0|First, this is not my husband reading these books.  It is his wife.  I have read all of her books and look forward to the next one.  They are well written.  I just wish sometime there would be a happy ending, they leave you wanting more, still they are a great read, the kind of book I like.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Great movie for all ages. This combo pack is now the way I shop for all my movie watching needs! Great funny movie with a few life-lessons to add!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Not my husbands review.  This is his wife.  I loved the House at Riverton.  I have read  all of her book and look forward to the next one.  Just wish they were not so sad.  They have all been well written and I will continue to buy her books.  If you are looking for a good novel, well written and a book that will keep you up night you will enjoy all of Kate Morton books.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So very consistent in content, color, and dialogue.  But I would expect that from Lord KillWillie!  He's so very talented!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|One of the best movies for Denzel Washington. Being an X addict I could see the procees of my mind. To scam until your so sick of the lies you can;t go on.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The actors in this drama are extremely talented.  All the characters are evocative.  Unfortunately, it is moving at glacier speed which prevents the secondary characters from being developed, since they primarily react.<br /><br />The zombie action is uniformly great.  There is much variety and the slow moving zombies are still very menancing.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of information about the new town of Woodberry that is not being expressed, causing unexpected surprises during action scenes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very daring series that definitely is worth watching.
1433502410|5.0|i didnt buy this but just wanted to tip the reviews to a total of 667! I am however searching for a quality study bible and will consider this one.
B00164GDD2|2.0|Lots of noise in the dark scenes that can't be attributed to my LCD screen.  Unlike other blu-ray titles, I have to view further away to avoid noticing pixilation on faces.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am always loved Maserpiece Theater and Downton Abbey is one of their best shows! Need more episodes! I watch most episodes twice!
B001FB55H6|5.0|I don't know if it has all the extras of the collector's edition, but what is there is very good.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|out of all the kids movies this is my nephews favorite. he watches it over n over. he loves it
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|This latest offering is disappointing because the story line was very predictable and it lacked the suspense of previous offerings.
B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|ths was a great deal n price and our neice n nephew love watching it. i wish u had more deals at prices like this more often
B008B92U32|1.0|This app has a cool premise but absolutely sucks. All never worked and wouldn't do the face swap properly. At least I got it free.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of hidden object games, but this one is very cool. Hard enough, but not ridiculous.
B0035S996U|3.0|This movie is supposed to be a cult classic and I can see why. It was cool but I don't think it was great. Overall I liked the story and there are definitely some classic parts to remember. \\"Warriors, come out to play-ayy\\" is pretty awesome.
B004GYY714|4.0|It turns out I'd rather use my portable radio.  It's awkward to drag the HD around whereas my little portable fits in my shirt pocket.  Also while running TuneIn Radio, I can't read a book or play Spider Solitaire from MobilityWare.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series - I can totally see this as a movie for teens and older.  Very colorful, imaginary and could be truly frightening!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I thought I was reviewing this app when I reviewed the Spider Solitaire app from Magory.  I don't play the Magory app since I got the MobilityWare version.<br /><br />This is more challenging than the Windows version I've played for years.  It has enhancement that make it play faster.  Like tapping on a card and having it move to an open slot, albeit often not the slot you want.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|It's a different type of book than I've read before and I like it a lot for that very reason.  It's well written, colorful and easily imagined.  I'll definitely buy the rest of the series.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I used to love watching this movie as a kid. This was the first movie to expose me to Johnny Depp. I was very happy with the product I received, and how fast I received it. It's so cheesy and funny. Don't be a square. Buy it! Lol
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm usually not into Sci-Fi TV because the quality of the story writing isn't there.  This series has enough quality to keep watching.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I can watch this any time, no matter how many times. It was shipped fast and was in great shape. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  &#34;Do you think I'm afraid?&#34;  ... &#34;I think you've been afraid all of your life.&#34; Classic!
B004RL9T50|3.0|This movie start real slow. I almost got up to go to something else and let the kids watch it. It did pick up and was ok by the end but it is not something I think we would buy to watch again and again.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|This movie has a very interesting story with great acting. Gotta love it. It's similar to Forrest Gump to me, being that it's a long movie that plays out a very interesting chain of events. My DVD works great and was shipped in a timely manner.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids really enjoy to play this game and it had a good price to buy. The play a lot.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|Great information to follow the Atkins plan.  Love having it on my kindle to shop with. I use it often.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids really enjoy to play this game and it had a good price to buy. The play a lot.
B007EDYN36|5.0|It was wonderful to finally hear Peter's side. It was really heartfelt and real. I felt he was talking right to me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids really enjoy to play this game and it had a good price to buy. The play a lot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better then the first one. way more traps and obsticles and new ways to lose. really recomend this game. having really fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids really enjoy to play this game and it had a good price to buy. The play a lot.
B007HACDLK|5.0|All Vince Flynn's books are enjoyable and fast moving.  Mitch Raap is literally a blast and as usual no nonsense.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed every episode.  The writing and acting is excellent and gives a unique perspective on the time frame and the English aristocracy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved Season 1 and 2, these were great.  I have it on i-Pad and my husband has it on Kindle-Fire.  But I have 2 episodes , I believe Jan. 13 and Jan.20's airing and there was a lot of &#34;buffering&#34; and &#34;error&#34; and &#34;trying again&#34; on my iPad for these but not the Kindle.  I loved being able to &#34;catch up&#34; with Downton, great story, things never get dull and happy Amazon made it so simple to get.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really fun. The graphics are really nice and the horses are adorable. Its for any animal lover.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Anyone who knows The Beatles music will definitely enjoy the masterful compilation that this album offers. If you like The Beatles, you'll love this CD!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Okay, so I confess, I took a vacation day the day after I got this because I wanted to keep playing it that badly.<br /><br />Each type of pathogen has its intricacies although some are less &#34;realistic&#34; than others. I didn't think the prion was really all that interesting, probably b/c the game is a matter of a year or two, and you just can't ruse the same mechanisms with it. The fact that you couldn't set up symbiosis with the parasite so that everyone was infected but not dying bugged me a little bit too. For that matter, the fact that you have to kill all of your hosts bugs me just a bit too, regardless of which type of pathogen you use.<br /><br />One other thing that bothers me is that you can mutate transmission until you get everybody infected and then you can make it deadly (mind you, it's still tough to balance when you can start killing people off - if you wait til you have no healthy people left you're going to lose b/c you're out of time against the cure).  If it's possible to mutate lethality and then be forced to do a second wave of infection I haven't figured it out yet.  Also, I only managed to blow up the infected one time and that was on normal not brutal.<br /><br />So it's probably going to bug some people more than others - it's not perfect, but it is TONS of fun. Not to mention that all of my &#34;complaints&#34; would probably require a GB or more and the app is only 26MB so you know, it has to have SOME limits.<br /><br />The different types of abilities between the pathogens is really cool, although not knowing the limitations out of the gate (or forgetting before you set up your code) is a hassle.  And it doesn't track with combinations worked really well and which didn't.<br /><br />So I can't wait until there's a three terabyte PC game that has all of those features. In the meantime I'm going to keep trying to get the infected people blown up.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Muy buena película<br />La cantidad de material extra y todos los componentes del pack son excelentes.<br />Me gusto mucho la presentación.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|For those wondering why these copies are both out of print and more expensive, this is the first printing, which included the \\"George Bush's head on a pike\\" scene which was cut out of the newer DVD's. So for die hard collectors get these, for everyone else, please just pay $29.99 on the new ones. I was lucky enough to have preordered season 1 on blu-ray.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|This is a good compilation of a great band although many of their best songs were never considered hits so in addition to a compilation of hits, I encourage you to listen to their lesser known stuff to get a true sense of how talented this band really is.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|The first one was great and then I got bored of it so I downloaded this one. It says you can add pixels and stuff and frames.. so I took a pic an  put different stuff on it and when I saved it and went back to it .. none  of the edits were on it except the frame  I have tried this a few times and the same results .. I take a lot of pictures and use instagram a lot so that disappointed Me  but I'm wondering if it has to do with the flash player on my kindle fire hd??
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Unlike some mystery games, this one seemed well planned and easy to follow.  There are some disturbing scenes, so parents may want to block this from young children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so cool that i have all the people the boards are awesome you have to get it
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'm hooked, the hook is firmly set and I'm one #4 already. Great writing and storyline. This is a great character to follow in a book. Whose bright idea was it to cast that pip squeak in this role!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wonderful characters! At times predictable, but for the most part intriguing. Makes you want to fall in love all over again.
B001NHNG64|5.0|A great follow up to #1 and it has all the action and great writing as well. I still can't believe that they cast Tom Cruise in this role as he's about a foot shorter than than Jack! Great read and I'm on #4!
B00000IMTF|5.0|Maybe Rainbow best album with  only a six  song and a sound  same  stiff like a fist shown on a cover
0785814531|5.0|I have many books with Poe stories in them, But having them all contained in one book is great. Spent most of the day reading it!
B002JIEYLM|5.0|This is must be last very good Black Sabbath album with original cast .no wandering why follow up album Never...didn t succeed  bacouse after release Tech Ecst  very difficult to creat something better
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|Helen Hunt and William H Macy....wow they were fantastic in this movie.  Both saving a soul but in very different ways.  Helen Hunt plays a sex therapist and William Macy plays a priest.  I guess I understood the six session rule but I think it took the Power failure to bring in true love.  While not quite a love story, It will make you feel both sad and happy....you decide.  I really liked the movie but remember there is nudity...and sexually related themes in it....take that in consideration.  This Movie was definitely worth the price of admission so to speak.
B00A3XQVKW|4.0|An interesting look at what we can all expect.  What I found most interesting was all the things the author says she was told about ourselves and what we should be doing for our spiritual growth, are what I was taught in my Christian Science upbringing. Nice to have it confirmed.
0316044695|5.0|My order was shipped and received in a timely fashion. Very affordable and exactly as described. I am very pleased. Thanks!
B000MYFILK|5.0|This is a timeless movie.  A bit old fashioned but a nice story and good acting.  Audrey Hepburn's first, I think
B000SM7QUC|5.0|My order was shipped and received in a timely fashion. Very affordable and exactly as described. I am very pleased. Thanks!
B000P0J09M|5.0|it skips a little but great condition, Original DVD flip over for the 2nd Half..love this movie and thanks again.
0062082353|5.0|Difference in Kyles story from other combatants is the involvement of his wife in telling his story.  The family are the unsung heroes in war.  A triumph rarely told is how the Kyle family overcame war and warrior related struggles and became the unified family under God that most of us pray for.<br />Don't get me wrong, there is a wealth of hard charging door kicking battle accounts not typical of snipers who usually serve as over watch.  Chris Kyle is no glory hound, he's simply a highly motivated warrior who carried a heavy burden for getting the job done alongside brothers from the teams.<br /><br />If you don't like this book, the problem may be too many Rambo movies as a child.  Fantasy-Drama-Junkyism is quite common in this day and age of video games and Bruce Willis movies.  DON'T PANIC; there is psychological help available, check your yellow pages.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think this game is awesome!It is fun and everyone plays it .You can not put it down.You can Evan challenge your friends and family!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Things get diabolically dicey in this second season of Sherlock, the continuation of the techno-reinventing of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic literary detective.<br />In this season the three episodes have a new direction of subgenres to explore: high-stakes thriller, psych-thriller infused with bits of sci-fi, and psychological mystery. And in each is there some element that makes Sherlock Holmes uncomfortably human. Especially in \\"The Hounds of Baskerville,\\" where he deals with doubt and fear, and doesn't like it.<br />With the clues, he's still adept to the most minute jigsaw pieces. With socializing, he's still quite the bumbler that doesn't get a hint very well.<br />The sad thing is that, in Hounds of Baskerville, the screenwriters apparently decided to hold back on what is considered Sherlock's most famous non-trademark statement, a comment about dogs not barking. And speaking of famous statements, it took me a while to figure out they don't have him say \\"Elementary, my dear Watson,\\" but just have say \\"Obviously.\\" Just as snarky as the current generation of youngsters, unfortunately.<br />Now it's the third episode that goes above and beyond the normal standards of today's detective genre. As well as has the best quote in the season, about how Sherlock works for the side of angels, yet is not one. Dark, provocative, if not evocative.<br />Now, with the end of that episode comes one last mystery that will not be figured out until the third season comes out, can you wait until then?
B006LSZECO|5.0|A really good read.  I had a hard time putting it down to do my everyday chores.  It kept me guessing.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|The connection was intermittent and the movie could not be watched to completion.  Other streaming providers (Netflix and Hulu) were performing well during the same period that the movie from Amazon could not be streamed.<br />Schedules did not allow attempting to complete viewing the movie within the 24 hour rental period.<br />I will not rent another HD movie from Amazon.  Very disappointed
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I am by no means any type of music expert, but I know what I like.  These two make for the perfect pairing!  This album is absolutely wonderful. Imagine what they will sound like when their voices mature!<br />I am anxiously awaiting their next album!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I loved Mario back in the day and this is a great close second.  My kids absolutely love it also!
B002L3ARRU|4.0|A stupidly brilliant piece of work by Matthew Broderick.  It is perfect for unwinding and reminiscing about the good old days.
1419705849|5.0|Bought this for my son everywhere else was more expensive. He loves the books and will pass them on thanks
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Richard Castle once again writes an exciting mystery.  The Nikki Heat series are enjoyable, especially with my wife.  She reads them and encourages my reading of the series.  She and I do follow the TV series, an entertaining take off.
B001R7VHKC|5.0|Finally got my workout music, Have been working out this Batman for the last 3 week and loving every time.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the World is an interesting and insightful read on the period of time from WWI through WWII, primarily focusing on Europe and Great Britain. The author may have taken some liberties with actual history to present his characters and create tension. But overall, the events depicted actually took place, and since history looks different through the eyes of those impacted by the events, the book presents an honest depiction from several personal perspectives.<br /><br />This is a book that, regardless of length, is difficult to put aside. After the first chapter you become hooked into the plot. There is  lot of adult romantic situations, maybe more so that some of the author's earlier writings, but in line with the first book of this trilogy. So reader beware if you are sensitive to raw pornographic depictions.<br /><br />Of course, no war can be accurately chronicled without graphic violence. But the violent scenes presented are more directed toward giving the reader an idea of the cruelty and dogmatism of the political and military characters.<br /><br />It is important not to read Winter of the World as a history book. The author uses the strands of historic events to weave his story. But if the reader has a good basic understanding of actual twentieth-century history &#34;Winter&#34; will add an interesting twist and new perspective.<br /><br />I recommend Winter of the World. But since this is the second book in the trilogy, be sure to read book one first.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|It speaks volumes of the human spirit. The people were real, as we're the emotions. It makes me think of the trail of tears and many other death marches. I am tired and I'm going to sleep. Isn't that what death is like. I wonder where we go when we sleep. Our brain is actually more active when we are asleep....I wonder where I will go tonight after I close my eyes. It's 1:32AM time to....sleep.
B00BESM14U|1.0|I never got to see it!!!!  It never came up on my Kindle Fire.  Kindly credit my account.  I am having a terrible time getting your movies to go to my Kindle.
B00899F0G8|5.0|love being able to buy single episodes when i miss the show, its cheap and loads fast, not much waiting for it to load at all
B00785P2QC|4.0|enjoy the game though i don't have twitter or facebook accounts so cannot complete those goals.  don't like that part.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The only unusual parts of this book are the author's obsession regarding the sexual relationship and the sex games the lead characters are fond of playing.  The plot outside the bedroom is boring and inane.  A waste of time.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Seems like Clint only plays one character these days, a &#34;Get off my lawn old man&#34;.  But the movie subject matter is interesting enough to keep watching.  Could have been shortened by 20-30 minutes.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I enjoyed the story however it went from one setting to the other and you get lost on the plot. Otherwise it was a good book.I will look forward to another ( Jack Ryan ) Tom Clancy book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is yet another of Gillian Flynn's work of art.  The plot is amazingly corrupt and twisted and keeps you guessing from the start, it is a wonderful read.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was an excellent book. I was actually pleased at other parts in the book not necessarily about the sex. I wasn't really feeling the back and forwardness in some parts. I felt she could've went in depth in certain parts but it was good nonetheless. I'm eagerly anticipating a fourth book now! Or a longer epilogue about Christian's take on the beginning of their meeting and relationship. Maybe a book about his past would be good.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book had my attention from the first paragraph.  I could not put it down.  I have read all of her work and her writing is addictive.
B00999DFP0|4.0|I love bbt, and everything as ordered i got. No hickeys.<br />Buble wrapping was also appreshiated.<br /> Four more words. Given.
0385340540|5.0|Grishan has avoided going on a far left rambling, this is what a good novel is all about! Fast paced, like a spy thriller, no political messages. The ending was sudden and I wish he has gone for few more chapters leading to a more dramatic end. What Grisham book you will find references to IPv6 networks and Wifi support! He has certainly caught up, though I find amusing author says in the end he uses a 13 yr old word processor and is completely naive about technology and he worries when the word processor hangs. What does he do with the millions he makes in book deals, one wonders. The Broker is a fast paced, international, and listened to good part on a coast to coast flight trip. :ove the audio book and listening on Bose OE headphone.
B001F12J48|1.0|Simple.... Would not play on my Blue-ray Disc DVD Player. Returned this one and ordered one that I hope will play on my 3D unit. Should have known by the price something was wrong. I have  to read more careful what I am buying.
1609611543|4.0|haven't been able to sit down and read it yet.......... so can't really make any comments on this book. U
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The  Forgotten Garden is an incredible mystery about an orphan's unknown origins. It is told from multiple viewpoints and spans more than 100 years. It is also a lovely story of redemption. I loved every word of the 600 some pages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Kids love it. They play it with their friends all day long..very easy to learn. Their friends like the game to.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My 11yr old girl enjoyed the game and thought it was fun, unfortunately only after a few days of play it frooze our Kindle Fire, so we uninstalled this app.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is awesome in the beginning, but once you get to level 7/8/9 it gets a bit frustrating. The objectives are really challenging.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of 'Les Miserables' after seeing the 1930's version of the film.  BTW this story has been filmed many times - that tells you something!  The book is wonderful - full of digressions on French 19th century society, but even these digressions are fascinating.  I would highly recommend this 1500 page book; each page is a masterpiece.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|For viewing my page it's great.  Every time someone new posts it doesn't send me back to the top of the page to view  what I've already seen, so that's great. I wish I could look at a friend's page more easily by searching for their name like I can from a computer page.  Another thing I love is that it takes you back to the post you were viewing when  you've clicked a link.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|Works very well after a little practice.  A light, consistant score is important as is alternating dipping the bottle in alternating boiling then ice water.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The app works about like the one I use on my large computer except you just can't open a new file from the app.  Instead you have to open from the notification part of the pull down menu.  Once it's open thongs proceed as they normally would.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I love Thriller!  The whole album brings back my youth.  :)  I could listen continually!  A classic!  He was definitely in a class all his own.
B000BJS4OY|1.0|I am not a fan of Bruce.  I bought this for a friend as a birthday present, and he loves it.<br />I wouldn't play a Bruce CD or DVD in my house.  I'd rather watch the carpet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great app. I like it so much better than the first temple run. this app is awesome!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Witty humor, fast paced and fun sci-fi crime show. Similar to x-files but much better! will be watching all five seasons! Totally hooked!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|It's a fine game.  Nothing extraordinary.  I thought it would be a bit more like majong (sp) but It's not since no cubes are blocked it makes the game less challenging.  I have not tried the other mode.  Maybe that is more of a challenge.  We will see
B009B50QOU|1.0|i've bought every green day cd for 20 years, i like them all except this one,  21st century started showing signs of suck but this one went over the edge,  i probably won't buy dos or tre.  seems like they've run out of material and are just trying to make some poppy songs to sell cd's and then they'll quit.  might as well milk it.  don't waste your money.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Maybe it should be obvious, all the pictures show the flashlights bezel up, but DON'T STORE YOUR FLASHLIGHT BEZEL DOWN in this thing.  Unless you have a perfectly tubular flashlight the bezel WILL overstretch the elastic.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Iron Maiden at their best with 250,000 hardcore fans chanting, singing and jumping along for the ride. This DVD shows the energy, talent and astonishing performances Iron maiden are capable of!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I came across Gotye through a friend of mine who thought a particular songs lyrics reflected by position in life perfectly. I listened to the song and it was indeed so. I was intrigued by the one song and went ahead and got the CD through some credit that I had with Amazon. It has indeed been enlightening and refreshing to listen to the music and lyrics of Gotye.<br /><br />It has been been a well deserved Grammy too!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very helpful app because I wanted to know what 99 times 99 was and it told me right away.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I have this game and I like it great game. Has a lot of Facebook things in it .<br /><br />Love the game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fairly easy to learn.  very fun to play and they actually have unicorns.<br />It seems to be very hard to get diamonds.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It's extremely awesome! Though sometimes there are levels that are difficult. So I recommend getting a large to medium fungus boost. Also they are really cute!
B000M53GM2|5.0|one of my favorite Bond films and one of the best with Pierce Brosnan.  These movies never get old - I love them.
B003TOP7RK|5.0|i love this season i really like the last few episode i love how it end they let you image what happens
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|so far the best Daniel Craig 007 film.  A good story with an interesting twist although the end was sad.
B000SW16M6|5.0|an oldie but the very best, good actors, good story there should be more movies like this, leaves you feeling happy
B000IKQK7E|5.0|classic crazy fun.  John Belushi is just a nut.  watching it now I'm kind of surprised at the language from a movie made in 1978.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of puzzles (nor am I very good at them) but this app is great! there are 4 options for amount of prices. it offers hours of entertainment! this app is great!
B003SI84D6|5.0|I always enjoy watching Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.  This is one of my favorite movies - much better than the one with Kevin Costner in my opinion.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I didn't like it till the update I went hammified and I'm (13) crazy for the game I love create your own I'm tired heading to bed
B0011E9LBI|5.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work so well together.  The story is different from anything that came before it.  I didn't remember that it came from a comic book.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|Great movie.  I wish the quality on Amazon prime was better.  The movie had a number of times when it just stopped working and froze or froze up for a bit and went back to playing.  This is not my Internet connection or anything like that.  I use a Roku box with AT&T Uverse (the fastest plan available) and I never have problems with Netflix or Hulu.  These problems are specific to Amazon Prime.  I still keep Amazon Prime because it pays for itself with free shipping on my Amazon orders.  It's also nice that Amazon prime has a lot of things available that you can't get on Netflix or Hulu.  Of course, anything that is good requires an extra fee on top of what I already pay per month.  Amazon Prime instant video is a perk if you are already going to get Prime for free 2-day shipping.  But it is not a competitive substitute for Netflix or Hulu.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I read all 3 books and have watched the movie several times now. I was glad to see the movie followed the book pretty well.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|IT DOENST MAKE ANY REAL SENSE BUT ITS ADDICTING.ONLY GET THIS GAME IF URN AMMUNEDTO ADDICTIONS!!!!<br />I'm not kidding this is serious if u are a addict u might end up with a 300$ fine so just be careful while playing!!<br />(Gem and coin interactions cause these enormous bills)<br /><br />-your dear friend snippy the doggy
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've never been much of a reader, probably having read about 10-20 books in my life, but this was impossible to put down. This book was so addicting that I powered through it in about 2 weeks. The points that stuck out to me was the character development, the story twists, and with no real &#34;one&#34; protagonist (although the Starks are portrayed as the &#34;good guys&#34;), the reader has the opportunity to pick their favorite family and cheer for them throughout the series.  A good read for someone who likes stories about the medieval age, warfare, politics, and adventure.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|First time buying his music, good CD! Enjoy the rhythms and ballads, Bruno really sings from the heart!  Recommended purchase!!!
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Was a gift but t got rave reviews, may borrow it....next Christmas. Anything whitney puts her vocals to is a winner. Miss you Whitney.....
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I actually now assign this movie to couples I work with to open up their minds to new possibilities.  Excellent Movie!!!
B001F0WXY0|5.0|An amazingly deep and richly detailed book.  The author obviously spent a lot of time and effort researching the close relationship between geology and climate to create a truly unique world.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The ins and outs of Swedish secret police workings did get a bit tedious, but still a page turner.  A good read (the 2nd book on my new Kindle) and a perfect ending to the trilogy.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Strong characters!!! Great plot, still keeps you guessing. Middle brother Ben is really showing leadership abilities! Wasn't a fan of alien type movies but this one caught my eye. Still don't understand Karen.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Lots of action and plot twists. Interesting insight into 007's background. Word, Word, Word, Word Word, Word, Word, Word, Words
B001TODCII|1.0|The item did not arrive early like gohastings is known for. My family members and myself always buy from the seller because he is known for getting the product out quick but not this time. The movie has a cut through the back od the case and the dvd was damaged because of the cut.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldnt put it down. Well worth it. Im a picky reader and this one takes the cake. Loved it!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love the Harry Potter series.. one of my favorite series. So glas it was put in Blu-ray form. Thanks
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Funny<br />Loved it<br />It was a really good movie. I enjoyed it. i love Simon Pegg and Nick frost.<br />They're so funny.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Brilliant story highly recommended.I remember the day well and have often mulled over &#34;what if&#34;,King gives one answer,very well written.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|I have been re-watching the entire series and The motion picture has always been at the top of my list. Share it with the kids.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've always loved the way Clancy uses 650 pages to set the stage for 150 pages of can't-put-it-down reading.  This one is no different.  The threats and the bad guys he portrays seem credible in today's environment.  I'm ready for the sequel.

B00499NHLC|3.0|I like it, but it can get a bit monotonous.  The stories are good, the characters are likable but the plot sometimes has too many loose ends - and not in a good way.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|If there were six stars, this album would have them all.  These voices are magnificent.  I can listen for hours.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Whether a Bond film traditionalist or a newer devotee to the franchise, Skyfall should be pleasing to both.  Personally, I think Daniel Craig is a great Bond and this edition captures the usual action along with just enough tongue in cheek humor to keep the violence and intrigue from overwhelming a sense of fun that Bond films should have.<br /><br />My wife, not a devoted fan by any stretch of the imagination, enjoyed it enough to want to see it for a second time.  Having seen it for the first time myself, I'm certain I'll watch again.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Entertaining, but also educational and informative  as it pertains to real life events. Would highly recommend this movie. Gerard Butler plays the lead role well.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|We all think we know about the war via stories we've heard, but more from the movies and TV shows we watched.  I found this book to be very well written as well as spellbinding.  I learned about the German Air Force, the pilots, and about the politics that were involved.  It is a moving story and one that I would highly recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did it again. He's written a book that captures your heart from the beginning and brings you in to the lives of the characters he has created. It's beautifully written and combines romance and suspense eloquently. As with all of his books, I highly recommend it. :)
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The writer drew the story with her words.  Beautiful, touching and heartfelt. I enjoyed it. It is a qui m read.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The one star is because even though we as Kindle users pay the most for the app, we are the slowest on getting updates.  I have been looking at this supposed Mayock update for MONTHS and still haven't gotten it.
B008M87GJK|4.0|This app is well designed and laid out.  It gives you quick bits of info and short articles for the main news stories of the day.  In 15 min you can get your morning news fill.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book and read it like a day. Picked it up and didn't want to put it down. I love the energy between the characters.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Not great but not bad either. I bet there is a better one out there but for $.99 it does the job.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love this product. I was disappointed when I got my Knidle that it didn't have these features. So I am excited to be taking pictures of my grandchildren.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I had read about the event in newspapers at the time but, to be able to learn of the intricate preparation involved in the act was truly amazing.  The effort that went into the act itself was impressive and I am delighted that someone found time to tell the world how much advance work was required and how it had to remain secret.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Definitely a good read that seems more like a murder mystery with twists.  I finished the entire thing in a weekend.
B001TH16DI|4.0|This is a welcome addition to any Trekkie's collection!<br /><br />It is great to see some of the (quite) old movies being remastered and in full glory of HD!<br /><br />Definitely worth buying, especially if you can find it on sale.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I have this app on my iphone and I'm a cheerleaders so all of the music from my gym my coach puts on soundcloud!!!!
B000AY74OG|5.0|This is a great movie, even for a toddler..........cannot go wrong with Madagascar!  Great addition to my DVD collection for my granddaughter
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Randomly caught the 2 hour premier and managed to get caught up on 3 1/2 seasons worth. New episodes can't come quick enough. Absolutely love this show!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I a  a serious history buff-- and learned a lot more about the secondWW
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|my granddaughter reccomended this book to me. she is 15. As I understand, it was a required reading for one of her classes.<br />there is a great deal of depth and a whole lot to ponder.
0062238310|5.0|As they say it's a script. It is fun to read if you are a fan. I haven't read it all yet but there are some differences between the book and the Tv show nothing earth shattering but I found it fun. Hoping to find other differences. If your are a fan and don 't want to read the Season 1 verbatim here it is.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works great! Responsive and fun. My kids and I love it!<br />I need nine more words, so here they are.
B006ZPAVUS|5.0|Great concert, a lot of new songs from the last album, nice edition, very dynamic.<br /><br />Magnificent audience.<br /><br />Nice docummentary about how Maiden planned the tour, and the management.
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids love this game. I like it too. My kid enjoys going back & forth with it to see who can get the highest score, so it's pretty cool that we can both enjoy it.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|The best movie ever! Tom Hanks is the best, and this chocolate box it is so nice to my girlfriend
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This movie is gripping,has fine acting,cinematography, and an interesting storyline, that it is definitely worth watching even though it is a foreign film with English subtitles. I liked it so much that I wanted to register my rating.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|You really need to use your brain for this game. It's fun for my 8 year old but a little difficult. He can join the pudding together but figuring out how to get the stars is harder for him.  I find it just challenging enough and still is fun.<br />I would like a way to 'earn' the help feature except for paying for it though.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I love the Sherlock Holmes stories and this book contained many good ones. The book had some display issues with numbers and so it wasn't always clear what the number referenced was but it didn't stop me from enjoying the stories.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|My 11 year old daughter was playing this.  It gives you a random person and the person that she was paired with had drawn some less than appropriate pictures (x rated).  She love to draw and thankfully I am always watching and checking as well as she comes to me when she thinks something is not up to par.  This is a neat game, but maybe the controls should be by age so if they are automatically paired, it is with someone their own age.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Going through the minds of two complex characters. The scary thing is, it seems a little too real. Real page turner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a lot more fun than the original. This game is also great because you have the option to buy extras but you don't have to to continue to play.
B0091CWYQ6|5.0|It's real very useful to use with iPhone and it is not dispensable after you began to use this dac/amplifier
B004HD61KE|5.0|This book kept a hold on me and I couldn't wait to read what was going to happen next.  A great read.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Season Two is the beginning of Stargate's rise to SciFi phenomenon. While Season One had some decent ideas, Season Two cultivates the mythology, the chemistry between the actors, the unique writing style, and the unique style of the Stargate universe. Don't let the aging effects fool you. This is definitely one worth watching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice graphics, no glitches, and best of all, completely free! Definetly worth the download, especially with all the new features added. Nice work Imangi Studios!
B008QYT7DI|3.0|Finally!  The Little Prince on Kindle with color illustrations.  HOWEVER, I am unable to enlarge the print, which makes for a lot of squinting while I re-read this classic piece of literature.  I hope that eventually, Amazon will get it together and make this book more &#34;reader-friendly&#34;.
0545265355|5.0|This is one of the best Trilogies I have ever read. Once I started I couldn't stop, and finished all three in 3 days. For those who aren't aware, it's more of a Sci-fi/action/drama, but there's some romance too. I recommend it to everyone over 13. Don't waste your time buying one at a time, just get em all now, or you'll be sorry later.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Excellent story, better than Pillars, in my opinion. The horrors of the plague brought to life. And such a completely different mindset from today, thank God!
B002GLWMK2|3.0|I thought this concert was kind of long. It was probably one of the best concerts back in the day but you would have had to be stoned. It was lacking something today.
020530902X|5.0|This book is very helpful in in my studies and I have found it to be a very useful addition for writing college papers.
0439813786|5.0|I did not know I could afford to give the hard-back version of this as a gift until I saw what the price was on Amazon. The recipient was very happy and so was I!

B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent.  The acting was great,  the story line was good and it was even a little emotional.
B009329Y30|5.0|Zac Efron is amazing,  In every movie I see him in.  Who would of thought  He comes from a much younger era but he is great in this movie
B008NMT684|5.0|I have two 2 year old grandkids and they both love these puzzles.  They are able to complete them on their own and they get so excited and cheer each time.  Also they love popping the balloons at the end of each puzzle.  Great deal for the money.

1616550414|5.0|I just recieved My Hyrule Historia, and have barely read 60 pages. Each page is filled with a lot of interesting facts about each Zelda game. Artwork, history of the games, different designs for each character in each game.<br />Ok, I am just happy that I can't formulate the correct words for such awesomeness.<br /><br />Best way is for you to simply buy it, you won't regret.
B0026JWDQW|4.0|Paolo's music was recommended to me, and I'd heard a few of the songs on the CD already via youtube - Pencil Full of Lead is a toe-tapping, fun song.  High Hopes -- can't help but smile when I hear that song!  And, Growing Old With You is another beautiful tune on the CD.  In fact, the entire cd is very will written and sung.  Looking forward to more of Paolo's music
B005IKZ1B0|4.0|Great music for the gym. Guetta and company deliver lots of fun upbeat songs to get you moving, and singing along.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Sometimes I can make the argument that language I prefer not to use adds to the song and might even make sense artistically. Other times, like this, it just hurts the music. The &#34;explicit&#34; tag for this album seems to come from two f-bombs in the each of the first two tracks. That's it. They don't even add to the songs. Seems sort of dumb - just like a little poo in a taco - not enough to ruin the appearance or smell, but definitely enough to really leave a bad taste in your mouth. Take those two words out and there's no more poo. Seems like a no-brainer to me.<br /><br />That being said, I really like many of the songs on this album. For example, the title track is this fun blend of an anthem with lyrics that question what the singer stands for. Since anthems usually proclaim &#34;This is what I stand for,&#34; questioning &#34;What do I stand for&#34; seems a clever juxtaposition (look at me using words my English teacher would be proud of!). My kids love the beat and really get a kick out of it!<br /><br />Just a note on listening order - I prefer listening to the tracks in reverse order - that way each song gets better, instead of the other way around. I can do without the last couple or tracks.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased that I bought it. I'm also pleased that I have so many great digital tools at my disposal so I cut the poo out and really sink my teeth into the album!

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Fun movie. Glad I bought because I've watched it at least twice and will watch it again probably within the next few months.
B007SGM084|5.0|What more can I seriously say than that I Love it when I thought it would be totally awkward to read when I know nothing about sex bc I'm a virgin at 19 but nope, love it also much. Gotta say though I blushed through the whole thing and my jaw dropped at a lot different things along with wide eyes and it made my mom always keel over in laughter at my reaction (she hasn't read them bc she was waiting for me to finish them, which I have in three days of nonstop reading, so she's ready to read these). These books have totally lived up to what everyone says they are...amazing, romantic, etc. Can't wait to see of they make a movie bc it will be interesting, but I will most definitely watch it. I think, dare I say it, I loved these more than the \\"Twilight\\".... or okay just as much as them and all my beloved Nicholas Sparks stories(:
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Loud noisy fun, with Daniel Craig looking very craiggy throughout. A waste of Javier Bardem's talent, but decent employment for Ralph Fiennes.

B0015346OM|5.0|A very good detailed story of the events in Somalia, taken from the soldiers perspective. Despite being an historical account of the events, it reads like a novel. It is good also to read some real stories to put into perspectives the fictions on this subject.

B000AP04KQ|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I recently gave it as a gift to a colleague and it was a huge hit. If you're looking for a gift for a co-worker who has any sense of humor at all, you cannot go wrong with this movie. Pairing it with the red Swingline stapler would be a great gift! :)
B0084TWN9K|2.0|I have read Alice Munro in the past and think she is a great short-story author. However, I could not get into any of these stories and never cared what happened to the characters. Maybe it was me this time around but the people were very flat and stories were tedious.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a book I didn't want to put down.  It kept my attention throughout.  When John and his wife traveled to the middle east - it was almost like taking a class about the middle east and drones.  Can't wait for another book to come out.  I love Nelson DeMille!!!  Every one of his books!!
B0083D9MXM|5.0|This collection of 'original jacket' CDs by BMG/SONY Classics was set down on tape originally by Columbia Records in a time period spanning from 1960 to 1977.  It documents Stokowski's work just prior to his most highly praised contract work with Decca in the 1960s and thereafter his final performances in his 90s!  In fact, he was 95 when he completed the final recording in this collection, so we have a set that in its entirety was made in fairly modern stereo.  Unlike the aforementioned Decca recordings ( also a highly recommended set despite its rather gimmicky Phase-4 Stereo) these are recorded in more conventional ways with fewer microphones and adequately but not overly detailed presence.  Like any CD collection, it's not without its hits and misses, but having lived with this set for over a month now I can assure you that it's treasures are ample enough and the interpretations and performances sufficiently satisfying to give you considerable pleasure and enjoyment.<br /><br />Let's get the 'misses' out of the way quickly.  The maestro's penultimate recording of the Brahms 2nd Symphony is beautifully shaped and phrased with none of the sonic effects or mannerisms for which he was often criticized, but it sounds so distantly recorded that it might as well have been played in an adjoining room.  It's the only one in this set I whose sonics I find objectionable.  The remainder of the sessions recorded under the same contract are far more detailed and present despite being made in an even more reverberant locale, London's West Ham Mission.  I was reminded that the Brahms 2nd and Bizet/Mendelssohn Symphonies were recorded in EMI Studio 1. The Bach collection recorded in 1960 with the great Philadelphia orchestra is a bit of a yawn.  Hearing the Brandenburg Fifth Concerto played by a huge mass of strings strikes me as antiquated, although the chorale preludes included are a delight, reminding listeners that Stokowski was originally an outstanding organist, quite devoted to the works of J.S. Bach.  Still, I wont' quibble too much as conductors like Stokowski kept Bach before the public in an era when he might otherwise have been ignored.  Stokowski's orchestral transcriptions of Bach, even if reviled by purists, are still played and enjoyed by modern conductors like Serebrier, Rattle and Slatkin.<br /><br />The 'hits' in this collection are sufficiently numerous to fully justify its low price.  You have the premiere recording, still critically acclaimed to this day, of Ives Fourth Symphony accompanied by several choral pieces of Ives, a document of a typically adventurous Stokowski program.  Then there is the brilliant and unusual reading of Beethoven's 'Emperor' concerto with Glenn Gould at the piano, a rare recording of Stokowski accompanying a solo artist.  The earliest recording in the collection finds Stokowski at the helm of the Philadelphia Orchestra again, in a brisk and warm recording of de Falla's \\"El Amor Brujo' which Stokowski introduced to American audiences in 1922!  The mezzo soloist, Shirley Verrett, Is ideal with these amazingly full chest tones suitable to the flamenco inspired music. That CD includes Wagner's love music from Act II of 'Tristan und Isolde' coupled with the Liebestod, an unusual combination nearly as satisfying as the customary Prelude & Liebestod.  Finally, the Sibelius First Symphony recorded in the late 1970s in London, remains one of the finest recordings its ever received, standing up to competition from Ashkenazy and Karajan. high praise indeed!  Despite some lapses in ensemble (the orchestra was assembled under contract solely for recording sessions) the balances and excitement achieved in many passages of sustained chords with tiered dynamics are testimony to the technical skills of a conductor capable of getting the very best out of his musicians even in his nineties. LIkewise the recordings of the Beethoven and Ives made with the American Symphony Orchestra in NYC. Again, this set is worth it for these 4 recordings alone, but there is more to enjoy in the set.<br /><br />There is a brief booklet with an overview describing each CD briefly along with its recording dates.  No additional info. on the remasterings, although most seem to date from the early 1990s after substantial improvements had been made in technology to transfer analog tapes into the digital domain.  With the exception of the overly reverberant Brahms, ALL the discs sound attractive, warm & clear with no evidence of digital artifacts. There is a bit of clipping in the loudest passages of the oldest 4 CDs, perfectly understandable given their age.<br /><br />The original liner notes are visible on the back of the original jacket sleeves, but you'd need a magnifying glass to read them!<br /><br />The following are brief incapsulated reviews of each disc in the order in which they were recorded.<br /><br />DISC 1- [52:54] 1960<br />Falla - El Amor Brujo<br />Wagner - Tristan und Isolde Love Music<br />Beautiful recorded sound from 1960 of one of America's finest orchestras at its peak.  The El Amor Brujo compares nicely with the definitive decca Fruhbeck de Burgos' recording. The Wagner is a total rarity, a must have recording.<br /><br />DISC 2- [38:27] 1960<br />Bach - BWV1050 Brandenburg Concerto 5<br />Bach - BWV0639<br />Bach - BWV0599<br />Bach - BWV0680<br />A brisk straightforward Brandenburg reading by massed strings.  May sound antiquated to those now used to historically informed performances.  The Choral Preludes are delightful.<br /><br />DISC 3- [42:36] 1966<br />Beethoven - Piano Concerto 5 Op 73 Emperor<br />An original brilliantly played performance of this war horse.  Highly recommended to anyone who loves the piece, no matter if you have other recordings of it, THIS is one you have to hear.  Aside from some odd shifts of tempo and accents in the opening cadenza's, Gould's approach is simultaneously both personal and natural.  The accompaniment reveals Stokowski as a 'sound' conductor finding some unusual balances and sonorities in this familiar score. This is Beethoven as a romantic.<br /><br />DISC 4- [69:55] The only disk with bonus material<br />Ives - Symphony 4 1965<br />Ives - Robert Browning Overture 1966<br />Ives - Majority or the Mases 1967<br />Ives - They Are There 1967<br />Ives - An Election 1967<br />Ives - Lincoln the Great Commoner 1967<br />This was the premiere recording of the Ives Fourth, still competitive and recommended against current digital recordings such as Litton's Dallas Symphony SACD on Hyperion.  Nice to have the unusual choral pieces and overture.  All very well recorded in excellent mid sixties stereo sound.<br /><br />The final discs are all recorded in a highly reverberant acoustic with an orchestra of contract London musicians.  While their ensemble is not as tight as the orchestras from which many of them came. they are excellent musicians, apparent from the outstanding solo work heard throughout.  The recordings are sufficiently warm and detailed if highly reverberant, with the exception of the Brahms. They even managed to find an oboist that plays with an American or Italian sounding timber.<br /><br />DISC 8- [42:56] May 1976<br />Tchaikovsky - Auroras Wedding<br />So many conductors have subjected us to boring run-throughs of Tchaikovsky's ballet scores, or stretched them beyond any notion of danceability.  Here Stokowski reveals how to keep the lilt and spring in ballet music while giving it symphonic architecture and weight.  This is a lovely approach, compiling the very best of \\"Sleeping Beauty' on one disc.<br /><br />DISC 6- Leopold Stokowski Transcriptons [39:37] July 1976<br />Rimsky Korsakov- Flight of the Bumblebee<br />Debussy - Claire de Lune<br />Chopin - Mazurka in B-Flat Minor<br />Debussy - La Soiree dans Grenade<br />Novacek - Perpetuum Mobile<br />Tchaikovsky - Humoresque<br />Albeniz - Fete Dieu a Seville<br />Shostakovich - Prelude in E-Flat Minor<br />Rimsky Korsakov - Ivan the Terrible<br />Chopin - Prelude in d Minor<br />A classic Stokowski collection of short encore pieces, all designed to show off the brilliance of the orchestra.  The dynamics in the string tremolos and first trumpet articulation in the Ivan the Terrible piece are amazing.<br /><br />DISC 5- [55:57] August 1976<br />Bizet - Carmen Suites<br />Bizet - L Arlesienne Suites<br />These compare favorably with popular recordings by Beecham, but in much more modern sound.<br /><br />DISC 7- [45:44] November 1976<br />Sibelius - Symphony 1 in E Minor Op 39<br />Sibelius - The Swan of Tuonela<br />One of the very best recordings of the Sibelius First.  An all stops out romantic performance that blazes with emotion, making the most out of Sibelius' unusual orchestral sonorities.<br /><br />DISC 10- [55:50] April 1977<br />Brahms - Symphony 2 in D Major Op 73<br />Brahms - Tragic Ouverture Op 81<br />A surprisingly straightforward well played and shaped performance of the Brahms symphony and overture.  Unfortunately it's marred by a distant perspective that clouds the rather dense textures of Brahms orchestral writing.<br /><br />DISC 9- [56:30] June 1977<br />Mendelssohn - Symphony 4<br />Bizet - Symphony in C<br />Surprisingly taught performances from a 95 year old conductor!  I expected to be bored by yet another Mendelssohn 'Italian' but this one is shaped with a number of lovely details in phrasing, is perfectly balanced and compares favorably with those by Klemperer, Commissiona, and Abbado.  The Bizet is very well played at tempos that show off the orchestra's ability to articulate well without sounding rushed or insensitive.  It is the first one I've heard that compares favorably with Beecham's and with far better orchestral execution.  It IS amazing that Stokowski had such energy and technical dexterity at age 95!<br /><br />Considering the price and diversity of programming in this collection, i'd recommend you buy it.  The conductor's finest performances (Tchaikovsky 5th, La Mer, Pictures at an Exhibition, Franck D-Minor) are found in the decca collection, and there are some excellent ones in the EMI and RCA sets as well.  You could actually build a decent classical collection by owning all of them.  There is really no one like Stokowski on the scene today so fascinated with his own stardom, new music, orchestral sonority and experimentation and in possession of the same technical proficiency.  You owe it to yourself to check this set out and find out why he was so justifiably famous.  Eccentric perhaps but boring? Never. So buy this already!a 'sound' conductor finding some unusual balances and sonorities in this familiar score. This is Beethoven as a romantic.<br /><br />DISC 4- [69:55] The only disk with bonus material<br />Ives - Symphony 4 1965<br />Ives - Robert Browning Overture 1966<br />Ives - Majority or the Mases 1967<br />Ives - They Are There 1967<br />Ives - An Election 1967<br />Ives - Lincoln the Great Commoner 1967<br />This was the premiere recording of the Ives Fourth, still competitive and recommended against current digital recordings such as Litton's Dallas Symphony SACD on Hyperion.

They even managed to find an oboist that plays with an American or Italian sounding timber.<br /><br />DISC 8- [42:56] May 1976<br />Tchaikovsky - Auroras Wedding<br />So many conductors have subjected us to boring run-throughs of Tchaikovsky's ballet scores, or stretched them beyond any notion of danceability.  Here Stokowski reveals how to keep the lilt and spring in ballet music while giving it symphonic architecture and weight.  This is a lovely approach, compiling the very best of \\"Sleeping Beauty' on one disc.<br /><br />DISC 6- Leopold Stokowski Transcriptons [39:37] July 1976<br />Rimsky Korsakov- Flight of the Bumblebee<br />Debussy - Claire de Lune<br />Chopin - Mazurka in B-Flat Minor<br />Debussy - La Soiree dans Grenade<br />Novacek - Perpetuum Mobile<br />Tchaikovsky - Humoresque<br />Albeniz - Fete Dieu a Seville<br />Shostakovich - Prelude in E-Flat Minor<br />Rimsky Korsakov - Ivan the Terrible<br />Chopin - Prelude in d Minor<br />A classic Stokowski collection of short encore pieces, all designed to show off the brilliance of the orchestra.  The dynamics in the string tremolos and first trumpet articulation in the Ivan the Terrible piece are amazing.<br /><br />DISC 5- [55:57] August 1976<br />Bizet - Carmen Suites<br />Bizet - L Arlesienne Suites<br />These compare favorably with popular recordings by Beecham, but in much more modern sound.<br /><br />DISC 7- [45:44] November 1976<br />Sibelius - Symphony 1 in E Minor Op 39<br />Sibelius - The Swan of Tuonela<br />One of the very best recordings of the Sibelius First.  An all stops out romantic performance that blazes with emotion, making the most out of Sibelius' unusual orchestral sonorities.<br /><br />DISC 10- [55:50] April 1977<br />Brahms - Symphony 2 in D Major Op 73<br />Brahms - Tragic Ouverture Op 81<br />A surprisingly straightforward well played and shaped performance of the Brahms symphony and overture.  Unfortunately it's marred by a distant perspective that clouds the rather dense textures of Brahms orchestral writing.<br /><br />DISC 9- [56:30] June 1977<br />Mendelssohn - Symphony 4<br />Bizet - Symphony in C<br />Surprisingly taught performances from a 95 year old conductor!  I expected to be bored by yet another Mendelssohn 'Italian' but this one is shaped with a number of lovely details in phrasing, is perfectly balanced and compares favorably with those by Klemperer, Commissiona, and Abbado.  The Bizet is very well played at tempos that show off the orchestra's ability to articulate well without sounding rushed or insensitive.  It is the first one I've heard that compares favorably with Beecham's and with far better orchestral execution.  It IS amazing that Stokowski had such energy and technical dexterity at age 95!<br /><br />Considering the price and diversity of programming in this collection, i'd recommend you buy it.  The conductor's finest performances(Tchaikovsky 5th, La Mer, Pictures at an Exhibition, Franck D-Minor) are found in the decca collection, and there are some excellent ones in the EMI and RCA sets as well.  You could actually build a decent classical collection by owning all of them.  There is really no one like Stokowski on the scene today so fascinated with his own stardom, new music, orchestral sonority and experimentation and in possession of the same technical proficiency.  You owe it to yourself to check this set out and find out why he was so justifiably famous.  Eccentric perhaps but boring? Never. So buy this already!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I got into this series and loved it. It starts off fast and exciting right away and doesn't let up. Although toward the end it gets a little wonky, I am still looking forward to seeing what comes next.
0470638842|5.0|Simple to understand and very useful for anyone trying to promote their business through social media. A must read for all marketing people
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I enjoyed the film's cinematography, it was well done but in terms of the story,  I didn't really love it as much as I would have expected. Long story short, the movie ended similarly to the ending of donnie darko, which left me annoyed, but I understand why the writer had finished in such a fashion (though having seen Donnie Darko, left the feeling of &#34;ive seen it before&#34; in my mind). note: both films were great and are different in their own respect.<br /><br />The video quality was great, sound was up to par. No complaints about the product itself. Well written movie, well filmed, all over good experience.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|High quality soap opera.  Creative and engaging storyline.  Terrific fun with beautiful sets and costume.  All the acting is good and the &#34;old world&#34; language, with its formality, slower pacing, elegant word choice, and propriety, is a satisfying pleasure and worthwhile counterpoint to the contemporary standard.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The format of this book was different and it made for an easy read. The book has you rooting for Charlie and hoping that things turn out well for him.  Would recommend reading.
B002ZNJW0O|5.0|as a fan of Nicholas Sparks' books, i'm inclined to like any book that he puts out.  this one is no different.  another quick and easy read.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I enjoyed this, good action film. Enough intrigue and story to keep you guessing. Colin Farrell doesn't disappoint. Good co-stars.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Better than the T.V. Show. My kind of story. Just the right mixture of fantasy and fiction. Loved it. Going to read them all.
031606792X|5.0|it's Twilight...if you like it, you'll read them all.  all of the books are definitely so much better than the movies!
0765325950|4.0|Pros: Closes a lot of plot threads and gives an epic final battle between the forces of light and darkness.<br /><br />Cons: Not too happy about the treatment of certain characters. Heroism is fine, but at least one bad guy I expected to feature very prominently was given a nearly insignificant role.<br /><br />Overall: Nice to finally put an end to this series after decades of reading it.
0316067598|5.0|with the media coverage on everything these days, it's interesting to hear the story being told by one of the actual participants.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Clever writing, great actors who fit the part.  Best ensemble cast on a television show since Seinfeld. Would highly recommend ... bazinga!

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have a problem hitting the snooze over and over in the mornings.  AFter twenty years of working I should be use to getting up early but that will never happen.  This alarm is awesome, I have it set prompt me to solve math problems before I can hit snooze.  And I only get to do it two times.  At first I had it set for medium level math questions but they were too hard for a groggy mind so I set it to easy and am happy now.  Of course you can change all kinds of settings on this thing so you don't have to solve math problems for some extra snoozes....
034580404X|4.0|i heard all of the hype so just had to know for myself...bought the trilogy.  i thought it was a very quick read.  unlike any other story i've read, for sure!  initially felt awkwardly written, but i think that may just be the perspective from which the story is told.  got used to that fast enough, and it wasn't distracting enough to make me put down the books.  enjoyable.
B005ONTD42|5.0|product was great there just isnt a lot to do with a remote control ball though figured that out after i bought it
B0025UHKNS|5.0|my first Garmin, so perhaps i'm partly just excited by the technology.  love this watch.  had a problem with it before i even used it the first time (button fell off!).  sent it back to Garmin and received a replacement quickly.  haven't had a problem since.  easy to use, easy to download, store and track past runs.  highly recommend.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I installed this game on my phone for my 3 yr. Old girl. Now im the one hooked with this Hello Kitty Cafe game. The graphics are so cute! Im a Hello Kitty fan since I was a kid. Love it! Wish games like this go over violent games in popularity.

B00899E7VM|5.0|The recording and the performance of these super musicians just keep on getting better everytime.. Must be from another world.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Begins a little cliche, but ends up as a surprisingly good movie.  Would recommend it to others.  All actors are well cast for their roles.
B002SXZVWY|5.0|Super recording,, for me one of the best if not the best fusion band of all times. Multy talented musicians and meaningful music.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|THIS IS THE ONE SHOW I NEVER MISS , I BUY THE SEASON WHEN IT FIRST STARTS $1.89. WHICH SAVES ME A DIME WITH EVERY VIEWING. THIS IS THE ONLY SHOW I PURCHASE SO I CAN SEE IT EVERY WEEK.

B005LAII62|5.0|I do not know what i expected to see, but it was fun.  I do not think this movies is for young children, as it contains a lot of adult humor.  We enjoyed it.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think the corniness did ramp up a bit for these later season, but I think it's still entertaining and beautiful to watch. I'll deal with the corny ridiculousness.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I watched it in two days and was deeply disappointed not to have a second season. Will never understand why NBC canceled it. It's right up there with 24, Fringe, Breaking Bad, Homeland.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|This was better than I thought it would be. It was a fun movie even for the parents. I would definitely recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Unique program.  Great acting, great scenes, great costumes, great writing.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  Give us more!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After about a week of research and deliberation I decided to purchase this Anker gaming mouse over its competitors.  Specifically, I was interested in a laser mouse with high DPI and polling rate options, but with custom profiles available at the users discretion instead of fixed preset settings.  I was also looking for a mouse with a more natural, comfortable design (palm resting grip), coming from using a MS Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000, another laser mouse that fulfilled its role as a portable option, but was not ideal for home and game use, and required a more 'claw-like' grip, using your thumb and ring fingers to hold the mouse with an arched hand, which was precise for delicate work but forced and awkward in a more tense game setting.  So, for comfort, the Anker mouse was an instant relief.<br /><br />I was also interested in additional, customizable side buttons.  I used to play primarily FPS games, but now play MOBA games almost exclusively, LoL in particular.  For that reason, I was deciding between this mouse and the Razer Naga Hex mouse.  The 6 side buttons on that mouse were attractive, but there was a pretty distinct difference in the inconsistent reviews of that mouse compared to the almost universally loved reviews of this one.  After a short time using this mouse it became clearly apparent why people enjoy this mouse so much.<br /><br />First, an often overlooked point in reviews of mice - the left and right mouse buttons are fantastic.  They are well shaped, good sized, well gripped, quick, crisp, responsive, and easy to depress.  That said, there is sufficient resistance, so you won't find yourself accidentally clicking buttons like with lesser, cheap, flimsy mice.  They also sound good - responsive, and distinct (left is rapid, right sounds more intentional) but not to the point where they are overly loud or annoying at all.  Also the scroll wheel is a great, rubberized, with short noticeable (almost silent) ticks as it turns that also strikes a great balance between ease of use and ample resistance to prevent accidental input.<br /><br />The mouse is packaged impressively, securely, and was free of mechanical or cosmetic defect.  Installation was a snap.  I plugged the gold-plated UBS connector (surely a nice touch, even if it doesn't translate to much of a quantitatively significant effect) and the mouse was instantly recognized by Windows 7 and installed the basic drivers.  I went and downloaded the latest drivers from ianker.com (took about a minute to navigate to and download - about 3 clicks, simple to find, and without hoops or fluff) and installed them in less than another minute.  I was then presented with the incredible customizable profiles where the buttons can be programmed and even a macro can be recorded and reproduced (a nice added benefit).  Even the ability to customize the mouse lighting, color, intensity, and pulsating rate were all great touches on an already technically superior mouse.  Finally, the case containing 8 metal weights that can be inserted into a compartment on the underside of the mouse (in a revolver arrangement, allowing a balanced or asymmetric weight distribution) were much appreciated, coming from using a wireless mouse that contained 2 AA batteries and was definitely on the heavy side.  Adding the weight made it easier to adjust to this mouse, and I'm sure in time I'll come up with my own preferred weight, but just having that option is great.<br /><br />The side buttons are positioned incredibly well for right-handed use.  They are also crisp and responsive, and distinct enough to easily tell the three apart from each other.  The button to change profiles is easily accessible, and there are 4 lights on the top of the mouse, left of the left mouse button, signifying which profile is currently active.  You can also disable one or more profiles so that it only switches between two, for instance, e.g. profile 2 at moderate DPI and profile 3 and high DPI, for on the fly changes according to game specific (or otherwise) needs.<br /><br />*******<br />Overall, this mouse lived up to the overwhelmingly positive reviews I read here on Amazon and then some.  The company is great and included a lengthy warranty in case of any problems, though I don't expect any.  From what I can tell, they are extremely prompt addressing customer concerns both through comment replies to reviewers on Amazon and through email.  Don't be fooled by the price - this mouse has the technology equal or superior to mice that are 2 or 3 times as expensive (upwards of 70-120 dollars).  It is well constructed, well presented, and well designed.  The braided USB cord is built to last, and the smooth teflon feet on the base of the mouse make using it a joy.  I am extremely happy with the purchase and would buy it again without hesitation.  I am very glad I chose this mouse over the more expensive, lower quality alternatives with inferior support.  This review and and steady stream of others like it should assure you that Anker's entry into the mouse market was not done without careful consideration and thoughtful engineering.  Anker is the way to go!nges according to game specific (or otherwise) needs.<br /><br />*******<br />Overall, this mouse lived up to the overwhelmingly positive reviews I read here on Amazon and then some.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|GREAT movie!!!  I highly recommend it.  The casting is superb and the story is sweet and fresh.  The relationships in this story are complex and unusual.  I will buy this movie.

B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Thoroughly enjoyed all the previous Pendergast books and waited eagerly for this final in a ttrilogy about Pendergast's wife. What a disappointment!<br />The FBI shouldn't even pay this fallen hero $1 per year. Lacking in moral character Pendergast and this series should retire to the old plantation never to be heard from again. The only redeeming value of the book is that it laid to rest some mysterious issues in previous books.
B000KIRT6A|3.0|This graphic eq does exactly what it says it will do. However, it is a little bit noisy which can be totally annoying when trying to pull out specific tones. If it was 100% quality wise this thing would be killer! You get what you pay for though, a cheap little eq ready to go!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I think this movie tries to do a bit of what the original &#34;Bring It On&#34; did, and it does succeed in that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is funny, and the music is well done and fun.  Grab some popcorn, sit back and enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the style of the book; the author choose a &#34;diary&#34; or journal type format.  So it was a daily account of the main characters account of what was happening.  The story moved quickly, with much attention to detail and character development.  It is way more than a &#34;teenage&#34; lust story or falling in love the first time.  The story takes off right from the start and has the kind of twist and turns that create the ultimate page turner.<br />I enjoyed this book so much I have gone to the library (remember those) and checked out her first two novels.  colleen Hoover is a terrific writer and definatley worth reading
B00APJLFEG|3.0|That monsters are the ones scared of humans and are just misunderstood. Overall it was a very good kids flick, that adults can also enjoy.  However it isn't a movie that I would want to watch twice, I enjoyed it but didn't love it.
B000I3PERS|5.0|I love this movie!  The story, the acting, even the soundtrack never fail to inspire me and give me courage to stand up for what is right.
0062200909|5.0|I love all things Hobbit and so I was thrilled to get this book.  It's great to see how very different the characters, specially the Dwarves, would've looked had they gone with their original makeup concepts for them.  I'm so very happy with the end results.  If you really loved the film then this book is a great companion.  It talks about the design process for the sets and the characters.

B000Q66JXA|5.0|I have always loved this movie because it's very close to the original tales of King Arthur and his Knights.  The Blu Ray movie looks stunning, it's almost like watching it for the very first time again.  If you love this movie or if you love anything dealing with the legend of King Arthur then get this film
B008JFUNTG|5.0|Ha<br />Haven't seen it. But it will probably be not like the book at all. Make it good Rick Riordan!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing show. Can't believe that they got away with half the stuff they do on cable TV. Just as good as any HBO show.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I was expecting some kind of additional content, besides the DVD's. Even a mini-poster or a sticker would've been nice!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great show, good acting and plot, very interesting premise for the different shows. Waiting for season three.  Can not come soon enough.

B00B01XDTI|3.0|Silent Hill 3 is my favorite in the series (aside from 1 of course, I'll never forget the first time I played that). I had no idea this movie was going to be about Heather untill I saw her white vest and hoodie sweater. In the opening scene. It hard to say if this one was bad or good. Really I just think it was too short. The plot stuck to the game a lot more than the first movie did and I like that even though some things changed she went to all the correct locations AND IN ORDER!!!. I disliked SH1 the movie so much because it was barely anything like the game. With Silent Hill Revelation's what's changed so much is that the movie has a lot more akward gore scenes than suspense. Silent Hill isn't really a \\"gory\\" type of game it's more of a \\"suspense\\" type of story. So that was a bit wierd to see as it didn't exactly fit with the theme of the game. There's no people getting chopped up or having thier skin sawed off in the game so why is it in the movie I don't know, also theres these random soldier guys thrown in and the town seems to be full of people which is also strange. In the game the town is empty and only monsters run about. That's what makes it strange when you find a real live humanbeing but in the movie that seems to be forgotten. They did the \\"Nurse\\" scene again in this movie I liked that part they're iconic to the game. What is thrown off that puts me halfway between this being good or bad is the storyline. Some stuff is true to the game but the some of it isn't. SH3 explains a lot about why silent hill is the way it is and the forces behind it. You see Pyramid Head doing his job as Alessa's protector but you don't see the other one that's responsible for turning the normal world into the nightmare world by turning the valves. Not that it's a big deal but it's a major part of the story line to explain the two guardians. Also there's Alessa and the order and their mission isn't explained well about them wanting to create a new God and Heather being the key to giving birth to that God. The ending feels very rushed like the movie is missing about another 45minutes. Considering how much I disliked the first one but how I wanted to see more of this one I say it's a decent movie but it could have ended better. If they do make another movie I atleast hope they adopt thier own story and pick it up where they left off with Heather. I don't mind seeing her since she is one of my favorite SH characters.ey to giving birth to that God. The ending feels very rushed like the movie is missing about another 45minutes.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was really intrigued  when I  first discovered an erotic novel about BDSM. And very happy also. Because BDSM can be very erotic. Unfortunately, this novel made me feel like I was reading a bad Harlequin's book with a 18+ rating. The book just doesn't go where it's suppose to. The heroine play hard to get and the man can hardly keep is dominance on her. Shall we just give them both a good spanking? . Really disappointing
B000YI7MRM|4.0|I had this movie in my save cue at Netflix for over a year and it hadn't move up to my disk cue so I decided to by it at Amazon.<br />Great move and a great movie.

B005COO1X6|2.0|Nothing new... another novel with this same style that has become quite boring... one can esily predict after reading about one third of the book what the outcome will be. It is almost unbelievable that this is a novel by the same author who wrote the excellent 11/22/63.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like the game but after a few minutes it turns my Kindel off and it taks awhile for it to come back on.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The title of my review says everything about this book.  I believe that it is Mr. Kink's best novel up to now, and I don't think that I can add something more. The book is excellent in every respect, and it keeps the reader interest high all the time. For someone like myself who has lived the \\"past\\" of the sixties, it is a real pleasure to go back there and remember this so-well described life, and I believe that young people who read the book will be also intrigued by this \\"feel of the sixties\\". Time travel is also at its best, very cleverly overcoming the known pitfalls. Finally, is is a science fiction story as much as a romance, both very well combined in favor of the second, revealing how true love can survive almost everything, even time itself.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Edge of the seat intense...recommend this book..<br />I don't even know how to begin to explain how I felt reading this at times I was giddy then more than not just sad and tearful.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Enjoyable book from at time when Empire was romantically displayed. A book for young men and older men, but my daughters and wife would prefer something else. Easy reading that presents a less than complex theme, but fun to read, adventure stories.

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Unless you are a recovering alcoholic or know someone who is, you will find this movie to be boring beyond words.  Denzel \\"flying\\" the plane is pretty riveting, but before and after that is exceedingly dull, unless you want to keep a count on the number of times the \\"f\\" word is used.  This is the first movie that I paid for, watched (except for a short nap), and promptly threw in the trash.  I guess I could have donated it to a local AA meeting or something. Don't buy it.  In fact, don't even borrow it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|An 8th grader could write better than this if he or she had the sexual experience to do so. No plot at all. Nothing but four letter words and repeated sex without any love interest at all. The protagonists have nothing in common except sex.  It was so boring that I almost gave up reading, but  I did struggle to finish the book. I find it hard to believe that the lives of so many people are so boring that they made the time to read all three volumes of this series. Skip this one!
B000EQHHJW|5.0|I'm not a perfectionist or fanatic opera buff, though a lot of fine performances by Pavarotti, Sutherland, Freni, Kewana, Troyanos, and many others have flowed under my bridge.<br /><br />I recently purchased a relatively small 32\\" high def because a big chunk of my substantial dvd collection is from jazz, classical and opera performances of many years past. Not too good for a 52\\" screen.<br /><br />Ok, so I hauled this out this afternoon, turned on the subtitles and let it flow through a good sound system. I often wonder what opera I would choose to show to a friend or relative not familiar with the genre. Sure, Boheme (I love the Australian version), Turandot.... But as this cranked up I found myself sucked right into its production values and singing. Proper chicanery by courtiers who would sell their mothers for a dime, a look from Pavarotti that screams 'I'm a cad who can have what I want and, yeah, sing' (which he may have been) and the revelations of Wixell and Gruberova, neither of whom I have seen in person or on film.<br /><br />What I liked about the production is that it truly revealed what opera is as a romantic and oft corny thing. It flowed and, despite the very  unhappy ending, left me smiling and wanting to share it with someone other than my wife who popped in and out while trying to get some work done.<br /><br />Why oh why can't our broadcast media give us music like this????? We know the answer but films like this one remind us we can do better to educate friends, kids and family about opera , which is now too expensive for most of us to enjoy in truly high quality.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have plans to see the movie so reading the story first was the plan. I would recommend this even if you have seen the movie.
0446580848|4.0|The Panther is a long book but I finished it in under 24 hours, that's how engaging the plot was for me. John Corey is back in Yemen, this time with his wife, and his task is to apprehend/terminate a U.S. born jihadist. There a many neat specifics about the locale and various technologies used that make the plot more believable. However, this is a work of fiction, so do take that with a grain of salt. On the negative side, Corey's wisecracks get to be annoying after a while. The ending is anticlimactic and the violence is gratuitous. Overall, a fun read.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Not really an \\"official\\" SG fan, but loved this.  Motivated me to go back and start with SG-1.  We'll see.
B000004CYT|3.0|When it comes to completely Beethoven symphonic cycles on original instruments, my top choices have been those with Bruggen and Immerseel conducting. I was never too crazy about Norrington's because of the performances and not taken with Goodman's because of the sound. Gardiner's set has a lot of cachet, but I soured on it rather early. I'm not sure exactly why, but despite all the hype it didn't strike me as all that special. And, truth to tell, I have somewhat the same reaction to this cycle by Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music. Not that I find it horribly bad, but to me the moments that should have bite and edge just don't. The fire merely smolders instead of burning brightly in those places. Oh, in other spots things go rather well, actually -- particularly in the softer, amiable moments. Hogwood's Beeethoven doesn't frown a whole lot, but rather arches his brows to feign intensity. I've admired the efforts of these forces elsewhere, most notably in the early symphonies of Mozart, and even in the piano concertos of Beethoven, but here in the latter composer's symphonies the results strike me as mixed. Overall it's okay and then some, but I just can't give it four stars. Instead of 3.5, then, here's 3 instead.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a really fun game if you love horses then this game is for you. I think the grafics are great and it is a really good game for kids
B0033QC0WE|4.0|When this Beethoven cycle on period instruments first came out, I rather liked it, but in the meantime I must admit that I've soured on it. Or, perhaps it's that with a subsequent experience of other sets based on \\"historically informed\\" practices, I found I liked others better. It's not that I object to fast tempos; actually, I rather like them -- they are refreshing in their way. No, I just find these recordings seriously lacking emotional fire and, to a degree, nuance. My first choice these days for period instrument Beethoven is the set conducted by Immerseel, which is fast and emotional, but still doesn't obscure the textures of the works, and you get a slew of overtures as well. Right now I would rate this cycle by Gardiner at 3.5, but thinking back to my first reaction to it, I'd like to be sentimental and give it 3.75, and the irresistible bargain price further bumps it to an even 4. It's okay, but you can do better with Immerseel or Bruggen.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The premise of an older man walking to see his old friend who is dying from cancer captures the imagination.  There are good &#34;nuggets&#34; of advice about the effect of tragedy on our lives and how we often block out the very people who could help us heal.  But the ending was a bit too formulaic.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This is an enjoyable book but I think it really caters to a specific audience.  If you:<br /><br />1) grew up in the 80s<br />2) played D&D<br />3) ever frequented the coin arcades<br />4) listened to 80s music<br />5) watched 80s movies like Wargames<br />6) Played the original console games like Atari<br />7) know who Ultraman and Johnny Socko's Flying Robot are<br /><br />or if you:<br />1) currently play MMOs<br />2) are into cyberpunk/hacker type stories<br /><br />.. then you'll probably like this book.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it as a fine literary work or for its plot, but, as a child of the eighties I definitely enjoyed it and could genuinely relate to it.  So for me, it's a 4 star rating.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is totally addicting. downloaded for my grandson too. we have hours and hours of fun together. he has even taught his grandfather how  to play
B0043WHRWA|5.0|I love this show, so I am probably prejudice. Beckett could hand cuff me any time she wants. Seriously, unlike most real female cops that are just dikes, she is a real woman.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Very well done.  They are a very dedicated, talented and professional band.  Glad to see Joe kept his sense of humor and has stayed off the sauce.  We have watched it more than once and often just pick out a tune some nights to watch before going to bed to free the mind from all that darn thinking.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|Overall a very well put together application. There are some quirks and bugs to it that need to be ironed out, but nothing major.<br />Provides lots of Bible versions to choose from, and a large amount of reading plans.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I have to give it to John Goodman and Denzel Washington in this movie because without their acting the movie wouldn't leave you with much. I think it had a lot of potential and the trailer certainly shows that, but it fell short when it came to the ending.<br /><br />***Spoil Alert***<br /><br />The roller coaster ride gets really old when Denzel puts you in that position of, \\"will he do it?\\" and he does it every time. By the end you hate his character and can't continue to cheer him on in trying to redeem himself. I understand the ending tries to accomplish a sense of closure but it's just too obvious and frustrating. The line that seals the deal for me goes something like this, \\"One more lie. I just needed to tell one more lie.\\"<br /><br />Worth a rent, not a spot on your shelf.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I searched apps for a long time for camera apps for my Kindle F-HD ,And seems this one is fine i did not buy my Kindle for an extra camera but it'll come in handy im sure .This app has features similar to your cell so it was a snap to use and worked without any trouble . actually i took one of the coolest pictures I've ever taken , Completely by accident but i think you'll agree its cool ! Oops guess you cant attach here my bad sorry ?????

B001NLKZUA|3.0|This book is well witten and has a unique premise.  However, I really think that this book is intended for the young adult audience.  Since all of the characters are young.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I have this on my cell and Kindle and its a must ! batteries in our toys are fickle . And trust me you need to keep an eye on charging up and running down .Always keeping your battery levels at your finger tips is so cool !i own a mess of electronic things and being able to monitor w/voice and sound is awesomeness!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very good game and very challenging.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone that likes a challange.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I was curious about the game and if we would like playing.well my wife got a hold of it and proceeded to beat 11levels woo hoooo no lock ups just good fun!!
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|Emmy Rossum, has a voice that can sing anything from Phantom to Gershwin. I was very pleasantly surprized to hear some of my favorite old songs on this album.  She has that old soul sound, that those of the big band era.  I have about worn out Sentimental Journey .  I play it in the car and sing a long... and for me that is a 5 star CD.
B00B7FXYJG|1.0|this movie didn't work when I tried to watch it it would get stuck or pause when I tried to get into the movie
B004EBT5CU|4.0|What the devil, I have to write 20 words or more about a CD that any simpleton can see is wonderful, provided that same simpleton likes Adele.  It's a great CD, no surprises.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Great character development!  Wonderful discussion about why man has the ability to choose a life of good vs evil.  It's obvious why it's considered a classic
B0063M22QO|1.0|First the game crashed my Kindle, I had to turn it off and hope it would come back to life THEN when I again turned it on, I was told Mahjong had &#34;encounted an error&#34; and had to be reloaded.  I doubt if I will.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This is an excellent true story for fire fight in Vietnam. Mel Gibson did an excellent performance of a true war hero. I would highly recommend this movie for history of just small part of Vietnam War.

B008IYR2BA|5.0|I love this show! Can`t wait for season seven!  Its hard to wait for the next episode, its pretty addicting.
B0015AARJI|1.0|It is a product that is not original, it downloads only without use, buttons and levers are harder than normal, if you leave it plugged into the console does not turn off the latter never, but restarts when you are going off , is made ​​in China. As a child I was cheated.
B005YPJ31I|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin knows her stuff and is a great writer.  This book is quite detailed but a great historial read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a good book. I thought it would be just about the operation pregnant killed bin Laden, and while  that was a big part of the story, that wasn't all it was . It gave me a better look at the inner workings of a navy seal.
B004GTLVIQ|5.0|This is part of a seven book series by Diana Gabaldon. It is brilliant! Give it a try...I hope you will love it as much as I did!

B004A8ZX2I|4.0|This was an very good movie with a surprise outcome.  My problem is with the purchase itself; there was no insert with the digital copy code so I was unable to download the movie.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Great series! I would highly recommend this DVD...the acting is amazing. I have watched it several times and saw something new each time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series.  Although I skipped over much of the &#34;sexual content&#34;.  I really enjoyed the story.  Even my husband is reading and enjoying.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I find this app. to be more accurate than most. I check it every day and it does better than the people on the TV station that I usually watch.
0316069434|5.0|Excellent service and the book was just as described! I really enjoy Michael Connelly's character, Harry Bosch as well as the other characters in this book.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|It was not quite what I expected, but was very good.<br />More than a movie about a plane crash, more of a story of a man finally coming to grip with his demons.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Shinedown. This is another great addition to my collection! This album hits it out of the park!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Better than Logitech. If you have small hands I would pass if you use it constantly, The claw affect & it makes your wrist hurt and thumb. Medium to large hands will be fine. I paid $29.99 for it, the software works well but I wish it had more ways to customize the buttons. Weight package was easy to install & took about 3 minutes to get it right. Still trying to find a mouse that fits my hand well for Gaming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was awesome and you should buy it! I think you will like It. You should try it right now.

B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Got this app as the FAOTD a few days ago, and was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are great, the music suits the game and doesn't annoy me into turning the volume down, and overall gameplay is awesome! Highly recommended app!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Grreat story!  Recommend to anyone who is in for adventure.  Haven't seen the movie although they say it is good too!
B000W93CHC|5.0|We loved the twists and turns the lives within the story touch. Plenty of twists, just when one didn't expect them
B002PJL85K|1.0|This was a low-budget movie made in a low-imagination framework at a time when special effects could have really helped this production! But even that is doubtful!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is super fun. Very addicting. I play the game all the time. It's not an easy game so you always wanna keep playing
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a heck of a lot of fun to play. The only problem is, after hours of playing, my eyes no longer work. If I look at anything other than the game, it's all blurry.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Cute movie.  My 2.5 year old didn't get it tho.  Most Disney movies keep his attention.  Even the real-amation movies, like Polar Express have him transfixed.
0142418471|5.0|I love John Green's books so I was anxious to read this collaboration once I had read all his others. It does not disappoint. While the shift in style from Green to Levitan is a little jarring the first time it occurs, it ultimately helps create two completely distinct characters. Green writes with his usual absurdness and wit, and now I can't wait to read Levitan's other works. Read it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Make sure you get the original UK version.  The revised &#34;edited&#34; US version is a poor copy of the real thing.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Love this! Great item, songs and display box. Really impressed with it. Price was decent too. Thanks so much! :)
B007GE2H3G|3.0|Could have a better story line for such a well put together film. Animation was great but I soon got bored.
B005LAII1C|5.0|In this movie, Peter Griffin plays a teddy bear, and Mark Whalburn does a cameo for 2 hours.<br /><br />Basically a live action family guy, with a lot of the same references.  If you like Family guy, you'll like this.<br /><br />It has 0 cinematic value.  Its not a good date movie, and its not a good family movie.<br /><br />Its funny... we'll leave it at that.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this story and can't wait till the next installment comes out. Travis and Abby face some ups and downs, but have moved forward with their lives. Looking forward to April when the next installment is due to come out.
B008FIHUDO|4.0|This album was not what I expected, but I enjoyed listening to it.  Some of the songs are a bit depressing, but the vocal performance is amazing!
B008JTK9NW|5.0|I am a huge P.O.D. fan and have been for a very long time. I love the album, have some favorite songs already.
B00A17AD36|4.0|Unique album. Would have given it a 5, but some of the profanity was just not tasteful (particularly one part (that was not a song) where the guy was talking about spending $30,000 at the strip club.) That little rant was unneccessary.<br /><br />Glad I purchased it. My wife really liked it too.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|No complex instructions, no endless confugurations; it's intuitive. Once you complete your first game you'll want to go again, trying to get faster at making those blocks match.

B0091LRZZW|5.0|Take a look at this ageless wonder. I don't know how he does it. McCartney continues to stay creative whether in his rock music, classical scores, or his newest venture, the world of standards. Many other classic icons have attempted recording of the &#34;Great American Songbook&#34; such as Jeff Lynn and Rod Stewart, but somehow you get the feeling they did it because they have lost their creativity. It's a fact of life. You can't expect albums like &#34;Eldorado&#34; and &#34;Every Picture Tells a Story&#34; to continue to be released after 40 years in the business any more than you could expect Joe Montana to be still throwing passes of the 49ers. But there is an exception to any rule and that's what McCartney provides here. First was the album, which incidently just won him a Grammy, and the beautiful, fresh interpretations he brought to these songs. The DVD gives an in-depth documentation of the passion and creative genius of Sir Paul. Sit with him in the classic Capitol Records studio and watch pure magic. You have a sence of being right in the studio as these tried and true songs are alive again with Paul's distinct treatment. Take a look at the microphone and imagine back to when it captured the beauty of Nat King Cole's voice. Paul, you are truly one of a kind and this latest venture gives us yet another side of your endless talents. We still love you well after you turned 64.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|Really loved this movie.  Cool luggage, cool shades and cool suits make a contrast against rural India.  Soundtrack is not bad either
B008OJ291W|2.0|It's sad when an artist loses his creative edge - but it happens to the best. Elton John, Billy Joel, Rod Stewart, Jeff Lynn. I guess after being spoiled for so many years by so many classic albums, it's difficult to maintain the standard of quality and inventiveness for 40 plus years. Most classic icons live on their past greatness and that's o.k. I still pay money today to hear their music live and certainly prefer them to the contemporary, no talent lip syncers like Bieber. Just stop ripping me off with an album of &#34;Standards&#34; (hey, Rod, enough with the Songbook albums already) or these newly recorded &#34;K-Tel&#34;  re-do albums. That's the case here. Jeff Lynn has genius qualities and an entire stable of unbelievable music to his credit. What he does here is is make you listen and say &#34;That's not how the vocal goes&#34; instead of &#34;Wow, what a song&#34;. Hey, Jeff, we grerw up on these songs and played the vinyl until it turned smooth and white. You can't improve on perfection. Stop ripping us off with these &#34;newly recorded&#34;, &#34;remastered&#34; and &#34;deluxe edition&#34; excuses to keep getting into our pockets. Saw the documentory - don't think you are hurting for money.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|This DVD arrived as promised with no issues. This is MY MOST favorite DVD yet. I never knew this guy had so much in him. He plays until he's dripping wet, never stopping once. His band is totally awesome..they REALLY put on a great show.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am enjoying finding interesting things, but would have liked any guidance when I first signed up.All I could do was stumble around.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show and missed a lot of it due to work. That I can watch it all again is great! The Show itself is hard to explain and that pretty much is the basis of it, the unexplainable. It's just an awesome show and the cast blend in fantastically.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse operates very smoothly and comes with very good software to change out your key layout. I would however like to see smaller buttons near the thumb and at least 4-5 of them for in game use. Smaller movements of the thumb with better placement of buttons can speed up reaction time. I have a hard time reaching the top thumb button so I may have to reprogram it with a less critical key.....it may depend on the size of your hands.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|I liked it, its a old movie let me try to make the I like it go on for a page or 2 I like it, I like it. 3 words summed it up.

0765367297|5.0|I've been reading all my life, across numerous genres.  I have always had a special place in my heart for good sci-fi and fantasy, but Fall of Reach really stands out from the pack.  As a Marine myself, poorly written/psuedo military sci-fi has always irked me.  Unlike many other military sci-fi books out there, Fall of Reach is authentically written, true to the nature of the military, and scientifically innovative.  The core of the book, the journey from innocent childhood to a grim warrior as the Master Chief, is tenderly written.  I've re-read this book at least a dozen times, and it always excites me and inspires me; a novel thing for a novel based off of a video game.  This definitive edition has corrected some plot inconsistencies that arose due to the hyper compressed production timeline (the foreword mentions the book when from conception to final print in 4 months), and after having read it, I feel it is truly worthy of the term &#34;definitive edition.&#34;
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The movie was funny as hell it is a must watch highly recomended why does the earth rotate on a
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this book in a few days because it caught my attention and kept it. I couldn't wait to see how it ended. Unfortunately it didn't at least I thought it didn't.  When I got to the end I thought there were pages missing from my book because I couldn't believe it ended on such a lackluster note. I would have recommended it but I've changed my mind.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|So far so good.  About halfway through and I actually look forward to the next chance I have to read.  I only give it four stars because I haven't finished it yet.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I havent seen this movie before, my dad have always told me to watch them, give them the chance, second time I am seeing the movies in the last two weeks, is a Must for everyone.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|\\"HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE\\" is probably one of the greatest songs ever written. this is a great album. i love the experiment of george harrison using the sitar on \\"LOVE YOU TO\\", harrison was so underrated as a beatle, he had a great solo career and made more great songs with the supergroup the traveling wilburys, id recomend checking them out, \\"GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE\\" is so full of energy and puts me in a great mood whenever i hear it, along with \\"GOOD DAY SUNSHINE\\" but wait: why is \\"YELLOW SUBMARINE\\" on here, that song needs to go away, this album was great up until that.<br /><br />Overall: great album, nothing silly or strange on this one like so many others, this was a good investment...
B005U3V7MC|5.0|one of my favorite crime writers. she did an excellent job continuing the jane austin story of jane and darcy in their new digs
B000EXZI1O|3.0|although i love a few songs on this album such as the title song is very soothing and easy to listen to. but after seeing what they did on saturday night fever i figured this would be out of this world, but it was a huge disapointment in that regard, i feel they took a small step backwards on this one, theres nothing wrong with it in whole, but its not near as good as saturday night fever or even main course for that matter.<br /><br />overall: i think i expected way too much from this one, but if you dont have it id say u should still get this one, it is worth it...
B003WEA4UM|4.0|at first did not think i'd enjoy it but as i read more began to et into it .reminds me of the tommo and hawk books with the pidgin english. that took me a bit to get used to . all in all a good story
B0025KVLU6|3.0|as ive stated on other beatles albums, only a few songs on most ot them are worth the money. this is no exception, i think the first 6 songs on the first disc are awsome, everything else is just plain boring, the whole second cd isnt interesting, it has 2 versions of \\"REVOLUTION\\" on it but neither one are the actual hit, if \\"REVOLUTION 9\\" was good enough to make it on the album, i dont even want to know what the previous takes on this track sounded like. i mean what was the point of even having 2 discs in this, i think its because they never once had an album on 2 records and they needed something different. this album really has no reason to be as classic as it is, id say by far its the worst of the successful albums of the beatles...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|All the characters are involved in this series and one can hardly wait to get into the next episode to see what happens next.
B00004WPAE|4.0|although i dont see the point or reason to make a film on this album, i think its just fine. the title song i have always found to be extremely boring and a little silly. but this album has several hooks in it such as \\"ALL TOO MUCH\\", this song is amazing, its a little too long, but its a great song. then you got \\"NOWHERE MAN\\", this was an instant classic, this is one of those songs that is hard to pick out the true meaning of what or who the nowhere man is but it keeps u listening to it because of its great toon.<br /><br />overall: i find this album good, if ur a beatles fan, u wont regret adding it to ur collection of beatles albums...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Simply the best! Not interested in the beginning, but could not stop myself from watching at least 3 episodes daily after the second one.
B0041KVX1A|5.0|now this album is a real beatles album, i love this album, i remember hearing several of these songs on the oldies radio i used to listen to. \\"AND I LOVE HER\\", is one of my favorite songs. this is the type of music that influenced other incredible bands such as the bee gees, this album totally reflects what the early and mid 60s were like, nothing but a harmless good time.<br /><br />this is for anyone who truely love music, and i said music not a poser image of music like todays crap...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is definitely worth the read! A really great book. Trust me, you will extremely glad you read it!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Tired of trying to &#34;catch&#34; episodes on my DVR, this makes it simple to watch the series in sequence. The special features allow you the behind-the-scenes information that helps you connect with the characters.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|great app and very FUN... I would rate it 5 stars but it didn't work and kept on erasing all of my progress. :( maybe it was bad luck but it was very entertaining while it lasted :-)
B005NFJAZS|5.0|A simpler time, a love story, and a marching band in early 1900's Iowa. What could be more fun! Enjoy!
B00ATU5JRA|2.0|This is simply an app that you download to make your friends think that you can hack into other people's wifi. Really stupid and immature.
B000050HTO|5.0|Long time Dylan fan and love all his songs, this is full of his hits and love them all.  Great rock and roll
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I read this book within a couple of days. The author is very knowledgeable and helpful. He is clear and provides real life scenarios where this knowledge will be useful. Great book!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|It was intense. I'm not sure why the movie had to start out with total nudity. Denzil is an awesome actor and handsome, too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love that authors like Colleen Hoover have a way of getting stories as tremendous as this out to the public. I have been feigning for a story like this only I hadn't realized until I read it! Now I know that some don't like stories featuring (gasp) reality but thats what this is along with its repercussions. I stalk this authors webpage for info on more of her stories and if she taps your veins like the book feign that you are, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF DOING THE SAME, pacing aimlessly chain smoking and wondering when the goods will be delivered....there's no shame... there's no shame !!HOPELESSLY ADDICTED
B004LV287M|5.0|Amazing voice of ZAZ, something fresh and special you can feel.<br /><br />Great songs, good style, bonus trackes etc. Good good good!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game...fun. addictive and challenging.  Fun for all ages.  It's great if you have one spare minute or one spare hour.
B00A3AY134|5.0|All of the Greatest... and a couple of others thrown in for good measure that may end up as some of my favorites.
1451695195|5.0|I have seen this Dr. on some of the news channels, and thought his story was interesting, so the first place I looked was Amazon.  I purcashed two of these books.  One for me and one as a gift.  The book is easy to read and understand.  His journey into the afterlife sounded amazing.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book was okay but truly not my style. It was predictable and very superficial. I would rather have some substance to a story.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Ive heard of it before and it works well. For some reason it doesn't turn off amazon apps every time though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just when I thought I had it all figured out, BAM!  A new twist....!  A very well written, and thought provoking story!
1416955070|4.0|I found the first installment of the series a quick read even though the plot was thin and predictable at times. The characters were fun and relatable and the language was quick paced with well timed pauses. Altogether, I look forward towards the rest of the series.
B005HSL626|2.0|used to work great on my kindle fire. now the splash screen loads for about 4 seconds, then it turns off. please fix
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Intellectual arrogance is not uncommon for many people when they are  expert at their job.  It takes a special person to be open to the possibility that they can be in error. Checklists are the acknowledgement of that possibility, that Real possibility. The author builds a compelling case for their use. He provides personally humbling examples throughout the book. In the end he convinces this reader that to ignore the possibility of checklists is the real intellectual arrogance.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|When released somehow learned of it and it absolutely amazing, golden. If you do not have this, you must. Words and music and each track, tune, tied to the next. Haunting, magical. A+++++
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use Pinterest for DIY, cooking, crafts, how to, problem solvers and cool ideas. There are many more things on Pinterest, but those are my favorites.
B0035LGXXO|4.0|In some city working and had a night free so went to movie theater and bought a ticket for??? Walked into theater and sat down. Movie starts and after a couple of minutes realized not the film I came to watch but so interesting, kept with it. Thought at the time that \\"gangs\\" of NY a little overdone, exaggerated, but point was made and had to cheer for the under dogs as they move through the side streets of NY. If nothing else a great period piece now on the streets of New York City. Liked all the characters, acting. Certainly not a romantic date movie and probably not a wife viewing movie, but many will like this movie, action, plot, fight scenes. Recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another good read from Sparks. I love to read books and this has some mystery and suspense.<br />Such a good book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun! My friends are all addicted to it. It's challenging and never gets boring!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A tough man that tried to prove himself worthy of others expectations. The rough language and behavior of the seals was probably pretty accurate for young tough idealists. Kyle's death after serving our country so valiently was a shock. He was obviously a silent hero that deserved a better longer life after retiring, only to be killed by one of his own.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this movie! Bought it for my little sister's birthday present and really wish I had gotten myself a copy!
B00APJLX8E|3.0|This movie is funny but it tries to appeal to everyone while falling a little short in all categories.<br />It's ok to rent if you have nothing else on your list but its not cute or funny enough to want to own it
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A story about a hopeless user/abuser who must hit rock bottom before he can rehab himself. Btw he is also a commercial pilot. Some movies make you feel good, this one does not.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love subway surfers. My mom and I have a comp to see
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Not too bad, for a free game. I miss some things from the original, though. Where are the other characters?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! YOU CAN BUILD ANYTHING YOU WANT TO. I BUILT A KINGDOM FOR MULTIPLAYER AND EVERYBODY LOVES IT : ) : ) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B001NHNG64|3.0|The reader has to suspend belief on too many levels.  The armed forces can't scrape together more than 8 guys because it's a holiday weekend, and the kidnapper has them surrender and line up on a bridge; otherwise he's going to shoot the kidnapped girl.  Then they just kind of disappear for the rest of the book, unless they were shot while I was asleep - not sure which.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER BUNK PAYING $30 for the online game this is better.<br />What do you think.I rate 5 stars
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I had never seen the play, didn't know much about the story besides reading the synopsis before watching the movie. I have never been drawn to musicals, but there I wanted to see a movie with my husband and there was nothing else worth watching. I do not regret this decision as my husband and I both fell in love with this movie! We were blown away by the beauty, emotions, and story. It was one of the best cinematic experiences I have had in a long, long time. I didn't want it to end. I teared up several times throughout the movie. Anne Hathaway was incredible and probably the best singer of the main stars. I loved the actress who played young Cosette. It is a dramatic story but with comic relief throughout thanks to Sacha Baron Cohen.<br /><br />I especially recommend this to someone who has never seen the play and isn't so familiar with the story, because it is truly a one-of-a-kind experience I wish I could do over!
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|Despite all of the media hoopla, this is little more than a made-for-TV movie.  Most of the acting is flat; the suspense is contrived; and the only memorable performances come from John Goodman and Alan Arkin - and then only briefly.  Ben Affleck again plays Ben Affleck - this time in Iran.  Rent it, don't buy it - you will have no desire to view it twice.  Once was enough.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|THIS WAS GOOD READING AND AS USUAL, TOM CLANCY CAME OUT ON TOP.  GREAT SUSPENSE AND THE GOOD GUYS WIN IN THE END.  AMEN TO THAT.
1780332009|4.0|I'm a teacher and I've always been uncomfortable with those who praise students for being smart when they know better.  I like the idea of praising their effort, because in the end, that will get them ahead in life.  Being merely intelligent can only get a person so far.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this pride and prejudice. While it isn't as long or detailed as the BBC one it is still a fantastic movie with great music and cinematography. And if you watch Mr. Darcy closely he gives all the looks and glances he is supposed to. The soundtrack is still one of my favorites as is this movie.
B00170DEM8|5.0|The writing, plot, coupling confusion, dancing, singing all great.  Watching it again after some time had passed, though, I realized there is a potentially offensive section, if not outright offensive unless taken into the historic/cultural context, with the song titled \\"Abraham\\".  Be prepared for black face and a black employee singing about slavery. The rest remains a complete delight with the city boy/country boy ending up in a sanitarium, the light-hearted fop who dances like a dream jilted and everyone, including agents, dance partners and friends ending up at \\"Holiday Inn\\".  Don't miss it - it will be come a holiday favorite.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The Walt Disney Network could easily delete a few male buttocks shots and then telecast this boring ode to male stripper for the enjoyment of the whole family.<br />Through much of 2012, we were treated to much hype and sizzle about this romantic saga set against the backdrop of male burlesque, as seen by star Channing Tatum who helped write this script from his real-life experiences as a male dancer.<br />The problem for me, though, was that the hype and PR, also extolled the fleshy wonders of such hot male hunks as Joe Manganiello, Matt Bonner and Matthew McConaughey and I, and millions more, savlivated over the expectations of seeing some of the most beautiful men in show biz giving us a peek at their awesome torsos.<br />Alas, we see a brief second or two of Tatum's naked rump in the very beginning but from there on, the hotness factor steadily fades away. In the show club, we're tantalized with several male-male routines which provides us with glimpses of jock straps. But just when the music is building up and the boys begin to disrobe, Pow.<br />We're whipped back into the story-line, which is so boringly deadly that the sizzle factor finally vanishes completely.<br />Director Steven Soderbaugh is considered in the movie world as a \\"serious\\" director.<br />I suspect that in order to draw a bigger audience to one of his boring movies, he and the producers thought it a good gimmick to choose the naughty, sinful world of male stripping--and then add one of those dull as dishwasher storylines where our hunky hero, Tatum, is really a serious-minded young man who wants to enter the corporate world. He meets and falls obsessively in love with probably the most boring, colorless heroines in movie history. As portrayed by unkown, Cody Horn, she, naturally, is horrified that her brother is turned into a popular male stripper by Tatum.<br />When she visits the club, her face grows harder and bitter and she expresses to Tatum how ashamed she is of men who take their clothes off.<br />In the meantime, we see a split second of the gorgeous Joe Manganiello and Matt Bonner and the other studly dancers. Only Matthew is allowed to finally bring some sizzle with his dazzling dance routine at the end. But for me, it was too late.<br />We watch as Tatum rather hysterically glares at the camera, as he contemplates his life as a male dancer and remembers the disgust of his boring girlfriend.<br />So, he suddenly sees the light, right before a performance, throws on his clothes and joins his jubilant girlfriend in her colorless, boring apartment and they presumbably live happily ever after in her boring, colorless home.<br />I was struck by how similar Magic Mike is to the 2001 masterpiece, Just Can't Get Enough that went straight to DVD but now has a well-deserved cult following. In this juicy, brilliantly made film about the rise of the Chippendale's in the l980s, we are treated to the jaw-dropping sexiness of Jonathan Aube--one of the most amazing pinup boys to ever grace the screen. His genuine sweetness and innocence is arousing when we see this dazzling hunk in nearly all of his glory: he never removes his britches like his frisky, glorious cohorts do but this adds to his eroticism.<br />In this movie, he, too, is obsessed by a boring, colorless, whining girl who shames him for being a male dancer until one night, after meeting her again, he is so traumatized that he barfs into a toilet, throws on his clothes and becomes a businessman.<br />\\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" is everything that \\"Magic Mike\\" should have been: hot, sweaty, beautifully photographed and with naked eye candy galore.es off.<br />In the meantime, we see a split second of the gorgeous Joe Manganiello and Matt Bonner and the other studly dancers.

B0095R64AO|2.0|So much so, I forgot I had watched it.  The only Jason Segel movie I have watched and liked is 50/50.  This is not 50/50.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series!  The family is intriguing and there are constantly new tricks and plots added in.  The english stories are intriguing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|THis series is the best I've read in many years. Iloved it and hope you do, too. Fantastic characters and descriptions; it's a true page turner.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Shows two sides of WWII and the violent life and spectacular men who died and survived. The book also details the mind set of the German Air Force and their views of Hitler and the SS. Excellent read!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have loved all the books in this series, and BOok IV did not disappoint. Read on folks, this series just gets better and better.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I was unable to watch 24 when it premiered on TV. Have been able to watch the complete series on prime. It is one of the best series I have ever watched.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Action from beginning to end. Better than the last Bond movies. Bringing back the Aston Martin from the 60's was a very interesting surprise.
B001OGNJYI|4.0|This is the Otis that everyone remembers. He sings the pain in his heart out and you feel better. What a trade-off!
B001BR5NH6|5.0|Forgot all about this movies with all the other cheesy 80's classics!  It was great to watch it again and share it with my daughter.  She thought it was good as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend for Valentines Day, and it showed up on the 13th so it worked perfectly. It was perfectly protected in cardboard and wrapped and taped. This is a great movie.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Mark wahlberg should be embarrassed. I can't believe they're even considering a sequel. I would give it zero stars if it was possible.
B008G59IKO|5.0|I love this CD. It arrived on time and it was wrapped and new and perfectly on time. Wonderful stuff here.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love listening to this when I study. it is very relaxing and I sk t get distracted by words I songs. i like the timer sk I can continue to use it to go to sleep. cant like with out it very useful.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is a very touching story about a man with Polio. The acting is superb! John Hawkes is truly remarkable. Helen Hunt is at her best in roles like this one, sex surrogate. High recommend that you see this movie, especially during &#34;awards&#34; season.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As an avid reader and collector of WWII histories, this book appeals to anyone who believes that war can produce random acts of kindness.  The truly incredible is obvious here. When a German fighter pilot in the flick of an instant decides to spare the lives of the injured and maimed men of a B-17 Liberator, I sat amazed and reflective. Why would an ace pilot do such a thing? What were the circumstances that led to his decision? All these answers and more become obvious as Mr. Makos unravels the motivations, beliefs, spiritual-leanings of the German pilot. This book has a special meaning for those of us accustomed to reading of the atrocities of war, as well as the killer instinct/menality that grips most combatants. What a powerful message is on display here. Mr. Makos has written a superb piece about a subject rarely discussed regarding warfare. I recommend this book as highly as I have ever done for any book.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was just ok,  quite simplistic.  Not the most touch sensitive game. blab blab blab blahhh blab. bla. bla bah
B004GUSG4M|5.0|What a twist of events!  Loved the suspense.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  Unexpected  and different than the typical storylines of today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game it's very fun as and it is awesome that it's free you will love it I know that you will
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though I prefer pc minecraft pocket edition is good for on the go  playing playing. I am building a city in p.e. and you might see me commenting on the house guides I used to build it and soon enough I will put the seed on YouTube so you can add to it yourself and you can see the real potential of pocket edition.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|OK graphics amazing,turning sucks,droppings confusing,gem tunnels difficult.,coins easy to collect but honestly I think that the original temple run is a lot better to play b were because it is simple
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I loved it because I'm really into music, and therefore love books about music.  Especially the fact that I'm writing one right now.<br />  I know I gave it 5 stars, but there was one thing I didn't like about it:  Online, it was classified as–not children's–but a young adult-teenager book.  So it was unexpected when there were a few uses of, ah, there was some cussing.  Not as much as in &#34;Where She Went (If I Stay),&#34; but enough of a certain word, as to where if it were to be a movie (and they quoted everything) it would have an R rating.<br />  Otherwise, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a book about a teenager who is trying to decide whether she wants to live or not.  Written from her point of view (while she's outside her body, watching herself), she wants to stay for the classical music and her punk-rocker boyfriend, I found this book amazing, and instantly bought the second.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game better than temple run 1 because the graphics are better and I like that it's not 4-6 ape things only one! I like the rope because its fun and the mine it is a beast!(:
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Not a quick or simple read, but well worth the effort, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I look forward to reading more by Neil Gaiman.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Sympathetic characters, great prose, heartfelt story. Highly recommended for anyone who needs a book to just fall into on a cozy day.
0307279189|5.0|Wow! what a story!  This was one I didn't want to put down.  Almost hard to believe it could be true but it has since been written about by Scott Jurek as well (one of the runners mentioned in the story)
B003UM8T3U|4.0|Breathless (1960) is considered to be one of the most important examples of French new wave cinema. It is the story of Michel Poiccard a young criminal who is on the run from cops and Patricia, a young American girl aspiring journalist living in Paris and working for New York Heral Tribune Newspaper.<br /><br />Michelle has immature ways and care-free life style. The movie presents him as a likeable character with his eccentric ways and idiosyncrasies, most famous of which is the thing he does with his thumb over his lips. Jean-Paul Belmond truly brings the character to life. Michelle and Patricia's relationship what really makes the movie. There is a famous sequence shot in a real hotel room. The scene is famous due to its natural atmosphere shot without any lighting, and the fact that the hotel room being very crammy. I also find the dialogues between Michele and Patricia very natural. It is a mixture of sexuality, romance and love and future of a relationship - essentials of what happens between every man and woman.<br /><br />But what makes the movie famous (or unique) is the \\"jump-cuts\\"; it is a real different way of editing the scenes. The entire sequence is shot, but the parts that slow down the pace are cut-out which make it look like the scene is cutoff and skips forward to the next scene. This gives the movie a unique atmosphere.<br /><br />I recommend Breathless to every cinema fan, especially if you are interested in European cinema, French new wave.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think it is harder. way harder. it is still pretty cool. I have to re get all the money I had on temple run.
B0063IH60K|3.0|After you have played Spider Solitaire for a while, it's difficult to go back to the plain solitaire - not much of a challenge.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Could not put down this book.  It was fast paced and very interesting.  Jack Reacher is a<br />unique character and fascinating.
1439152802|4.0|I've read all of Kate Morton's books and thoroughly enjoy them. The Secret Keeper is a woman with a deep secret that affects many through her life. The book goes between the present and the past and the ending is well worth the read. I look forward to further books by this author.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I was a little disappointed that it was just the movies - I was going for some of the extras but at this price for 8 blu rays I can certainly get over it!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought two of these microphones and use them extensively on video projects. They have good sound quality -- in fact, I have a $500 Sony ECM-88 lavalier mic that sounds no better than this $25 Audio-Technica. I like the l-o-n-g cords on this A-T mic, and the 3.5mm connector plugs right into my video camera. I was concerned that the small button battery would need to be changed quickly, but I've probably used one of the mics 40 times without battery replacement. (I'm scrupulous about turning the mic off when not in use.)<br /><br />If you go to YouTube and search on \\"solar products annandalearts\\" there's a video of me where I used this microphone for the entire thing. Overall, this is an exceptional mic for very little money.
031606792X|5.0|Best out of the set. This was a thrill to read. Movie was awesome. Sad to see it end. Gotta read this book again and again!!!
B002KGEORM|5.0|This show is great.. although some of the violence is a bit much for me, I love the sence of family... and the guys on the bikes too
B00A757EFW|3.0|I got the free version and it didn't last long before it wanted me to buy the full version. I just didn't want to buy it yet. maybe later
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found this book totally engrossing, well written. I was totally involved with the characters throughout. I recommend this book highly
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love all mahjong games. I have them on my Kindle; phone; lap top;and desk top Pc.  I look for more manning.  I even have it on my DS. I like the tile design and ease of moving thru the layout.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The first 15 minutes is great 007, but it's all downhill after that.  No one wants to think about getting old at the movies.  M dies and James Bond has bags under his eyes......where does that leave us for the next installment shopping for old folks homes?
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|old format, fresh view. I enjoy it very much. Switches the normal combination with 3 guys and a gal. Makes for fun.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is one of those shows where all the characters are likable and empathetic and the persons playing the parts are all perfectly suited to their roles. It just gets better and better every week.
0061128562|5.0|Funny and enjoyable book.  Easily read by my grandson.  He enjoyed the CD as it gave him another dimension to his book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simple and easy to read.  It deserves the attention it craves...including the scar on the soul it leaves.  It ends complete, but wanting more.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Glad we didn't see this one in the theaters - too scary for my sensitive 8 yr old, although the scary stuff was balanced with enough laughs for my 12 yr old to enjoy it. As the name implies, this movie is ripe full of ghosts, zombies, witches and other scary stuff. Also, the biggest surprise to be aware of - one of the main characters reveals that he is gay at the end of the movie. I don't have any problem with that, but just be aware that you might need to answer some questions that you weren't prepared for when simply viewing a children's movie!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|A little history...<br /><br />There used to be TWO versions of this program, Office Suite Viewer (a free version), and Office Suite Professional.<br /><br />The FREE version, Office Suite Viewer, did not support certain fonts. It was free, so what did you expect? The Font Package allowed the free version to open documents<br />without losing formatting if the included fonts were in the document.<br /><br />Office Suite Professional HAS ALL OF THE FONTS THAT ARE IN THE FONT PACKAGE:<br />Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Courier New, Symbol, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Veranda,<br />and Wingdings. You do NOT need to purchase the font package. Just create or open a document, go to &quot;Format&quot;, and choose your font. Tadaa!<br /><br />This app works great on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I've had no problem opening and editing documents<br />from a pc or the cloud (Google Docs).
B0081336FO|5.0|If I could give it more stars I would. Witty fast paced, thinking mystries. Bring 'em on!<br />So sad that season 3 is LATE!!
B0026KX6TY|5.0|I have seen this movie many, many times over the years and it still remains one of my favorites. Great cast!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Worked fine, no problems<br /><br />Not real heavy weight so not sure how long it will last if not cared for properly
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book drew me in almost immediately.  There is subtle reference to the right to life but the story involves families from different walks of life. It includes their desires, fears, unconditional love and a real generosity of spirit.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I did not expect a monster to be in it.  My four year old likes the game not the monster.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Weather antime at your fingertips anywhere in the United States. Plus it was free. Pretty good deal. I will recomend to freinds
B00845PT18|3.0|The first Ghost Rider was full of plot, but the action felt forced!  Now we have this one:  1. It was great that Nicholas Cage came back as Johnny Blaze!  2. The underfoot actors were not well known actors, but they were great with  their characters!  3. I like how we see that more people are making bad choices by making  deals with the devil!  4. David Goyer, who worked on The Dark Knight Trilogy and the Blade trilogy  gave us a decent plot!  5. The visual effects were more convincing than the first movie's fx were!  6. The guy who played the devil was really creepy!    What I didn't like was:  1. The movie felt like it needed a thicker plot!  2. Some of the action felt mindless!    If the movie had a thicker plot and if the action wasn't mindless it would have been better!  My grade: B- or three stars!
B005HSL626|5.0|What a wonderful game.  I play it just to relax me from a very hard working day.<br />it is one one of those game you will enjoy while going on a plane ride or a long drive.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Yes, it does deserve all the accolades...guess  I'll check out the movie now and see how the screenwriters interpreted the story...hope. I'm not disappointed
B00A757EFW|1.0|It never down loaded for me.  Not sure where the game when.  So it is very hard to rate it,
B008P3SPVU|4.0|I have five teenage boys and we enjoyed watching this inspirational movie. The message is great but the language is not appropriate for younger audiences.
1426308469|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 3 year old grandson to enhance his new interest in dinosaurs. The pictures are big and colorful. The pages are not cluttered with too much information. It is a perfect companion for his dinosaur set that I ordered at the same time.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|The first time I read this book (1st of 3) I almost gave up trying to keep the characters straight ~ so glad I stuck with it since this book is one of my top 5 favorities.  I finally made a character list and just handled the pronunciation in a consistent way, not necessarily the correct way.  Love the focus on the female characters in this retelling of an familiar tale with a new slant.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Very entertaining and action packed. I don't know how I missed this series when it came out. I am catching my way up to the current season now.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|My 6-year-old granddaughter understood this immediately. She and her older sisters played it a couple of times and lost interest, as did I. It's just a pattern matcher that can hardly be called a game. Still, it might be pleasant to watch as your life ticks away.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I really enjoyed learning the story about Rodriquez. We have a friend that is from South Africa & was there during the time Rodriguez was big. She said when she moved to the US, she brought 3 tapes with her and Rodriquez was one of them. Very interesting story about an unusually humble person. Refreshing!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The movie was good but the book is better.  Sparks captures the thoughts and feelings of the abusive husband as he struggles with how his wife could leave him.  And it is so beautiful how Katie is the missing piece to Alex's family.  She fits in perfectly.  And thank you for setting the story in Southport, one of my most favorite places on earth.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books to begin with, I love how there is always a test to an amazing love story.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable that came with my Kindle Fire wouldn't always charge my Kindle.  I guess it had a short or something.  The new 5 ft. cable is really great.  Haven't had one second of trouble with it.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I don't like the way this ended.  It made me mad.  You get so involced in their lives that the way they ended it you want to hit someone.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Of course I have to rate this well. Anything by Miyazaki is going to be amazing. It's a great family movie that'll capture everyone's heart.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|enjoyed it , a great read, i would recommend you be sure to read the collectors before reading the camel club, for continuity baldacci tells a terrific story.
0142407542|5.0|This is my son's absolute favorite story by Julia Donaldson.  He asks for often.<br />I think it's cute too. We absolutely recommend it for your children's library at home. (there's a great movie version too!)
B005HED11Y|5.0|Quality was great. Really love the old Star Trek episodes. This was the series that opened the door for space oriented scfi series.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. It makes you fall into different decades seamlessly. Loved it! Excited for the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I played this game on my cuzin's phone before and got addicted to it really fast.Plus I really like the graphics on the game too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I couldn't wait to see where it was going. Have read all of her other books and this is her best yet! Likable and interesting characters and surprise twists.
0143106651|5.0|Great addition to my 'classics' library I'm creating for my kids.  Super happy with it - although I wish it was a hardback
B008D28HYS|5.0|Lots of fun and very addicting. I love how difficult some of the puzzles are. I can pay it for hours.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's awesome to play . Love it . Best app ever !!!  love love love love love love love love love love
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The graphics are beautiful and the game play is easy enough for my child. It would get 5 stars if it weren't for the bugs, like not receiving the gems you buy or losing your profile. The game server is also either down or my device won't connect about 50% of the time. Despite these flaws though, it's a fun game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book.  It shows that there is always two sides to a story.  It takes you the reader to see what life is like for those with tremendous handicaps and what their life is like to live each and every day.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love it. I love BBC anything, but this show is fantastic.  Wholesome-something we don't have in shows nowadays.  Wish there were more seasons.
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|Kenneth Branagh Scores again with Hamlet!  If you enjoy Shakespeare this will be quite enjoyable.  Great cast and great direction for a very good reproduction of the classic story of Hamlet.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|I really enjoyed this series and liked the &#34;all episodes at once&#34; format. I have never seen the British version so I can't compare them.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This was great.  Obviously action packed and provides insight into Bond's background/history.  I really liked this one.  Can't wait for the next.
034580404X|5.0|Read the books through the library and liked them so much bought the set. While the first book covers some intense material, the EL James does so in a way that's caring and insightful. The subsequent books move into deeper territory. I thoroughly enjoyed them all. Ordering from this merchant went well and I'd recommend them to others and would shop from them again.
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|Hugh Jackman can made a bad script good to watch.  This script was a so-so, but all-in-all an entertaining movie.  Movie arrived quickly and securely wrapped.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book grabs you and takes you on an unexpected journey. I did not want it to end. Good read!
0439813786|5.0|It's just like a magnificent story board or a graphic novel. A beautiful base for the making of a movie.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I really like her music. I get a kick out of watching her on you tube. Can't wait for her next offering. This CD is great!!!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|All characters were cast perfectly for this lovely and enduring story.  It was enjoyable to watch a movie without the violence, sexual acts and foul language.  Dennis Quaid makes such good movies and with him as the star I know the movie will be good!  Lindsay Lohan was perfect but look at her now....
B00B8ESWAM|5.0|I really enjoyed this, perhaps because I'm pretty fascinated by cult movements.  Though it's not an exact depiction of Scientology, Philip Seymour Hoffman does an amazing job playing the Hubbard like cult leader.
076115728X|5.0|I wish this book was available when I taught Kindergarten,<br />Or better yet, when I was in Kindergarten!<br />Our educational system can benefit from teaching children<br />how to use mistakes for developing creativity and for learning.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|Oh, wow, what this movie ever horrible.<br /><br />I threw away some good money after reading some good reviews and went ahead and purchased this urgh movie.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|tedious level of detail around setting up gardening and keeping alive until rescued.
B000NJMJGG|1.0|The DVD frames froze throughout the movie. Unable to watch the movie all the way through, This is the first time I have purchased an item that was not to my expectations. I will probably not try buying anymore items which say Very Good. I will stick with New only.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|We got in on season 3 . Have bought seasons 1-2-3. What a cliff hanger ending. We are looking so forward to seeing it continue.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|After watch it twice, once to get the language and then to watch the scenery I concluded it was great.  Some of the characters were really funny is you listened closely.  It has a lot to say about how you look at life..............or maybe how you SHOULD look at life.
B00633W614|5.0|One of my favorite authors.  When I reached the last page of book one at I:00 am I immediately ordered the next and I appeared on my iPad within minutes.  How great is that?  The next is already on order.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We are totally hooked on this series and eagerly anticipate the next season.  Maggie Smith absolutely STEALS the show in every episode.
0545123283|5.0|I fell in love with this Trilogy.  It features a heroine who was bitten by wolves and saved by one with big yellow eyes.  She is soon after left in the car by her father and suffers heatstroke she should not have survived.  Her father is wrapped up in his career and her mother is an artist who is only really into her art.  The little girl basically raises herself taking on the running of the household and does everything she can to get her parents attention but what time they have seems to be  taken up with each other.<br /><br />She never forgets the wolf and one day she has the chance to save him.  A boy from her school was attacked by wolves and his father and mother become determined to eradicate the wolves in revenge.  But the boy did not die, he turned into a wolf.  Linger deals with werewolves in a non-supernatural way but still tells a great story about young adults forced to deal with extraordinary situations on their own.  This is the first book in a trilogy that never fails to surprise and keeps the tension going.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have read most of DeMille's Cory series...they are fun to read and I love his humor.<br />It's his humor that keeps me coming back for more.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|How sad would it be to wake up every morning and have forgotten the events of the day before and of your life to that point. Reminiscent of 50 first dates but more of a mystery/thriller. I enjoyed the book, could have done with out the f bombs. Other than that, this book had me guessing each and every page. I like the premise of the story and enjoyed the characters.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|So what if I started watching Fringe the week that the series finale aired? The point is, it's a JJ Abrams product with great writing, solid acting, utterly wacky stories involving everyday people who take the most bizarre, otherworldly, creepy, and terrifying occurrences completely in stride - what's not to love? Oh, and the cow in the lab.<br /><br />I'm totally into this show, and only a third of the way through season 1. I have a LOT of enjoyment still to come.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Could not stop reading this book. I finished the entire series and I am awaiting the next book in 2014!
8866130923|3.0|It's OKAY. There is a very clear creasing mark on the cover. It is about 2 cm. But, it is very perfect inside.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|If you pick up this book for a guide to change your own behaviors you won't get what you're looking for. Instead Power of Habits provides deep analysis into what exactly habits are. It reads like Gladwell with powerful anecdotes that challenge common sense notions of choice. Deeply interesting and fun read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it it had action and love all at the same time it was awesome and I already know I have fallen for the peeta
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked this book a lot. It's dark, mysterious and you really get to know the characters.<br />Now I don't know which came first, but I see many similarities to the Twilight saga. Between the Bellaness of Ana, the old car, Jose being like Jacob, I felt as though I was reading a vampireless twilight.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great drama that is so different and refreshing from all the mind numbing reality shows out there. Intrigue, culture and great acting makes this series a must see.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like it because its readily available; the buttons are big and  its cute to look at. Its a calculator folks its free and they don't spam you with ads that get in your calculating way.
0345803485|5.0|I still dont know what all the fuss is about, quite frankly i couldnt make it though the first few chapters and reading smut with clouds of disfunction isnt my idea of pleasure reading. However im sure there are plenty of people searching to live in another world that might find this book enjoyable, I however did not. . - Movie version? I may wait till video for.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I love JG's music! I couldn't wait for this CD to be released. I can't believe I'm going to say this - I like the CD, but I'm a little disappointed :( I'm really hoping that by listening to it more and more, it will grow on me. There are certain notes or parts of songs that I love, but I haven't had one particular song jump out as a \\"favorite\\" yet. On his other CD's, it's hard for me to just choose one favorite song! My biggest \\"issue\\" with the CD is that I feel like the background singers, or even the woman with whom he does a duet, compete with his voice and at times, drown him out. I was hoping it was just the speakers in my car, but I have listened to the music on several other devices now, and each time, I end up wishing no one else was singing at all with him so I can just hear his voice! As much as I love the instrumentation that always goes with his songs, I feel that it also drowns him out at times on this CD (others in the car with me on a road trip commented on this, too). I am still a huge fan, though, and look forward to his upcoming tour :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I found this very different from most of Grisham's books.  There is a twist where all of a sudden you think you are reading something else.  I would recommend for anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a lot of intrique.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Any day anytime I will choose a film that has these two. They rock my world! To me no two actors in Bollywood compares well with these two...
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This made for TV mini-series is my favorite I could watch it over and over again.  I am awaiting season 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app a lot it passes a lot of time when I'm bored and its gives me challenges I have to say that it in wayyyyyyyyyyyy better than temple run
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie was a little different from the Dark Shadows soap opera I watched as a kid.  It was scary and funny, good for kids, especially young teens.
0316069434|3.0|Unfortunately this was my least favorite of the Harry Bosch series.  I will say the audio with the reader Michael McDonnohie was very blah and not as good as his other performers of the Bosch series, so was disappointed when I saw the narrator, but gave it a shot.<br /><br />I like the reference with his daughter and her personality and his love of jazz music, and his tenacity, but again the reader was not exciting at all.  As usual Bosch is involved in the unsolved cold cases from 1992 and now in present day he is focused on bringing in the killers---with its normal political bureaucracy.<br /><br />I have read all the series, but sadly, this was my least favorite and did not live up to the standards of the older novels.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. It is challenging and fun! Angry Birds keeps you coming back to play over and over again!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I guess I'm a sap, but I wanted more from Katniss in the way of becoming a loving person. I think this is a good portrayal of war, which I think is what Collins intended. Just a little too much darkness and depression for me. Definitely worth reading though.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A completely different genre for Rowling.  I waited to read this for fear I'd be disappointed (because I love all of the HArry Potter books so much).  This is definitely adult fiction, with interesting characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins really did a great job of keeping the reader wanting more! This novel has all that we want: mystery, love, adventure, thrills, etc.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A very enjoyable read.  Heard an interview with Rachel Joyce on NPR and that whetted my appetite.  A most interesting and slightly odd story.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|WONDERFUL.  I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS MOVIE.  IT HAS A TERRIFIC CAST, AND THEY ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran is a hell of a song writer. He is funny, sad, and romantic. Sometimes all in the same song. His profoundness is such that you see his soul at war (and peace) and through aural osmosis, you discover your own. His vocal and lyrical machinations are a miracle. His ability to put put more words verbally in a bar than is humanly possible is hysterical madness that actually works.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Great CD, Lzzy has an amazing voice and this CD couldn't be better. Sometimes you buy a CD and hear an okay song and just skip through it, not on this on. I enjoyed every song here
B00445RHKI|5.0|This show appeals to so many different type people. Perfect for the family. You can watch any episode in or out of order no problem.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book could not put it down. Can't wait to read the next book. Hope they all end up being this good
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just kidding but you will sleep with one eye open! Intreging characters. Love the action and the story line. I'm hooked!
B009JCPM5S|4.0|This is one movie I have yet to finish due to it being too creepy.  I am an adult and movies don't affect me like they did when<br />I was younger.  My wife has the same feelings...we cannot watch but 15 minutes.  It is a well done production.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game! I bought it on my Kindle Fire but then I got it in my Windows 8 laptop and its so fun to play it and so addictive! My brother plays it on the Surface and he has bought all gadgets and has everything gold and wow! It's so fun and intense! Even my parents play this! And my aunt! This is a very good, challenging game :D
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book! There were so many unexpected turns in this book.  It kept my interest all the way through.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Even though this is an older production the story is well done.  I can't wait to watch the rest of the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy being able to look up Pinterest on the go on my new Kindle Fire and having the pictures and instructions large enough to see and use - versus on my Android phone where I felt I might go blind looking at the small screen.  Works well and I can find everything I'm looking for easily!
B002SZXSL8|5.0|While I prefer Wolfmother's first album, Cosmic egg still has a lot of great music.  This album feels more streamlined and not as adventurous or raw as the first album, if that makes any sense.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though, if you liked Wolfmother, than you can't go wrong with Cosmic Egg.
B005HSL626|5.0|Even my fiance likes this one alot.  You can play over and over, and it's just a mindless game that you can play for a few minutes to take your mind off of other things.  Fun and glad I downloaded it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a fast, fun read that kept me up late at night wanting to continue reading. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development and the universe Card created in this novel. I can't wait to see it on the big screen (though I'm sure I'll be disappointed, the movies are never as good as the book).
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Just like the app on my Android phone was, it works well.  I constantly ran out of available space on my Android phone though, so it's nice to have FB on the Kindle.  Only problem is not being able to download the Pages App portion for our business page.  Within FB it tells me that I should download, but when I try, it's not available.  If I could run my business page more thoroughly, it would have gotten 5 stars.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books! I couldn't put it down and read it all in two days! Bravo
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game but I don't like how you can only unlock games if you have a lot of coins.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|I like it. It's pretty handy especially with the hand draw attachment. Try adding a program where I can download notes off the internet and attach them to notebooks and draw on the notes maybe. Or try converting handwriting into text
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This story will keep you on your toes. Twists and turns and the research behind the book is incredible. A must read!
B002N2LEVM|3.0|Tight plotting, decent scripts, Joss Whedon doing what he does. Pretty girls kicking ass surrounded by eye candy. What more do you want?
B00B2EWNWG|3.0|Tons of epics fights but &#34;The Man&#34; should have learned how to fight.  Rest of the movie was great though.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I was looking for another app and Amazon was offering it for free. Since it had such high ratings I decided to download it and try it out. It is so fun that I paid and downloaded on my Nook too!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This book is a  classic; everyone on the planet who claim to have a soul should read. Read it and re-read it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone interested in a series of family life and struggles with a period theme.  It is always interesting to get a perpective of how things changed - when automobiles became available for instance.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Much better than the series of course much more detail , But i wouldnt give up on watching the series the book just seems to give the series more life
B009EEFTMC|5.0|fast paced game - constantly trying to improve your previous score.  Even my husband likes to play it.  I really like it
B001EYK52O|5.0|Still one of all time great classics.  Better, he actually was a race car driver. The Best thing about Steve McQueen was that he was so at ease in the parts he played.  Watch &#34;Bullitt&#34; when he really shows off his racing skills.  He set the epitome of style in all his films.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|I like the idea and I the series, but it is very sexually explicit, with probably at least 5 full minutes of it in every episode. I am very very disappointed and think that it is very unfortunate and unnecessary! A waste of my money and time. Thankfully, I paid only a few episodes.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved this book.  It makes you appreciate and respect not only the Navy Seals but anyone who serves our country.  I have the utmost respect for this man and what he did and for what he is going through now.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Came as expected very happy with it. I hate having to leave a review for for such a Simple thing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so much and this is the best game for horse lover's and I would rate it infinity stars if I could
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is about kinky sex.  It has some funny lines and sex is not done in mean or vicious way. It could have beendone like that but then it would have become low class pornography.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This really was a good album, i received it as a present from my friend, and had no problems setting it up, or playing it! whenever i'm on my kindle fire i listen to it non-stop! i d the same on the computer too:) I recommend this for every sheerio!
B002361MLA|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because 10 stars was not an available option. Unlike most 'deep' books I've read, this one is easy to read. It not only makes complete sense, it also makes me happy. Reading it gave me power. Believing it is changing me. I see its truths played out before me every day of my life. I am now the silent listener of my own babbling mind, and the secret observer of battling egos. Consciousness is a trip not to be missed. I do declare I am almost fully awake. Thank you Eckhart Tolle, thank you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Okay this game really is great it was addicting to play. I really enjoyed it. I love this game, it is fun and had great graphics everything about it is great. I loved the first one now the second is way better than the first one. If you want a addicting game get this one!!!!!<br />I recommend it to everyone who loves addicting games and has patients because it will come in handy a lot
B00000IL67|5.0|I bought this CD set for my boyfriend after attending the Alice Cooper concert in Tacoma.  He wanted certain songs on CD and this compilation included them all!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THESE GAMES ARE FUN AND KEEP THE KIDS ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE KINDLE AWAY AND SEND THEM OUT FOR A BREAK. HOWEVER WHEN WE ARE IN THE CAR OR DOCTORS OFFICE THEY SAVE OUR LIVES.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|This was a very well done and heartwarming movie about a little boy who happens to be a prodigy chess player.  This story isn't really about chess.  It's about a little boy who follows his instincts, despite the pressure from adults to play his game a certain way.  I feel the movie is more about believing in yourself, and trusting your instincts over all else.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I DID NOT FIND THIS GAME AS MUCH FUN AAS THE OTHERS WE BOUGHT BUT THE KIDS SEEMED TO ENJOY IT. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT WAS FREE.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|I got this application in an attempt to convert my ITunes video to a format that would play on my Kindle and it didn't work.  Nothing has worked so far and this is very annoying.  I have over $200 worth of ITunes videos on my PC and resent the fact that I will be forced to pay for them again from Amazon just so I can watch videos when I do not have a WiFi connection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY YOUNG AND OLD. IT IS REALLY CHALLENGING. I THINK IT TEACHES THE KIDS TO PLAN AND GIVE A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO PLAN A LITTLE BEFORE THEY MAKE A MOVE. WE ALL REALLY LOVE IT.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham and this book delivered on all levels.  It made my bus ride to work a whole lot more enjoyable as I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE KIDS FAVORITES. THEY LOVE THE CHALLENGE AND NEVER SEEM TO TIRE OF WATCHING IT.APPRECIATE THE FACT IT WAS A FREE ONE AND THEY CAN PLAY AS OFTEN AS THEY LIKE.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I really love flipboard because it lets me access google+ , facebook, Twitter, and instagram, but it's hard to post things and usually it won't let me post things. Also it wouldn't let me log in to Facebook, and I was trying to post things to instagram, but it won't let you post anything to instagram. Please fix these problems!
B004Y042N8|5.0|THE KIDS REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME. IT IS DIFFERENT AND CHALLENGING. FELT IT NEEDED A FEW MORE INSTRUCTIONS BUT ONCE THEY FIGURED IT OUT THEY LOVED IT.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've read (and spent money on) lots of fitness books. By far, the principles in this book sum up everything I have read (and spent money on) and more. Matthews lays it all out in the most simplest terms. Everything from diet to workouts to motivation to supplements.  This book is all you need. It's rocket science simplified to model airplanes. If you want to get in shape for 2013...start here!<br /><br />Side note: I've been working out 5-7 days a week for many years. So, i am no beginner to working out by any means. So, through my own experiences I have tried just about everything...this book brings it all home
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was very insightful.<br />My wife is a nurse practitioner and found the information very compelling and has started the diet to see how it works.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|The free digital copy version was an awesome surprise.  This was a gift to my wife for Christmas and she listens to it often.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|Red Tails contains considerably more special effects, but lacks the depth and quality of [[ASIN:B00319ECI8 The Tuskegee Airmen]], which I rate a full 5 stars.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I think this game is really pretty and creative and does everything it says. It's a definite 9/10 at least.
1616890835|4.0|Sign Painters by Faythe Levine and Sam Macon is an interesting and nostalgic look back to the times when advertising often meant you hired someone with pens, inks, and brushes to label your business. So much of that has been lost to computer generated vinyl lettering and less permanent means of creating signage. But there are those around who still generate those hand-painted masterpieces that cause almost everyone to take a second glance when they walk by.<br /><br />The book is structured around short bios and commentaries by those who earn their trade in the sign painting business. Usually around five to six pages for the 24 different people and groups, you learn a bit about how they got into the business, the apprenticeships they followed to prepare for life on their own, and the struggles they face in a world that favors immediately and the temporal over craftsmanship and enduring art. The work they produce is stunning, and I'm sure if you were into the topic as more than just a casual reader, you'd be able to look at signage and know which artist created it. When you look at these bright provocative sign boards with the paint barely dry, it's easy to transport yourself 80 years into the future, looking at the same piece and wondering everything that it's seen and experienced in that time.<br /><br />On the whole, Sign Painters is a short and enjoyable read. I would have preferred it be about twice the size so as to go into the stories behind the artists a bit more, as well as perhaps going into the stories of particular signs that had untold histories behind them. Still, this is a book that's worth reading if you've ever been intrigued by a sign in a building that looked \\"different\\" than anything else you've seen. It probably is...<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|Do not rent this movie.  Some writers lose their creativity and some people have no creativity at all.  This is the result of both of these instances coming together.  Rza is not a director, film writer or anything that has to do with making movies. Quenton must have lost his creative spark and ability to place things together.  If I had the chance I would take my money back and spend it on a huge pile of doggy doo....I would get better entertainment from it.  I am extremely displeased with it on an exponential level....Can you give negative stars ?
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this version of solitaire.  Pleasantly surprised to be able to get it on the Kindle.  Easy to play.  Doesn't matter how I hold it.  I like that.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|UNLIKE SOME WRITERS CONNELLY GETS BETTER AS HE GOES ON, A GREAT BOOK, THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT.<br />ALLHIS BOOKS TO DATE GREAT.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Johnny Depp is always funny and will deliver no matter what.  The film was predictable at times and did have slow spots, but overall it was pretty funny and enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|hi how r u this game takes awhile  to load but i heard  its fun so  bye bye bye bye for  now
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|Actual reality here gives way to a screenwriter's and director's view of what would sell. Brave acting, especially if one hopes that the actors know their history.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a good movie for the whole family.  Should be a must for all teenagers to learn how it it really was.  Movie was in great shape when I got it.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|Great acting, incredible sets - gives you the vision of the sweep of time is reflected in this dvd. Don't view it for history, view it for grandeur.
B001HYY35G|1.0|It was lost and i didn't find out until 3 weeks later. someone else is enjoying it right now for free.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read books on my phone now. How cool is that! There are TONS of free books on AMAZON.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much ! Young love with twist and turns with lots of love ! Not everyone's life is perfect but you can grow and learn from it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Yes, season 2 exceeds expectations.  If you thought season 1 a bit over the top, wait until you see season 2
B000YMFCS4|5.0|I fell in love with Ryan Gosling's acting after seeing this movie.  It is funny and sentimental and a real tear jerker to watch. If you want to see what true love is really all about you need to watch this movie.  This is a must buy of DVD because you never grow tired of watching it.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I had seen the english version of the first book, and the swedish version of the remainder, and was encouraged to read the books.  Very well written, and I read them all over a week.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put it down, a very good book from start to finish. Very fast moving read, very good.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This film works on so many levels. The challenge of aging is not the only theme. It also sheds a warm, benevolent light on dealing with change, confronting people and cultures different from one's own and learning to discern and follow the desires of one's heart. It is a delight to see an extremely talented cast sink their teeth into well-thought-out roles. And, actually, owning the DVD has improved my social life. I keep inviting small groups of friends over to see it. It makes for a nice weekend afternoon or evening social event. And the film stands up well to repeated viewings.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I am 11 I have not really read these books.I asked my mom for this book and it only took me 3 hours to finish this book. As a kid I recommend this book to all children ages 8-12.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL takes on the stereotypical  \\"killer hillbilly\\" movie (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, WRONG TURN, etc.) by turning the entire sub-genre inside out! Through accident, misunderstanding, and assumption, a comedy of errors becomes a bloodbath! If you love horror / comedies, then this one is a must! It's right up there w/ classics like SEAN OF THE DEAD and THE COTTAGE! Watch immediately!...
B00973DDN2|5.0|The Killers have a unique sound and way of song-story telling. And just like their other albums this one does not disappoint!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|this is fast and fun and adicting i also like it because its like temple run great great game please get
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This second book is better than the first. The story really gets going good and the shower scene is crazy hot! Only down side is the 3rd book was to be released in May... now it's June! No fair!~
B001R4MEUM|3.0|A little obscure in places but overall I enjoy this album. Interestingly dramatic enough to live up to the title. Not everything I wanted  but I think it will grow on you.
B00846REIS|4.0|The story is very similar to 50 Shades... both men rich, super handsome (although the author didnt give as good of a description to Gideon as 50 does with Christan, so its hard to picture him) and immediately addicted to a young, innocent and very willing woman. This one also has a much better story line than 50 too.... and the next book gets even better!~
B0074MZSWW|3.0|Slightly repetitive but overall a pretty good debut. Would have liked more variety and shade in the songs and I'm still listening so not at all bad.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I never wanted this book to end!! Such a nice story from the first book to the last, I definitely recommend this book.
B001R4MEU2|2.0|Have had Genesis albums for years and loved them especially Selling England by the Pound, but this one does not do it for me. Perhaps you need to be in the right mind space?
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case is absolutely perfect. I love the feeling and texture and the fact that the band holds it closed. I also love the color and the way you can stand it up on its side.<br />I would definitely recommend this case.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved the way the author took us back and forth from the past to the present. I was surprised by the turn of events.
B008M721MS|4.0|I have been trying to get oovoo but it didn't work my best friend and I never see each other so we got this. But at first it was difficult to set up other than that 5 stars for now 4.
1426209584|5.0|This beautiful book compliments the National Geographic DVD, Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise. It further describes and documents research on all of the 39 species of birds of paradise; maps out locations of research areas; and offers more thorough explanations for display behaviors. It is a beautiful compilation of years of dedicated, difficult efforts to photograph, record and understand these exquisite creatures.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love having access to the Downton Abbey series on my Kindle.  I can stop and start it whenever I want, rewatch episodes and tune out the rest of the world while I watch it with headphones.  Only difficulty is I have to tell co-workers not to discuss episodes past where I've watched!!  They only cost me $1.89 each and I have all the episodes available after they've aired.
B008476HBM|5.0|It's one of the first books I've read in English. I've read it many times after in English and Polish and I never get bored with it. I absolutely love it. For the language, storyline, heroine.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I thought this book was fast moving and interesting. I did not think it was as porn as I was told by others but in fact very well done. I really enjoy it. It was hard to put down.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|The author's fascinating presentation of the Victorian language of flowers kept me reading even when the plot became predictable and the story languished.
B0091THDOM|4.0|The case is inexpensive and very well made. It protects the phone completely.  It really looks good. High quality leather, stitching and exact fit on my iPhone5. The downside is that it fits very, very snug, so the phone will not come out unless you use the attached tab to pull it out.<br /><br />This is a great case if your phone is regularly dropped into a gym bag or some other place where it needs protection. On the other hand, if you pull your phone out 100 times a day to check the time, email or whatever, then this is not the one for you.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|I'll start with the basics; the video presentation was very clear. Free of grain, tons of detail and color, great movie to watch. The lossless audio is full of thundering bass, it you've got a sub or multiple subs, they will get their work out.<br /><br />I love cameos, this movie paid tribute to the original TV series The Incredible Hulk by showing in one scene, Ed Norton is watching TV when you see the show he's watching is The courtship of Eddies Father, which starred Bill Bixby, the original Bruce Banner. Later, you see Lou Farigno, who played the original TV series Hulk, as a security guard at the University.<br /><br />And of course, you get the cameo of Stan Lee drinking the lethal dose of gamma rays in the sports drink from the factory where Ed Norton was working.<br /><br />Fun movie, my only criticism is; Ed Norton might have done a little better job as Bruce Banner, other than that, great movie, will stay in my library for life.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|For all those who complain about not being able to close the cover while charging, all you have to do is rotate the Kindle 180 degrees so the charging port is on the outside.  When reading in bed while lying on my side, I close the case with the kindle on the outside.  That way it sits at a slight angle which is just right for me to read.  The case'a hard plastic frame protects the Kindle very well.  Buy it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall(2012) is a solid James Bond movie directed by Sam Mendes(American Beauty). It has exciting action scenes, an interesting story and a dark tone. It's closer in spirit to an Ian Fleming novel. Daniel Craig returns as James Bond. Cyberterrorists are hunting down MI6 agents. 007 has to prevent Silva(Javier Bardem) from assassinating M(Judi Dench). Q and Miss Moneypenny return to the series. The Skyfall theme song sung by Adele is very good. There's a fair amount of fan service. Bond drives his Aston Martin DB5 in the last hour of the film with the Monty Norman/John Barry James Bond theme music on the soundtrack. The music score composed by Thomas Newman is quite good. Skyfall is one of the best 007 movies.
B000RD0RDU|2.0|Purchased two of these fans.  Unfortunately, neither one of them worked.  Don't know why, but I will have to return them.
B005JE1KHE|5.0|Will continue to read her work when I find it, I know she is rather prolific so I am sure I will enjoy further books from ths author.
B0088W6LAK|5.0|SG1 has it all -adventure, drama & humor. The acting is excellent. My son is 20 & I'm 62 but we love watching the show together. It's almost like the cast is part of the family. We've watched everything Stargate through once but were anxious to see them again. Thank you Amazon Instant for making that possible.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I tried the original Quell, and fell in love, so how could I not get this when I saw it? It didn't not fail to impress me, and it's every bit as fun, relaxing, frustrating, challenging, enjoyable and more as the original.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch great acting and riveting story.  Enjoy this series and share with friends
B0087HT36U|5.0|I got this because it made me think of an Angry Birds type game, and I've weirdly enjoyed it more. What a blast! Does take a little getting used to because it's different in it's mechanisms, but once you're in the swing of it, it's a lot of fun.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a fiction fan and closet nerd in general, I really enjoyed this book and the numerous references to popular culture during my youth.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Loved this movie, my kids can't get enough of it. Would recommend to anybody who has young children even for adults. Makes you remember the old arcades and old video games we played as kids.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I loved every minute of this book! My heart broke for the young boy being bullied from the first day of this school career. The twists and turns were page turning. The book really makes you think about how you treat others and the horrific consequences the actions can have. A must read by the wonderfully talented Jodi Picoult!
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This has to be one of the lamest movies in the 007 series.  I hope the next one is more james bondish!
1616550414|5.0|Comprehensive and beautiful overlook of the entire Legend of Zelda universe. I highly recommend this to any Zelda fan, but especially to hardcore fans. I'm so glad that Dark Horse translated this for release in English! And at the Amazon price, it's truly difficult to pass up.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I know this show has been on for a few years, but I just started watching it and wanted to catch up on everybody's storyline.  This show is raw and full of testosteron, and gunfire, but as my daughter says &#34;there's nothing like watching buff boys being bad&#34; so it has a lot of that also. There is a bit of soap opera to this,but to keep it interesting there has to be that also. I have recommended it to all my friends. There is something for male and female in this, but not for children.
B002R5QPRI|3.0|My dad has a lot of VHS tapes and wanted them on DVD..this was his first choice..glad I could find it here for him...
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I did not think I would like this but it is pretty challenging once you start playing it.  I like it and it is fun to play
B007ZD17XO|5.0|My husband and I both like this app a lot. Very challenging, some days I can achieve the high scores easily, other days, just can't do anything right! lol I like that it's not always easy but not always difficult either.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|characters/script felt true to life w/out going Hollywood;  pulled off plot w/out unnecessary sex, violence; clint pulled off this character only he could do
B00846F1YW|5.0|I have Mysteryville on my iPad, and when this came up free I knew I wanted to get it! it's just as good as the first, and if you like seek and find apps, this will be great for you!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is my favorite show! The actors and the storyline are brilliant! If your looking for good wholesome entertainment look no further! Downton has it all!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love this little app. It was a free app of the day, and I snagged it then. I always loved puzzles and this gives me several options of size and rotation. The photo's are beautiful, and the puzzles are really a challenge. I am enjoying this for my Kindle Fire HD.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Great band! Great album! This is an album you NEED in your list! Also, great in concert! Go see them if you can!
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|You can't lose with this one. Gorgeous 3d. Brendan Fraser. LIttle Josh Hutcherson. This movie looks great on my 3d TV. Lots of action.
B005VJ8ATS|5.0|Brit Marling is fantastic in this, one of her best works. I'd watch it a second time. Amazing it was made on such a low budget...
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This was recommended by my son the comic book reader. He says it's one of the best story's written for Batman. I enjoyed the animated feature, but it has a VERY different Batman than we know from movies. It's still an excellent story, a bit grittier and more cynical Batman.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|I just got through watching the end of Season 3, and I'm very disappointed.  I understand however, that Dan Stevens (Matthew) had chosen to leave the series, leading the writers to have to find a way to write him out of the script.  I just found the end heart breaking, perhaps because of how touching the scene with his wife and new child was.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|this book is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love the whole series!! as soon as i read this i knew i would have to read the whole sreies!! love it:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun. its almost like taking care of a real horse! get this app!!! its so worth it.
B004GYY714|5.0|i really like this radio!! it has all the stations i want!! it has a nice big variety of music!!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|The game is a lot of fun, basically Memory but in cube form. I wish the graphics were better, very 16-bit, and not in a good way. The patterns are easy to see & recognize, but could use some classing up.<br /><br />I also would like the multiplier to be effective with accuracy and not just speed.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|i just wrote this review to say to that danny reviewer guy used an apostrophe in &quot;menus&quot;...  PLEASE LEARN GRAMMAR PEOPLE, OR AT LEAST PROOFREAD!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Worth reading but not a favorite. I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. Not a page turner...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got temple run and lived it so when I found out that temple run 2 was in the app store I was filled with joy. this game is so much. better than temple run. I hope there is a third one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book. I like that fact that the book makes u learn that everything happens for a reason. Listen n research b4 coming to conclude life's actions.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The colorful graphics add to the fun of this game which has various ways to make it more challenging.  I recommend it.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|Russell Crowe must have put on 50 lbs.! He's looking like Brando now. Lucy Liu is still great. RZA could have been better, but just dragged everything down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Came fast and exactly what I needed. Thanks for such a fast delivery and the product is exactly as shown.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|This movie is a great one if you have a surround sound setup. I watched it over my roku and it sounded awesome.
B007SGM084|5.0|Came fast and exactly what I needed. Thanks for such a fast delivery and the product is exactly as shown.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|This movie made me want to go out and eat sushi. I  did and it was great but I was left wondering what Jiros sushi tasted like.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game...the graphics are great...the music is relaxing...would reccomend to anyone who loves bingo...just one thing that could be improved....more tickets to play more bingo!!!!
B007IK44CK|5.0|Good. As prime, no any charge.<br />But amazon always want to sell something to me.<br />Just try to install the most new version player is OK.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Content wise the movie was amazing. 4 stars. It was a little slow but picked up fast. I took off 1 extra star because the movie was originaly a YouTube production. They then took the videos off to make them a DVD. I ended up renting through amazon for a couple bucks. Just a FYI: If the clips were left on YouTube I would have supported the movie production and bought the DVD. As a matter of principle I wont buy it now. Machinima, don't forget where yout roots lie and why you became what you are. Don't let greed consume you.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|As a stand alone film, Silent Hill: Revelation is just barely &#34;O.K.&#34;. More a 2 /12 star film than a three star, even by horror movie standards.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was somewhat promising, but IMO it completely went off the rails once the movie returned to Silent Hill. Better than a lot of the horror popping up on the various streaming services, but very clearly a &#34;direct to video&#34; quality of offering.<br /><br />As a real fan of the original movie, however, I was completely disappointed with the film. The writer/director completely missed the mark on all the things that made the original engaging. The visuals were in the same style, but clearly not on par with the quality of effects in the first movie. The sense of tension, suspense and &#34;creepiness&#34; factor of the original were absent. Alessa, the &#34;demon child&#34; from the original is barely represented in the movie and a &#34;key showdown&#34; with the characters fell so completely flat that it was sadly laughable.<br /><br />After watching this film, I couldn't help but be reminded of another horror film sequel, &#34;The Ring 2&#34;. Just as with &#34;The Ring&#34;, this film was such a vast failure as a sequel that it has virtually guaranteed that a once promising franchise will die a whimpering death.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was way better than the first. It was great Where was Rourke though? Will there be a third? Say yes
1451627289|5.0|I'm generally not a Stephen King fan, but every once in a while some of his work appeals to me and this one certainly did.  This is one of those books where I would lay down at night to read a couple of chapters and then read for an hour unable to put it down.  A great read and very engaging!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|everyone or anyone that loves zombies this is the best If you have not seen all seasons GO RENT NOW
B00942G4UA|4.0|Without saying who the giant fast food company is, we all know who they are talking about. I don't eat there and haven't for a very long time. After watching this movie I now know I made the right decision in that regard. We as a nation should all become vegetarians, but unfortunetly that isn't going to happen.
B008JFUMUQ|2.0|Although I've been a big fan of the \\"Die Hard\\" series over the past 25 years (all owned on Blu ray), I was a bit reluctant to see this one.  Based primarily on the trailers and some critical reviews I was going to wait for the movie to hit HBO in a few months.<br /><br />While on a road trip with my 17 year old son, he convinced me to go, himself a fan of the franchise.  Even at only $4 a pop, it was time better served.  John McClane (Bruce Willis, not looking his age) heads to Moscow to find out why his estranged son (Jai Courtney) has been imprisoned.  It turns out son Jack did it on purpose to get close to a political prisoner who he hopes to rescue.  Oh yeah, Jack's with the CIA.<br /><br />Nothing in the film makes sense in reality and the script is horrible.  But at any time you can expect car chases, car crashes and plenty of flying bullets, rockets and fists.  I suspect this is one of those films that was storyboarded with action sequences long before someone said, \\"well what's the movie about?\\" They never did figure that one out.  My son was more generous and gave the movie 2 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a fun quick game that tests your reflexes as well as your mind.  The powerups are cool and if you get in the mine it's pretty cool
B0052RDHTM|4.0|it took me forever to get into Pillars of the Earth.  I finally just sat<br />down and read this one like a proper novel.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is one ap that includes everything including the kitchen sink. It lacks organization due to its massive content, but the site is still searchable.
1936850028|5.0|Beyond Birkie Fever is a book about the American Birkebeiner, described as \\"America`s greatest cross-country ski race\\" and the following it has inspired. In fact, the race kicks off again for its 40th Anniversary in just 5 days.  The race \\"..spans 50 kilometers from Cable to Hayward for Skaters, and 54K for Classic Skiers..\\" in Wisconsin. I am not a skier, I have never skied and always felt it looked tremendously dangerous to me. To be honest, I have lived almost my whole life in Wisconsin, and until now had not heard of the race or \\"Birkie Fever\\".<br />Having said that, I really enjoyed this book. Mr. Rhein is able to harness the emotions the race holds for him, the lifestyle it compels you to lead in order to compete in the race and get that across to the reader. I was able to see what he meant in terms of the dedication, desire and hard work necessary to even attempt this race, rather than being told about it. That is a rare gift indeed in telling a story.<br />Anecdotes and trips down memory lane regarding the race, travels across the globe to race and Mr. Rhein's family especially his Grandpa are another way he is able to make the connection to the reader and keep it throughout the book. My favorite memory is when his Grandpa decides to take a pair of Austrian skiers out and teach them how to drive on black ice. Oh boy, that is a memory dipped in gold. Once again, I felt like I was in the car with them and I cannot say enough about how that impressed me. For a Non-Fiction book, this one was incredibly entertaining, humorous, has you training, racing and experiencing everything he experienced in real time.<br />It also drives home another point among his travels to Europe, Australia and back again. Doing things you believe you cannot, expressing essentially my favorite Yoda quote. \\"Do or do not, there is no try.\\" Mr. Rhein wanted to complete the race, and he was not going to let anything get in his way. Not being under trained, over trained, the flu, out of shape(I know this one) or having sub standard equipment.<br /><br />Having a dream and the fire in your belly to reach for it is the over arching message I personally took from this book. Again, he does this by showing you what happened and how he responded to each situation, not telling you.<br />My last points on this book, I have no issues with it period. Well done, well thought out from beginning to end and executed beautifully. From the viewpoint of a non-skier I really got into the book, and for a moment contemplated trying it out. Then of course my lifelong fear of pain and anything remotely dangerous kicked in and the urge quickly passed.  I can imagine that from the viewpoint of a skiing enthusiast this book is an absolute must have and you will understand exactly what is being said. To be transported back to those beautiful snow covered hills if only in your imagination during the long Summer months of waiting for the ability to strap on the skis just one more time.<br />I give this book, Beyond Birkie Fever 5 out of 5 stars. Check it out, skier and non-skier, you will not be disappointed.e(I know this one) or having sub standard equipment.<br /><br />Having a dream and the fire in your belly to reach for it is the over arching message I personally took from this book.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|The DVD contains interesting extras that really help to enhance the enjoyment of this series.<br />Don't miss out on it
B007HACDLK|4.0|A very good action story which keeps your attention throughout. Adequate detail to add to the realism of the presentation. Probably depicts US inter-agency politics fairly accurately. The constantly developing developing story is a good way to take your mind off other things.
