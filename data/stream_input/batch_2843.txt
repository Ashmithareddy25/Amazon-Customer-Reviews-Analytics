B00B7Y0206|1.0|I HATE this app. Reason number:1 it takes forever to load.  2: once it loads it goes right back to 0%  3: if your lucky and something starts up its just pitch black!!!<br /><br />My advice find something better than this app!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this game is fun. not sure it will hold my attention for a long time, but it is a great way to pass the time for now.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is an easy to use alarm clock that I have on my original kindle fire. I have my music playlist as my alarm.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci continues to grab the reader's interest and keep it throughout the book. Action filled from the first through the last pages. His main character, Will Robie, is someone you want on your side. Don't ever want to be on the bad side of Robie.<br /><br />Recommend this book if you are interested in a good ole &#34;who done it&#34; and a very special, elite gentleman with most unusual skills.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Totally awesome. Easily my favorite missile command type game. I will be sure to recommend this to anyone I known that plays tablet games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Sometimes I go to the boys-across the street's house and played minecraft on their Xbox and I loved it!!!! So just for fun I typed minecraft on my kindlefire. I was not expecting anything to come up, it did! My dad let me get the game because he heard it was educational.

B0040I09RM|4.0|somewhat violent, a tab unbelievable &#34;good&#34; guy , very good acting, not enough sex, I will watch whole series, wife may miss a few
B005XQLBU4|5.0|the best game iv'e ever played not glichey and free!! epic pixel llc has many good games but I think this is the best
B00867GKIK|5.0|We love this movie. I always try to buy digital copy so my kids would have it on the IPod.
B00640UICA|1.0|I thought this game was going to be really cute, but the little guys just won't connect up!  I tried dragging them together, but they just go back into their spots!  I even tapped on them, but it won't work.  I deleted it from my Kindle Fire.
0205313426|5.0|I highly recommend this book by Strunk.  It has all the necessaries of what excellent writing should be.  This book will definitely help anyone who is serious about their writing skills and techniques.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can build anything you can think of. You should buy this game. Also buy it on the computer and Xbox. $7 Is worth the money. On the computer  $30 .is worth it. Buy or have fun playing another game. (Being sarcastic.
1594746036|5.0|This is a YA book; however, I selected it because it's been on the NYT bestseller list for months.  It truly is a story that adults can enjoy.  It is very suspenseful and engaging.  The children in the book are fascinating as are the adults.  The photographs the accompany the text are incredible and almost unbelievable.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Brings back traditional Christmas music in a sweet and whimsical way! Highly recommend it. Makes you smile no matter if it is in summer or winter.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is a joy to play. I can't. seem to be able to put it down. Give it a try. You might enjoy it.
0800141660|5.0|Another good movie.  I love the book and also love the movie.  If you like Jane Austen than you will love this.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I accidentally ordered John Carter of Mars...SENT IT BACK! It is NOT the movie JOHN CARTER. Disney version is a GREAT MOVIE.<br /><br />Disney can nearly be depended on to put out something that you don't have to hide from the kids and put under cover in case you have friends over.<br /><br />It is pure Disney in that it is just fun and lighthearted...you aren't going to be using this as a reference on one of you college papers.<br /><br />I really get tired of swearing and voyeurism and when you realize that it is one of the brain-children of E.R. Burroughs and if you liked Tarzan...I mean the \\"REAL\\" story, Lord Greystoke, another great movie that is full of thrilling adventure and imagination. It also doesn't insult the intelligence. It is a lot like H.G. Wells, The Time Machine or a Jules Verne tale.<br /><br />I, of course, have it now in my collection. It is another classic. It is to be read, but like I tell my students. Shakespeare was never meant to be read...they are Plays and should be introduced as plays or movies (no wonder so many people hate Shakespeare...they had to READ it in high school) The above mentioned stories and authors should be READ first and then seen as movies. Why? Because in reading you develop your own mental vision as the author wanted you to. In movies you are seeing some else's imagination. Both have their place. I really liked John Carter as much as I did Tarzan. It's a classic
B000AMSSAW|1.0|I was very disappointed with this dvd. It didn't work and when I called to see why they informed me that it was and overseas dvd.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is pretty good. Simple, you've done it before , nothing new but as fun as you remember. I don't know what else to say . These things and their doggone word minimums. Like everyone wants to write a 3 page review. Who are those people anyway? Oops, hit the limit.. have fun.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl turns in a stellar first-time directorial effort here, even more amazing when you consider that he worked outside of the Hollywood film system. Grohl clearly has a natural feel for shot composition and effective editing. The stories are incredibly well-told and engaging, no matter the detail that they delve into (fellow audio geeks, this is a must-see). Interviews and archival footage, along with some exceedingly rare insider photos, fully round out the story of this historic studio. The performances bring together artists from across the Rock spectrum, and some actual legends. All of the seemingly disparate musical backgrounds of some of the performers meld together in some outstanding music. Any film that can get me interested in the music of Rick Springfield has accomplished the unfathomable.<br />Watching this documentary is a rare, joyful experience if you appreciate Rock music or great storytelling. Five stars from this reviewer's perspective.
B0013F1D02|5.0|There's something in this movie for everyone.  I especially thought the leading actor, Charlie Cox, did an excellent job playing the innocent wide-eyed youth on a journey into the great big world.  It even has plot twists, a wide range of character personalities, and a fairytale landscape that will whisk you away from your daily life.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|Who does not love Jane Austen.  Love this movie.  The characters were so believable.  A must see to all Jane Austen fans.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Get it now. Thought it would be boring but it keeps me busy and the time flys. Get this game if you want so.e thing fun and free
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|This book kept my interest engaged; it was hard to put down, even when it was late and I knew I had to get up early.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple but fun  not 100% like the old game but still cool.Great for hand  eye coordination.Worth try + it's free.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Color, sound, ever nuance of the films were well worth the money. The kids and I enjoyed this set very much.
B00006AW63|1.0|Highly disappointed that my family was unable to watch this DVD. It is in PAL format which only works for European players. I wish I could have my money refunded. This is a disc that we will never be able to use, unfortunately. It would have been nice if the description had stated the formatting.
B000VR824S|5.0|I would recommend this dvd to any true music lover.  Everyone on it is exceptional and it is worth buying to have in your collection.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Entertaining and nostalgic of the old missile command easy to play<br />My children had a great time playing it on road trips this summer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I put my Kindle to update apps and itself automatically so do the same!(If you have a Kindle Fire HD I think...)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to learn.very addictive<br />Upgrades are fun and add strategic elements.play and enjoy.for a free game it rocks.missile defender.missile defender
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game good upgrades. Good classic compares to the classic Nintendo game. Fun game to play when looking to kill time
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|I could not enter any information on this app. It does not work, instructions are not clear and you can't get from them to use the app.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|So many twist and turns kept me on the edge of my seat.  fantastic movie.  I would recommend to everyone!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|it is a great game. get it<br />everyone should have something like this.  it is highly addicting.  so everyone install it up
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. The drums are HUGE and the emotion he conveys through the music is unparalleled.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and weird way to entertain yourself between flights.  The minions make me laugh every time (even when my flights late).
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Started to play this yesterday and am enjoying it so far but to be honest I don't really understand it properly yet!
1451695195|4.0|I was interested i this book specifically because it was written by a neurosurgeon.  Most science types have a different concept of the afterlife from the mainstream.  Dr. Alexander's journey was interesting and detailed in a manner that gives credence to what waits us on the other side.
078324228X|5.0|What can you say.  If you love DW, you'll love this movie.  Such a great story, it compelled me to buy and read the book that it was based on.  One of DW's best acting jobs!
B0049J0DC8|2.0|I love this movie...as do my students. Unfortunately, it stopped working just before it ended. We were all pretty disappointed.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|Faint echoes of [[ASIN:B006TTC5HC THE DEER HUNTER]] (1978) in KILLING SEASON (Belgium/US-2013).<br />John Travolta plays a Serb with an Abe Lincoln beard. Over a decade after the Bosnian War, he searches out Robert De Niro at his rustic mountain cabin, spends the evening drinking Jaegermeister with him never letting on that he's come to kill De Niro for something he did during that conflict.<br /><br />They agree to go bow hunting for deer. In the early morning they separate in the field.<br />This is when Travolta's true intention is revealed.<br />He begins hunting De Niro with a bow, wounds him in the leg when he could've killed him.<br />Travolta soon runs a badly limping De Niro down. Rather than kill him he wants to talk about why he's done all this.<br />But first, a little torture...<br /><br />.<br />I really liked this one.<br />The first surprise is John Travolta who is unrecognizable as Robert De Niro's pursuer. From what I can tell he does a great Slavic accent, too. Next is De Niro's performance. At age sixty-nine he was still vigorous and limber enough to take on a trying physical role. I was most impressed by him in this picture and think it's a marvel that in a half century of acting De Niro has rarely looked bad in a film.<br /><br />Just think of his extensive film resum&eacute;. What an awesome body of work!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it<br /><br />Eighteen words are required to tell you I am enjoying this game. Does the period count I wonder.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Sick crazy whiskey tango foxtrot kinda book.  Really really great book. It was going in all kinds of directions. I will be buying other books from this writer. Really great story. I want to say more but would hate to give it away. Read the book.
0307200477|5.0|I purchased this for friends who are expecting their first child. It was fabulous and just as I remembered it.
B003WJQ74E|3.0|It wasn't a bad book or anything. Its just it's not a book I would choose for myself. I had to read this for summer reading in school
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Typical story but with a taste of coming of age. If you want a thoughtful plot and story pass on this one.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Great series, action, adventure, romance and war. Mystery, magicians, and great passion. There are some intimate sceens I could live without . Great writers keep you on the edge of your chair.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking up married was a great book! It was well written and a great story line! I can't wait to read another story by this author.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|His novel is one of the best from JA, maintain the reader in suspense in all pages...I need tho have the next Clifton chronicles now
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I think it's very fun and everyone who likes puzzles will love this game I try to play as much as I can.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, basic but very enjoyable. Worth the ninety nine cents. I would recommend this game to anyone that needs a time killer.
0425263908|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I was told it was like fifty shades of grey. Not quite but it was an enjoyable read. Can't wait to read the next one...  Gideon Cross...ahhh!!!
B0063S3DMK|5.0|Very educational especially after watching the real Whale Riders from New Zealand perform at the American Museum of Natural History!!!
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|This new music is amazing. Maysa is in top form ! How appropriate that this is her 10th solo album. A+++++++++++++++++++++
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Great protective case. I love that I can turn my kindle and stand it on the case so I don't have to hold it while I'm watching a movie. Case protects my kindle when I shove it in a bag to take with me. Was pretty fast shipping too. Plus I like the color, but if you don't like orange, they have other colors.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Fun, functional and timely. The volume is not loud enough. I need concert volume. Definately worth the download and the dollar.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I remember this game from elementary school. Fun game and I haven't experience any crashes. I would recommend this game for anyone.
0061537969|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Written from the dogs perspective! Enzo...he was the most human he could be and still be a dog. This dog was truly part of the family. I think this is probably one of my favorite books ever!!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun but simplistic.  Worth it as a free game but I am not sure if I would pay for it without some upgrades.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|it is fun to watch Suits.  The legal matters and the unexpected results are attractive.  Too bad that the relationship did not work out.
B00BMHFYVA|5.0|I love this record.  It's catchy and fun to listen too.  Miles' music seems to brighten even the cloudiest of days.
B000V6AD46|5.0|I love this album because it is real music compared to today's. I am not a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, but like to listen to music with guitar and piano played in it. Free Bird is my favorite because of the dueling guitars. It is just awesome. Simple Man is a touching song from mother to son. Gimme Three Steps is fun to listen to regarding girl trouble. Tuesday's Gone has a piano piece that touches my heart. Mississippi Kid has banjo in it and tells the story of a man while visiting Alabama is not to be messed with. The only song I didn't care for was Mr. Banker. Too slow for me. The rest was pure toe tapping, finger popping or get up and dance music. I liked the 4 extra demos. Especially Free Bird. The ending of it was mind blowing. These boys have great talent. One of Southern Rock's all time favorite bands. I am no country girl, but I do appreciate fine music when I hear it. I recommend this album to all.
B0026P40NU|5.0|Did you hear about Aidan Turner? No? Go check the interwebs, I'll wait...<br />Yes, there you go, give this item all your money
B00BE97ONM|5.0|I love this - even though I had the killer figured out pretty early on, it kept me engaged and it was hard to put the book down.  There are a lot of grammatical and editing errors that hinder the flow, but otherwise it is great!  This is a story I will read again!!
B00CXQL828|5.0|Absolutely love this CD, excellent musicians come together and create a great rocking CD that is reminiscence of the 70's power groups.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|It is a little hard to believe that a successful man can be so totally inhibited in his social interactions.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|the only thing scary about this movie is how lame and boring. we fell asleep several times during this no so thrilling not so scary movie. Contrite and long.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is no doubt one of my favorite photo editing apps. Even if you are even the slightest bit thinking of getting this app... It's so worth it. It removed red eye,blemishes, whitens teeth, warms temperature, sharpens image, smart blurs, and SOOO much more. I highly recommend this app. AMAZING
140123769X|3.0|I feel like Fables at this point is, straight up, phoning it in. Maybe Mr. Wallingham is playing online mad libs and just seeing where it gets him. Whatever is what this book is, not terrible, not great, but if you like Fables, buy it, your bookshelf will look weird otherwise.
B00CR1DX9A|4.0|This is a really fun story to read, but if you are really concerned about grammar and editing, you may be tripped up some. I quite enjoy Roses' writing style, so I will be reading him more.  :)
B0088W6LGY|5.0|Love all the Stargate shows they look really good in hd on amazon. I actually sold all my discs cause it looks as good on amazon like having a dvr.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I saw a preview for the movie and thought it looked like it would be a fun one to see with my daughter. I thought I'd better read the book first, so I can picture the characters before the movie does that for me. I like having all the details of a book before seeing a movie. I also like to know if it's appropriate for my daughter. The story is definitely a young adult level book, but it was a quick fun read. I enjoyed it.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|I know people raved about this but it was very very lame. I did not find it either funny or scary. We turned it off after about 30 minutes in and watched something else. The main zombie guy lacks charisma if a zombie can have that, but since he is supposed to be searching for meaning, well look somewhere else.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a great game it's a challenge and lots of fun whenever you have a little spare time and want a challenge
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|Very heartfelt, very emotive, and fun for all. Classic Spielberg film. Even though it is an older film, it is still very much worth the watch. Little Drew is adorable.
B007US9NA8|5.0|this book is really great to the point where once i started reading i didnt want to stop Arnold really explains everything he knows about bodybuilding even using his personal experience
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is the way the original should have been. It is good little action game. The upgrades are a good adition to the game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|We read this for book club and we all gave it a thumbs up. It wasn't as depressing as some of the author's previous books. (thank goodness) It was a good story with some nice twists. I enjoyed it.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|this is a touching film, filled with memorable characters and a wonderful story line. great late night entertainment. two more words.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|After reading The Selection, I couldn't wait to pick this book up! And that feeling continued throughout its plot twists every time I had to stop reading (to eat, sleep, use the restroom). While I personally didn't like the direction the story continued, I still couldn't put it down. The ending seemed to drop the ball considering the build-up to this moment, but I find that is the case with most sequels with a third one to follow.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Love the Die Hard movies, so added this one to the collection. Pretty good flick - good ol' Bruce Willis, still funny.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love Batman to much i grew up watching batman i dressed like batman i have batman cups and plates my bedsheets are batman my toilet seat has the batman logo on it and i own the trilogy....i know bruce wayne is proud
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|This bottle cutter is extremely difficult to use and the instructions for assembly are terrible. The scoring tool keeps falling off. Even my husband who works in the construction industry can't get it to work. Don't waste your time or money!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun game, a bit redundant. It could use a bit more variation. Kept me entertained for a while. Got it as free app of the day so I can't complain.
B001A4LYN2|2.0|Wow. This movie was slow and violent and the ending left you with a bad taste in your mouth. Maybe it was blood I might have bitten my tongue in disgust at the ending.
B009RH973I|4.0|Excellent protection, perfect fit, useful elastic strap, fun colors, nice design, good quality materials, good ratio cost-quality, low weight, easy to install and de-install
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|only finished watching it because we wanted to see how they resolved all the issues for the original movie.  franco let us down on this one:(
0670033049|5.0|It was a fabulous book from beginning to end.  I would recommend this book to anyone and i am very happy to have it in my library.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|It was great.  The picture was clear on all three DVDs'.  Thank you for the good quality.  I would tell anyone to get this movie.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Addictive game but a bit a bit frustrating when you have to stop playing for energy to build back up. One of the better hidden object games
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very good game. Exciting and keeps you playing. That's all I have to say about that. The end thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun, challenging, you may win lots of awards, great tutorials, you can talk to Gru and to minions
B00A8ECU24|3.0|In order to buy main characters gems are needed and without spending no eyeball they are very hard to acquire. Fun game but disappointing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game with all the different rooms in different counties with the accompanying voices. This is an enjoying and relaxing way to end your day.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Get the right upgrades and its a breeze, good time killer that gets more fu. The further you progressif you
B002APU580|5.0|Best movie ever! I love this movie and have wanted to own a copy for a while now. Found this great bargain here! Wonderful!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|awsome series for a sweet price. I cant wait until the thied season comes in a few mor days I cut off cable and moved across country I only saw the premier walking dead marathon this weekend!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its so cool!!! its so close to the actual minecraft it needs maps and fishing poles and boats and nether but its still AWESOME!!!!!!
B009K916ZK|4.0|This works exactly as expected. Plug the VGA cable in, plug it into the computer, and it works. I've bought a ton of these for work over the last year or so, and only one has failed (definitely abuse). If you need one of these, just get this official Apple one, because I've had issues with the cheaper knock-offs.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun game similar to an old classic that I used you play on the computer years ago but now on my phone
B0091REZMW|5.0|This application is great and especially great if you love a good mystery.  It is very mysterious and challenging but not too hard.
0143122916|5.0|This is an excellent piece of journalism.  Harden, through extensive knowledge of the region, makes contact with a fugitive from the North Korean prison camps and after establishing a good relationship over a long period of time pierces through the fugitive's various cover stories to arrive at a compelling narrative.  In lesser hands, this would have been a cliched, one-dimensional narrative.  But Harden writes a far more subtle and interesting account.<br /><br />Harden also makes good use of the Holocaust literature to gain some understanding about camp life (groups of two are the unit that best survives), but also points out the grim lack of any experience outside of the camps for inmates born in the camps to draw upon.  He also notes the irony of those arm-chair zealots who criticize Roosevelt for not bombing Auschwitz yet are content to let the North Korean camps exist in the plain view of satellite imagery.<br /><br />Also fascinating is the South Korean indifference to the North Koreans.  Officially they are supportive, but the population at large would rather go on with their lives and fear the expense and burdens that would attend any reunification -- far more than what the West Germans had to bear.<br /><br />Harden also follows his subject's story after his fame, which despite some considerable suffering and setbacks is uplifting in the end.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun but also quite hard to spot all the bits so it keeps you on your toes.<br />Very easy to understand.<br /><br />And energy levels are renewed at regular intervals so your waiting all day to continue play.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Useful application. Every person with a smart phone, computer, or kindle should download this app. You won't be disappointed. Try it.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Come on, this is like the best movie ever. And the Blu-Ray scan is fantastic, so everything looks amazing. Turn off the lights, crank up the stereo, and enjoy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very thought provoking game.  Genuinely original and can be very addictive. I was sad when it ended although it took some time to get all the way through the room. I would highly recommend.
B005I4JG80|3.0|Interesting and entertaining. I read it out loud to my baby. I will try some of these techniques for sure.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It came promptly even before it was supposed to show up.  I already knew I loved the movie when I bought it.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|pretty boring and artsy.  i fell asleep watching it with my wife about 5 times.  you may want to wait till it is cheaper than $5 unless you just want to drool over tom cruise
B004RE29PO|5.0|I loved this movie back in the day and now I finally have it to watch when in home chillin
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book not only did I recommended to all my book club friends and family but also meet a lot of people that have also read the book and have enjoyed it. Thank you to the Author for her vivid imagination.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Fits perfect. Buttons work as good as without case. Stylish design. Allows others to know you have a Nexus phone!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a really awesome game! Feels like the old fashioned missile command game I played as a kid. Thank you!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Not only does this clock capture the title...but it is hands-down straight-up the best I've found for my Kindle Fire. Great job Apalon!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I had a hard time playing this one. It also has areas that make you play through, you can't stop the game whenever you want.
B0094K38KQ|5.0|Kids enjoyed watching the movie, especially the one who is reading through the series.  Playback was great with no glitches.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|pretty good set. bought it because I could get most of his early hits all on one disc. disc one is great. disc 2&3 are fair. not a real big fan of his later stuff.
B00BFBBN3G|5.0|Best movie I've seen in very long time ... Bought it for my grandson Caden . Him and his sister age 3 ask to watch it often .
B0083Z614S|4.0|This was an amazing book. Although it is a classic I was still able to enjoy it. Overall, I loved the sense of happiness and the concept of the garden. I loved the book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Not only do you get all of the excitement of BINGO & SLOTS you meet old and make new friends from all over the world!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Both my kids and husband like it and they have to think a little it figure it out at times. Good to pass the time.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Excellent movie! There were so many twists and turns and surprises! I love when a movie surprises me! And Morgan Freeman is great as always.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very easy to understand and addictive. Enjoyed the touch screen to launch the missile. The game is quick and fun.
0061537969|5.0|A timely, tender, warm, astute approach to how to live fully, all in the mind of a devoted aging dog that reviews his master's life and shares with the reader canine wisdom for human choices based on our hopes, our disappointments, our passions, all told with poignancy and appropriate humor interspersed.  I keep recommending it to friends and they love the book, too!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Do not buy it is just a wast of money not worth the price and it is not even a fun game.
B000002G23|3.0|The Police's hits are so good that I was excited to hear what else they did. What I found was it was the hits and not much more that I enjoyed on this compilation of their complete work. If you're not a huge Police fan get their &#34;Every Breath You Take - The Singles&#34; greatest hits package and it will be all you need.

140006922X|5.0|I am a Buddhist and I read this book out of curiosity.  The lesson I took away from the author is this: Though you may not be able to rely on The Bible as a historic text, like Martin Luther King Jr. or Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus of Nazareth was and still is a MAN worth believing in.

9997409051|4.0|I absolutely adore the vintage vibe of this book, written in a bygone era (1950s). That said, although the writing has the polish and style of a gentleman from that era (and that's good), the humor is still highly relatable to any parent or grown \\"child\\" in this era (2013 as I write this). Especially in regards to vacationing together, as the extended family does in this book.<br /><br />I actually did laugh out loud, several times, reading this book. (I'm afraid I embarrassed myself at work, reading on my lunch hour.) Streeter has a dry sense of humor and an unfailing ability to nail the funny, everyday predicaments and irritations that drive us crazy. He would have been a fabulous sitcom writer. There is a hilarious chapter when they move into the summer rental cottage and he's trying to decipher the cryptic notes on how to start the well pump (while his wife impatiently urges him to hurry and get the water going). There are other times throughout the book when I was captivated by his spare, spot-on and hilarious writing as Hobbs tries to enjoy, and then gives up and just tries to get through, his family vacation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, too often for my taste, Streeter goes off into flights of fancy, and the prose sags and lags while descriptions abound and Hobbs thinks about incidents in the past (with lots of description and little action) or even fantasizes (with lots of description and little action). I found myself thumbing quickly through these sections.<br /><br />Happily, Streeter picks it right up again later, and I could enjoy entire chapters by skimming over any section that bored me.<br /><br />Note: He is the author of the novel on which \\"Father of the Bride\\" was based, the original movie with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor, and its subsequent remake with Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. Any fan of that movie (or book) will notice many lovely and enjoyable similarities here, the language, the relationship between father and daughter, the father's angst, the married-couple-talk. A delightful part of the book.<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, as long as you feel free to page through parts that might not be of interest. Well, well worth reading, and timeless in the gentle (and spot on) observations on family life -- and even politics and the economy! -- even though it was written in 1954<br />.angst, the married-couple-talk.

140006922X|5.0|Aslan deftly presents most of the material covered in a college level Biblical Christology course in a highly readable single volume.<br />In a nutshell:<br />The brutal Roman occupation ensured fidelity by appointing to positions of power those corruptible by compensation and by quelling seditious movements swiftly with overwhelming force. The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus gained a reputation as a wonder worker, a lucrative and common enough profession, but distinguished himself by providing his services to the poor and weak free of charge. He was a sympathizer with nationalists opposing Roman occupation and protested the social, political and economic injustice. For contradicting the prevailing order, he was dispatched by crucifixion, a common means of public punishment of those who spoke out against Rome.<br /><br />Significantly (and wisely), Aslan leaves the resurrection event alone, as it remains a matter of faith, outside of the bounds of evidence-based history (\\"Or else, what is the value of faith?,\\" as Joe Campbell often said).<br /><br />The development of the Jesus cult had twists and turns.  James the Just, the Mosaic Law-abiding brother of Jesus, renowned for his virtue, led the movement in Jerusalem that expected Jesus' imminent return to liberate the Jews from Roman oppressors. He asserted that converts should \\"maintain a measure of fidelity to the beliefs and practices of the very man they claimed to be following (Acts 15:12-21). Otherwise, the movement risked becoming a whole new religion, and that is something neither James nor his brother Jesus would have imagined\\" p. 211.<br /><br />In a different camp, Paul presented a more elevated and Greek-influenced view of Jesus and the way that believers should conduct themselves. James the Just continually corrected Paul and it is clear that Paul was a headache and a loose cannon taking things in an undesirable direction. [E.g., Paul stated that Jesus suffered, died, and rose according to the scriptures, but there are no such scriptures in the whole of Jewish thought, which complicated conversions of Jews who knew the scriptures, but then, they weren't Paul's audience]. Alas, James the Just was killed, the Temple was destroyed, and Jerusalem was left in ruins c. 70 CE, which proved to be a brilliant stroke of luck for Paul.<br /><br />In the interest of survival, Christians distanced themselves from Jewish roots and tweaked their message and rituals to become more congenial to Rome. Within a generation of Jesus' death, gentile \\"sophisticated and urbane\\" Hellenistic Christians outnumbered peasant Jewish Christians, the Greek language and symbology heavily influenced the movement's evolution, and we are left with Paul's Kitty Kelly-like unauthorized, imaginative, outlandish and inauthentic version of Christology and how the Church should be. These educated folks reinterpreted Jesus' message and \\"transformed Jesus from a revolutionary zealot to a Romanized demigod, from a man who tried and failed to free the Jews from Roman oppression to a celestial being wholly uninterested in any earthly matter\\" p. 171.<br /><br />Zealot is an excellent treatment of early Christology. Aslan makes us see, feel, hear, smell the time and place. We come to understand Jesus the man. What remains unanswered (and unanswerable) is exactly why THIS man became the model for millions. What do we make of the resurrection? Why does this man from this time period and this place still matter to so many? It could have been the Hand of God guiding the evolution in thought and the establishment of the Church(es) as institutions, or it could have been slick public relations and talented bureaucrats skillfully building framework around an appealing, hopeful worldview and facts many years after they occurred. There is a limit to what social scientific analysis can yield. The rest is a matter of faith.ures, but there are no such scriptures in the whole of Jewish thought, which complicated conversions of Jews who knew the scriptures, but then, they weren't Paul's audience].

0596805527|4.0|TL;DR: This book is an excellent reference.<br /><br />I decided to pick this book up a few years ago when I found out I'd be writing significant pieces of software using Node.js.  I had used Javascript in the past for client-side work in the browser, so I was familiar with it, but didn't have the deep understanding I figured I'd need to be productive on a large project.<br /><br />I have the PDF version of the book.<br /><br />Part I contains chapters that go into a lot of detail about how Javascript works.  This is where you can learn about types, Javascript's functional nature and how to build classes.  This is excellent material if your goal is to understand language internals.<br /><br />There is a chapter that isn't there though: \\"Crap to Watch Out For.\\"  This would include information about IEEE754 floating points, null vs undefined, truthy/falsy and so on.  Instead, that information is sprinkled around the book.  (More often than not, you figure it out on your own through sad experience.)<br /><br />The chapter on server side Javascript was more or less pointless.  It was neither a good primer for Rhino or Node.js.<br /><br />Part III contains an exhaustive reference of core Javascript APIs.  I found this section indispensable.  Every method of every key class type is documented.  Some include examples.  I found the cross-references (linked in the PDF) extremely helpful.<br /><br />Parts II and IVwere not useful to me since I was not doing client side programming.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate this book positively.  It helped me figure things out and continues to serve as a reference.<br /><br />Full Disclosure: This book was given to me by O'Reilly with the hope that I'd publish a review on it.  Other than the book, I have received no other consideration from O'Reilly.

Good for creativity purposes, bad for your feet since many are bound to end up on the floor!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've read several works by Martin, mostly the Wild Card series, and love his style and imagery.  If he spends a little too much time describing foods or dress, it's only because that lends to the realism.  I've read other works from lesser authors who clearly lacked the imagination or the simple resources to research background information.  Martin becomes the modern Tolkien in this series, an opinion shared by a great many other people.  If you're not a medieval fantasy fan, then read something less ambitious.  Perhaps the Twilight series is more your speed.

B003HARV7A|2.0|The 2-disc (1 BD & 1 DVD) 15th Anniversary Sinsational Edition on Blu-Ray of Showgirls is an interesting film about the real life behind the scenes of a Las Vegas dancer. While it is controversial the film is worth watching. The picture and audio quality are very good but the only new feature in this version seems to be 12-minutes of pole dancing in HD. In total there is only about 30 minutes of bonus material and a great audio commentary by David Schmader. For two-discs this doesn't seem to be the deluxe version fans were expecting. This edition just seems too bloated for the amount of supplements it contains.

Edition DVD released back in 2004. That same DVD was also released outside of its box set for a Fully Exposed Edition in 2007. Many of the supplements are comedy-oriented. No one from the production participates (notably Paul Verhoeven is absent). The only thing missing is the video commentary feature from the DVD. Showgirls has been released in so many different packages it begs for more content but it doesn't sound like anyone's favorite film in Hollywood. Unless you want the feature on pole-dancing in HD then you are better off buying a cheaper release on Blu-Ray. The Sinsational Edition is selling at an inflated $44.99. The film is better than most people want to admit but not at that price. I rate the film 3 stars and this release gets 2 stars.to admit but not at that price.

I love Karajan and I suppose either you do or you don't but I, for one, am thrilled to have so many of these great performances all in one box.  Many of the recordings I've known and loved for years but many slipped by me so I'm very happy to have them now.<br /><br />My one miss-giving about the box AND it's a big BIG one is the presentation.<br /><br />This box not well thought out. The presentation doesn't make it easy to find the CDs at all.<br />The CD's are in a box with 3 square boxes within that box which already makes things complicated but the complication is compounded because there is no program information on the spines. Not such a bad thing if there are maybe 10 or 20 disc in a collection but when there are 82 disc it's not good.<br /><br />The box has a wonderful look to it but user friendly it is NOT!  I printed the list offered in another review by MOONFISH on this site (Thank YOU Moonfish) which helped but this just seems like laziness on DG's part.  DG this is BAD.<br /><br />For comparison of user Friendliness I've found the bigger boxes on Sony/Masterworks (Rubinstein Complete) and RCA (Arturo Toscanini - The complete collection) to do far better with easy to read spines so I can quickly find what I want and not spend ridiculous amounts of time flipping through the booklet and then searching back and forth.<br /><br />Hopefully DG will correct this for the forthcoming Karajan 1970's box that will, I understand, be out shortly.<br />Still... this is a treasure trove of greatness.

B000O5B4C4|4.0|Great film in the 128-minute unrated director's cut. Starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone they take their romance to the edge.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun nether get bored playing this game I think everyone should down load it so fun
B00CE3IC74|4.0|I ordered these to use with my Galaxy S4, and they work flawlessly.  Using an ap0 to program them,they perform any number of simple tasks you might need at a time. The adhesive backing is very useful and the range is good.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|This movie is captivating! Every actor and actress nails their part, and the story is so poignant! In my opinion, this is Vivian Leigh's best performance, even better than Gone With the Wind! And, I have to say, Marlon Brando IS Stanley! I highly recommend this film!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it. I play it every day. It's like  the horse is real. You have different things to buy for your horse. GET THIS APP!!!!!!
B000VD9MG4|4.0|Hostel is an enjoyable horror movie about a group of friends in Europe who go looking for excitement. The music is awesome and the story has plenty of twists in it. The picture and audio quality are great in this release. There are plenty of bonus supplements for fans (roughly two hours).<br /><br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Featurettes, Deleted Scenes, Photo Gallery, Radio Interview, TV Spot<br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1<br />Audio Formats: Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/16-bit), French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps)<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles, Portuguese Subtitles, Chinese Subtitles<br /><br />Buy this film. Check the version before you buy because some releases don't have the extras. Avoid the double-feature Blu-Ray with Hostel 2 that doesn't contain any extras and suffers from poor picture & audio quality. Hostel 2 isn't as good because it suffers from the miscasting of Roger Bart (you know the guy from Stepford Wives) who hams it up throughout the movie.
B0035LJY6C|1.0|Overly slick. This was some real hipster throwback crap. If you have nice memories of the TV show, do yourself and keep it that way by avoiding this movie.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love this game. The app was offered free and even tho I have All-in-One Mahjong I still down loaded this as well. I love playing it and so does my granddaughter, the summer titles are different and colorful with the flip flops and beach balls. It's a game for all ages.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a puzzle action type game,  you have to figure how to aim the monkey and collect the stars while you catapult him to the next landing. Then the patteren changes and you have to figure out a different way to aim the monkey.
0811875555|5.0|I would highly recommend The Art of Tangled. It's loaded with lots of illustrations and information on the artists and process.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It I awesome get it now sweet I think it looks best on kindle fire get it now it is free
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Helps with all relationships...spouses, kids, friends, co-workers.  I reread it every year just to refresh/remind myself of the love languages.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|But if your an old fart like me you might not.  It's really a fast game and a lot of what happens I can't follow so I have a hard time figuring out how to keep playing it. But, imo, that doesn't make it a bad game.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This review of purchases shows that I have UNOTM & Friends, but it doesn't show up on my Kindle Fire. Did I do something wrong?  Audrey Busse
B006O2QNOU|3.0|Good actors, but seems like a low budget production, a reasonable take of the Bear Stearns debacle, but not very compelling in the end
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift grew on me.  I didn't like her when she first came out but after learning more about her, listening to her songs, and watching her grow up, I changed my mind.  She is a fine young lady with excellent songs.  You have to listen to the words.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a really good brain game it has all of the extra features that make this game so interesting to play. As many hints as you need,  as with all Mahjong games sometimes the tiles look like they can't be moved but they can, so hints are always nice to have. Over all,  if you like this kind of challenge I think you will like this software.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. I would recommend it to any one who like minons and temple run.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|Great quality. Have the Phantom on DVD. This one is sad since it ruins the original Phantom story and view of him.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'd heard other people talk about this book for years and dismissed it as not my type of thing. But recently I went through a very tough time personally and I was looking for something to give me some focus or help me to put things in perspective. So almost reluctantly, I came across this book on Amazon and decided to give it a go. What could it hurt right? I'm so glad I did. Sceptical as I was, I actually found myself drawn in and something in the story began to resonate with me. It hasn't led me to change my life and it hasn't made the difficulty of my personal life evaporate. But it has given me perspective and given me the strength to focus on the future and not be afraid to reach.<br /><br />It is a beautifully written story, simple and engaging. It is a treasure of a book that I will hold onto forever and read again and again. Take a chance, open your mind to what might be. Be willing to take a chance and you never know, it might be right for you too.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Best bubble blasting game. Addictive. I wish I could remove the ads tho. Too distracting. I like that I can swap balls
B004CIIXC8|2.0|This movie was not entertaining at all. No real plot.  I just didn't get it.  The accents are so heavy that I couldn't understand anything they were saying except the cussing (mostly done by children).  I just didn't care for it at all.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|Perhaps he doesn't understand the game, but not really a lot of fun.  I even tried it and either it isn't working right or--well it just isn't something fun to play.  All the bunnies just die and never go anywhere.
B004XOZ8CY|3.0|Another leg of the journey the author takes on his quest for personal enlightenment. I read it after The Alchemist and was not expecting it to be autobiographical. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I did the other. It is interesting but shows that the route to the ultimate spiritual levels can be paved with egotism, selfishness and frustration and not a few nutjobs. Get past that though and there is still a lesson to be learned. Mr. Coelho has a flowing writing style and an honesty in his work that is compelling. I do enjoy his work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Full of witty comments and classic upstairs downstairs drama. Season 3 doesn't disappoint and I can't wait for season 4 to air.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Had several twists and turns but that kept my interest. Will want to watch the movie now.
B00640UICA|4.0|Quite easy in the beginning, but makes you think as you progress.  Grandson is enjoying it, although the harder it gets the less he enjoys it.  I'm hoping that will change and he'll learn a little about examining things and putting them together to make it work.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|I listened to Halestorm the first time because let's face it...Lzzy Hale is hot and has a voice that is unmatched. I stayed with Halestorm because the whole band ROCKS. Do yourself a favor and get this  they are unbelievable live. Love me some Halestorm!
B005GIS1WA|3.0|Kids enjoyed the music but didn't sit still for to much more. Perhaps my 5 1/2 year old was to young for it. Even I thought it was only okay, it didn't keep my attention either.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|This is just another sophie kinsella great story, can't put it down, easy read. With fab characters who you can relate to. If you liked the shopaholic series you will like this.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|It's a great game for kids and if you just want to bypass time, there is nothing to intricate about.  But it's fun, you get to customize the little monkey, get achievements and enjoy your time.  Good game!!
B001NLKZUA|2.0|Not as good as the 1st one.  Chary is an idiot, Jace a brainless thug, Simon an emovamp,  Luke a doggie dormatt.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Nothing to over think about this; a fun, quick read. A few interesting twists. Looking forward to reading the last title in the trilogy shortly.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game!!!!!!!! So much fun and I can buy my favorite mlp characters u gotta try this game out. So addicting
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I'm one of those people who don't trust buying things online so I reviewed every description available on every case for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. I decided on this one, and am more than impressed with it! You can Stand you Kindle up either vertical (very handy while you're eating lunch) or horizontal. You can comfortably fold the front cover behind your Kindle. There even is an elastic handle on the inside if you want a better grip while you're typing on the kindle. Don't worry about the sound being distorted either, the manufacturers were smart and left opening for the speakers. Also every button, plug and port is accessible. Then when you're done just close it like a book and secure it with the elastic band. I definitely recommend this item!
1594746036|1.0|What a great idea for a story. But lousy execution. I really wanted this to be something special but it just kept losing it's pace page after page. The story was long forgotten . Instead a mixed-up rush to a finish that had no real ending.  The book needed a better writer. Anne Rice would have had a field day with this idea.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book was heartwarming and extremely funny. You cannot help but fall in love with Allan and all his adventures. A Swedish Forrest Gump :)
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|had to spend to much money wish there a different way. I liked the game after I got the hang of it.
B0041OOEJY|5.0|I ENJOY THIS MOVIE VERY, VERY MUCH! I CRY EVERYTIME! THIS IS MY PERSONAL CLASSIC. PART 2 WILL BE NICE!!!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This DVD came with the special features that matter-- ex: an interview with Richard Armitage! That and some production commentary and I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />This movie is beautifully made, I wonder how it didn't win any awards! Though it is not too faithful to the book, purists are rewarded with very good cinematography and screenplay, as well as beautiful haunting music by Martin Phipps.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful all around. Richard Armitage perfectly captures the storm behind Mr. Thornton's personality and Daniela Denby-Ashe is a wonderful heroine in Margaret Hale. Sinead Cusack is also great as Thorton's mother.<br /><br />This movie is up there with the other great BBC movies.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Grandson's new favorite movie. He can watch it over and over and over =D. He has a Woody toy that he takes everywhere. Buzz LightYear will be under the tree this year
0345803485|1.0|this is S&M for people who are scared of S&M...i swear it took like 100 pages before there was even a kiss. many, many cringe-worthy paragraphs. just poorly written.
030758836X|4.0|This book was well written I never would have guessed how it was going to turn out but it was a fun read.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I truly enjoyed all the featurettes on this DVD. I truly enjoy learning about the production process and background on the film. Love Mr. Darcy.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|it won't down load so I can't play. trouble loading on my kindle.  paid but no game. help me load.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I finished Nikola Tesla this evening and wanted to leave a review of the book.  I normally am a little bored with non-fiction, but for some reason I decided to download this one and I'm glad I did.  I was never bored reading this book.  It was interesting learning about Tesla and his relationships with others of his contemporaries who were great thinkers.<br /><br />I was inspired by the example of Tesla the author used to help explain his point of drawing from our experiences to form new ideas.<br /><br />Honestly I think this was a smart read.  The author was organized in his thought process and that always makes a book or essay easy to read and understand.  As I read more, I was surprised how interested I became in the life of Nikola Tesla.  His imagination never let him down.<br /><br />I am at a time in my life when I must re-create myself.  I've recently had to take early disability retirement.  I do not recognize myself or what I am to do in this retired state.  This book did help me to see with imagination I will soon be coming up with whatever it is I am meant to be now.  Not easy to start over in one's 60s.<br /><br />This book is a good, smooth read and is encouraging for any age at any time in life.  I saw few mistakes, if any, so I believe the editing was better than most independent editing.  I give this book 4 stars.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to someone who might be struggling to find their place in this world.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|First Reacher novel I read and couldn't stop till I finished...it was a late night read!!! Great characters and a plot to keep you from even thinking stopping reading!!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Good quality DVD but there are no special features here. Bummer. I would've liked to find out about the production of this movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is sinister but cleaner than most of today. It's addictive and gives you a glimpse into the past. As a woman it makes me grateful to live in today's society!!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I tried the paper version of Sudoku once or twice, but never really understood how to play.  In this version, the goal and strategy toward achieving it are shown by the program itself.  It took many 15-second add-on penalties for incorrect guesses, but eventually I learned to use the columns, rows and squares to narrow down the possibilities.  Since you're only competing against your own best score (lowest time) the early scores became easy to beat.  Not sure if I have learned the game well enough to enjoy it on paper, but I love playing this version on my Kindle Fire 8.9 inch device.
B0015UKX7E|1.0|If you love Prince's music then, TRUST ME, invest your money in one of his many music CDs, not this excuse for a video recording. The video & camera work appeared to be done by amateurs and looks like something you would see in the late 70s or early 80s. The audio tracks are little better. You would be better to dial him up on youtube and watch videos.<br /><br />Musically, Prince did an excellent job as always. He demonstrates how crazy good he is as a musician and stage performer. Fans of Prince's music will enjoy the music. But people buying this expecting to get a well recorded concert experience will be disappointed.<br /><br />Unless you still enjoy watching old VHS videos on old vacuum tube TV that take 5 minutes to warm up, then skip this DVD and go straight to Amazon's music store and use the cash to purchase a Prince anthology. Much better use of the $$$.
B0007M4610|5.0|My son has been talking about Shinkansen trains forever and pretending that he had one.  Now he does!  Sturdy, true to life, fits on Thomas Track.  Love it!
B005QMOZOO|1.0|So unlike PD. James's books. Poor narrative structure and style. Boring and unbearable at times. The plot is forced and rather slow. Events and characters are flat.  A complete failure : no suspense, no mystery, no quality.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game! Great for children and easy to pick up on. Wish it was easier to get repair points though.
B001R0KH3W|4.0|Stevie Wonder delivered an AWESOME performance in this Blu-ray. He covers the majority of his big hits and delivers them with the excellence, joy and energy we've enjoyed now for over 50 years. He also sprinkles in some surprises here and there that are thoroughly entertaining. He shows why he is a true legend and a musical and vocal genius. 5-star performance.<br /><br />Only one small gripe: The A/V team failed to do this Blu-ray full justice. To my knowledge this is Stevie's only HD production. As such, I expected them to do a better job with the A/V editing. The background vocals were only marginally mixed into the DTS audio track, but fortunately Stevie is so amazing that he carried the day. The video and camera work was also marginal. With a better job on the production end, this could have been classic.<br /><br />That said, Stevie was AWESOME. If you are a fan, you will most definitely want this Blu-ray.
0385738765|2.0|Book was Very Well worn, not &#34;like new&#34; as indicated on ad.  I knew I was buying a used book but the add did not indicted how &#34;worn out&#34; it was
140006922X|5.0|It was one of the best books I've read in years. Aslan is insightful, original, and thoroughly engaging. Rather than weaken my Christian beliefs, it helped solidify my opinion of Jesus as a great revolutionary who really existed, who sought justice for all, and was a model of sacrifice for his ideals. Thoreau once said, \\"If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.\\" That is what Aslan has done, with his careful and objective historical analysis. Be forewarned, if you read Zealot, you will immediately buy another of Aslan's books, such as his excellent book on Islam, 'No God But God'. Thank you Professor Aslan.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Was a great movie - lots of fun - whole family liked it -  had a solid if semi predictable twist at the end but  great family movie.
0345803450|4.0|The setting for Ian McEwan's latest novel is 1972 London.  Cambridge student Serena Frome takes a degree in mathematics but actually wanted to study literature.  She lands a position in MI5, the British Intelligence Service, thanks to a recommendation by her tutor and lover, Tony Canning.  However, unlike the MI5 on TV's PBS, you won't find any characters like Harry, Ruth, Adam or Ros.<br /> A scheme is concocted and Serena is chosen as an undercover agent, posing as a literary group's representative.  She meets Tom Haley, a promising young writer, and convinces him to accept a stipend with no strings attached.  The premise is that he'll write something to further Britain's global political aims.  Serena falling in love with Tom is not part of the scheme but how can a young, attractive and impressionable young woman resist the charms of such an exciting novelist?<br /> This book is an excellent reading experience but the downside is having to get through the first one hundred or so pages.  But persistence will pay off.  As Tom Haley's writing career succeeds beyond his wildest imagination and he is more in the public eye, Serena frets about her situation; should she tell him who she really works for and lose him and her job or \\"kick the can ahead\\" to another day.<br /> The truth eventually comes out, of course, with glaring headlines and incriminating photos in the London newspapers.  But the ending is perhaps not what you'd expect.  I'm not giving it away here but it will give you, as a reader and qualified judge, the power to decide what happens next.  It also reinforces the old adage about never confiding intimacies to a writer unless you care to read about yourself later.
B0086700CM|1.0|It does the opposite of what you want it to do. If I were you I would not get this app.<br />If you do do get this app don't expect to get a high score.<br />I give it 1star .

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show has been my favorite of all British shows and the plots and subplots are intertwined and linked together with great finesse  and the only fault I find is the grammar and language so that some of it does not fit well.  Otherwise I have no complaints.  I think it is very well done and the central actors are professional and very likeable and work together very well.  I am very sorry Mathew dies at the end of season 3 but I await the next season with great anticipation. I just wish they would show season 3 again before season 4 commences to get back into the groove.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is great and very entertaing I could play this game for ever is good and it's free I highly recemend it.

1451695195|5.0|We have both the book and CD of this publication and I have to say that, while I almost always prefer books to \\"books on audio\\", I far prefer listening to this on CD than reading the printed version.  The reason is that, since the audio version is being read by the author and not a paid professional, the description of his experience is richer than the printed version as you can \\"hear\\" the excitement in the authors voice as he describes a particular experience, or hear that he puts emphasis on one word in a sentence and not another....a difference that can present a very different meaning.  And when describing such an esoteric experience, these difference can be very important in understanding what happened to him.  Listening to him describe his fantastic experience provides critical color and depth you do not receive when reading the book.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, its a must read (or \\"listen\\") that importantly, transends any particular religious denomination. And what makes it so credible is his background as a doctor and scientist.  In certain chapters, he explains in a very detailed and scientific level why its impossible that these experiences could have been fabricated by his earthly mind.  You come away with the impression that, \\"this guy knows what he is talking about\\" which sets the stage for the incredible story that follows.<br /><br />He presents his experience in an oscillating manner, each chapter alternating between what is happening to his physical body in the hospital, to what his spirit is experiencing as it enters a heavenly realm. Many parts are  hair raising (in a wonderful and beautiful way). I'm not sure why, but I can connect and see what he is describing as he goes through the experience as though that on some level, I know I have been there before as well and I have a feeling many other listeners will have the same experience of thinking..yah...I dont know why...but on some level...I KNOW what he is talking about!

B004ZMWUCU|2.0|The writing about 86 seemed much more genuine than any other part. The rest of the novel including most of the story line was too forced. I had to make myself finish the book.

Remove the two smaller antennae from the Antennae bank - I can only assume that something with the unit's operation causes devices to connect to only one at a time, and to cycle through them - causing the instability and constant re-connects.  I wish I had another one to test this fix with and know without a shred of doubt that the problem lies with excessive Antennae.  If someone has one and are looking for a way to salvage the unit, give it a shot and let me know what you think.<br /><br />This fix was applied in a home environment and may not be suitable in a large office environment....unless you have multiple units.  ;)

B008G8SFGO|1.0|A few years ago, I wrote a review about Sonic Boom, and wasn't impressed. This is no diferent. A friend of mine is a huge Kiss fan(bigger than me), and had me listen to this;First of all, the sound quality is total garbage on this album;they recorded this in Analog? lol, no wonder. Don't get me wrong, I love the Original Kiss, along with their 80's stuff, but this? really? This is crap. Paul/Gene get all your problems worked out with Ace/Peter, get them back in the band, and you'll have a kick ass band again. Muddled through out. Real Kiss fans who may see this review will know what I am talking about, the other \\"Fans\\" won't. It's that simple.

B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I loved the preview, so I rented it and I must say I loved what I saw....pictures, places, nice looking people but I did wish there was real conversation or if they tried to make it somewhat like a 'silent picture' movie, they should have learned from &#34;The Artist&#34; or &#34;The Mark of Zorro&#34; (1920).  This movie tried to make poetry on cinema without too much words but I felt blah about it....I love poetry but this one for me was a bit silly.

0307341577|4.0|In 1985, in the desolate farmland of Kinnakee, Kansas, The Day family were murdered in the early hours of the morning. The mother Patty Day, Michelle ten, Debbie nine and the youngest; the lone survivor, Libby Day was only seven years old that morning. Her mother and two sisters, strangled, bludgeoned, knifed and shot gunned; murdered that early morning by Ben Day. Libby's fifthteen year old brother.<br /><br />  \\"...I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it. It's the Day blood. Something's wrong with it. I was never a good little girl, and I got worse after the murders.\\"<br /><br />  The novel begins with a grown up Libby Day, angry and full of self pity, wondering how she is going to continue with her life. She has always been the one who survived that terrible day. But public sympathy and attention have passed her by as other tragic events have taken center stage. She has lived off the donations and care of others her whole life and now; she finds herself as alone as the day her brother took her family away.  That is when she receives an invitation to attend a group meeting of the Kill Club. Amateur sleuths who look into various murders and come up with conclusions of their own. Crackpots and zealots who find conspiracies in every tabloid and internet page. Libby sees this group as an income source, a group of fools who will pay her anything to have a piece of that terrible day for themselves. Anything to put themselves inside the murder.  What she finds instead is very different. Crazed, lonely women who have been writing love letters to her brother Ben. Angry women who feel seven year old Libby lied and convicted her poor beautiful brother to a life behind prison bars. Professors and ex-policemen who find flaws in the case and her testimony. Libby Day, the lone seven year old survivor of the murders finds herself under attack from people even more pitifulthan herself.  What she also finds is a proposition. The Kill Club will pay her to investigate the murders of her mother and sisters. They will pay her to talk with people they do not have access to. Her estranged father, aunts and neighbors. And...her brother, Ben Day.<br /><br />  .....\\"When I was fourteen, I thought a lot about killing myself-it's a hobby today, but at age fourteen it was a vocation.\\"<br /><br />  Dark Places is written in first person through the eyes and senses of Libby Day, with flashbacks to the day and preceding hours that lead up to the murders through the eyes of Patty, Ben and the rest of the Day family. The mood of the book is thick, even though you know what is coming you still feel the sense of building dread to the events of that morning.  Central is Libby and she is what is most powerful about Dark Places. Libby Day will stay with you long after you put Dark Places on the shelf and try to go back to your normal routine.  Dark Places is Gillian Flynn's second book, before she broke wide open with Gone Girl and between the two you can see how much more polished Gone Girl is. Dark Places is visceral, raw, with blood and emotion and the loneliness of desperation dripping from every page. I enjoyed every drop.  It must be that Day Blood
0060899220|5.0|I love this book. Bourdain can really write! He's not just a kitchen personality, or a TV personality, he's a literary personality!!<br /><br />A friend of mine passed me his book, and I quickly got lost in those strange tales of a punk rock chef allying himself with the short order swashbucklers who inhabit the realm and keep it going, who keep it crazy - who keep it real. From his savagely bourgeois upbringing, to the wild days of his apprenticeship, to his lessons in finding his path (I don't know if I could ever do the same, to tell you the truth), I just enjoyed the journey and how he described it.<br /><br />For all of his swagger, Bourdain can be remarkably humble when talking about the really great chefs, managers, mentors and influencers that he admires (there are quite a few, although not as many as he really knocks down to their knees). Then there's the wild rides of the kitchen hands:<br /><br />\\"It was Friday, an hour before service, when I was introduced to Tyrone the broiler man, whom I'd be trailing. Looking back, I can't remember Tyrone as being anything less than eight feet four, four hundred pounds of carved obsidian, with a shaved head, a prominent silver-capped front tooth and the ubiquitous fist-sized gold hoop earring. While his true dimensions were probably considerably more modest, you get the picture: he was big, black, hugely-muscled, his size 56 chef's coat stretched across his back like a drumhead. He was a gargantua, a black Viking, Conan the Barbarian, John Wayne and the Golem all rolled into one.\\"<br /><br />Sounds like a pretty vivacious kitchen ride. Amazing. But it gets very real when Bourdain burns himself and asks for burn cream and a bandage.<br /><br />\\"Tyrone turned slowly to me, looked down through bloodshot eyes, the sweat dripping offf his nose, and said, \\"Whachoo want, white boy? Burn cream? A Band-aid?\\"<br /><br />\\"Then he raised his own enormous palms to me, brought them put real close so I could see them properly: the hideous constellation of water-filled blisters, angry red welts from grill marks, the old scars, the raw flesh where steam or hot fat had made the skin simply roll off. They looked like the claws of some monstrous science-fiction crustacean, knobby and calloused under wounds old and new. I watched, transfixed, as Tyrone - his eyes never leaving mine - reached slowly under the broiler and, with one naked hand, picked up a glowing-hot sizzle-platter, moved it over to the cutting board and set it down in front of me.\\"<br /><br />He never flinched.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />With all of his ego and scorn, Bourdain does give credit where credit is due, and one of my favorite passages in the book is when he's talking about Bigfoot, the employer who pulled him out of the gutter and gave him a chance when he was going through a very bad drug phase.<br /><br />\\"In Bigfootland you showed up for work fifteen minutes before your shift. Period. Two minutes late? You lose the shift and are sent home. If you're on the train and it looks like it's running late? You get off the train at the next stop, inform Bigfoot of your pending lateness, and then get back on the next train. It's okay to call Bigfoot and say, \\"Bigfoot, I was up all night smoking crack, sticking up liquor stores, drinking blood and worshipping Satan... I'm going to be a little late.\\" That's acceptable - once in a very great while. But after showing up late, try saying (even if true), \\"Uh... Bigfoot, I was on the way to work and the president's limo crashed right next to me... and I had to pull him out of the car, give him mouth-t-mouth... and like I saved the leader of the free world, man!\\" You, my friend, are fired.\\"<br /><br />And while he can be prone to doing that lame \\"as I mentioned earlier\\" thing nobody should ever do, especially not in print (we've been reading, we know you wrote it earlier), his descriptive passages are awful and marvelous:<br /><br />\\"It was, as I've said, hot. Ten minutes into the shift,the cheap polyester whites we all wore would be soaked through with sweat, clinging to chest and back. All the cooks' necks and wrists were pink and inflamed with awful heat rashes; the end-of-shift clothing change in the Room's fetid, septic locker rooms was a gruesome panorama of dermatological curiosities. One saw boils, pimples, ingrown hair, rashes, buboes, lesions and skin rot of a severity and variety you'd expect to see in some jungle backwater. And the smell of thirty not-very-fastidious cooks - their sodden work boots and sneakers, armpits, cologne, fungal feet, rotten breath - and the ambient odor of moldering three-day-old uniforms, long-forgotten pilfered food stashed hidden in lockers to which the combination was unknown, all combined to form a noxious, penetrating cloud that followed you home and made you smell as if you'd been rolling around in sheep guts.\\"<br /><br />Disgusting tales of kitchen hijinks are amazing, and some cool practical jokes, like forming realistic-looking amputated body parts out of sweet dough.<br /><br />\\"A waiter would open a reach-in in the morning to find a leaking, torn fingertip, Band-Aid still attached, pinioned to a slice of Wonder Bread with a frilled toothpick. A floor manager would be called down to the kitchen in the middle of a dinner shift to find one of us standing by a bloody cutting board, red-smeared side towel wrapped around a hand, and as they approached, one of the grisly fingers would drop onto his foot. We experimented constantly, finding to our delight that not only did the sweet dough look like flesh when shaped and colored correctly, but it drew flies like the real thing! Left overnight at room temperature, these fake digits could develop into a truly horrifying spectacle.\\"<br /><br />Each chapter is somewhat self-contained and is a journey through Bourdain's childhood education of food, his college years, his first jobs in a kitchen, and includes wild ruminations on cooking school, the development of professional kitchen culture in the US, his various New York City jobs, and his late-night misadventures. He also has great instructive passages about planning his menus, buying the right kitchen equipment, managing a kitchen, dealing with owners, praising the work of his pirate crewe of Hispanic kitchen staff, controlling theft and other criminal activity among his staff, and some interesting words on the operations of rival chefs. He includes a fair bit on how-not-to-run-a-restaurant.<br /><br />There's also some cool history-of-New-York stuff in his book that you must marvel at:<br /><br />\\"The most truly amazing feature of my temporary kingdom was to be found deep in the bowels of the Paramount Hotel, through twisting catacomb-like service passageways adjoining our downstairs prep kitchen. If one squeezed past the linen carts and discarded mattresses and bus trays from the hotel and followed the waft of cold, dank air to its source, one came upon a truly awe-inspiring sight: the long-forgotten Diamond Horseshoe, Billy Rose's legendary New York nightclub, closed for generations. The space was gigantic, an underground Temple of Luxor, one huge uninterrupted space. The vaulted ceiling was still decorated with Renaissance-style chandeliers and elaborate plasterwork. The original rhinestone-aproned stage, where Billy Rose's famously zaftig chorus line once kicked, was still there, but the giant space where the horseshoe-shaped bar once stood was empty, the floorboards torn up. Around the edge of the cavernous chamber were the remnants of private booths and banquettes where Legs Diamond and Damon Runyon and Arnold Rothstein and gangsters, showgirls, floozies and celebrities - the whole Old Broadway demimonde of the Winchell era - used to meet and greet and make deals, place bets, listen to the great singers of the time and get up to all sorts of glamorous debauchery. The sheer size, and the fact that you had to slip through a roughly smashed-in wall to enter the chamber, made the visitor feel he was gazing upon ancient Troy for the first time.\\"<br /><br />It's great that he has such cool taste in music - working in his kitchen must be a blast:<br /><br />\\"I've assembled a pretty good collection of mid-seventies New York punk classics on tape: Dead Boys, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, Heartbreakers, Ramones, Television and so on, which my Mexican grill man enjoys as well (he's a young head banger fond of Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Rage Against the Machine, so my musical selections don't offend him).\\"<br /><br />He's great at describing his comrades in ways that seem unbelievable (but which may actually true), and none more so than Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown:<br /><br />\\"I may have wanted Adam dead a thousand times over. I may have imagined, even planned his demise - torn apart by rabid dogs, his entrails snapped at by ravenous dachshunds, chained to a pillory post and flogged with chains and barbed wire before being drawn and quartered with chains and barbed wire - but his bread and his pizza crust are simply divine. To see his bread coming out of the ovens, to smell it - that's deeply satisfying, spiritually comforting waft of yeasty goodness; to tear into it, breaking apart that floury, dusty crust and into the ethereally textured interior... to taste it is to experience real genius. His peasant-style boules are the perfect objects, an arrangement of atoms unimproveable by God or man, pleasing to all the senses at once. Cezanne would have wanted to paint them - but might not have considered himself up tot he job.\\"<br /><br />Towards the end of the book he has great chapters talking about his time in Tokyo, learning a bit about the country and seeing how people there cook, as well as searching the country for great food, is very interesting to me, since I've lived in Japan; to his credit, he doesn't try to peer into the the mind of the Japanese or to make any pronouncements on the nation's character, and therefore doesn't embarrass himself with the type of flaky wrong-minded stuff you'd find in a book by Pico Iyer or Paul Theroux or dozens of other bozos. No, he's only there to write about the food, and the journey reaches its climax at the fish market.<br /><br />\\"Tsukiji, Tokyo's central fish market, puts New York's Fulton Street to shame. It's bigger, better and - unlike its counterpart in Manhattan - a destination worthy visiting if only to gape.<br /><br />\\"I arrived by taxi at four-thirty in the morning. The colors of the market alone seemed to burn my retinas. The variety, the strangeness, the sheer volume of seafood available at Tsukiji amounted to the colossal Terrordome of mind-boggiling dimensions. The simple awareness that the seafood-crazy Japanese were raking, dredging, netting and hooking that much stuff out of the sea each day gave me pause.<br /><br />\\"A Himalayan-sized mountain of discarded styrofoam fish boxes greeted my arrival, as well as a surrounding rabbit warren of shops, breakfast joints and merchants servicing the market. The market itself was enclosed, stretching seemingly into infinity under a hangar-type roof, and I will tell you that my life as a chef will never be the same again after spending the morning - and subsequent mornings - there. Scallops in snowshoe-sized black shells lay atop crushed ice; fish, still flopping, twitching and struggling in pans of water, spat at me as I walked down the first of many narrow corridors between the vendors' stands. Things were different here in that the Japanese market workers had no compunction about looking you in the eye, even nudging you out of the way. They were busy, space was limited, and moving product around, in between sellers, buyers, dangerously careening forklifts, gawking tourists and about a million tons of seafood, was tough. The scene was riotous: eels, pinned to boards by a spike through the head, were filleted alive; workers cut loins of tuna off the bone in two-man teams, lopping off perfect hunks with truly terrifying-looking swords and saws that, mishandled, could easily have halved their partners. Periwinkles, cockles, encyclopedic selections of roes - salted, pickled, cured and fresh - were everywhere, as was fish still bent from rigor mortis: porgy, sardines, swordfish, abalone, spiny lobsters, giant lobsters, blowfish, bonito, bluefin, yellowfin. Tuna was sold like gems - displayed in light boxes and illuminated from below, little labels indicating grade and price. Tuna was king. There was fresh, dried, cut, number one, number two, vendors who specialised in the less lovely bits. There were hundreds, maybe thousands of gigantic bluefin and bonito, blast-frozen on faraway factory ships. Frost-covered two hundred- to three hundred-pounders were stacked everywhere, like stone figures on Easter Island, a single slice taken from near the tail so that quality could be examined. They were laid out in rows, built up into heaps, sawed into redwood-like sections, still frozen, hauled about on forklifts. There were sea urchins, egg sacs, fish from all over the world. Giant squid as long as an arm and baby squid the size of a thumbnail shared space with whitebait, smelts, what looked like worms, slugs, snails, crabs, mussels, strip and everything else that grew, swam, skittered, crawled, snaked or clung near the ocean floor.\\"<br /><br />Finally, he offers a list of advice to someone who, despite all warnings, still wants to work in the restaurant industry.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great free app. It is so easy to use. Anyone can do it. No need to carry anything extra with you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. it is addicting and so much fun. we need more games like this on my amazon kindle
B005XQLBU4|4.0|First, I found no bugs in this game on a Kindle HD 8.9.<br /><br />I'm old enough that I played the original Missile Command arcade game a LONG time ago. This game is considerably easier than the arcade game was, and that makes sense, because the app doesn't need you to keep feeding it quarters! LOL<br /><br />One reason that it's easier is that you don't have to select a missile base to fire from, just tap on the screen and a missile is on it's way. Also, the game starts out slowly with only a few attacking missiles each screen and they don't move all that fast.<br /><br />Of course, as the game progresses the attacks get more hectic and the attacking missiles drop more quickly. You can counter this by upgrading your defense with more missile speed, more blast radius, longer blast length, and more defending missiles per attack. You earn repair/upgrade points after each attack, and if you don't have to spend your points repairing the buildings you are defending, you can take your defense upgrades more quickly. There is no reason to hold back on upgrades, buy them as quickly as you can.<br /><br />About Night 20 or so things start to get more difficult. If you have plenty of missiles and learn how to time things correctly, you can place a preventative screen of explosions across the sky, then individually pick off missiles that your screen doesn't catch. Missiles that you stop too low will damage your buildings anyway, so it is best to catch them in the top 60% of the screen.<br /><br />The graphics are pretty plain compared to many of these apps.<br /><br />I don't know if I will play this game a LOT, but it's an option if I'm out somewhere with my Fire and have some time to kill.<br /><br />If you're an arcade fan, this is certainly worth a buck. Even if not, grab this as the Free App of the Day and \\"give it a shot\\". ;-)

1781162646|5.0|Great true crime drama with great character development.  If you have ever visited or stayed in the North/SouthCarolina beach area from Wilmington to Myrtle you will recognize many places in this book. Quick read and hard to put it down.  Great for a vacation or just a few days off work.

B009KG7EMC|5.0|Right off the bat you are thrown into the action where the characters and their personalities are quickly shown off to the viewers.  The entire movie never stops with the laughs and action pack to the very end
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Practical advice for start ups and innovation teams in large corporations alike.  Lean manufacturing principles crisply adapted to growth strategy.  Lots of good ideas and examples to illustrate application.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A lot of fun, challenging little puzzle game. Only thing I hate is the having to wait for energy to do the quests but that's kind of standard with these kind of games.

B003B17YZE|5.0|The one and original hendrix as he was so long ago, I can only imagine where he would have taken music had he not left this world prematurely. I have many collections of his work, but needed to reacquire this golden classic.

B000ZOSMTW|4.0|i liked it very much. I have been trying to find concert footage of this band for quit a while. it was not a disappointment.
0385486804|5.0|This is a very interesting, adventurous, inspiring, and haunting book.  The author tells Chris McCandless' story, but is sparse on offering his personal opinions, allowing the readers to come to their own conclusions.
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry but this is a required taste I guess because I find it boring. I'm not able to connect with the story although I understand it, just cannot connect on any level so I quit reading it from the get go.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wanted to read this one to see what all the talk was about. No plot, not believable and poor poor writing.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Although this app says it has downloaded on my Kindle Fire, it will not open or respond in any way.  After making the purchase, I find that this is a very common complaint among other customers.  How does one cancel this order and receive a discount?
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|Although I already own it on DVD, I'm really looking forward to seeing Fantastic Voyage (1966) on Bluray.  It's a high octane science fiction adventure, featuring some amazing miniaturization technology.  Even over forty years later, the Academy Award winning special effects, still stand up quite well.<br /><br />The excellent cast, is headed by the underrated Steven Boyd ([[ASIN:B0074JOW5Y Ben-Hur]]), and also includes Donald Pleasance ([[ASIN:B000UR9QHQ Halloween]], [[ASIN:B00AZFECJU You Only Live Twice]]), Arthur Kennedy, Raquel Welch ([[ASIN:B00018D3ZA One Million Years B.C.]], [[ASIN:B0007TKNJW Kansas City Bomber]]), Edmond O'Brien ([[ASIN:6305770328 D.O.A.]]), and Arthur O'Connor.<br /><br />Like many adventures at the time, this one has a Cold War connection.  A scientist named Benes is critically injured, when an attempt is made on his life by the \\"other side\\".  With a blood clot located in an inoperable part of his brain, Benes is doomed, unless extraordinary measures are taken.  Enter the Combined Military Deterrent Forces (CMDF), a top-secret government agency.<br /><br />The mission involves the miniaturization of a small nuclear powered sub (the Proteus), that will then be injected into the Benes' body.  A team of five, will then proceed to the site of the clot, and dissolve it, using a laser gun.  The miniaturization process lasts only for an hour, after which the sub and crew will begin to return to normal size.  After witnessing the miniaturization, and entry of the Proteus, via injection into the victim's neck, most viewers are right there with the crew, thoroughly engrossed in the marvels inside the human body.<br /><br />A chain of events, both accidental and deliberate, makes the journey to the brain, a most breathtaking and circuitous one.  The \\"detours\\" provide opportunities to view various systems and organs, including the lungs, heart, ear, and lymphatic system.  The time factor goes from comfortable to critical, as the crew soon find themselves up against the one-hour deadline.<br /><br />Among the amazing phenomena seen, are the oxygenation of blood cells, antibodies attacking, and the interior of the lungs. With their time almost up, the Proteus finally reaches the clot, where the crew scrambles to complete their mission, and exit the body.<br /><br />With a creative premise that is brilliantly executed, Fantastic Voyage truly does live up to its name, mixing science, fantasy, intrigue, and danger.  The movie features some wonderful cinematography, highlighted by some colorful scenes inside the human body.  The acting is slightly over the top at times, but thoroughly enjoyable, in an adventure that pushed the limits of imagination in 1966, and has a real-time sense of pacing, that adds to the tension.<br /><br />Hopefully the Bluray release does full justice, to this absolute classic in the genre.  Iconic author Isaac Asimov, adapted the story into a novel, and the movie was also adapted into an animated series, which is available on Region 2 DVD, at Amazon.UK.ves up against the one-hour deadline.<br /><br />Among the amazing phenomena seen, are the oxygenation of blood cells, antibodies attacking, and the interior of the lungs.

1400032717|5.0|Poignant in its insight to the personality of a boy with autism, the story grips the reader's attention and heart at the outset.  With every page, one grieves for the boy's innocence and vulnerability as his life is further complicated by the aberrant behavior of a few adults in the little neighborhood that was his world.  But the boy, utilizing nature's gift to the autistic of the ability to &#34;work out&#34; problems, finds his way from where he doesn't want to be to where he wants to be.  And the reader follows in amazement, as the boy finally achieves his goal<br /><br />A mesmerizing story, whose author seems able to convey with great sensibility some of the most powerful perceptions of the boy with autism depicted in the book.<br /><br />Gwen Mercer
B0011XBLUS|5.0|It's a classic movie with an iconic figure and always worth watching every so often. That said his other two before this one, I love more.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|This app seems to work as it is supposed to, and is fun to use.<br />I subtracted 2 stars because it doesn't move to external storage.

B000JQUMPI|4.0|The beginning was a little slow but the book is one of the best ones I have ever read in my entire life
B00APYKXFS|4.0|This is a great game. I have always loved shooter games, and this one is sweet!!! It plays almost flawlessly, and the soundtrack is excellent:-)<br />I subtract 1 star because it doesn't move to external storage and it could use a few glitch tweaks.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars was a book I had to read in my Senior Literature Class. I love to read and this book spoke to me when I heard about it, so I bought it. And now I've read it and I think this is a really beautiful book that can truly relate to the reader. I'll admit I really do not cry because of books I read but this one hit me hard. I could not stop reading even though at times I wanted to throw the book against the wall and go cry in a corner somewhere. That normally does not occur when I read books. But it happened because I was able to connect to Hazel's feelings.<br /><br />Now I know many will think \\"Who wants to read a book about people dying of cancer?\\" But I would respond by saying cancer is not what the book is really about. I mean yes, it is a major part of the plot but that does not mean anything. The main point of the book is about learning who you are and how to accept you are. Augustus Waters came into Hazel's depressing life and turned it upside down. He made her realize she was not just her disease; she was a beautiful, smart, and funny teenage girl.<br /><br />I think everyone should read The Fault in Our Stars because it can connect to anyone. Everyone has been touched by cancer in at least one point in their lives. Everyone has felt worthless. Everyone has fallen in love. I believe that people ages 15 to 115 will enjoy this book because of that. So if you enjoy literature, and want a book to read that will make you want to never stop reading it, pick The Fault in Our Stars.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Ralph's performance as Daniel leaves you rooting him on, feeling bummed for his failures and cheering on his victories. The Kobra Kai gang do an excellent job if evoking just the opposite. A must see film for most ages... Some light cussing and violence but nothing kids don't already see on regular tv.
B001BKZDB4|1.0|It wasn't a movie or anything exciting.  It was not what I expected.  It was just ok.  I got for my daughter
B005XQLBU4|5.0|downloaded this just sitting around and then found myself playing it for 30 minutesnon stop.. I was late to my appt
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is such a good game it is easy to fun and is adicting it is so worth it get it now
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Well constructed and user friendly.  The humor, combined with just the right amount of difficulty for us who are just trying escape the rigors of ordinary life. Thank you again for another great game.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I preordered the final season. I only saw the first three episodes because of CBS and Time Warner fighting like kids. What I like about Amazon is on the preorder if the price goes down before the release date Amazon makes the adjustment. You can't beat that deal.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It was an ok book I give it 3 stars so it was okay and that's all I have to say
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Outstanding cast and story line.  This is something I will watch over and over again and most likely will purchase the seasons once it ends.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|In this day and age where rock music is not dominating the music charts like in the 80s and 90s, the queens of the stone age continue to put out great music, continue to  tour, and continue to sell out arenas. This is one of the bands that has passed the test of time. ...like clockwork is yet another great cd that meets or exceeds the qotsa standard.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|As a free app it's next to useless for me, and I'm not inclined to pay for the features I might use.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was not a good book so I don't want to say anything  mean but I've seen better book's so just change it up

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My cousin got this app on my kindle and it is so awesome. You can hatch dragons and make them adults it is awesome. I totally recommend that you should get this app.
B00BM7ORFO|4.0|I'm a fan of stories where weaker people bullied and hurt by stronger people fight back and win.  It's a modern day fairy tale that I wish would come true more often.<br />The hero was unreal - literally.  This guy has kids to worry about, and the fact that he still wants to protect her from a crazy man had me feeling a tad uneasy.<br />Still, it was a great romance.  Easy to read and it kept me hooked until the end.  I don't expect much more than that.  Thanks author.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|As ususal, Michael Connelly doesn't let me down. His climaxes are what make his books so wonderful.  Love his Harry Bosch books also.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This is very well imagined, creative, shamelessly fun sci fi.  It plays a bit fast and loose with technologies (I'm not a fan of &#34;gravity generators&#34;), but it's still a very well paced, well written adventure
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was suggested to me after my dog passed away. This book helped me remember All of the good times we had spent together. It also reminded me how to let go without forgetting. Be ready to laugh and cry.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's an amazing book! The best part is when they fight the titans and win! I love when b e makes the wish to the gods!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Nice quick action game. Nit particularly deep, but diverting. I like the upgrades. I do better at this game than I did at missile command.

B00992CF6W|5.0|The photos are out dated of the ones you see they are a lot better graphics and a good price considering on the computer it is 22 dollars or something buy the portable COOL minecraft now!!!!!! There are some things to perfect but if you buy it now and wait for updates what do you know it might cost 15 dollars in a year
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The format was a bit difficult.  I found myself rereading portions for clarification.  But figuring out the ending was worth hanging in<br />there.  We had an excellent discussion in book club about this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|both of my girls love the game. It helps them learn to be patient to collect coins to achieve goals.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I got a message that I would get free in game currency if I wrote a review so here it is. So far I can only give it 3 stars.
B0098A70Y2|5.0|Parents don't have the option of the Baby TV channel, which I do.  Grandson really enjoys watching all of the colorful shapes and critters so bought this DVD for him when he's at home.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|Serendipity has rated as my favorite romantic comedy from the first time I saw it. If you watch the commentary on the film, the director acknowledges that it's a fairy tale and there are a few things that are definitely movie fantasy, which to me added to the charm, because it's a fairy tale filmed with real people. As for the film itself, John Cusak is always enjoyable in whatever he does. He has an unorthodox acting style and a contained yet frenetic energy that lights up the screen. I have no words for Kate Beckinsale, who has beauty far beyond my words to describe. Kate's acting in Serendipity is rock-solid, charming and emotional. You can't help but fall in love with her right away.<br /><br />The supporting cast is just as incredible and what really rounds out this film. Jeremy Piven has the same frenetic energy as Cusak, but less control of it, which works perfectly. He literally crackles with it and the lifelong friendship that Piven and Cusak already have makes the onscreen relationship completely solid because it isn't really acting for them. I've never been a huge Molly Shannon fan, but she is cast perfectly as the best friend and foil for Beckinsale's cheery demeanor.<br /><br />Bridget Moynahan plays her role perfectly. She is a sweet beauty who any man would love and you find yourself loving her. You can't hate her- there is no reason to and any tension you feel with her is derived from how well Cusak plays his role. John Corbett shines again as an actor this time with a boyish enthusiasm for his art and his fiance. Like Moynahan he is completely likable. You feel his characters love for Beckinsale's character, but you can also sense that it isn't quite enough.<br /><br />Eugene Levy is a joy. He really is fantastic in anything he does. He doesn't have a whole lot of screen time on Serendipity, but that is offset by the fact that you get a full dose of him in the short time he appears. His chemistry with everyone he appears with is almost magical.<br /><br />This movie was directed with the sense that it's a fairy tale by a director wise enough to know when to let Cusak off his leash. Despite Cusak's tendency to speak quickly, he is always completely understandable and his ability to improv physical comedy and short additional comments to written dialogue  is what makes many of his movies so enjoyable.<br /><br />The soundtrack is awesome- I have it and I listen to many of the songs often. My favorite is the haunting acoustic guitar solo by the very talented artist David Gray. It plays perfectly into the quiet reflective moments of the filim.<br /><br />To wrap it up, this movie was perfectly cast and perfectly directed. Everyone's screen time was exactly what it should have been and everyone works together seamlessly. It remains my favorite romantic comedy of all time.<br /><br />Really, this movie has been out since 2001 and if you haven't seen it yet, you need to watch it. Don't put it off any longer.><br />This movie was directed with the sense that it's a fairy tale by a director wise enough to know when to let Cusak off his leash.

B00AAQVSDW|4.0|They are kicking ass and taking names with album. Great hits coming off of this. I hope their next one is just as good
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Well written for the layperson.  Takes a complex subject and explains it piece by piece so that it begins to open up yor thought processes.  Even if you don't know a quark from a qua ck  you will enjoy this book
0770437400|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy 'World War Z' as much as I did. Max Brooks has produced an amazing work of faux history which demonstrates the formidable depth of his political, military, and cultural knowledge.<br /><br />Such a strange idea for a book, and yet it works amazingly well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I've tried a number of different mahjong games, and this one has been a lot of fun.<br /><br />It has very decent animation and sound, quite a few interesting backgrounds to choose from, and several different tile sets.  It has unlimited reshuffles which is a very nice feature.  I definitely recommend this game!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The initial graphics were pretty basic. When you go to the gameplay, however, the touch aspect was right on and for what it was, it was pretty neat and took me back to the Atari type game of the 80's. Briefly.<br /><br />Ever... so.... briefly.<br /><br />I ran out of ammunition so fast and had no clue how to replenish it and inevitably,  the big ships were sent out and all of my \\"bases\\" destroyed. That was sooo frustrating!<br /><br />So, meh. Fun while it entertained me for five minutes.  Would I pay for it? Not if I can't play longer than five minutes. Glad it's free today.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I have long been a Star Trek fan (the original version) and am so excited that there is now this second installment of what-could-have been. The casting is near perfect.  The pet.. or whatever for Scottie is a bit off as far as I am concerned, and he is the only member of the crew that does not quiet match the original, but other than that, I do love the movie and hope that there will be more coming.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I'm not a Christian, but it is easy to imagine that there are a lot of difficulties to swallow in this book for pious people.<br />But the author has posed us the historical figure of young Jesus with tremendous explicitness , which agrees with his long study in<br />ancient Greek documents.
0743490304|5.0|Dan Brown is an amazing author! I highly suggest giving one of his many books a try! There is always amazing adventures that makes you never want to put the book down!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The DVD set has the old as well as the re-touched versions, but it has NOT lost the feel or content of the original show.  Included are interviews with some of the cast and even some of the writers. I wish I had bought this set long ago.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Incredibly gripping, once you start reading you won't be able to stop until you've reached the last page of the third book!
B0093LINVK|5.0|I purchased this to replace the numerous components in my AV cabinet, while giving me the multitude of streaming options that a proprietary media box would/could not.  I have the machine loaded with Windows 8 and am running XBMC, iTunes, Amazon Unbox and Netflix with no issue.  For optical media, i use a USB3 bluray drive.  Though no powerhouse, it is quite capable of playing games at a moderate setting.<br /><br />The NUC requires the additional purchases of the SSD RAM and power cord.  I would also recommend the purchase of a WiFi/Bluetooth radio.  Component installation was quick, less than five minutes: the most difficult part attaching the internal antennae to the radio.

B009X01GJ2|1.0|The case was not constructed well. I ended up purchasing another type.  It left the kindle automatically turning on and draining the battery.  I purchased the Military armor screen self healing protector. It left a color impression on the screen....which made reading or doing anything difficult.  I had to replace the screen protector as well.  I do not recommend this product to any future purchasers.

B0084AXZK0|5.0|I remember when I heard about this novel in high school. I remember when I refused to read it, because it supposedly had a lousy plot. Thank God I didn't read before, because now I have the maturity to understand not only the story, but also the profound symbolism in it. By the way, thank you to the people who have converted this book to the digital format and have put it in Amazon for free, thanks a lot.
630587493X|5.0|This is such a good movie!  It's much more serious that the usual Robin Williams movies, and I think he was an excellent choice for the role. Watching anything with Sam Neill starring in it is an added bonus.  I wish the storyline had allowed a way for him to play a longer role in the movie.<br /><br />Awesome addition to mycollection
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It is a well researched book. I learned things I did not know as bout Jesus and his times. However the development of Jesus became &#34;The Christ&#34; could have been more developed.

0783230079|5.0|I think that this is the movie when I first discovered Robert Downey Jr and fell head over heels!<br /><br />It's a multi dimensional love story that moves along quickly. It's a fun movie that will leave you wishing for more.

B00B7Y0206|5.0|I have gotten some sewing feet and for the life of me I couldn't get this one to work. Boo Woo. I know but it was on YouTube and very nicely done step by step on how to make the darn thing work. I put this on my kindle and took it to my sewing room and with the stop and go and replay, I tell you. Who can't love You Tube and have a kindle or tablet and you can do anything. I was so close to throwing money down the toilet by not being able to use this expensive sewing machine foot. Yeepie-yo-kuy-A for me.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|this book almost reads like a textbook<br />but the story it analyzes is so compelling that you read on and on<br />a very different look at baseball<br />I'll never look at a baseball game the same way again

B0064NTZJO|4.0|My favorite Ryan Gosling film. It's such a thriller. Everyone is great in the movie and everyone brings there own little piece to the film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. It is kind of easy but it is awesome. :-) . The computer version is much better but this is still good for people who can't afford or get computer version.
140006922X|4.0|I have read the author's earlier book, &#34;No God But God&#34; and find his research to appear quite in depth.  I have felt that Jesus's role in the times in which he lived was more complex than that presented by most mainstream churches and am aware that the politics of the early Christian Church doctored and presented the life of Jesus in a way to suit their ambitions and needs.  This author's presentation could upset some readers who are not comfortable with thinking of Christ as so completely immersed in the politics of his time.  But I only gave the book 4 stars because I also feel that this presentation made too light of the compassion, and unique nature of Jesus Christ. Worth reading- could have more balance.
B000002PCS|5.0|I'm a hopeless romantic, it seems, but this this has been a favorite from the first time I saw the movie.<br /><br />Now I can listen to the sound track anytime I want!
B00915G6YE|3.0|This is not the best dexter season. It was all down hill after season 4, which was the best out of the whole series. The ending, however was fantastic. If you are a big dexter fan I would still watch it.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|A lot of references to Shaun of the dead jokes and the same comedic style. One of my newer favorites
B0013TTLDE|4.0|The House at Riverton is a gorgeous debut novel set in England between the wars. It is the story of an aristocratic family, a house, a mysterious death and a way of life that vanished forever, told in flashback by a woman who witnessed it all and kept a secret for decades. Grace Bradley went to work at Riverton House as a servant when she was just a girl, before the First World War. For years her life was inextricably tied up with the Hartford family, most particularly the two daughters, Hannah and Emmeline. In the summer of 1924, at a glittering society party held at the house, a young poet shot himself. The only witnesses were Hannah and Emmeline and only they -- and Grace -- know the truth. In 1999, when Grace is ninety-eight years old and living out her last days in a nursing home, she is visited by a young director who is making a film about the events of that summer. She takes Grace back to Riverton House and reawakens her memories. Told in flashback, this is the story of Grace's youth during the last days of Edwardian aristocratic privilege shattered by war, of the vibrant twenties and the changes she witnessed as an entire way of life vanished forever. The novel is full of secrets -- some revealed, others hidden forever, reminiscent of the romantic suspense of Daphne du Maurier. It is also a meditation on memory, the devastation of war and a beautifully rendered window into a fascinating time in history. Originally published to critical acclaim in Australia, already sold in ten countries and a #1 bestseller in England, The House at Riverton is a vivid, page-turning novel of suspense and passion, with characters -- and an ending -- the reader won't soon forget -
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock team for one of their best. Grant's most economically successful film, according to some reports.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Will smith does a great job in this sci fy thriller. If your a will smith fan or even enjoy sci fy films, you will not be disappointed. Watch it.
B00003CXAR|4.0|With the advent of computer-aided special effects, it doesn't compare. However, it was an amazing effort for it's time, and still has a gripping story line.<br /><br />It became my annual 4th of July watch for many years, and now it will be again!
B007CT1UJ2|5.0|Lots of fun and great characters make learning about Australia a joy. As always, Bryson's writing is fun and informative.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app worked just as I expected it to.  I really like the feature that it works in the background so I can read my books. Sometimes it works too good and relaxes me to the point that I fall asleep.  Give it a try, you'll like it.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Top movie of all time. Everyone should own a copy of this movie and if you have not seen it then watch it ASAP. I'm not over selling it.
0525478817|5.0|I listened to this book via audiobook and it was great. The narrarator was perfect for the story. There is an author interview at the end where Green mentions that he recorded an audiobook version for his fans, with him reading it, because some fans wanted to hear him reading it. While I can understand that, I do believe that this book, being told from a female character's point of view, definitely benefited from Kate Rudd being the voice.<br /><br />The story is based on a girl named Hazel, who is terminally ill, and it also features other characters in similar situations, it isn't all tears. That doesn't mean that no tears were shed in listening to Hazel's story. There were more than a few times where I had to suck it up and dry my eyes. Luckily it isn't heavy handed and there were many lighthearted and fun moments.<br /><br />Hazel's character is the most developed, but the others that enter her world are no less worthy of mention. From those friends that only made short appearances to characters such as Gus that became a mainstay in Hazel's world, they were all so well written and so well rounded. No one was perfect, everyone was realistic as a person. This is what made the story feel fuller and true. This could have been someone's autobiography.<br /><br />As an adult, I've never been shy in reading young adult books and this book is a prime example of why. Just because this story features teenagers as the main characters, doesn't mean it isn't a story worthy of being read by people of all ages. It's touching and charming, heartbreaking and delightful, and one not to be missed.<br /><br />Book Received: For free from publisher in exchange for an honest review<br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Very pleased with this new app. Recommend to anyone who loves music. Very easy to use. My music sounds great!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|this is a handy, easy to use sharpener. i even use it to sharpen kitchen knives instead of the block sharpener.
B005J4TLO8|3.0|It's not the best movie. The only funny things about this movie was nick Swardson and Aziz Ansari. It's not the type of movie I can watch over and over again.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Add more enemies.  Kinda repetitive, but good.  It also could be faster, but it certainly keeps my attention for a while.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|This movie was decent I liked the acting and the story line in it.  I do not want to get into spoilers but there were a few things in the movie that were not historically accurate however it is a movie and it is still worth the watch in my humble opinion.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|took a chance on this game and had know idea how much fun it would be! its addictive,  always feel the need to try one more time,  an hour later . great game for all ages
B0017APQ1K|4.0|This movie may be a little long, but it was still great. Dicaprio was great and Daniel Day-Lewis was amazing. This is my third favorite Martin Scorsese movie, behind goodfellas and casino. If your a movie buff you have to watch it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I like the upgrades you can purchase and its much more fast paced than the original missile command. Plus its free so download it.
B005LAII44|1.0|I had really been looking forward to these movies to come out for a long time I felt there were  a lot of story lines and characters they could have gone with to make them really new and interesting for both children today and adults who used to watch the cartoons when they came out.  I was very disappointed. The first movie was terrible and was not even going to watch this one but after I heard they changed the entire movie I gave it a shot thinking they would have learned from the first one boy was I wrong. Minor spoiler alert but they even killed off a good character and other ones just never show up.  The movies are total mish-mosh all I can hope for is some day they will make a set of G.I.Joe movies and do it justice.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This Vevo kicks ass! But we've got to talk about the other vevo app. You know, Vevo HD? When I use that &quot;app,&quot; and I use the term loosely, every time I try to play a video, I get a message that said, &quot;video cannot be played.&quot; On this version, no problem. It's a piece of cake! A child can operate this app. If you want a suggestion, fix that app. Or better yet, throw it in the garbage where it belongs!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was a very good read. I really liked all the characters and I felt like I could relate to them. This is the second book I have read from this author and they were both wonderful books.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Always loved the classic this is a great remake. Upgrades to missiles are nice. And fun to see trees as protection.
B000KIPD5E|4.0|This pedal works as described and is perfect for what I needed it for. No issues with it. Thank you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've got just about every bingo game app butt this has got too be my favorite one been playing it for years. With the chat was better
B005K17RU0|3.0|Not sure why but don't always get accurate current weather. Also just not crazy about the way it's laid out. Not a bad app but I prefer Weather Bug.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Good pick up and battery lasts long.  Great way to pick up small messes on the carpet and hardwood floor
B000PMG16U|5.0|After having not watched the prequel trilogy for a while, it was actually different than I had remembered.  Everyone always seems to make fun of Anakin and Padme courting scenes, but if you think about it, Anakin is just being an ankward teen trying for his first girlfriend, one he obsessed over for years.  And as for Jar Jar, the other common complaint, I never noticed how everyone else makes fun of him the entire first movie, and it's really quite amusing.  The CGI yoda in episode 1 is a welcome change in the blu ray version.  Also the quality of the blu ray is far better than the dvd version.  It's been fun watching these movies again and thinking about how the sith plot unfolds.  The best thing about this movie are the details left out, like who Sifa-diyas was, and it makes me think and hypothesize about the background story.  This is much more engaging to rewatch than Lord of the Rings.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not Bad for a free game. I'd recommend to anyone. Well thought out and easy to play. Levels get harder and harder make sure to spend your money wisely.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I was not overly impressed by this movie in spite of it's Academy Awards and ratings.  It is SO SLOW in getting started and very hard to get into.  I need to watch it again and, hopefully, some of the ratings will prove true.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I can't wait until Season 2. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are both wonderful in this. Love the politics and backstabbing that goes along with it. At the top of the scale for me.  Ann Ottawa Ontario
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|While watching tv I find myself picking this game up and playing it. It is kind of fun to play.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's is really cool and very fun. They are easy but very clever these are for u clever ones.Plus I jus did dis for coins.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|I think Denzel was a little misled by this one.  By far, not his best acting, and the script was not one that he should have considered.  He is too good for this movie.
0061537969|5.0|Clever way to tell the story, pet lover will enjoy this story. Author knows  a lot about loving pets and their behavior.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|I love the movie. I love Angelina Jolie. I bought it. There is no more no less. Good quality, plays just fine, haven't checked out the extra features yet, but the movie seems to play fairly the same as the regular version. Great story about fashion / modelling industry, its pressures and the ramifications of drug use, centering on (as the title would suggest), the model Gia Carangi.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is fun and awesome the best running game ever in the world fun minions love them it awesome LOL
B004QX07G4|3.0|Ellen DeGeneres is a very interesting person and one who is fun to read about as well as be entertained by.  She has a personality which reflects who she really is and she is enjoyable to read.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game to just whittle away some time.  Keeps your fingers tapping fast and accurately.  I found nothing wrong with the installer with my phone security software.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I love this game. It reminds me of when I was little. I haven't started getting ads like the other people say but it is free so you sometimes have to expect ads.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The written word combined with the spoken word  makes for a perfect learning tool.The access to the content/index makes for speedy transition and the daily scripture makes the app perfect.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a great game. Makes you think and feel like you have accomplished some thing. Highly recommended. I was sad when it was finished. :(
B002VISNLC|5.0|Just taught this book to a class and they thoroughly enjoyed the wit and clever use of language. A great text to show the power of stereotypes in narratives. Some critics consider a Dahl as racist and a misogynist but honestly he picks on everyone!
B008HFWF3U|5.0|This is just a perfect joy to listen to! It has got to be the best example of this artist at his PRIME! These two CD's uncover a treasure trove of the beautiful, elaborate, and yet pulsating rhythms that made up Pat's past productions and now blend into a totally new creation in this astounding orchestration! Pure ENJOY for the ears! Stunning says it all!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read the first book in this series shortly after finishing another similar series. I fell in love with Sylvia's writing quickly. I have read all three books now, although slightly annoyed (there was only supposed to be 3 books) can't wait for the 4th and 5th! The relationship between Gideon and Eva is a different one for sure, but surely passionate and caring also!
B005PK553C|5.0|I was told about  America Horror Story while I was away, started watching it on my Kindel, enjoyed it very much can't wait for more
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Uno was a fun game as a kid playing with my family.  Now we have grown n moved apart so now i can play on my kindle and relive the old days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think that when you become involved with the show, you care and (don't care) about many of the characters and want to know... &#34;What happens next?&#34; So, I totally loved it... want more, yada yada yada.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very fun and creative hard at times but it's fun to figure it out ! I LOVE IT and so does my little brother
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I found this book to be really interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed the experiments at the end of each segment. I found the way some thoughts were explained enlightening and presented in a unique way.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great missile defense game, nice graphics , very enjoyable, highly recommend!<br />Have been looking for a good missile defense game fir a while, this one hits the mark.
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|Fogerty's sound never gets old. I enjoyed listening to the music and recommend this album for all Fogerty or CCR fans.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really enjoy seeing the weather in my area displayed instantly.  It also makes it easy to check the weather where my friends & relatives live.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This CD was fantastic all the songs on it I love them all.  My favorite song on here is the greatest love of all.<br /><br />Thank you!!!
B001N3OJEG|2.0|The movie was good but 3/4 of the way into it, the sounds went. It was like watching a 1960's dubbed Japanese movie. The sound was about two seconds before the action. You would hear a punch or a shot, and then see the punch/shot. I gave it two stars for the actual movie but couldn't give it more because of the defect in the disc. This is the first video from Amazon that I've had a problem with and I've ordered quite a few.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love it!!!!!  This is a fun game for someone who likes hidden object games. I would highly recommend this game.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|Product made of silicon dioxid and polydimethyl siloxane<br />Durable?  Do NOT get wet.<br /><br />I've just purchased, but not received it yet.  It certainly looks like fun in the video.  Wondering how Matchbox and Hot Wheels will intereact.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is quick easy to play. Also, the in game upgrades make for extended fun. Well worth the cost.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Too violent and unbelievable plot.  This was a trial on my part to see if we could view a movie on our computer at our summer residence.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My little sis wanted to get this game on my kindle so I got it for her and I even love to play it I would recommend it to a lot of my friends if I were her.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Coming from someone that usually can predict an ending, i'll openly admit I was shocked even though I had vague suspicions throughout the book. Whether it be stress, fear, confusion or love; you are impelled to be just as involved with the character of this story as though it was your very own. Masterfully done and well told by the author. I recommend this for anyone with patience and an open mind. You won't be disappointed.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I was suprised by how much fun this game was.  Worth picking up.  Just challenging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this one.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Fast and easy to get in the ring and simply go for it, another way for your brain to vicariously do some serious pummeling!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This Game Is Very Awesome Is Not Even That Hard Like The Other Guessing Games I Really Do Like This Game .
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Awesome !!!  good way to kill time .  Graphics suck but game play is addictive and challenging.  Thank you for the fun app.  Keep up the good work.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|Funny and awesome like the Star Wars lego titles.  Good for young and old lol.  A worthy purchase plus minifig
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a good game for kids that like despicable me. This game is great there is three labs one is Grus lab the second lab is residential and the third lab is el machos lab. If you know what subway surfer is it is kind of like that
B00005ATZT|4.0|Good movie and will keep you interested the entire time. Great actors as well and they get the job done.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|It took me a while to &#34;get in to&#34; this book. When I first did, however, I found a wonderful, typical Austen story that made my 5 am mornings and 1,5 hour bus ride to work much better. A real feel-good treat for my tine girly-girl side.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it every day, its totally changed my life. You will be a pinner for the rest of your life.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is exciting and fun. Easy to navigate. Reminds me of the old Middle Command from Atari. Gets your heart racing as the threat gains speed.
B00015YVDG|4.0|Good Movie and will keep you on toes. Good action as well and recommend for others to see or buy.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I have only seen the movie before (the one from 1993), but I haven't watched it in several years. As I loved the movie, I was looking forward to read the book to see how similar they were. I didn't remember everything, and I know some details are changed, but I still remembered to feeling I had as a kid watching the movie.<br />The book is very well written. If you do not want to run outside to go hiking or to get a garden, there is something wrong with you.<br />It was a bit hard to read the Yorkshire dialect at first, but I soon warmed to it.<br />In this time when children want to stay indoors, play computer games, and get stuff and more stuff, this is a book every child should read. I loved how much it focuses on how happy everyone is because the thin children are getting fatter, and how healthy it is to be playing and running and exercising. Children should learn this at an early stage, and not the &#34;eat fat free and go to the gym&#34;-way.<br />Anyway... I loved it. I put it on my all-ages shelf, as it is just as relevant for grown-ups.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It only somewhat compares to the original Missile Command. But, I'll still play it when I have a few minutes to kill.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Good controller. Actual Sony and Playstation 3 controller. It is a bit expensive but for what you get, it's well worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE it!!!! Maybe me feel like I have a real house!!!!!! You get to train it and go to conditions and free it out is AMAZING
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game brings back memories of the old school middle defense game that I used to play on my really old computer. It seems a lot easier now that I am able to use a touch screen though... seems almost like cheating. Great game so far.
0553386697|5.0|I love the idea of the upstairs / downstairs brain.  Its helped me to connect to my tantruming 5 year old rather than getting angry with him.
B005LN5UOC|5.0|If you are a hardcore gamer that plays a lot of multiplayer games, this is a necessity. Good sound quality from both ends. The headset is well made. I couldn't be happier. The price is good for this headset.
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|These CDs are amazing!  I love their version of each and every track - what incredible harmony/voices they have.  So pleased I purchased this particular CD, as being &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; it has the best of all their other CDs.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is so great, excellent story and weighting, can't wait for the movie just hope it's as good as the. book.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great movie, laughed all the way through, but am still craving twinkies.....hmmm..... does anyone else see a connection there or is it just me? Very enjoyable and family oriented.
0307476073|5.0|This book is an inspiring journey, told in a highly entertaining way, and I could not put it down.  I am now continually craving Snapple.
B0098460O4|5.0|I saw them first on Google -&#34; Britains got Talent &#34;. and thought how amazing their voices were.  I followed their progress on Google and just wanted to buy their CD  - I wasn&#34;t disappointed.  GREAT!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game makes you use your mind to figure out the clues. need more rooms and challenges. can't. wait until they are available.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun for the kid should MAKE it greater with more explosive so read it in written word thank you come again
B0030IG0C6|5.0|We bought this as a wedding cake topper (seriously!) It was even better quality than we expected. It will definitly be washed and kept in the family for the kids to play with! It's a very nice product and arrived quickly in the mail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I first got this I just loved it when I first started. If you LOVE horses like me then GET THIS APP NOW
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Turns out this is a pretty good version of a classic. The touch controls make it a little easier than the trackball, but it is very fun. Upgrades are smart and add to the overall fun.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I'm glad that I found this game as I find it quite entertaining.  At times, I'm perplexed because I know that  I need to find one more piece in order to move forward, and it can be difficult to find. But, if it was too easy, then I'd get bored and delete the game from the cloud. The fact that it is free is particularly sweet!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Ok, so Aslan was given a nasty interview on Fox, other than that his book is really a easy-to-read re-hashing of what many New Testament scholars have already said about Jesus. It is eye-opening and thought-provoking just the same. My faith in God and his son Jesus did not change because of this book. I suggest that people reading this book take the time to read others like it before they make a final decision on whether it's important to their view of religion and how this re-reading of scripture affects their beliefs, if it affects it at all.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Not up to the first two,to much padding,found the middle a bore,was not a page turner,will re read his first novels
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I really love this series and I found the did not disappoint. Love the characters and the plot. Only problem it is not complete and now I have to wait for the follow up.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I'm not a sophisticated podcast user. I justed wanted something basic that would allow me to listen to NPR-ish things - Terry Gross, Car Talk, etc. - while I read on the Kindle. Works fine for that purpose. Has never crashed or caused me any problems that I can identify.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I love it! It's a brand new gamecube controller that's exactly the same as the incredible original, and the buttons work pretty perfectly. The white design also looks very sleek and the cord is actually longer (about 10ft) than the old ones, so it's easy to play from a distance from your gamecube/wii.<br /><br />**I am a competitive Smash Bros player so I ordered this almost exclusively to be able to play better with better button precision (replacing my old cruddy controller with sticky buttons). I know its expensive but it's almost impossible to find original series controllers that work as well as this one does. You are DEFINITELY better off ordering this. It works as well as can possibly be, with no risk of disappointment from buying used controllers, ships as described, and will probably last you for years.<br /><br />Overall a great purchase. I only wish they had more controller color options, but regardless it looks really nice!
B00A27X972|5.0|It was better than I thought it would be.  It proved to be thought provoking and laugh-out-loud funny at times.  The only problem was that it ended too soon.  I wanted more.  Sequel?  Please!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|.... except you can repair buildings too... and there are trees that also defend against missiles.<br /><br />I need more words.... la la la.
193700788X|1.0|I have enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse series since the very first book. However, the last few have left something to be desired. They focused too much on Sookie taking a bath, doing her hair, picking out her (outdated) clothing, tanning in the yard or just plain doing nothing. B.O.R.I.N.G. This last book, alas, was the same.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />Pam being made Sheriff was the only thing that made me happy. The rest was just so..anti-climactic. Sookie is kidnapped by these people who hate her but oh wait, she's out of the car and she's safe. That was fast. And we've waited the entire series to see her finally hook up with Sam so I expected fireworks, a huge public cry of love and devotion as they both realized they were meant to be together. Instead it was...Zzzzz...oh, sorry. I dozed off there. The Devil was an AWESOME character and I would have loved to see more of him but we were only thrown a bone and then he was gone.<br /><br />It was clear that this book was meant to tie up all loose ends. But really, what was the point of Quinn showing up? To let the readers know he's happy where he's at and still a Sookie supporter? And as soon as he arrives, he's suddenly gone to plan Eric's wedding. Barry was missing for a while but then just shows up at the end, battered and bruised and all we're told is they were holding him and he was saved. Yawn. How about detailing the rescue? Even the interaction between Sookie and Eric was boring. And the new vampire Karin who is unsure, jealous of Sookie and then is suddenly kissing her cheek as if they're long lost BFF's. What?<br /><br />Overall, I don't regret reading this series. I do watch the show but it's really easy to separate the two (I admit, Tara on the show is way cooler than Tara in the books). I just wish this final book had been an explosion of shockers, twists and turns befitting the lifestyle of a woman who dates the undead and shifters. I just expected more and you know what? The characters we grew to love deserved it.o love deserved it.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Does anyone know if they are going to make a DVD/ CD version of this like they did for Sticky and Sweet and Confessions?? I hope so!!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|One of the nice things is when a book trains you by telling a compelling (and familiar) story.  While I'm one of those dev guys in the book, I have a deep appreciation of the IT function and what problems they solve day to day.  I really learned (and reminded myself) about things that will help me do my job better as a part of the system of delivering value through IT
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really awesome game fun like the atari original. I really like it. I'll waste a lot of time with this.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master has really helped me to keep my Kindle running smoother. I think it is a great app to add to your device.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Needs updated version. This version is 3.3. I have version 3.5 on my cell phone. Won't allow me to update.  Please get updated version.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|This game definitely has playability. I like the customization thing, it definitely adds a little depth and there are definitely some challenging opponents. My only gripe right now is with the &quot;challenges&quot;. Why is it that even when it appears that you win a challenge you seem to lose? I have had 90 fights and I can say with all honesty, I have only won two maybe three challenges. This issue needs to be addressed. Other than that it seems to be a well put together game.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|I bought this with the glitter variant and they are adorable! Derpy is one of my favorite characters! Derpy comes with an opaque mane and tail and her cutie mark is only one one side.<br />Keep calm and muffins!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very addicting and fun. It's always fun to blow stuff up. Easy to play and easy to lose yourself. Great.
0544104404|5.0|I can whole heartedly recommend this book  if your lives include children that you want to succeed in life. Knowing how to help instill a &#34;stick to it&#34; , attitude in children in an increasingly instant gratification filled society is priceless. Priming  your children or students to dig deep and persevere will undoubtedly help them grow into strong , resilient adults who know how to strive towards success.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Really enjoying this game.  The play reminds me alot of missle command which I played as a kid over at a friends house.  Try it.
0425264351|3.0|A solid story arc and interesting character -- also Child makes the choice to have a mystery told by a first person narrarator which is different than most books of this genre I've read.  Unfortunately the later books in the series are just written better and more entertaining.  Read it because it is the first in the series...but don't judge too harshly.  Look for One Shot or 61 Hours to find Reacher at his best!
0765325950|5.0|What a way to wrap up almost everything.  It has been quite the journey, more than 20 years, but I would do it all over again to experience the depth of storytelling in this series for another 20 years.  Brandon does great work with Mr. Jordan's notes, and brings things to a rather satisfying if slightly open ending.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|... and now I get to watch it in Blu-ray.  So it's almost as good as winning the lottery.  Almost...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game is terrific if you have some time to kill.  You can play one quick hand for a minute or two or, if you're really bored, you can pass an hour or two.
B008220BLG|5.0|It's not your typical zombie story and it's also not a tacky love story! This movie has action, comedy, and a taste of horror. This movie has restored my faith in American horror movies again.
B00005JKGK|5.0|honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen....and  I have watched it often...something every mother and daughter should watch together....!!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|This game is fun and worth the money i have the regular weaphones to and its fun also you should defintley get this app
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Only had this a few days, but it's a neat little item that you can put in your pocket and forget about although not to the point of ending up in the wash!  Integrates well into the Withings App so if you are using the scales and/or blood pressure monitor this is a great addition.  As with all Withings, you pay a somewhat premium price, although not so much with this when you compare with the competition.  Will update after a month or so of using...
B002ZG99A4|5.0|arrived quickly<br />It was so good at the theater we had to add it to our library.<br />Viewing is as good at home as it was in the theater.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|It's a beautiful book, John green is an impressive writer<br />I would defiantly recommend this book. Again it is amazing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great time killer, easy to play, challenging as you progress. Extremely addictive game play that can keep you busy for hours.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Interesting ideas and a thoughtful read...<br />Worth a listen to those with open minds!<br />Thank you for this scholarly work...
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|FUN and addictive game... it's just like all of the other games of its type, but fun still the same...
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Great movie with great performances from all.  Teaches a lot about what's really important in life and is a must watch for any young, shallow teenagers who need a reality check.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game would be great, but it seems to crash quite often. Maybe they will fix it with an update.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Entertaining, and even though shooting involved, enjoyed how the &#34;old-timer retirees - grandpa&#34; put the young agents to shame and earned respect after all. Watched it several time already.
006224454X|5.0|I have never been much of a reader because I tend to get bored with books. Put them away because they haven't hooked me fast enough. Not with this book. I could not stop reading, stop thinking about it while I was reading it. Began sneaking bathroom breaks just to read a little more. This is a great book - really well written and leaves you thinking about it long after you've read the last page.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and brain challenging and you really have to think about and concentrate but figuring it out is super fun.<br />Excited for more levels to come.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the game is fun at the smartphone icons at the bottom of the screen cut off the bottom of the game so it is difficult to know how to play
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|Now I can watch whenever I want and have the time, even as an adult approaching Medicare! We like to have the closed captioning on to understand the British accent better, but not available in the first few. Otherwise, I'm totally pleased.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|A truly shocking exposition of Islam. Violent in many ways people could not imagine. Also speaks volumes about the disgusting trends of leftists bent on destroying western culture.
0060594896|5.0|Thank you Jack for a wonderfully entertaining and informative book. I love the principles introduced in this book. There is so much goodness wrapped withing this cover to ever convey in one review. I loved everything, especially the quotes, stories and examples, and especially the message. Do the exercises in the book! They will make you think about things in a new way. There were several sections that inspired me to take action, but the most important one was &#34;The Total Truth Letter&#34; where you write a letter to someone who upset you, but don't send it. This really helped me move on from  a damaging relationship, and I have never looked back yet! Thanks again Jack!

0399255370|5.0|I do not have children of my own yet, but I do have a collection of children's books (both old and new) that I started collecting when I was a child.  My search of unique and quality children's books began in my college years while getting my degree in education.  This story teaches kids to rethink of their use of colors in their art and try them in creative ways, while also adding humor and personality to a box of crayons!  As a child, I use to think all of my things (toys, dolls, school, crayons...) had feelings and personality.  I think that's a great way to look at one's things because it encourages children to treat their things well.  I have seen many a child open their box of crayons on the first day of school and immediately break their new crayons in half or launch them in the air at a fellow student.<br /><br />This book is great....AND it made me want to buy a brand new box of crayons to make some art!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Third is a great take on missile command.  Brings back some fond memories.  The power up element is a nice touch as well
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I love Keane music and this album is perfect to listening it while on your way. I always listen it a the car, and we sing it along with my daughter.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I've been reading Grisham for the past few months, and was glad to read this book from a perspective other than a lawyer. As always, grisham is easy to read and I definitely recommend this book
1401323952|4.0|I love how Nigella's personality is written into each recipe description.....(ha &#34;Slut's spaghetti&#34;)<br /><br />If you are tired of plain banana bread every time you have old overripe bananas, you MUST try the chocolate banana muffins!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a yarn Grisham spins! It's never dull and he does not need any gore to keep it spellbinding..good job!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Us read the first trilogy. This one as been just as good so far. Can not wait to read book three.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Updated graphics and gameplay to an old favorite of mine. Intuitive interface, responsive controls, I found myself immersed quickly and my younger son now wants on his tablet!

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is a must-have for your collection. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is easy to get through. Definitely worth it.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Love this movie.  it stayed true to the book.  Minnie and Aileen and Skeeter and Hilly were perfect in their parts.  I hope that this type of life never exists again for anyone.
0316056871|5.0|I got this as a gift for my wife. She had it on her Amazon wish list. She said it was full of humor and it was an easy read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is really fun but it finished  it in a few minutes. You should get it though. Very entertaining. I recommend it.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I got this album because I've been a JB fan for a long time. When I got it I thought the whole album would be like his viral songs such as &#34;as long as you love me&#34; and &#34;boyfriend&#34;, but when I got it I was pleasantly surprised! He has lots of slow and personal songs and also some very touching songs. Overall amazing album!
B00BIR381W|5.0|Although the mystery is nowhere near being solved and the red herrings outnumber the real clues by leaps and bounds, this is a great, fun, whodunit show with a lot of pretty people, pretty scenery, and fun plot lines.  I love it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I got this book because my brother read it and said he liked it a lot. I must say I agree. Lincoln was a hard working President.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's not always easy to travel with books. The Kindle apps helps me to travel, wait in Dr offices, waiting in line at the grocery store...it's also helping me to get of the clutter by getting all my books moved to ebooks.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|This is a Fantastically great movie. Robert Downey Jr plays a Fantastic Sherlock  Holmes. Full of action and funny quips.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was interesting.  Different experience altogether.  The author has quite a tale to tell, I'm just not sure if it's entirely believable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is an awesome game!!! I have every gadget and all the vehicle upgrades and clothes and jetpacks!! The only problems are that it unequips all my vehicle upgrades every time I go out of the game and I have to equip them again, but that's minor, it won't update my distance, which is actually 7,727m and the coin magnet circle thingy around my vehicles and Barry disappeared about a week ago, so now it just pulls the coins in without any animations. Halfbrick, please fix stuff like this! But despite all this, it's still the greatest game in the world.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|There is always lots to do. The goals consistently challenge the player everytime the previous goal has been achieved.  The graphics are awesome, and the minions are adorable.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jet pack joyride is really cool you get to unlock levels, crazy vehicles, and buy gadgets. My brother and I love this game are , are favorite gadget is flash a cute little robot puppy that collects coins!
B003V4AK8E|3.0|Not at all advisable for shooter games. The original one works so much better than this one. I only kept it to use with racing games, which it works fine for. Overall I think not as described st all. Got it cause says works just as good as sony equipment and that is not true at all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome everyone should play it I recommend this to anyone with or without kids I can't put it down
B001GJ30Y2|5.0|I've listened to all of m83s album and this one is my favorite.<br />The album starts with &#34;You, Appearing&#34; which has a nice piano piece and progressively joined by a synth pad of ambient sound and anthony's voice.  The song is very dreamlike and has a nostalgic feel.  This is reversed with the next song which has more of a synth pop upbeat feel with &#34;kim & jessie&#34;.  Very likable song.  It is followed by the &#34;skin of the night&#34; which has a great duet? of anthony and the Morgan Kibby's soothing voice.  Kibby's voice is at the forefront song but I particularly like anthony's backdrop voice to hers which makes this song work.  Is then followed by &#34;Graveyard Girl&#34;, which again just like the beginning this album  with the song &#34;you appearing&#34; followed by the upbeat song &#34;kim & jessie&#34; , graveyard girl is the upbeat response to skin of the night melancholic feel. Its got a nice beat and anthony's voice really makes this song deserve a repeat. This song is followed by the &#34;Couleurs&#34; which is has a long build up and has this trance like feel.  Coleurs is anthony breaking away from the early songs of this album and  going for a his signature synths.  He still adds his vocals in a drone melodic like manner in the end of the song which elevates this song even more.  Coulerus is followed by probably my least favorite song in this album &#34;UP!&#34;  kibby has a very soothing voice and she is the main voice in this song, but I think this song is a bit cheesy and boring. I tend to skip this song a lot.<br />We own the sky is a very nice song and has anthony and kibbys voice layered in this dreamlike feel.  The song is followed with a more dreamepic of &#34;highway of endless dreams&#34; which i think the best way to describe this song is going down a tunnel really fast with lights passing by.  The cacophony of voices and the drum build has this trance effect.  It is following by &#34;Too Late&#34; a piece which has again avery melachonly nostalgic feel. It has a piano piece sound like you appearing but anthony's voice in this piece is more profound really makes this one of my favorites of this album.<br />The song which I like most in this album has to be &#34;Dark Moves of Love&#34; everything about this song I like.  The voice combo and the drum piece stand out in this song.  Similarly, the lyrics albeit simple are powerful.  This song is 2nd to my favorite song of M83 &#34;run into flowers&#34; from dead cities, red seas and lost ghosts.  &#34;Dark Moves of Love&#34; is by far the best song in this album.<br />Its is followed by a drone like song in &#34;Midnight Souls still remain&#34; that isn't much of a song but rather just ambient synth. Not much going on in this song.<br /><br />Ranking from Favorite to least<br />1) Dark Moves of Love<br />2) Too Late<br />3) Skin of the Night<br />4) Highway of Endless Dreams<br />5)Kim & Jessie<br />6) You appearing<br />7)Coleurs<br />8) Graveyard girl<br />9) We Own the sky<br />10) UP!<br />11) Midnight Souls still remain

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I often have trouble sleeping when there is too much noise going on around me, but I have found this app to be one of the best sleep aids in all kinds of noisy situations. I like the fact that it has such a wide range of white sounds to choose from and that it can play all night. Falling to sleep even while loud music and boisterous people are outside my hotel room has become a treat with this app.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|One of the best live albums done by the Allman Brothers Band.  There is perfect harmony among the musicians throughout this album that it doesn't get any better than this live album.  Highly recommended!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a pretty fun remake of the classic game Missile Command (I think that's the name of the original) it's all right
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive. I can't stop playing it. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a free and fun game. Play it and see for yourself.
B000E33W1C|5.0|This is a very funny movie with the cast from Monty Python movies.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline are also great additions to this hilarious plot.  Highly recommended!

B008XG1X18|5.0|This is seriously addictive! I could spend hours wandering through the pins. I truly love this app. There are so many cheap and creative ways to improve your home and life. I don't know how I lived without it. A must have for everyone.
0061339202|5.0|Flow is an excellent reference for managers and team leaders. If you need to motivate a group this is required reading. I find it odd more people don't know about it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked Hosseini's other books (Kite Runner & Thousand Splendid Suns), then this is a must-read for you.  It will not disappoint.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've always hated the escape games because I always end up not figuring out what's already in front of me. Either I got smarter or these escape levels got easier. I doubt the latter. It's challenging. If you just take your time and look at what you have and ask yourself what can you do with it, eventually you will figure it out. I'm glad to say of all 10 levels I looked for video help on youtube for only two levels. The only problem I have with this is there's only 10 levels. At the end they say more levels are on the way and I can't wait to play them!
1594484805|5.0|I listened to Daniel Pink's Drive while (ironically) driving from Southern California to Northern California. It's hard to find something that will keep you interested for that long but Drive did it. It is an excellent resource for team leaders and managers.

B004GUSG4M|3.0|Christine proves rather reliable in her unreliability as a narrator. But it's not exactly breaking character since she can't remember. I've had traumatic experiences in my life, and I can't remember that particular time period. My mind is blank. It's like that particular event didn't happen, except I remember the before and the after and there's a crumpled car to prove to me that I'm not just making stuff up in my head. And if your entire world revolves around your husband Ben and you suddenly see three words in your diary--DON'T TRUST BEN--I can understand how that might be terrifying and traumatic for you. I'd equate it to building a million dollar mansion on quicksand.<br /><br />The structure worked for me. It added suspense. Had BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP been structured any other way, it would have crumbled in on itself like an origami bird. But I didn't like the ending. It felt a bit like cheating to me. *BEGIN SPOILER* Christine suddenly has her memory back or large chunks of it at least, because the supposed traumatic event is over, and Mike has been expunged from existence. It seemed a tad convenient for me. S.J. Watson may, or may not, have consumed an illegal substance during this period, and there's a decent chance he may have inhaled. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />But otherwise the story worked. It had a different feel to it, and I was turned on enough to want to know what happened, but I did have a sinking suspicion I had the ending figured out before it arrived.<br /><br />For those of you who don't like tangents, you'll probably want to skip right on over this part. Let's get one thing straight: There are no original plotlines. The well of lost plots has been used up, drying faster than the Nevada desert. Sure, it's easy enough to make the argument that this story is similar to Memento, but so what? We might as well take every romance and mystery off the shelves...and sit around and wait for someone to come up with something \\"original.\\" I'll save you the suspense: You probably have a better chance of meeting a little green alien, having him tickle your forehead, and then receiving a wet smack to the lips. Guess what? The Fast & The Furious is essentially the same as Point Break, only there're cars and car racing instead of surfing. And the director of The Fast & The Furious is in preproduction on a remake of Point Break. You're welcome.<br /><br />But let's get to the good news: Even without an endless number of plots, there are an endless number of ideas and experiences and opportunities and characters that writers can bring to the table, bringing an essential \\"uniqueness\\" to the creative drawing board. The Fast & The Furious feels different from Point Break because the characters are different.

B0040QYROA|5.0|The film is not yet complete--there are about five minutes one cannot restore--but it mostly here.  The cinematic masterpiece, slow by contemporary standards, holds up better than most movies made in the last 80 years--or 8 years--or 8 months.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I've been in so many unsatisfying relationships and I couldn't figure out why. Well, most of them were jerks but they definitely have a language of love. After reading this book, I understood a whole lot more about relationships, not just the romantic kind but also friendships and my relationship with family. Each person has a way of saying they love you and this book explains so much even though that concept seems so simple. I've heard that concept before but I brushed it off because &#34;if they love me, they should do the same things I do for them&#34;. I was wrong. Luckily, I read this book just shortly after being engaged to the man I completely adore and love. Without this book, I would have interpreted our relationship so differently (and I was beginning to). But this book made so much sense that I couldn't put it down and read it very quickly. It shone a light on my relationship and I've since had a great appreciation of my loved one.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The program is well written.  It is entertaining.  I can't wait for season three to be available.  Matthew will be missed, but I can't wait to see how Mary and the family manage.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|After a successful first season taking over the show, Steven Moffat continued to do what he's known for: write crazy, brilliant television shows with likable and endearing characters. This season of Doctor Who loses none of the flair, brilliance, and character of the previous seasons, and in some ways, ramps it up to eleven. Through its creepy new villains, intriguing and mysterious seasonal arc, great development of characters (especially in River Song and the Doctor), and truly great selection of episodes, Doctor Who's sixth series is one of its best.<br /><br />After rewriting time and finally removing the crack in Amy's wall, the Doctor (Matt Smith) continues to travel through space and time. After a brief honeymoon stint on Christmas (found in the 2010 Christmas special \\"A Christmas Carol\\"), Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) settle down for a few months and live their newly wed life. However, one day they get a message from the Doctor and, along with River Song (Alex Kingston), wind up witnessing his future death. After a strange reunion with his younger self, they continue to travel through time and go on their adventures, but now with the knowledge of his death on their minds, and the creepy new Silence (who take a noticeable page from the Slenderman mythos) out to kill the Doctor.<br /><br />This season contains some more excellent, brilliant, and purely enjoyable episodes. The season starts out with the first (at least for the revived show) two-part season premiere. \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"/\\"Day of the Moon\\" is an excellent two-parter, with an introduction to the Silence, who join the ranks of some of the series' scariest villains, a creepy new alien race with a plan to kill the Doctor and a habit of being wiped from people's memories. The episode is also great for its continued development of River Song and her back story, as well as making for an excellent way to start off the season. Other excellent episodes grace the season, from the interesting and mysterious \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", to the series' first use of a midseason finale \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\" and its follow-up \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", to the strongly thematic and excellent characterization in \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" and \\"The God Complex\\". In fact, there isn't an episode of the whole season that isn't great (except maybe \\"Curse of the Black Spot\\", which is only good in comparison to the rest of the episodes). This season is full of quality episodes, full of excellent themes and morals, strong characterization, brilliant twists, and just plain fun. This season stands as a testament to the quality of the show.<br /><br />The characters continue to excel on the show. The main leads Smith, Gillan, and Darvill are all fully comfortable in their roles, and it's great to see a set of companions last more than just a single season (so far, Amy Pond is the longest lasting companion with two and a half seasons). Smith's Doctor is as great as ever, full of kookiness and brilliance, while episodes like \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\" and \\"The God Complex\\" help build and balance his character, showing the darker elements to the nature of the Doctor. Amy and Rory also get more development, especially now that Rory is a permanent companion (and Darvill is finally on the cast list!). Their relationship gets a great amount of development, and it consistently remains excellently written and fully believable (except when Amy speaks like she's talking about the Doctor but really referring to Rory; that continues a bit longer than necessary now that they're married). River is likely the highlight of the season, as her back story is now fully explained by the end of the season. Her character gets to run the gamut of emotions and Kingston pulls through in providing her some excellent acting and believability (and sympathy).<br /><br />The production on the show is great as ever, too. The Silence (and the dolls from \\"Night Terrors\\") have just the right style and look to make them one of the scariest villains to grace the show, and the effects for things like the Flesh or the headless monks (and their headless victims) is great and adds some great immersion, fun, and downright creativity to the show. The soundtrack also continues to excel. There are some great tunes to be found, especially in the finale \\"The Wedding of River Song\\".<br /><br />Series 6 is truly one of the best seasons to grace Doctor Who. It has everything that makes the show great, and in many cases it is turned right up to eleven, without losing the quality and heart of the show.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|if you update it on a kindle, won't let you go in. never update. So horrible I was about to delete it. Never buy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This a fun and wonderful game! I recommend anyone who likes Mario Brothers try this game now. It's easy and will keep you entertained for hours.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Cabin fever is when they get locked inside for a blizzard. Sooner or later,the goes out. Or does it? You can find out if u read cabin fever. It's worth the money!! :)
B001FB55H6|5.0|I love the special features on this blu-ray and i have yet to watch the whole movie. but it shouldn't fail to meet expecatations
1401938906|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable and cleverly illustrative using current examples, references and concepts.  Quick and fun to read.  Matches most of what I have read by deeper writings.  Well done.
B007PM218K|5.0|I loved the product very much, it's a great movie and i feel like it should be seen more by people
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I challenge anyone and everyone, to play this game. You definitely have to be a &#34;Sherlock Holmes,&#34; to be able to escape. Avery challenging game.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is one of the best games on kindle fire. Perfect for those who's moms won't let you get cod or battlefield.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|I love Stop Making Sense, tho I had it on VHS i did know how good it was ... then on Blue-ray, couldn't wait to order it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Fun game, very easy to play and Lear and bosses are challenging my first time playing a game like this on kindle and I think it's a great game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Have you ever thought of  saving the world from aliens?<br />Now you can with missile defender.<br />I recommend it to people who like to be a hero for once and for people who like shooting missiles. I really like this game.<br />Pleas  make more games like this
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Classic; in every sense of the word.  A film that put the race first, not as a backdrop to lame drama.  It is the purest and best racing movie ever.  Gentlemen, start your engines!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My favorite game. I have had this game for several months and has crashed. But I can't wait to finally get to level 70. Would recommend this game for all ages. Keep in mind it can be expensive when you use real money.
B000FFJYCU|1.0|Should have had more racing and less scenes of contrived drama with lackluster acting by James Garner and cast.  I consider this movie to be a waste of time to watch.  Occasionally you will see flashes of John Frankenheimer's brilliance in the racing sequences that would forshadow his later \\"Ronin\\" but the non-racing dialogue scenes could not help.<br /><br />To my eyes \\"Le Mans\\" with Steve McQueen is the best racing movie to watch. Unlike Frankenheimer, who used Grand Prix as a backdrop for human \\"drama\\" (weak as it is in \\"Grand Prix\\"); Steve Mcqueen had the race of Le Mans as the main focus.  The human drama was there, but Mcqueen used it as a seasoning for the movie,  not the main course.  It was in just right proportions, which is also why I feel \\"Le Mans\\" is the best racing movie ever.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The Facebook app can be very helpful keeping up with your facebook. But it also malfunctions a lot sometimes. But other than that the app is dependable and could probably use an update. Enjoy.
B004KPLVYA|1.0|Great movie but this copy was a total bust with no audio or video after the preview of coming attractions.  Will not be making any<br />more purchases from this supplier.
B008MM9630|3.0|I like the graphics and game. The only problem i have is the short life of the plants i never seem to get back before i have to spend energy to revive the plants. Make for slow progress.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|I'd read all the reviews about the book lacking a narrative and was ready for it to be a group of short stories, but the pacing of some of those stories was a little irritating. Personally - I found some of the shorter stories were the most interesting and the longer ones dragged. Worth a read,  but best if you don't have lots of expectations.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you are a reader who enjoys well written words this books for you.  Not only does the author do a masterful job of telling his story he leaves you wanting to know more about the charters.  Read this book if you love mystery ,mayhem ,and adventure.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Thought this was a great album, hope more of these type of songs by Vince in the very NEAR future. This cd for both Vince Gill fans and those not aware of his great talent.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Quite an eye opener !  I had actually gone completely grain free several months ago due to an elevated blood sugar on my last blood test.  This book confirms that I am doing the right thing.  Sent a copy to my daughter in the hopes of sending her down this road as well.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|First time reading Jane Austen. I'm loving it. I got the dictionary, and is so easy to read with the kindle app. Save the page, has dictionary for all words, highlight the text, and more. I just love it.
B008Y1YK0I|1.0|The video quality really is great, but they cut at least two key scenes and probably many more. Those are just the scenes that I noticed, which are when the arabs invaded Aqaba and said they destroyed the radio because it was making weird noises and the scene right before Lawrence says \\"No Prisoners\\" which shows the civilians that had been killed by the Turks. Each missing scene sacrifices key parts of the narrative. Why did Lawrence have to cross the Sinai? Because a bunch of illiterate Bedou smashed the radio for no good reason. Why did Lawrence massacre a Turkish column? Because that Turkish column had committed war crimes against a civilian village. Who was the jerk who thought that he knew better then the director which scenes to include in the movie?
1612183956|5.0|This is a great book. Crouch is a young writer who deserves to be read - especially if you are a fan of Stephen King and the like. There are even slight rumblings of Cormac McCarthy. But that aside, Crouch is a storyteller. He is high concept and I love it - if you want a deep mystery, some good scares, and an addicting plot you should get PINES. I have already started reading Crouch's oher works and PINES is not a mistake. Crouch could easily be the next Stephen King, and that's okay by me.<br /><br />Some other cool things: Crouch writes with a very cinematic bend - PINES will soon be a TV show starring Matt Dillon and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan - That, plus - I def. pulled some direct influences from Twin Peaks. If you are a fan of the show, that right there is enough to read this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love this game!  Great game for all ages!  Our whole family plays it and really enjoys it.  The only problem is I wish you had more options to earn coins instead of having to purchase them.
020530902X|5.0|No matter what you write you must have a copy of this book. It is the best of all style guides in my opinion - it is the first and the most efficient. Learning these rules will help your writing - a crucial skill in understanding that writing is, in fact, a skill. Whenever I get writer's block or must edit a piece I pick this up and read through. It's that quick. It always helps. It comforts me to know this is book is always in arm's reach of my laptop.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Love this show and all the behind the scenes extras!  Looking forward to season four.  I will be watching this for years.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Ken Follett has just become my new James Michener -- epic novels of historical fiction, great characters, intriguing plots and enough twists to keep you on your toes! The only downside for me discovering this (for me) new author is that I feel compelled to read his other books. After reading this, I bought his &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and plan to buy many others.Plus, most of his books are of considerable length so getting the Kindle versions saves wear and tear on the arm from lugging them around.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Sparked an. Nearest in this period of our history. Want to visit the museum next and will do research on the orphan trains
B007VDN1PA|4.0|It should to the job I need, but I have not had time to really try it out as yet
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to understand how to play and lots of fun.  Playing it co-op with my son and we both love it so far.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Browncoats should rule the verse  because it would be a much more noble place. Serenity we hardly knew ye before you were gone.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Not a bad remake of the arcade original, allows upgrades to your weapons with decent graphics. Would have liked better graphics or Joe character, this is more like a free Flash game on line.
1883398088|5.0|If you would like to feast your eyes on the complexities and beauty of H.R. Giger's  biomechanical art, this is the book to buy. It will give one an in depth look at the making of Ridley Scott's classic film along with presenting some beautiful pieces of art by the incomparable H.R.Giger. A must buy.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|Playing as essentially Moses delivering the Israelites across the Red Sea would seeman odd choice for a game... and it is. But the game is fun and addicting as it continually introduces new game mechanics to deliver your people oyt of danger. Also the art style of yge game, styled after construction paper cutouts, gives it a charming feeling. Wether you like, or agree, with the theme or not you owe it to yourself to play the first few levels, you might just enjoy the game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A fun game to pass time! I really enjoy the challenge of the game! A must have. I would recommend it to any body!
B003IKMR0U|3.0|Just a little bit of a filler dice rolling game for warming up the game group or to fill time in between other games. Good quality dice, not stickers thankfully, and simpke rules. Really just a thematic push your luck style of game.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|Hawking and Mlodinow do a world class REVIEW OF THE history of man, thought and the physical realm that we inhabit.  They do a grand tour of the histories of all of these subjects,man's advancement, theories, and the atomic structure of our universe.  Grand job well done. Inspiring reading and time well rewarded.<br /><br />Frank Hatch
B00005KK9M|5.0|always a great trip back to the sixties and seventies...lots of god memories Kansas was a great group thanks bye

B0083IQFD2|5.0|AB is one bad little bitch! She has no shame, her rap is tight, I love this girl! Much sux sess to you Azealia!
B000OXHRRC|5.0|I really enjoyed this film! Not his usual action flik so not everyone will prefer this type of film. However, it is thoughtful and intelligent and Russell Crowe is even more that than an action hero. He's a complex fellow and some of that complexity surfaces here.  This film is more in the style of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" in which he also was superb. Who wouldn't want to share a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread with him and just enjoy life???
B009WUBERW|3.0|Suspend every bit of physics and logic for this moronic shootem up.  If you need to zone out for awhile it is a great movie.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Loads of fun when you need to waste some time challenge but I have gone many levels yet but I hope there are lots and lots
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The BEST! McConaughey's best movie yet! I was skeptical as the movie had a slow start, but that was to build the characters. Lots of very strong characters and a very strong story line.  I also love to guess where a movie is filmed since I live in Louisiana where more movies are being filmed.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|The best flash light I ever owned and always on me as I always have my phone.  A must.  download now :)
B000IZC7WG|3.0|If you loved Vanalla Sky, you will love this character built twisted movie. It really was not a bad movie just be attentive to what is going on & you will not get lost.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I'm a working mom of 50.  I never watch anything...just too busy with life.  Any free time I have I usually read. But one day I heard some coworkers talking about Glee.  They convinced me to watch just 1episode.  I did and now I'm hooked. I really like the music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered this a few days after it was announced.  Due to short supply, I just received it today.  It did take a bit of time to look online to get it working with my router.  Once it was set up, it worked like a charm.  I have read reviews of poor visual quality, dropped syncs, and stuttering video.  I have experienced NONE of those issues.  It plays smoothly, and every android decice in my home connects flawlessly.  It puts the power of real choice back into my TV watching.  When they are easier to fet, I will frab another one for our other set.  Kudos to Goofle!!
B009A9SULS|1.0|I bought a Kobo Mini when they were on sale for around $40 about a month ago.  It was supposed to be for my son and I am just getting around to setting it up.  I have an old Kindle and my husband has a Kindle Touch which I sometimes use.  I had hoped to be able to download more free books on the Kobo, but it is SUCH a pain compared to the Kindle.  If I had paid the full price I would be furious.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  The biggest problem is the \\"touch\\" keys are so unresponsive you have to about jam your finger down and make sure it registers. I could say more but why waste more time.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Found this game very easy and enjoyable to play, I recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games, great fun for all
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so lifelike. It's an awesome app. The horses movement are a lot like real life. Awesome app!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I love this movie. Have watched it at least two dozen times. Never gets old and I'll probably watch it two dozen more times.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I read the book first and saw the movie in theaters. The movie itself is really good, but it's off from the book. I know that no movie can be just like the book. My only complaint is that the digital copy from iTunes can't be viewed from my iPad 2 or iPhone 5. I have started the download from my phone, it takes forever, but that's the only way I can watch it.  Besides that flaw I think this is a good buy.
B0070DQZ86|5.0|Always love the movie. Never can get brought of it. Wish that I could live back.in simpler times like that
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was awesome! One of the very favorite books! Loved the characters and all about the book! Awesome book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The best and easiest game ever, a must have to all puzzle lovers, so recommend this game just get it and try it you will love it. I just keep trying different tools until I solve it. Great time passer.
0060775858|5.0|Who would have thought putting together such simple rhyming words could make for such a great book? The author did and it worked! My 1.5 year old enjoys pointing at the objects in the artwork as we read the book.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Takes me back to my teen years! Can't find anything wrong with it yet! Don't be afraid to give it a try!
B008KHRODG|3.0|I loved David Tennant as the Doctor but by the time we got to the Specials episode I was so done.<br />The doctor is getting whiny and annoying by this point but they had to end it somehow, I suppose.<br /><br />Despite the mediocre review I wouldn't necessarily warn someone against buying the season... not when they collect, but I would strongly suggest watching the episodes on Netflix and then purchasing while the DVD's are cheap. Their not worth straining your budget for.<br /><br />P.S. Loving Matt Smith!  Can't wait to finally get started on Season 7  : D
B00992CF6W|1.0|my survival map got turned to a creative map that is very stupid you should get it they fix it
B00003CXCT|5.0|The box set was in perfect condition for being used I saved 100 dollars from a brand new box set. I bought it as a birthday present, and the funniest thing was it's like they knew....the box set had the coolest tweety bird wrapping on it with the box set in perfect condition.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This has been one of the very best series I've watched. There is always an unexpected twist and even if the storyline isn't what you might WANT, it is drama at its best. It was a series that can be watched more than once because you'll want to go back and see if there were clues you missed when the climax occurs.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Takes me back to the hours and hours spent in the arcade as a teen . Great translation and fast game play.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|i haft to say this was such a great movie. Natalie portman did a spectacular job on the role. Honestly, i couldnt think of any other actress who could have played the part?<br />When it was getting close to the end of the movie, i actually thought she was going to die as she was falling? it was powerful. but until i relized they still had it going when she landed i was like damn! that would have been a great ending to the movie. just showing the actress dieing in the air looking up at the stage lights than right to the credits. to me that would have been great.<br /> Overall, the movie isnt bad at all. i lucked out seeing it in theaters. but, glad i waited till now to watch it. :)
0307749606|5.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors. I enjoy his books and was noat disappointed with this one. I lok forward to each new release.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|This is a great supplemental book to the foundation trilogy.  I now plan on starting more of his books.  Happy reading.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The character development was very good. The author's skill at delving deep into these characters allowed the plot to flow masterfully.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I really think that parents of the Y generation should never change how they raise their children. Kudos to Amy Chua!
0060512806|5.0|If you have some knowledge of military history, programming, and cryptography you'll like it as much as I did.  Else you may find it a bit inaccessible.  His use of language is sometimes unusual and I occasionally found myself stopping to think.  If you think this is a compliment, you'll like it.  Else you won't.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I really like playing this game. I also have many of the fish games including this game on my computer. I really enjoy their assortment.
B006M4F67A|4.0|i like this game a lot. I always want to get a score of 3 stars (complete board in 5 minutes or less) and it provides a good challenge to do that. It has 5 chests. Two of the chests are unlocked in the free app and they have 10 boards each. It costs $.99 to unlock any one of the other 3 chests and they have 10 boards each. I think if you like mahjong games this will be one you will enjoy.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This was the most exciting game to find out how to get to one clue to the next. I really enjoyed this game.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The update made power ups way more expensive & the items much harder to get. So the rooms are almost impossible to complete. Plus I won 32 keys in a free daily spin but it never gave me the keys. I sent the information to support but they never responded & I don't think support even exists. Poor!!!!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|The Mothership Returns (2CD/DVD) Where do I begin Return To Forever in my opinion the greatest band ever so much talent in one place is mind blowing
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My six year old daughter loves this movie!  Very cute, and clean.  The music is catchy - my husband and I know all the words too!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I am enjoying this game, very relaxing & Zen-like.  Encourages me to improve score by thinking out of box moves aiming perfection without stressing.  I was severely disabled over 14 years ago and was bed ridden, lack of interaction, meds, enormous stress and anxiety, as a result short term memory and disorganized thoughts have afflicted me.  I am searching for fun yet effective brain games.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|If your reading this don't install it. I mean it's really cool to play with people all around the world but each.time you play you pay this wierd coins wicth you only get in a hour.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I know a book is good when I can't feel the time passing by and my reality turns into that which is in the book. John Green is a wonderful author. He wrote about things that were so real and meaningful. I laughed and cried and I fell in love with The Fault in our Stars. I can easily say it's on my favorites list. Highly recommended.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Well done and highly addictive. Keep finding myself playing longer than I should. You should pick this up, a great time killer.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this book! I read the entire series twice and I have to say the first book is my favorite!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This book just sucks you in. The layers of this story seems to be getting more and more. I.'ve been engaged in the story of a younger ; both, but now the present is starting to get forced to the front. Simply amazing,can't wait for the next book.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This is great. If you like Minecraft PE, then you'll love this. This game is a lot like Minecraft, but it's not a clone, this seems a lot more lifelike, and is way easier to play on a Kindle. I give the demo a 4, and I'll probably give the full version a 5!!!
B004IWR06S|4.0|Some movies to individuals are hits, for others they are \\"walkways.\\"  \\"Hereafter\\" is one story that may touch others in many different ways.  It may touch one closely where it delves deeply into characters as they try to address the pain in their lives.  To many, it might be slow and goes nowhere.  To me, if you take the time and view the story carefully, it may be your own trip to introspection helping you realize your own inner strength and why I think it is a great story.<br /><br />If you seek the big scare, the
B002MC9H8K|5.0|I love this book. I first read it when I was a young woman. I have reread it several times. It is well written and the story line is wonderful. Sometimes growing up is hard, however books are always a comfort.
B0028MBKVG|2.0|This book is for a speciality audience that is interested in the minute details of running - not for the casual reader.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|my husband uses this app more than I do and the one thing that I constantly hear is how A LOT of the listings are not up to date compared to what he can find by going online.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this.  Don't know about the ads yet but a lot of games have them.  I'm just tickled with the Retro undertones of this game...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|use it everyday not just for weather, but earning mpoints as well and redeeming them for gift cards. The updated version isn't as great as the original but if you're just now downloading it then you'll never know the difference.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game. Awesome graphics, tons of mods, really fun. It gets updates all the time, so right when you're starting to get bored with it, bam! Something new is added. My only complaint is that the latest updates have added the minecraft realms, which I was excited to see what it was, but it's never working! The same message keeps popping up when I go to play on it. But they say that soon it will be fixed, and mojang is usually pretty good about their games, so this part of the review probably wont apply for very long. My advice: if you have the money to be spending on this app, BUY THE APP! It has given me hours of entertainment. I think it was definitely money well spent.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Its great for having on the go, but i only gave it 4 stars because when my tablet is turned a certain way, certain buttons won't work and you have keep moving the thing around! gets annoying after a while
0786956291|5.0|My husband and i decided to start our own D&D night. We had some experienced members and some beginners. Although this product helped the beginners it didnt really do much for the more experienced members whom wanted to create there own characters from scratch. With this you don't really need a dungeon master..it just does it for you. Its already set up with a particular story. So if you're a beginner or simply want to pick up and play then this is perfect for you
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I sell a lot of things on ebay, and this app is just as good as going online and doing it there. Granted its not exactly the same, but it has its own layout and features that make just as accessible and easy to use for anything ebay related
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A brilliant book: written by a brilliant man about a brilliant man.<br /><br />I admire both these people for their creativity and inspiration.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Takes a little while to get the money flowing to really get some dinosaurs. but overall its pretty fun. Would recommend this game to fans of dinosaurs or Jurassic Park.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was kind of leery about this product but after using it for couple of days, it is very impressive.  I have smart TV and blueray players with Google TV but Chromecast makes those things obsolete.  The interface of Youtube and Netflex is so effortless.  The Chromecast uses your WIFI to stream Youtube and Netflix.  I have no lag issues.  Watching Netflix and Youtube have never been so easy and fun.  Stopping and changing content with your IPad or smartphones.<br /><br />This is a must-buy product for all households.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a very good block simulation game I really enjoy this game I love you mojang!!!!! please buy this!
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Nothing prepared me for this read.  It was the physical representation of the thoughts in my mind,  but organized and effective without being a lecture.  Sheryl Sandberg is amazing, and writes with ease.  I felt like i was having a discussion, a frank sharing of experiences,  with some very intelligent girlfriends!  No matter what you want to do, this book is a must read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show and it's  even better watching it on Amazon and be able to watch it continuously without commercial interruptions.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Orphan Black is simply one of the best first seasons I can ever remember seeing from a tv show, especially on an unproven cable network like BBC America. Tatiana Maslany's performances pull together a great cast of characters and some excellent writing into a truly extraordinary experience. Definitely worth owning (and rewatching frequently) for any TV fan.<br /><br />My only complaint is the rather sparse extras. All but two of the interviews/featurettes included here were originally available from other sources either televised or online. I would have liked more exclusive content, and an episode commentary or two would have been fantastic. However, the overall quality of the show is so high I can't bring myself to take off a star for lack of additional features.
0671777068|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd<br /><br />The narrator, James Sheppard M.D., tells about the little village of King's Abbot. Widow Ferrars died in her sleep from an overdose of veronal, a drug to induce sleep. Her husband died a year earlier - gossip said he was poisoned. Roger Ackroyd, an immensely rich manufacturer had thoughts of marrying widow Ferrars (they would be richer). Ackroyd was a widower without a child (Chapter 2), and lived in a mansion with relatives and servants. There is a new arrival, a stranger named Hercule Poirot. Conversations tell about the people and personalities. Later Dr. Sheppard visits Roger Ackroyd. A letter from Mrs. Ferrars brings shocking news: she poisoned her husband and was being blackmailed! Dr. Sheppard leaves Ackroyd and returns home. Later a telephone call sends him back to find Ackroyd was murdered! The police are summoned, and Poirot begins his parallel investigation. The chapters tell of the investigative procedure. Everyone connected has something to hide, and Poirot (aided by Dr. Sheppard) finds out what the secrets are.<br /><br />The usual convention is to plant little clues throughout the story so an attentive reader can figure out the mystery before the last chapters. Did you? The first time I read this book I had a hunch, but it seemed crazy. Is the first clue in Chapter 3? Is there another in Chapter 17 or Chapter 24? As the suspects are eliminated who will be left? Were you shocked and surprised at the conclusion? Christie examined the fictional lives of the upper class in a small English village. Do the sins of Ralph and Flora reflect the morals of the aristocracy? Are they like the people in a TV show? Fiction must reflect reality to be believable. Reading this again after forty years I noticed the feminine characteristics of the killer. Was this symbolic for a personality that could not be mentioned? This was not her first novel but the one that made her famous. Afterwards she disappeared for a number of days. Personal problems? Mary Roberts Rinehart famous earlier novel \\"The Bat\\" had a similar plot.<br /><br />The lifestyles described here were damaged by the Great Depression, and mostly killed off by WW II. Inflation has made the monetary figures far out of date. They had automobiles and telephones, but no radio [electricity?]. The comments about coldness say there was no central heating. Do the marriages without children have some hidden meaning? Or merely a way to simplify the story? There is one problem in this story. How did the killer know beforehand that an alibi was needed for the murder?<br />There is one problem in this story. How did the killer know beforehand that an alibi was needed for the murder?

1451678193|5.0|There are some books that defy classification -- they slip from the clenched fists of genre's restrictive grasps, and seem almost above critique.  Their sums are greater and longer lasting, more impactful than their parts.  They represent some of the best of what the human mind can create, and remain strangely timeless despite the fact that science or culture may surpass their literal truths.<br /><br /> The Martian Chronicles is one such book.  Famously referred to by author Ray Bradbury as \\"a book of stories pretending to be a novel\\", the disparate parts somehow come together to form something more than a novel.  Like Tolkien's war of the ring, this story of the settlement of Mars and its aftermath  transcends genre-fiction and somehow becomes more like fictional history -- or, in this case, a cautionary fable.<br /><br /> Throughout these stories, the reader encounters themes of xenophobia, imperialism, censorship, war, and racism (though the story dealing with this most directly, \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\", where, back on Earth, all black people decide to emigrate to Mars, is stupidly cut from many of the later editions). Although Bradbury tends to stick to these broad strokes throughout, rather than focusing on individual characters, there are also stories that chronicle the more personal struggles of violence, fear, loneliness, and isolation.  Yet somehow it never manages to get mired down in its own bleak moralizing.  Bradbury knows when to apply a light touch, and it never feels as if he is lecturing or proselytizing.  In fact, sometimes the tone of the book, while sometimes drifting into Bradbury's trademark syrupy and sentimental nostalgia, sometimes swings unexpectedly into the other extreme, describing deaths, plague, genocide, and near-extinction with an irreverent, almost flippant tone.  It's a harsh dichotomy that he employs to great effect throughout these stories.  Although Bradbury had one time said, of  Kurt Vonnegut, \\"He couldn't see the world the way I see it.  I suppose I'm too much Pollyanna, he was too much Cassandra,\\" and I generally agree with this assessment (Vonnegut could never have written Dandelion Wine, Bradbury could never have written Breakfast of Champions) I think they were occasionally more alike than he realized.<br /><br /> As I said earlier, the sum total of the effect of reading these stories is greater than any individual tale might work as a standalone, but there are definitely some highlights.  \\"The Third Expedition\\", where Martians use their psychic abilities to greet the arriving Earthlings by projecting images of the hometowns of their childhoods and appearing as their long-lost loved ones in order to lure them into a false sense of complacency before killing them would not be out of place in any horror collection.\\"Usher II\\" is a tongue-in-cheek cautionary tale about the dangers of censorship and book burning, where reading the stories of Edgar Allan Poe would literally have saved the lives of several murder victims.  \\"The Silent Towns\\" is a dry tale of gallows humor where the last man on Mars seeks out the last woman, and then runs from her when he realizes she is unattractive. The real emotional punch, though, comes in the last three stories, where we are shown the grim reality of the fact that we have carelessly destroyed not one, but two planets.  In true Bradbury fashion, however -- and perhaps this is his most stark difference when contrasted with Vonnegut -- he leaves us with one last glimmer of hope, in one of the most beautiful ending scenes ever written in a sci-fi novel. Or any novel.<br /><br /> The Martian Chronicles is a mirror -- or rather, a twisted series of funhouse mirrors, showing us the uncomfortable and grotesque images of the worst parts of ourselves stretched and distorted and put under a harsh, glaring light.  Mars is the backdrop, but is largely inconsequential -- its a stage for Bradbury to put our species on display.  Even after the characters and events in these stories start to fade out of your mind, there is something about this work as whole that stays with you for years after reading it.  This will be one of those books that you return to periodically at different stages in your life.  Reading this now in my 20's was a very different experience from reading it as a 12 year old, and I'm sure reading it again in my 30's will bring an even deeper understanding.<br /><br /> In its Hirsohima-inspired penultimate story, \\"There Will Come Soft Rains,\\" Bradbury uses the 1920 poem by Sara Teasdale against a chilling backdrop of a silent post-fallout Earth, and these words sum up Bradbury's message here far better than I ever could.  Rating: A<br /><br />There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,<br />And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br />And frogs in the pools, singing at night,<br />And wild plum trees in tremulous white,<br />Robins will wear their feathery fire,<br />Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br />And not one will know of the war, not one<br />Will care at last when it is done.<br />Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,<br />If mankind perished utterly;<br />And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,<br />Would scarcely know that we were gone.vents in these stories start to fade out of your mind, there is something about this work as whole that stays with you for years after reading it.

B00821OX98|3.0|Interesting premise, likable characters, and decent acting make this show entertaining despite mediocre writing. Do the main characters always have to play out the obvious roles? The precocious likable kid, the strong father figure, two young people acting out a love interest and always in danger, we've already seen all these characters in other shows and movies. All season I kept hoping that the writers would come up with something original.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoy the game. Huge fan of hidden object games. All of the G5 apps I enjoy playing as well. Thanks.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When I first received the mouse I felt like I messed up because I was used to using a cheap mouse with a different feel. Initially I hated the mouse because I was used to a different feel for a mouse and I simply could not get a good feel for the mouse. Now that I'm used to the mouse, it feels perfect and the buttons are placed excellently. The Gui is easy to use and you're probably going to have to tinker with it until you find what's perfect for you.<br /><br />Tips: Use a mouse pad and if you're right handed, only place the weights on the right side. When I had all the weights in, the mouse felt unbalanced but with only 4 on the right side it feels perfect.<br /><br />TL;DR, This is a great mouse and I'm glad I bought it. Also stay away from the tron razer mouse, that thing started double clicking after 2 weeks.<br /><br />Edit: 6 Months in the middle mouse button broke. Sucks that I used it to close tabs and it broke when I don't game but I would still recommend the mouse.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is absolutely nothing like the movie and I'm alright with that.  It takes place after the movie.  Highly recommend.
B006QKKICS|4.0|Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik \\"Chava\\": I was reading over reviews and this movie IS more shallow in plot and acting than the other Hostel movies. The Hostel concept progression is logical, the other two Hostels had to be taken to the next step. I don't know where Eli Roth was, it was still very grossly entertaining. The producers had to up the ante for torture saturated watchers with made-to-order, sadistic/snuff 'plays behind glass'. This all for the enjoyment of an audience of vile, salivating, psychopathic aristocrats (I would love to have seen them get their debut on the snuff stage). I thought a guy's face being peeled off while he was alive was horrific enough, I think other reviewers found it to be G-rated fare, God help us what they think is 'over the top'. This is entertaining and delivers. A good ironic statement on what Vegas does to people anyway. 4 stars for 'this is quite good for a third installment of a horror snuff sequel'. Now where is this number 4 installment I heard about??
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the game is so good for me and my mom she du not know how to play<br />I love it
0763635383|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite book. She can listen to it five times a day. Maybe it's because I work and the mommy owl works and then comes home. For whatever reason, this book is a favorite and provides comfort when it's needed.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Too difficult for my 5-year old granddaughter, but it is probably good for older kids.  They have to be able to read.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved this book!  It is such a great blend of fairy tale & sci-fi fantasy, AND it is well written!  The Characters were complex and realistic, quirky & fun! It has everything, Compelling premise, Budding romance, Action, suspense, and Witty, humor, and it is Clean!! (No swearing & sex!) That is so hard to find sometimes, something clean AND well written And Funny, but Meyer did it, & I can't wait for the rest of her books to come out!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I did not want this book to end. I love this author's writing. There is so much depth to the book and characters.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I watched the 1st season in a day or two. I loved every moment and found myself mourning that it was over. I debated buying the book for fear of being disappointed. I am reading it now- there is no disappointment to be found. The writing  creates the same awesome world in which I had missed living. I will be sorry to finish the book. Anymore from this author???
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game over all just like the classic reminds me of original but better so if you. Like the original game you will like this
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's inexpensive and there's a lot of potential, but the fact is that I have about a million other devices that do exactly what the Chromecast does. For people who are full on Android, I think it makes a lot of sense. If you've iOS or Mac and already have an Apple TV, it doesn't add anything new.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Fantastic versions of John's music. My mom and I keep fighting over the CD, ;) . Great idea, thanks for the great music John!
B004VFK5LO|5.0|Pure adrenaline...I love this type of movies which are fast paced, have several twists and feature a great set of actors/actresses.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Strong performance from a strong performer. He reminds me of Gary Moore (whose &#34;Midnight Blues&#34; is tastefully covered on this DVD), Clapton and Kossoff. His guitar playing and singing remains powerful and inspiring. His guest singers (including Paul Rodgers from Free/Bad Company, Beth Hart-his part time collaborator, and John Hiatt- whose songs he often covers). Great stuff, highly recommend this album for those who like EC, Gary Moore, or Paul Kossoff. Keep on rockin' Joe!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome i love all the new updates i like going to creative to sirvivle and (all the creats)
B0033AX1YG|5.0|Great CD and DVD's. The versions, common and rare, show Gary at his best. Whether it is rockin' out or going bluesy, his guitar prowess is hard to deny. The CD seems to contain, in my view, the best versions of the songs presented on the DVD's. Would recommend for Gary Moore fans!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy the game; sometimes I get hung up and can't stop playing! The only time I don't play is when I do not have my kindle with me.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Some of the games could have had better directions, but otherwise found it enjoyable. Pretty easy. Good for killing time.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Loved it.it was great my child enjoyed the movie so much we watched ot three times in a row .
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a good experience for a family to enjoy. building a city &amp; a future<br />looking forward to what's next
B000069I1C|4.0|I saw this on tv and wasn't expecting too much from it.  Found myself laughing (along with my Dad) which was a nice surprise for both of us.  Purchased this for him since he mentioned it was worth seeing again.
0755322819|5.0|Considering who Gaiman is, I decided to give him another try. I wasn't such a fan of Ocean, but  American Gods seemed like a deeper story and something I could appreciate. I'm glad I went with it, because it was amazing.<br /><br />This is the type of book that you can find something new with each reading. The fact that a Brit could land on our shores and so perfectly capture the spirit of America is astounding. The story is magical and the writing near perfect--to the point where it made me feel inadequate as a writer (and that's a good thing). Gaimain's research, passion, and creativity shine through from cover-to-cover.<br /><br />Perfection isn't without its faults. There were a few parts, or side stories, that were tied to ancient mythology. I didn't understand how some of these stories tied into the main story, but this could be due to my own lack of knowledge on the subject or something that would make more sense in a second reading.<br /><br />Overall, there are many things that I can look back at and appreciate: Lots of deep meaning; lots of good story.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Ads after ever game...very annoying. But the game runs just as well as any other and it gives a lot of options.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|There needs to be 6 stars! I felt as if I was the mayor/batman of Gotham city, defending in the name of everything justice!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Played flash version of this before and so I know it's been ripped off. I was expecting there to be a quality settings option but there was none.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really a fun game to play! It helps me pass the time when I am bored. Fun for many different types of people. My brother also likes this game!
B006UN3FTY|5.0|These stories are perfect for bedtime.  Even with a sometimes sleepy audience, I never wanted to put down my kindle, and would frequently chuckle through passages enough to jolt my listeners awake.  This will be read again and again!
B000HKYOK0|4.0|You have to love the creativity of the original star trek.  It actually has some super creative storylines and themes each episode.  Almost every episode sees the captain Kirk and Mr. Spock tackling some very dramatic moral issues we don't see dealt with a lot today.  Of course, as it was made in the 1960's, the special effects are antiquated.  However, if you can appreciate how great they were at the time, it is wonderful.
0385523394|4.0|My main motivation in reading the book was that my wife and I enjoyed the first season of the same titled show. After reading this book, I don't know if I can go back and watch the very fictionalized depiction of what Piper Kerman (Chapman) went through. I understand the changes that are necessary when switching from different mediums, but the tone the series has built in the first season seems to be pulling so far from the messages and lessons that the author gained and passed on to her readers that I am not sure if I would feel the same watching it if they don't tackle some of the issues that are addressed in the book in a serious and real way and not just go for shock or ratings grabbing antics.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The plot was interesting, but spoiler alert...I knew they were clones for the early scenes. For such a hyped movie, it was only fair. Of course...Tom Cruise was good, but that scientology stuff is always in the back of my mind whenever I see him.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Very nice music. very exciting, energy,and New. I saw them live then bought the CD. worth every penny. cant wait for the next.
B004NELBPC|5.0|So happy this app exists. I used to read the New York Times Sunday Edition, but they no longer offer it without a subscription for all week. We don't need weeks of NYT when you have this app...and it updates throughout the day. At least I can get my sunday paper through the Washington Post.
0061122416|4.0|I purchased this novel for summer reading purposes. My son didn't like the outcome but it was an easy read.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great game while at the doctor or setting around with nothing to do while just wanting to burn a little time
B0066NA8CU|5.0|I came just across the title and looks intriguing. Checked the synopsis in wikipedia and I got interested! Watched the pilot episode and can't stop watching the rest of the episodes! I love the plot and that there are twists in the stories. There are many mysteries that I could not wait to be unveiled!
B001H9MWW2|5.0|The CD came just as expected, and with both CD's.<br />Also, just to forewarn people; the case to it is more like a vinyl's case. Not like a plastic one.

1577311523|5.0|I was so impressed by this book that I have bought 10 more copies for friends and family.  Some people are having epiphanies from reading it.  It's not for everybody.  You have to be ready for it.  I certainly was.  Eckhart saved my life.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|I bought Joni Mitchell's first album as a high school student the year it came out. I bought the second, the third, the fourth, and the fifth. Listened to Court and Spark a bit in college but passed on all of the others and had not paid much attention to her work since the mid-70's. My sister had a copy of Hissing of Summer Lawns but it didn't appeal to me at the time. Recently on Spotify I listened to HIssing of Summer Lawns, Hejira, Don Juan's Reckless Daughter and MIngus (along with the earlier albums) and watched a recent interview in connection with her 70th birthday celebration which really helped put her whole career in context.  Those albums are for the most part so dramatically different from what preceded them that it's easy to see why some of us could not digest them at the time. Listening to them now, I can see in hindsight how far ahead of her time Joni Mitchell really was. (I've listened to some of the later ones and there's good work there as well, but haven't decided on whether to purchase any of those.)T<br /><br />his is brilliant work, esssential in my opinion. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter for my money is the most amazing of the bunch, although I find myself listening to Blue and to the first album (somehow renamed &#34;Song to a Seagull&#34; although it was originally just &#34;Joni MItchell&#34;) quite a lot and I agree with Joni's assessment that the first album was mature work, just different from the later stuff.<br /><br />Although I already had several of these albums on CD, the package turned out to be a better bargain even if you just want half of them than buying them individually. Comparing quality against price this is the best deal around.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I use Roku and Apple TV for streaming video and both work well though each has limitations. The Chromecast is a direct competitor at about 1/3rd the cost but unfortunately you get about 1/3rd of the viewing options also. As I was viewing the Chromecast setup video it stated that \\"more apps were on the way\\" and that kind of tells you what to expect. It does offer Netflx and YTube  and Google Play but does not offer Amazon instant vision or access to your local cable provider (I have Time Warner and the Roku app is outstanding). Of the 3 options I prefer Roku, Apple TV then the Chromecast in that order. Since either Apple TV or Roku are offered at a very moderate cost, I recommend either one over this initial version of Chromecast. It will unquestionably get better but right now its Not Ready for Prime Time.<br /><br />Some additional updates:<br />Several reviews indicate the video quality is substandard and that is clearly the case for me. I've tried the Chromecast at 2 separate locations and in each case the quality is not as good as either my Apple TV or the Roku. Additionally at one location the Chromecast stops every 5 minutes or so to load more streaming, this is clearly not acceptable. Again neither the Roku or Apple TV have ever had any problem with quality or maintaining a steady stream. I am seriously considering returning the unit to Amazon and I have down graded my rating to 2 stars.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|UPDATE 9/14/2013 CHANED FROM 5 TO 1 STAR DUE TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCT - STILL A GREAT SHOW THOUGH :/ UPDATE 09/11/2013  It's a shame that the quality of the blu-ray encoding is not that great.  Unfortunately, I am returning it and ordering the DVD version.  I was fortunate enough to see this concert live from the \\"Golden Triangle\\"!  I have seen this concert on EPIX and it amazingly translates to video brilliantly!  My favorites are \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Vogue\\" \\"I'm Addicted\\" \\"Like A Prayer\\" \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Celebration\\"!  Madonna puts on a concert like no other!  Enjoy!
B005LAIH54|5.0|It was very good DVD without any scratch . Tht I am so grateful  with it and I thanks u for being honest about DVD .
B000FC146C|5.0|I had difficulty in putting this book down to either sleep or eat. The characters became so real you have the feeling they are alive and you suffer with them when they are hurting and hate them when they are mean or selfish. A true work of art.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Hosseini captures the atmosphere and cultural boundaries that define growing up on a small Greek island and in Afghanistan.  It's a masterful tale told from the perspective of three generations whose lives are intertwined.  Hosseini's observations on the culture shock that one experiences returning to the United States from a developing country like Afghanistan will resonate with anyone who has worked or volunteered overseas.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun little game that makes a great time killer.  It's really just a modern interpretation of the old classic missle command.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter first saw the movie on disney and loved it. Turns out it was a hit for the whole family as it was a move we all could gather around to watch together. Ages 6 - 60 all enjoyed the movie and were happy to see the added scenes.
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|Not much can be said about this recording that hasn't already been said. Having listened to early releases of this album I would say, being a live performance, it left a little to be desired in terms of recording quality. Having listened to this release I've changed my mind. The sound quality is so improved I find my self enjoying the entire album from beginning to end. I definetly reccommend it.
159463176X|2.0|The first part of the book was captivating - if it had ended at page 131 then I would have given it four stars.<br /><br />But alas, it went on for another 270 pages with disconnected people and stories, only coming back to the original characters at the very end. The middle characters were hard to connect with and the stories were confusing.<br /><br />I loved his other books, this one was hard to love.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Well worth 99 cents, very entertaining, good for hand eye coordination Lost a star due to not so great graphics, but they aren't bad.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|So far so good although it is paying for reviews so I take off for that. It is a small game that could do so much.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love the action and adventure of this book! It's by far the most thrilling of the series! Capture yourself in yet another great book of Percy Jackson!

B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I thought this would be a great action movie. I was disappointed. I could not figure out who the good guys was vs the bad guys. Finally about half through, figured who was who. However the action was so unreal, I could not believe it. Sorry I wasted my time. Looking for something like 24 or The Shield or Lost or Prison Break. Guess good movies now a days are a thing of the past. Glad to hear new 24 in production for next year. Even the actors in here leave no impression.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Hilarious, touching, nostalgic.  Excellent film for kids and adults alike, like most Pixar movies.  I'm gonna wreck it! ! !
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the characters and story lines.  Also love the history intermingled in the story line.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B00CMQX84A|5.0|This is a great movie. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Are there gonna be anymore in production soon???????<br />Woulld be great to have remake of some movies with Ross Lynch and the rest of the cast.
B000FC130E|4.0|A lovely change of pace. Nice fantasy world with well developed characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I'm looking forward to reading more of this author's work.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|So much fun. I love the upgrades. great graphics too. the music is OK. Overall great game glad it's free.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|I had the original and this is a good update. There are a lot of good songs that could have been on MCIS on the original release and quite a few new ones on the re-release that could have made it on to TAFH the first time.<br /><br />Shut up and take my money, Billy
B0092MKFIY|4.0|The band Imagine Dragons are very different in their sound.  Each song has its own foot print of sound.  Love the harmony of<br />voices with sound and the lead singer rocks it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I used to love Middle Command. The track ball made it easier but I find the to be just as easy. Got it free but worth 99 cents.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Captivating story with amazing characters. Some characters you will love and some you will hate but you will not want to put it down.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and addicting game. Worth the money if I had to pay for it. Glad its free through daily apps.
B00CXQL828|5.0|What can I tell? Is Richie, Billy and Mike, I mean, Just a hell of a band! I watched them play in their first gig in the U.S. which were at the B.B. Kings bar and grill in NYC! It was awesome!
B002MFV2IK|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite comedies.  You cannot beat the combination of Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, both of whom must have had the time of their lives making this film!  Their on-screen chemistry is delightfully devilish as they go from one hilarious effort at one-upmanship to another in their on-going cosmetically enhanced beauty rivalry and competition for one man's affection.  In the end, their continued 'experiments' in age-regression via cosmetic surgery have the undesired and unintended consequence of interdependence on each other for 'maintenance.'  I won't say anymore lest I spoil it for anyone who has not yet seen this movie.  I owned this one in VHS format years ago and I'm thrilled that it is available on DVD today.
B0063GORYU|5.0|excellent product for kindle fire, easy to play, very user friendly although it can be addicting, would recommend for anyone who likes to play solitaire
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I must agree with the negative reviews. I loved the previous weather channel. The new version does suck battery power and the format is irritating. I have decided to uninstall it from my kindle fire HD.
0393061310|2.0|This book would be ok if it was about half the number of pages, it is way to long and goes all over the place. I am convinced that the author, Jared Diamond is not normal so he goes to Africa.
B003XDZN8A|3.0|This shoe was rated highly and my podiatrist suggested the brand so I gave it a go. It was a disappointment. One turn around the living room and I decided to send them back.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Okay so let me just say that when I first read the first book I wasn't so intrigued in reading further just because there's so much repetition. But it gets ADDICTING! And I found the series pretty enjoyable to read! I got a little sad when I finished reading this book...but I definitely look forward to seeing the movie coming on the big screen! And do hope that Ian Somerhalder gets to play Christian Grey:)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's a great time sink. I play it in my down time when I'm out of the house. It's simple and a great take on a classic.
1563523302|5.0|I read this books some years ago and recently purchased another to give to my grandson. It gives a great perspective on how people become wealthy and stay that way.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved this movie so much, that I sent a DVD of it to my boyfriend.  He loved it too.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Good movie. I had trouble trying to figure out where it was going and what the subject matter really was in the beginning. I will watch anything Denzel is in. If the movie isn't that good, his part usually is.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I cannot recall the name of the &#34;original&#34; version but I do remember what I remember to be a foreign version of this same movie that was virtually identical except for the actors of course.<br />I had a great time watching the movie and enjoyed it immensely. Tom Cruise can make a pretty good movie on occasion and this is one of those occasions.<br />I highly recommend this movie to any Sci-Fi enthusiast......or to anyone that enjoys a good action flick. A big plus is that the women in the film are HOT!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great nostalgia fun and easy to play.  My kids think it's hysterical.  We've been having a great time trying to beat each other's scores
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it so much I ordered the soundtrack the same day then the movie when it was available for pre-order.. When I watched it the second time I was just impressed by the story and the deep meaning of &#34;Jack Harper's&#34; quest to understand what's going on and why he so different.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent lawyer show balanced with excellent drama.  The characters are fantastic and the storylines are often relevant to current events.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|If your on the market for a gaming mouse and your a budge gamer like myself, this mouse wont disappoint. The mouse is very comfortable and fits the hand supremely. My accuracy and control in fps have improved, along with my KDR ;)<br /><br />I have one gripe. The wheel takes some getting used to, I dont know if it was designed low profile on purpose, but I find myself rolling the wheel with the inside of my middle finger where im used to using the tip of my middle finger.<br /><br />Minor note: It wasnt hard to find the drivers but my mouse didnt come with any driver cd.<br /><br />Update: Mouse still running strong. I think its starting to get into that sweet spot phase, where all the new mouse kinks are polishing themselves out. Still very pleased.
B00DU74U74|2.0|This book was awesome! I loved it and i couldnt wait until the movie came out. I know the book is always better than the movie, however, The acting was poor and they condensed it so much to fit into a movie that they missed a lot! I was not even close to pleased with this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|i have high speed internet (38 down and 10 up) over wifi and the video was going in and out of HD and the audio and video didnt match up. i even took it to my parents and had the same issues. everytime i took it out of the tv it was burning hot to the touch.
1591396190|4.0|A recommended reading for CEOs struggling in a competitive environment, mature markets, many competitors, declining profits and the like. Do you know anything about? The basic idea is: stop looking at the benchmarks; stop fighting for small incremental advantages... be brave and invent a really new business, find a vaste a blue ocean where you are alone offering you valuable stuff.  It seems a tale, but the authors demonstrate it could work, as it did in many occasions. There is a theory behind and a sound practice, explained. It was written seven years ago, but ir is still interesting. A good book, I would recommend.<br /><br />Carlo
B00BKTFABE|3.0|I like it but all of a sudden every time I try to use the video it says camera has stopped
0142421715|3.0|This 2nd installment in the trilogy isn't a rivoting as the first, but still kept my interest as now I'm vested<br />I'm looking forward to reading the last book, Reached.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Love this game. Easy to figure out and easy to get hooked. Would highly recommend you give this a shot!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|If you are expecting a blockbuster action film, this is not it.  If you love thoughtful character development, beautiful cinematography, and coming of age stories, this if for you.  As mentioned by another reviewer, the story largely follows the development of Ellis as he grapples with issues of love, trust, and commitment.  Ellis' character is charming and wonderfully played.  Overall I was impressed with the acting in this film, with the exception of Reese Witherspoon who I often find mediocre at best.  Worth a watch if you enjoy more artistic and thoughtful films.
B009C7JS14|5.0|grest info when i need to plan my week!mskes it eady to have a great day! love it every one needs yo get this app
B00CL68BK2|5.0|The acting is top-notch, and makes you really fall in love with all of the characters in all of their quirkiness.  The plot line follows a nice progression while also dropping in unexpected moments.  Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Do not miss this one.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a good way to pass the time away.Love to play. Get aggravated sometimes on the daily tournament.Go on an try it. You won't regret it.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|The quality of the contents (before my purchase) was never a concern...and I was not disappointed, after I downloaded.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the software that allows a person to speak to the dictionary, rather than have to use a keyboard...exponentially better than my experiences with the Dragon software voice recognition product.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Loving this device!  Basically, if you are looking for an easy way to get Netflix to your TV set (without having to go through an Xbox (pay wall $/month), ps4, or a kludgy blue-ray player), this is it.<br /><br />This solves a big problem in our house, as we got tired of paying extra $ each month for Xbox live just so we could get to the Netflix app on the device.  Plus the Xbox has an incredibly kludgy interface, patches galore (my time is theirs to waste), and the Netflix app at our house takes two or three tries before it will actually work.<br /><br />We also tried Netflix through a Sony blue ray player, but man is it slow (and has another really kludgy interface.<br /><br />It's only $35, and connects via the HDMI port.  It needs power, so if your TV has a USB port, you can hook it in there, otherwise you'll need to run it to wall power (all connectors included).<br /><br />You also need a wireless router in the house.  The router must have internet access.  You'll also need a computer with a wireless connection to that router to set up the chromecast (which is very simple).  Once it is set up, you can then stream Netflix (YouTube, and chrome) to your TV.  You control the chromecast through remote devices like iOS (iPhone, iPad), android, or pc (via chrome).  Basically, you load up Netflix, and then select something to watch, and where to watch it.  Once you select the chromecast, it will send the movie to your TV.  All standard controls (stop, pause, rewind, etc.) are on the remote device.  The remote device isn't actually streaming the movie, so it can be used for other things.<br /><br />There are a few possible issues that might affect you:<br /><br />1) The unit is completely self-contained, so if you want to output the audio to a stereo system, you're going to have to see if you can do that through your TV.  I haven't tried this yet (my TV only has L/R audio out), and the HDMI standard may not even let you run analog audio out.  If you try this, let me know.<br /><br />2) There is no HDMI pass-through, so if you are already using the HDMI port for something else (cable input, whatever), then you'll have to have another free HDMI port on the TV, or get an HDMI muxer of some kind.<br /><br />3) If you do get an HDMI muxer that has auto-switch capability it probably won't auto-switch.  Auto-switching muxers try to automatically change the input source to the first available \\"ON\\" unit in a series.  This is supposed to prevent you having to manually switch between inputs.  However, this only works if devices truly shut off their HDMI output to the TV.  I don't think the chromecast ever turns off, so it will always appear to be on.  If your other HDMI device(s) do fully turn off, you should be ok.  For us, we have chromecast + Dish, and both devices are always sending a signal to the TV, so the auto-switch muxer we have has to have its input manually changed.<br /><br />4) You need a fair bit of room for this thing to fit on the HDMI port.  It sticks out about 2 1/2\\" from the port.  The power port is on the back of the unit, and requires at least another 1-2\\" inches of clearance.  So if you've got your TV mounted flush up against a wall and your TV HDMI port is on the back, you might have clearance issues.  If the HDMI port is on the side of the TV, you might see the chromecast unit+cables sticking out.<br /><br />5) Not sure if the Netflix stream is high definition or not - haven't really checked into that.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun free game graphics are good and gameplay is fun just hate you have to spend money for points other then that nothing bad to say.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Beautiful storyline like a romantic saga come to life.  The characters, the scenery, the timeline are wonderful. Th acting is terrific.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game was a great deal and it will keep you hooked for a while. I like that the difficulty increases as you progress through the game.
0671004107|4.0|I just read this book on a whim after seeing the movie a dozen times over the years.  I expected quite a few differences, and the book delivered.  On one hand, I found much of the tangential character development and background to be dense and only mildly interesting, the main exception being the Hadden character, who is far more complex and interesting in the book.  I genuinely wanted to know more about him.  On the other hand, by the end, the complicated context of the book had merit beyond displaying Sagan's talent for background research.  The end of the book is significantly more satisfying, and dare I say spiritually fulfilling than the movie ending.  I loved, loved, loved the way the book ends.<br /><br />Reading the book actually made me appreciate the movie in a whole new way, and the writers in particular.  The book in its original form would make a terrible movie.  I really wonder why they didn't incorporate more of the book ending though.  Makes me wonder what was left on the cutting room floor and/or inked out.<br /><br />This book is worth reading, and worth sticking it out through the first 3/4 to get to the action at the end.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I got this for my 4 year old grandson who wanted to play on my Kindle. I find myself doodling on it too. He loves the stickers and stampers. I love all the colors.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very happy to see some of the old games coming back around. Plays well, easy to understand the &quot;how to' s&quot; fast, points to upgrade missiles. More of the old games, please...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've read this twice in paperback and enjoy it still on my third reading. I love the story from a dog's point of view but it is a good read even if you don't love dogs.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Is this story. Based on a real high jacking at sea? Wonderful spy story and hard to put down read it.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I have nothing to compare it to, but it is what I was looking for, as far as ease of use. It does have a lot of &#34;toots, horns or whistles&#34; and that was what I was looking for. Something simple and easy to access.
B0050XFY4O|2.0|Characters are too sweet.  No conflict in their relationship at all.  Never an argument between the two main guys.  Could not relate to the lack of strife in their life.  The mother plays the role very well, excellent acting overall.  I just didn't think the script was compelling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i have enjoyed this fun little game...i thought it would be more for little kids but it has proven to be quite enjoyable
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's okay fun time yeah!<br />I play with! Good yes! It makes! Good for happy! :-)<br />Sometimes I dad and tree. I play fun so good!
0380807343|5.0|This book was great! It was a horrorIFIC adventure and so different from any other book! This is truly an original like no other!
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|Entertaining but kind of more of the same from season one. A bit difficult to believe the main plot- would he really get that far without a law degree?
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Perfect application for all ages. So addictive,play with everyone. Best option to kill time. I suggest that everyone download this application.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|OK its an app and its OK the app dose what it suppose to do its free so that's good and it works.
B001LX2J22|5.0|There isn't much I can add to the positive reviews here. Hopkins portrayal of the character is by far the best rendition of Lector that I have seen.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is Fun so far, it has kept a lot of elements from the original, with new features sprinkled on top.
0525478817|5.0|The book mesmerized my daughter, She laughed, she cried.  She gave it a five star rating and said it was a must read.
B00AYLD09I|5.0|My 8-year-old loves this movie.  It does have some scarier scenes which I would not recommend for younger children. But for 8 and up, its a fun movie.
0393327655|5.0|The End of Faith exposes reason's worst enemy religion. Harris gives accounts where religious ideology swims against the currents of science and most importantly human well being.
B00C8RDSWK|5.0|Cute movie.  Not too much violence like some kids movies.  Sweet theme.  Funny and entertaining.  We've watched several times already.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I like that the Rodenberry Ethos is preserved in the newer films.  I hope that the next movie will be something from their 5 year mission.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me strongly of the Atari missile command.<br />Here, you have more options such as upgrade speed or range.<br />You can rebuild what you lost with what you earned in defense.<br />Tested on Kindle, but it doesn't seem to have any sound.<br />Still an excellent game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So far. I'm having a fun time playing it and as.long as ot doesn't have a gazillion bugs them I think it will earn 5 stars
B00280LYHS|5.0|I LOVED this series. When I first started to read the Percy Jackson series I didn't like it since I've seen the movie before so I thought it would be exactly the same as the movie But as I got deeper into the book I couldn't put it down and started to realize I that the book slowly changed the whole story into what Rick really wrote in the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Whole family loves this game including my 4 yr old who is better than me, which is n o t saying much.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down until I finished it which was at 1:30 in the morning.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Very addicting. Just great. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Also,  very awesome. Very super duper awesome. Awesome. Also, very awesome.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Graphics are a lottle sharper but, other then tha the very much the same fun game I played in the 90s.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Easy read - never boring - thought provoking ... and I'll definitely read it again. Well worth reading - great opportunity for discussion.
B005PK553C|5.0|Love this show.  I will continue to obsess over it until it's off the air.  I have to say I totally didn't understand it until I realized I was overanalyzing/overthinking.  LOVE this show.  Season 2 was even better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like the game it is a real challenge which I like  really makes me think things through thank you for the fun
B00CXQL828|5.0|This album is awesome from start to finish. There isn't a bad track on the whole thing. I've been a fan of Kotzen's for years and he shines here. Catchy rockers and soulful ballads make this one a must buy! Get it now!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very good game, runs stable in kindle fire hd. Game gets tough pretty quick so be ready. Gotta get back to playing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Nice games, varied, keeps me occupied. Would recommend to others.  Good for keeping kids entertained too. Glad I saw it.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I am a Sudoku fanatic.  I love this purchase as well as &#34;fall&#34; Sudoku I just recently purchased.  Don't miss both of these!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The friend list doesn't work. You cant add friends and you cant visit other towns yet you need to in order to complete the storyline.<br /><br />The gem prices are horrible and once again you need to use real cash to buy some pony in order to complete story.<br /><br />Game also crashes a lot. A LOT.<br /><br />I'll change my review once they fix the game.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|How did I ever miss this movie when it was in theatres?  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Don't miss out if you haven't already seen it once or twice!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Classic game done right<br /><br />Really enjoy it, launch missiles for a great time<br /><br />Requires speed and a watchful eye, no issues in gameplay
B000XUBFE2|1.0|I am sorry, but I could not get into this book.  It came highly recommended to me, but after 50 pages, I gave up.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|my favorite move for the last four years and i enjoy viewing it over and over, i loved the pie scenes.
B00005JKG5|5.0|A classic,all the dances, music and songs are for always to remember! The handsome guy oooohhhhhh  makes me go back to that year.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|addicting fun free flashback cool get it now got 50 points for this review fun on kindle fire love it
1878424319|5.0|The philosophy in this book is wonderful; we give this to every client that comes our way.  You can't go wrong with a book that gives you four wonderful life concepts!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|One of the best game I have ever played on kindle fire in fact this game is on my top favorite games on kindle fire.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time!!  I love the story, characters, actors, scenery and the music, and would recommend this to everyone.
B00D4ABW82|5.0|We Came As Romans has always put out good positive music. This Album is simply the best. I have listened to it many many times and it's just an incredible experience from start to finish. Stop the hate'in. This Album is priceless.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I loved the movie, and thought I'd enjoy the CD, but I was surprised at how much I love this music.  I'll probably wear it out playing it as often as I do. :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is wonderful.  I have it on both my phone and KindleFire.  It offers enough challenges that it doesn't get boring.  Its perfect for those times you have a couple minutes to kill.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|This as a gift  for my father-in-law and I  feel that I also made my wife a gift. Lve the DVD and the show. The seller sent it fast and I received it in two days.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Had not read Follett  for quite a while, but I  really enjoyed  the action and intrigue set forth in this story. Will recommend this book to several friends.<br />.
B00966TN1Q|2.0|A bit stretched. What I didn't like is the overdose of reference to Jazz and Restaurants. From Michael I want action not all this blah blah about food places; bit TripAdvisor style. Also the daughter, the fiancee... Bosch is getting too soft
B008QTVNUI|1.0|My husband and I just finished watching  the Series &#34;LIFE&#34; with Damian Lewis.  We really liked his character and how well he played the police officer.  We both hated HOMELAND.  To much swearing and way to much sex!! You distracted from the story when you keep showing couples having intercourse.  It was embarrassing.  And Claire Danes character had me so wound up, I thought me or her character would have a break down before the episode ended. It is sad when producers feel they need to show slut or have lots of swearing to make a movie appealing.  I work with the public and you do not hear that type of language,  only the un-educated talk like that. t
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From the beginning, this book had me captured. Loved the character, loved the story, and loved the depth... would recommend this book to anyone.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This was a good game. I had a lot of fun. Brought me back to the nineties. You should play
B00A429YF6|5.0|Almost 30 years old, this movie is timeless and great. It's one you can watch over and over and always see something new.
0060556501|5.0|Great story. Beautiful book. Giving to someone with small children. I read this to my kids but didn't have a book with pictures.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is so fun I feel like the missile shaped hole in my soul has at last been filled in an explosive cloud of glory
B005HSL626|5.0|I think this is the best game ever buy it I know I would which is funny because I already have it
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This man's journey was thought provoking and made me realize we need to nurture our spiritual side and everything will turn out fine.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What else can I say they said thank you and that is all I care about did not ask any more questions
B009IU6N5Y|3.0|Recommended by a friend for the action and told to keep my expectations low. Enjoyed the movie, and thought it was an interesting concept to wrap the life of Abraham Lincoln into a vampire war. Would probably recommend to approve who just wants an action flick to watch.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|What else can I say they said thank you and that is all I care about did not ask any more questions
B000W453KQ|5.0|I like Redford and Striesand. Together they're fabulous. The movie reflects the politics of that era as well as the charm, love and poignancy that two people can share as life moves on. It's one of my favorites and is well worth watching more than once.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A wonderful series with intriguing characters. It is much better than &#34;Elementary&#34;, which I also like but the 1 1/2 hour length allows so much more depth and storyline. The writing is terrific and the actors are spellbinding.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|While this isn't the most thrilling game, it is fun to see your reef grow.  The game does go much much slower if you are not putting money into it.  If you're letting kids play on this, make sure they know not to hit the &#34;buy&#34; button or you could owe a lot of money fast.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the app it's awesome it's worth the money even though it's not full minecraft it's sill good through
B009CG29RK|5.0|We watched this movie during a car ride, and despite a few interruptions, we had a lot of fun watching it.  It's definitely a whole family move.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it wont update. I just uninstalled the game since it wont update and now it is gone forever. thanks a lot for the bug mojang
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It was ok at first and then realized that you couldn't go on to people's channels and search for their videos only. But if you tried all the other ones then this would be your best option.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|Mr. Dawkins has authored many books on this subject. His  pragmatic & scientific approach to evolution v. creationism clearly proposes that one stance does not  refute the other.
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|Norma sung by Callas is seldom out of site. I listen to it over and over. That said, I admit to being an insane Bartoli fan. This NORMA is beautiful, I love Sumi Jo, the instruments glow, the singing dazzles.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is excellent, it's nice to build your own city and it keeps you going all day, never want to put the game down.
1936719118|5.0|Derek Sivers is a genius!  He is an amazing role model to me.  I read everything he writes and find it all extremely helpful and brilliant.  I just wish I had his intellect and focus.  This is a tremendous book and I plan to buy multiple copies for all my friends I think would benefit from it.  Great job Derek!!
B0068OXAM2|4.0|Helped establish a baseline mathematical items needed for the GMAT.  Wish there were more sample questions but overall it was very helpful.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This is the very best book of the series.  There is plenty of detail.  Salander is one amazing woman. Enjoy.
B00BMCAM6M|3.0|I like the app for my kindle fire but why won't the app rotate the display when I rotate the device?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not a bad game.. can be addictive. Reading all other reviews in regards to this app not being safe. Well I can't comment on that, but the itself is fun.
1401223176|2.0|After reading Daredevil: Yellow I had higher expectations for this book.  The book is essentially aimed at twelve year olds, which is fine for what it is.  The story telling is technically precise and the plot it tight, but don't expect any amount of intelligence or depth like you might find in Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Alan Moore or Ed Brubaker's Batman work.  This is just a mindless entertainment product with lots of punching.<br /><br />I really dislike Jim Lee's art style.  Although he is highly detailed (there are lots of lines on the page,) his characters are essentially cartoons.  All of his women are barbies in spandex, and all of his men bodybuilders.  In one of the opening panels, Batman's bicep is approximately twice the size of his head.  With artwork like that, this book could only be a story for children.

B00884GR0W|5.0|I don't know about you guys but this game is very similar to SKYRIM.<br /><br /> I LOVE SKYRIM, RATE If you agree
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It works good for some things and others not so much. I was watching full tv shows when it suddenly and still is only giving me his no more than 8 min long. Why suddenly.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Dumb me! Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb me! All summer I put my faith and hope in the big blockbuster films, the Iron Man 3's and Star Treks of the world. And from Man of Steel to Pacific Rim almost without fail these over budgeted, underwritten explosiony action films left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. Except for World War Z there is not a single movie I've seen this summer that I can truly say was a great film. Some were better than others (Oblivion and Pacific Rim were both pretty good) but considering their competition was Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness that's not saying much. All the while I put off seeing Monsters U for weeks. \\"It looks silly\\" I said, \\"Pixar has lost its mojo\\" the idiot side of my brain insisted. Well, that sure teaches me. I will never doubt Pixar again. Even if they make another mediocre film like Brave, they have more than proven themselves still capable of making a damn good film.<br /><br />Wall E will always be my favorite Pixar film, and Toy Story 2 will always be my second, but fighting for third place for a long time has been Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, the original Toy Story, and Up. That is the kind of company Monsters U is keeping. It does everything right, from delivering plenty incredibly funny moments balanced with the kind of emotionally powerful and heartfelt scenes that have made Pixar a household name. This movie is so funny I chocked on my popcorn. I haven't laughed this hard in a movie since 21 Jump Street. And it wasn't that cheap appeal to the lowest denominator type humor either. There aren't any fart jokes, poop jokes, inside innuendos about sex or drugs. None of that nonsense here. This is good old fashioned honest to God comedy that's drop dead hilariousness and perfectly appropriate for all ages. When you hear kids laughing in the theaters along me, a 24 year old man, you know its comedy gold. It's because the characters carry the story, and when you have a story driven by strong characters you have a good film. Mike and Sully aren't the only ones delivering laughs, as just about everyone gets in on the action.<br /><br />Mike and Sully, much like in the original film, star as the main roles but their relationship isn't quite the same. They start the film as heated rivals: Mike is an underdog overachiever who's devoted his entire life to becoming a scarer despite the fact that he's not even remotely scary, while Sully is the son of a famous scarer who's had everything in life handed to him and makes no effort whatsoever in applying himself. Sully has all the natural skill in the world but none of the motivation or drive to apply himself. Mike on the other hand lacks any sort of natural skill. He isn't scary, he's built like a lovable beach ball, he can't roar, but his drive and motivation makes him able to compete with some of the best scarers on campus. It's very Rudy like in that regard, and though not entirely original the way the story is told is Pixar magic at its finest. And like Rudy it teaches us a very valuable lesson that people of all ages can relate to, that despite ones physical limitations, even of those limitations preclude you from achieving something you've wanted your entire life, with enough hard work, dedication, and the right attitude you can very well succeed at what you wanted, even if it's not quite in the way you imagined. Who can't relate to that? Who here wanted to be an athlete when they grew up but didn't have the physical capability to compete past High School? : raises hand: As adults we've all experienced this at one time or another. You wanted to be an actor, an athlete, a musician, something, but despite your hard work and dedication it was just never meant to be. So I sympathize with Mike, as I imagine most audience members will.<br /><br />At the other end of the spectrum we have Sully, who presents a cool and collected face to the world but is living with the weight of high expectations. His father is a world class scarer, a legend, and so Sully has a lot to live up to. His pedigree makes him blind to his own limitations and the need for improvement while also placing a burden upon him he's terrified of not living up to. He's brash, arrogant, a know it all, but as time goes on and failures pile on top of failures he learns that pedigree is not enough, that without actual effort your natural skills won't mean much of anything. Life won't give you a pass because you are the son of so and so or because you can roar really loud. Eventually you're going to be put to the test, and forced to compete against those of equal or greater natural ability. When that happens it's the ones that apply themselves the most who will succeed. It was great to see Sully's development in this way from hot shot know it all to humble and hardworking individual. I'm telling you there is more depth, growth, and subtlety to these characters then all the summer action films combined. It's not even close.<br /><br />The animation in this film is the best CGI I've ever seen. For the scenes set in our world I would have to remind myself this was an animated movie. There is a scene when Mike and Sully are sitting by a lake with the moon hovering over them that looks like it could have been shot live action. It's that amazing. If not for the cartoon monsters I might not have been able to tell the difference. This applies to the very well made short, The Blue Umbrella that kicks the movie off. Pixar has always been a pioneer for animation but this is their best, more realistic work yet.<br /><br />Monsters U is nothing short of a masterpiece. If this were any other studio I'd present this film as their masterpiece, but along with Japanese Studio Ghibli I don't think any studio has such a consistent level of success with almost every film they make. It's merely one of many dozens of fantastic movies by an amazing studio that deserves to be seen. If you've not seen it yet, make a point to do so. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Replay value: High.s scarer, a legend, and so Sully has a lot to live up to.

1250029465|5.0|Author, James Bowen was a recovering heroin addict....finding Bob saved his life.  James' story really hit home...reminded me so much of my brother and his lifelong struggled with addiction. Then throw in the orange tabby (just like my Abby) and I melted.<br />I was all in.<br /><br />It's a wonderful story...There are some dark places but it goes to show the reality of just how far James and Bob have come.....together.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone....you don't have to be a cat lover to appreciate the struggles and victories of James and Bob.  *High Five*
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|You really have to get into it or it gets boring.  Not as good as I thought it would be, but worth the money.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a fascinating work delving into the historical aspect of Jesus.  The author provides invaluable context by explaining the contemporary times, politics, beliefs and customs in place leading up to and during the time of Jesus, and presents it in a fairly easy to read prose rather than the usual dry format often found in scholarly works.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|What can I say.  Wow. Love the dancing and bodies. O yea the story line was good also.  Great movie to wTch with the girls.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's funny I love it it keeps meh busy it's fun and I really enjoy it so much the for making it

B004RJMUJO|2.0|I know people swear by this game but... it's mindless. make a swiping motion to cut a fruit which is flying through the air. Make a couple swipes to get 2+ pieces... but ... eh.<br />Good for the medium to less intelligent droves of lemmings.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|THE FAULT IN OUR STARS by JOHN GREEN<br /><br />It depends on your perspective really. I have no idea what the story of this book is all about when I decided to start reading it but I'm not disappointed. Not at all. I am writing this right after I finished the beautiful book. Like I said, PERSPECTIVE. You may say that the book is morbid, sad, funny, unfair but I would like to think that it has a very beautiful story about love & life. Yes, it's also funny. The humor is palpable and so is sadness. Even in dying, you can still find a way to joke around and laugh and it's not a bad thing. We all have ways of coping and that means your sanity is still intact.<br /><br />IDK bout you but while reading this book, I have a lot of questions bout life and one is, WHY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE? I know there are Augustus & Hazel out there and maybe have the same situation (or had) but don't you think it's unfair? I mean, I want them to have a good life. There are people in this world who doesn't deserve to live but still they exist. I just don't understand. I don't understand the lesson in it. And I think, I will never will. Not unless God appear in front of me right now and answer my questions.<br /><br />Dying. Death. It's also part of the book. Some (maybe most) people don't like to talk about death because it makes them sad. I don't know what's the difference in grieving if a person you love dies compared to your dog being dead. But from what I experienced from our dog dying last year, it was very exhausting and very, very sad. I know I just compared a person to a dog but I really don't have anything to compare it to. I will never be prepared if my mom or brother dies, no one can be prepared for any of that (I think) but if someone will tell me right now that I will be dead in a month, I will be grateful. Why? It means I still have time to do what I want and to tell the people I love that I love & appreciate them.<br /><br />\\"Grief does not change you. It reveals you.\\"<br /><br />Like Peter Van Houten's An Imperial Affliction, I guess will never know what happened to Hazel after reading Gus' letter. But unlike Hazel (she wants to know the ending of Van Houten's book), in this story, I do not. Obviously, she will die but I'd like to think she died contented. Having to meet the love of her life even in a short time is good enough. I would rather live in a short time knowing I experienced that kind of love & joy with Gus than live long and not have any of it. Yes, it's unfair. Duh. Life is a bitch, haven't you noticed? But what makes life worth living is having all the unexpected things that makes your heart flutter & makes you smile everyday. So yes, life is unfair but it's worth it. And Hazel said, \\"I do\\" and that means she doesn't regret meeting Gus and her decision to love him.<br /><br />\\"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.\\"<br /><br />♥ \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.\\"- Augustus Waters ♥<br /><br />** Also posted on my TUMBLR & GR account
B00640UICA|4.0|So far, I got to &#34;world 4&#34; and have played it a few times. It's extremely easy, which is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars. It's not too difficult where I put it down after 3 levels, and the levels are stepped to get harder as you go. It's a good thinking game, with plenty of time and different strategies. If you like thinking puzzles which aren't based on luck, then this will be a game for you.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|A really great price on the 1st 5 seasons of Big Bang. You can't go wrong. Need I say more?
B00004WQ3A|5.0|Bought it for my boyfriend as a present along with a few other Vinyls. Package came on time and is great.
B0012GMVSU|5.0|I watch Forrest Gump every few years to remind myself of all that I've lived through<br />It stirs so many emotions inside me, especially from the music.<br /> I urge everyone of all ages to watch this movie and understand upfront that they will be learning history from it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|awesome game loved the first 3 modern combat games hope they make another one and one like blackops zombies because that would be awesome. the only downside to this game is when I have to wait a long time fore multiplayer to load.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This version of Superman is one of the best plots and story lines I have ever seen.<br />A lot of people didn't like this particular movie, It is a very good movie. This is a must own, rightfully close to the original, beats out the other so called remakes by a nose.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If your hesitating about get it it is an awesome game and its very fun that's just my opinion. If you like collect and dodge games the you'll like this game
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|So far it's a good game.......No problems yet.  I love the puzzle part of the game and finding some of the items can be challenging.
B006PTZNSY|3.0|this women is pretty cool her music brings something would recommend to a friend to much pink though what if???????
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a well written book in a kind of diary format!  You have to play close attention in order to follow!  Really interesting story line!  L
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I play this game every time I'm on the toilet. It helps you to relax every muscle on your body. therefore, u poop better..
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Recommend this game. It's improved a lot from its first version. I'm not sure how to reset the game or start new in this version, thought.
B00821PCJS|4.0|A very interesting tale where a very small group of people withstand the beings from outer space.  Most of the humans have been eliminated.  It is a story which keeps your interest through out all the episodes.
1451695195|1.0|The book was a waste of money, very boring and I could not finish reading it. I was expecting so much more because of all the great reviews it got.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The book is fairly easy to read, but at some points the details of connections and names is more than needed and a bit distracting. I find this is often true of experts - every &#34;fact&#34; is important. They may be to scholars working in this area, but boring to me.<br />The book is informative and does enlighten my understanding of the history of that period quite a bit
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Best TV series since Little House on the Prairie! Absolutely loved it. The characters and the acting are just wonderful and it's like watching a living painting on TV. The HD is just awesome and the whole series is so good, my wife and I started watching again from the start.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this hale is awesome I thought it would never come out for my kindle fire but now it did so try it u will love it to
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I'm completely addicted I cant stop playing once I start I love the grafting n details of the pets :) also have pony game
B005XQLBU4|5.0|it is fun and it is always constantly getting harder with every level I completely recommend this game you'll love it alot
0425267695|5.0|Ok this review is clearly not needed. There are many others that effectively summarize the plot. However due to sheer fandom, I had to add my own 5 stars so that these sacred verses never fall to a shocking 4 and 1/2 stars or dare I even mention the perverse 4 stars?!<br /><br />Alright alright, fantastical posturing aside, I enjoyed this book because the story is complete even though unfinished. The characterization, the motivations, every random plot off-shoot etc. As an avid reader I have found that this is rarely the case even in \\"finished\\" books. And best off all, it retained all the traditional bad-Ass-ery of the genre without feeling worn or shallow. I found myself imagining Vaelin facing of other fantasy heroes and he kept coming out on top. However there was an impasse between him and Kaladin from Brandon Sanderson's \\"Way of kings\\". Need I say more?
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|Saw the movie before seeing the tv series it was base on. the blu ray is out of this world.
0525478817|5.0|Such a good author and such a well written heartfelt book. Made me emotional and that rarely happens. MUST READ !
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|I has a lot of happings that make you jump. was very impressed with the blu ray picture was very sharp.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are great! They present just enough of a challenge to keep you interested in going on. The games are fun for adults as well as kids. I don't understand any rating under a four.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We got into white collar a while ago, but once we were done with the seasons netflix we found Suits. Suits is witty and full of funny and suspenseful banter between the characters! It's a must watch!!
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|I'm a lifelong Rush fan so take this review for what it's worth. When I say I love it I am talking about the 5.1 remaster on Blu-ray  because I obviously already love 2112. Although the instrumental nuances don't shine through like the Blu-ray of Moving Pictures, the sound is crisp and sharp and Neil's drumming which is the signature of 2112 sufficiently pounds the air with a distinctness of tones when played on a quality system. The animation that accompanies the music is somewhat cheesy but fun, but then what else do you expect from Rush? That's one of the qualities that have enabled them to endure and sustain such a large fan base--they don't take themselves too seriously. For those of you who have never heard good music on a good system, ditch i-Tunes and your i-Pod and listen to music the way for which it was intended.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game is really fun if you like bingo games but I will say this sometimes the bingo balls lag sometimes so you miss out on bingos and stuff will rate better when its fixed or something.
0375869026|5.0|That's it....WOW.  Just read it and you will know what I mean.  Best book I have read in years! So good that I am going to pick it up and read it again and the last time I did that was with Harry Potter.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This was a sweet sad story about foster children and adoption, and how our system sometimes goes wrong.  This story held my interest and it was a quick and easy read.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|My favorite part of this book was the way it was written. It was a beautiful story, heartwrenching and relatable. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading young adult fiction or would like to revisit those times when you were young, starry-eyed and in love.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Plays fine, good time killer. Reminds me of missile command on the Atari 2600. A lot of fun to be had for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is so helpful for me and my family. I would like to recommande it to everybody take your time and try it
B004XNGKBS|1.0|The app is terrible an is not user friendly. I was trying to cancel the order but good ole amazon does not give me that option. I don't know how to tell them I want my money back. Don't believe they will read this and give me my money back. But, if you do don't waste your money.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|The FLY 5 is a solid stick. It looks great, it's affordable, and the modularity is nice.<br /><br />If only it worked.<br /><br />My first stick was great, except that the rudder didn't function properly. So I returned it (at my own expense - Mad Catz doesn't cover shipping) for repair. Mad Catz instead sent me a different stick, which was even worse: the scroll wheel was broken, as well as one of the face buttons, and the lights to boot.<br /><br />I read some horror stories and thought I'd take the gamble. It wasn't worth it. Avoid this stick and go with a company with a solid track record and halfway-decent support.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A great show, but so expensive to watch.  Is there not some kind of deal that can be worked out with HBO, especially if the show is in its third or fourth season when the viewer orders season one?
B003HARV3Y|3.0|If you want a movie true to the amazing book... this is not for you.  While the film is an overall fun adventure for the younger members of the family the film takes extreme liberties with the Riordan original.  In an attempt to streamline the story and appeal to an older demographic details that are pivotal to the plotline for the Olympian series are drastically altered.<br />The film is still entertaining and is a great way to introduce Greek mythos into a young persons world I think a 3 star rating is generous at best.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a darkly witty and terrific action flic with a cast that has real chemistry.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I've had this on my to reading list for the longest time and just had not come around to reading it till now. I fell in love with the characters and the story line almost immediately. I found myself not able to put it down.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This is a film both my husband and I watch regularly (at least once a week and sometimes more!)  McAdams is so adorable and perky one just can't help but be uplifted by this film.  Harrison Ford also pulls off humor in a subtle but gorgeous performance.  Heartwarming, evanescent, LOVELY!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good gamE it is exitingE  and it lets you pass the time with some fun game play. This is a good game for Amazon free game. Thank you.
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|As far as I can tell, this film was pretty much overlooked -- I ran across it by accident.  IMHO, Rockwell is an actor of tremendous talent -- his performances are nuanced and brilliant, moving, and deeply authentic.  Great plot, nice twists, all around EXCELLENT in entertainment value.  Highly recommended!!
B008OJ291W|4.0|I don't think there is anything new here but the quality is good and since I don't own any other ELO compilations it was a good purchase for me.  I've enjoyed listening to it very much.  I also enjoyed the documentary (or was that an infomercial) by the same title.  He seems a very talented and interesting fellow:)
B00DURILJ2|3.0|I took a chance and purchased this movie at $14.99 based on the rave reviews -- and I will probably not watch it more than once or twice more, ever, so have to say I was disappointed and wish I had just rented it.<br /><br />If one wants to see an Oscar worthy performance of Matthew M -- I would STRONGLY suggest The Paperboy -- now THAT'S Oscar worthy.  This one?  Excellent performances but nothing to write home about.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really enjoy playing this classic remake!!!  It is fast and fun!!!  Great game to past the time.  Free is even better!!!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I suppose Bruce Willis must have made a film that is bad before, but I personally haven't seen it.  He's SO RELIABLY THOROUGHLY ENTERTAINING it's pretty amazing when you think of the ability to sustain that quality over such a lengthy career.  This is the same predictable shoot-em-up that we've come to know and love -- and I never get tired of it!!  Witty dialog and enjoyable!!<br /><br />BTW, for any Bruce Willis fans out there that haven't seen 16 Blocks -- that is another of his films that I watch over and over -- SUPERB -- IMHO, his best film.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game but can be very addictive. Fun thought, need to use you'd skill to win. Can be expensive in some rooms. Have made so great friends from around the world.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|As a Jessica Chastain fan, I had to rent it even though super-scary films are not my thing.  Still really enjoyed the performances all around and the special effects were great.  Entertaining!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Just like from back in the day. If you like the original youll like this one too. And i got it for FREE.
B005VC4FLW|5.0|This is a movie to watch over and over -- just fantastic chemistry with the cast -- comedic timing is perfect -- and the film is full of warmth, humor, philosophy, love, and of course, David Lindhagen!
B00CEK9OTM|2.0|There are lots of other games like this but not as dull and with better control so just skip this one.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|So far so good, seems fun but only a few levels in, will give a more detailed review later on
0425263924|5.0|I WAS HAPPY TO FINALLY GET THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR THEM.  I MIGHT HAVE TO RE-READ BEFORE THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT?  THE ROMANCE, STORY LINE, THE MATURTY OF EVA IS FASCINATING TO ME.  I HAVE PASSED THE BOOK ON TO MY DAUGHTERS AND THEIR FRIENDS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO LIKES ROMANCE THAT DIDN&#34;T START OUT YOUR GIRL MEETS BOY STORY LINE.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|The idea behind the movie is good and works out well for a plot that will keep you interested for good time.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Well, what can you say about all the songs you grew up to all in one cd.  It's wonderfully fantastic!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good old classic gaming with new version of missile commanding. Very quick and easy to use but gets addictive just as quick. Love it
B0095J0AL6|5.0|When I purchased this item it was for my daughter who was 13 then and was totally in love with them last year, but everyone grows up .
B0063IH60K|5.0|After downloading another version of Solitaire on my Kindle Fire, then raking it over the coals for being too small and too slow, I found my favorite version of Solitaire by MobilityWare. I was able to download it for FREE, and it's the same one I use on my iPad and iPhone. I love this version. It's quick, intuitive, and has much larger cards and readability.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|this book is so addictive and interesting I couldn't put it down at all. the rest of the series as well<br /><br />i luv shadowhunters
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice simple interface. Plays at a good pace. No extra charges required so far. Might be a good gsme to keep my kids entertained for a while.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is the most definitive MGS collection around. The gameplay time alone is worth the price of admission. The extras are just icing on the cake. Seeing the evolution of Snake is a treat. Get this game!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|It was a bit slow but worth the read, definitely made me reflect on perceptions and people. In all honesty anything by Green is a winner
B005XQLBU4|4.0|remember Atari's Missile Command, very similar to it, but bumped up with steriods and neat up grades, not to mention it is very addictive
B005FITIDC|5.0|This is a great movie. And a true one. It's not for the family with little kids though. It's a bloody movie and it's true to life. So all the Christians who want a whitewashed version of history  should not watch this probably. But if you want the true story of a man who tries to do right and then becomes a war leader then this one is for you.  And it must be pointed out that the preacher doesn't kill people until his orphanage is attacked. He has no choice in the matter. Some Christians would have just died there and not fought back , which is their choice and very brave too, but then all the kids would die.  The acting is great in this flick and the lead actor really begins to chow how war brutalizes the preacher , until he comes back from the brink.  The war scenes are brutal and the fact remains that the international community  needs to help the Sudanese fight the madman koney and his army of death.  The film looks great in hd and should be seen that way if possible.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very old school and very fun. Much like the old arcade game. A good tip is to not be stingy with the missiles!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Its OK but its not a app that I would use often in fact very rarely. I have better things to do with my time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game for those who like to do hidden object games and like a little mystery! You do have to pay attention to the messages but it is worth it.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I found it on videotape years ago, but since videos are becoming a thing of the past, I am glad to have found it on DVD through Amazon.com.  It is a hilarious movie starring a great actor and wonderful actress. Considering when this movie came out, I am surprised that the content was deemed acceptable at that time.  However, I have not seen another movie quite like it.  An added plus is the inclusion of the old newsreels containing the current events of the years over which this couple's encounters took place.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Worth a download. Similar to old school Atari game only better interface with the touch screen. Best FAOD in a long time!
B000ID1J5E|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies, perhaps because I enjoy the rafting experience so much.  The actors/actress are some of my all-time favorites as well.  It has a great plot, keeps the viewer engaged throughout, and the scenery is fantastic.
B000FFJYB6|3.0|We watched this movie with our granddaughter and it is a pretty good family movie. It has a good story and moral message but I would not care to watch it again. I think with any such film, getting good acting from kids and dogs is a challenge and this was no exception. I let our granddaughter take it home with her. Not sure if she will want to see it again either but her family has an extensive movie collection and loves dogs.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|More than I expected OUTSTANDING.  Thanks to Don Imus (Fox news IMUS IN THE MORNING) for advertising or I would have missed it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun in the beginning, gets hard very quickly. The levels don't last long, makes it a great game for a quick distraction.
B000006NPY|5.0|Smashing Pumpkins : Adore, is my favorite SP album (Machina / The Machines Of God is my second favorite SP album).<br /><br />The album combines Blues, Jazz, Folk Music, and Gothic Rock perfectly.<br /><br />The music, lyrics, and production are perfect.<br /><br />This album got me through a lot of depressed days and sleepless nights.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Well written but sad.  John needs to move on with his life too.  Can he now?  Maybe a sexual is in order.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Pretty good game but sometimes the controller glitches up so that's why I only gave this game 4 stars but it usually stops in time
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|This is my 2nd Kindle.  I purchased the HD update and was disappointed in the way it functions.The original turning it on and the charging light are not the same  and function poorly.  the size is to thin to the touch.  I expected an updated version of my original.  Not the same.  Shortly after my purchase, u reduced the price to $159.00.  I can understand Why!!
