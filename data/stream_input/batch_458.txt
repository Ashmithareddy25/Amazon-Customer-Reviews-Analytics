076790592X|5.0|This is one of the few books that I've read a second time. I love the life lessons that are packed inside the pages of this little book. What led me back to this one was a new book I just finished called Live Like You Were Dying. It's also full of life lessons but more from a son's relationship with his dad. I hope that Mitch Albom will continue writing these little books that inspire long after the last page has been read.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|As a general rule I like to read the book before watching the movie. However, every once in a while it happens to me that while watching a film I think that I would like to read the novel too. This was the case with \\"The Shipping News\\", and it was also the case with \\"Mystic River\\". When I watched this production, I was constantly thinking that the story was so perfect, that the book must be great. I hope I get a chance to confirm this suspicion soon.<br /><br />Anyway, going back to the movie, the story evolves around the lives of three childhood friends that went through a traumatic experience when one of them, Dave, was bullied into a car by two adults posing as police officers. He was abused for days until he could finally escape, but something broke inside him, and all three friends where affected as a result.<br /><br />Now, Jimmy (Sean Penn) owns a convenience store and is still involved with some dangerous men from his days as a delinquent, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police officer who was abandoned by his wife six months ago and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a married man that lives a quiet life but still has ghosts from his past that visit him. These three men have not really been in contact with each other over the last few years, even though they live in the same city.<br /><br />When Jimmy's oldest daughter is murdered, Sean is the detective in charge of the investigation. Also, Dave was in the bar Jimmy's daughter went to the night of her death, and he later came home to his wife bearing a knife wound and alleging that he was mugged by a man that he had to kill. Once the path of the three friends converges, we find ourselves in the middle of a craftily constructed story, which has all the elements that make a great mystery.<br /><br />Besides the script being incredibly good, it allows the actors to show their best aptitudes by having very powerful scenes and a lot of interesting exchanges. If you have seen this movie it should come as no surprise that both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for their performances in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor respectively. I really found no drawbacks in this film, but understand that some people may find the story somewhat disturbing. I still think that it is worth seeing by anyone that is not extremely sensitive to murder and violence.h Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for their performances in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor respectively.

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|Michael Jackson's career is well-documented in this already large collection; however, to best represent Michael Jackson, his abilities as a true soul singer, his abilities as a gifted live performer, this collection could be much improved.  The first disc (arguably the best of the four) crams his first 12 years of recordings into one, a huge oversight.  That period should consist of two discs, to allow more of his biggest earliest hits and essential tracks, such as \\"The Love You Save,\\" \\"Never Can Say Goodbye,\\" \\"Who's Lovin' You,\\" \\"One Day In Your Life,\\" \\"Blame it on the Boogie,\\" \\"Can You Feel It,\\" \\"Off the Wall,\\" etc. The second disc understandably focuses mainly on the \\"Thriller\\" LP, but should probably include the final product of \\"P.Y.T\\" for comnparison and for the fact that they're really not the same song at all.  The major missing tracks from this period is \\"Human Nature\\" and the Jacksons' \\"Torture.\\"  The third disc spans the \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" years, clipping some important \\"Dangerous\\" tracks (\\"In the Closet,\\" \\"Heal The World\\").  Disc 4, with its \\"HIStory\\" to present timeline, will probably be viewed as the weakest, but could have been bolstered significantly with great tracks like \\"EarthSong,\\" \\"Is It Scary,\\" perhaps one of the single remixes of hits \\"You Rock My World\\" (with Jay-Z) and \\"Butterflies\\" (with Eve) in place of non-singles/weaker songs like \\"Unbreakable\\" and \\"Blood on the Dancefloor.\\"  That being said, no one collection will perfectly please everyone.  Overall, it's good and the demos and unreleased tracks are interesting, if not pretty good(exceptions: \\"Monkey Business,\\" \\"Cheater,\\" \\"Scared of the Moon,\\" \\"We are the World (demo).\\"  The DVD is well-shot and is a great show in itself, but previously aired on HBO, MTV and VH1.  A \\"greatest performances\\" collection spanning his entire career would be more \\"ultimate,\\" plus would help showcase what really made Michael the star he became: his captivating live persona, his dancing, his ever-changing style.  Nonetheless, the product as presented is second-to-none as far as box sets go.  The main problem (and perhaps only hardcore fans will notice or care) is the accompanying book.  There are typos, incorrect/incomplete data, and a relatively brief and disappointing essay.
7119005901|5.0|One of the greatest of epic novels. I received this book as a gift, and I'll treasure it forever. I know I'll return to it several times in the future to reread it. The book is as long as five novels, but it's more fun than almost any five novels you could choose. The epic sweep through 110 years of Chinese history is amazing. The narrative is swift and compelling. The battles are spectacular and exciting. The characters--especially Kongming, Cao Cao, and Lord Guan--are wonderfully memorable and alive. The English translation, aside from a few typos and misspellings, is good. I don't speak Mandarin, so I wish someone would make a movie version of the story in English, or provide a subtitled version of one of the many Chinese screen adaptations. If I have one problem with the book, it's the character of Xuande. He's weak and indecisive, and lacks the qualities needed in an epic hero. It's hard to see what the other characters saw in him.
0399900705|1.0|I decided to buy this book to kill off a weekend reading a good thriller. My weekend was ruined! First half of the book is quite engaging and action-packed, but when Ludlum started these long and horrible dialogs I just gave up and trashed the book.
B000002G87|5.0|Clapton at his best. Before pop music, when playing the blues was what mattered. Everyone heard Layla and Bell Bottom Blues, <br />but if you haven't heard the rest of this album, you haven't heard Clapton. I compare his playing on this album to his days with Mayall...blues, blues, blues.... then brought to the next level, to where only Eric Clapton can take you. An honored addition to any music collection!
B0000028UK|4.0|This follow up to \\"TEN\\" is really impressive, as not only does it manage to be a better album than it's predacessor, but it explores music sounds and genres and furthers Pearl Jam's resume of what they are capable of. We see a more country side to some of the song, as well as acoustic elements, and yet the album still rocks as much as \\"TEN\\" did.  <br /> <br />Grade: A-
B00007FOMP|5.0|This was my Soul awakening album...WOW...it blew me away. <br />Not much else to say except, thank you Marvin!
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is by far Pearl Jam's best effort to date. I love Pearl Jam, but I'll be the first to admit that their albums tend to slow down and lose momentum as they go on, but this album is probably the most solid album they've made yet. It starts out with an eery and beautiful \\"Sometimes\\" and goes on into some rock and acoustics songs, with gems like \\"Off He Goes\\". All of the songs are well done, and you can definitly tell Pearl Jam put a lot of effort into this one. A+
B00005ATQF|4.0|I remember back in my Senior year of high school (only two years back), I've read and heard about how great this movie is. One of my friends in particular loved this movie. And on the back cover of the DVD, some critic hailed this as \\"The Best War Movie Ever\\" (quote may not be exact). And I've read that about how critics call this the best war movie. And, yes, I've seen other war movies like \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" etc., etc. So, naturally, I figured it'd be high time to finally view the movie for myself. I caught it on tv one night and Leonard Maltin came on and praised the movie for all it's worth. My expectations rose. After the movie... I was rather... puzzled... and a bit... disappointed... <br /> <br />Not that I didn't enjoy the movie. As just about everyone says here, the movie is two stories that talk of dehumanization that war (not just Vietnam in particular) brings about to some. The first half revolves around boot camp, and the second half is the war itself... Blah, blah, blah... I'm just repeating what everyone already said... but continue on. <br /> <br />R. Lee Ermey plays the hard-ass drill instructor Sgt. Hartman. He just about shouts put downs that would disgruntle or sickingly humor anyone who's anyone. His basic job is to train Marines to fight and kill. But he gets his kicks by shouting obscenities to his men, especially one in particular named Gomer Pyle (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), a lazy fat guy that can't do much right. His laziness results in punishment for everybody else. So the rest of the men take their anger out on Gomer in a very disturbing scene involving bars of soap. Then... Gomer goes crazy. He kills his drill instructor as well as himself. <br /> <br />Watching the first half of the film, I was led to believe that it would focus primarily on that subject, but then the film rapidly shifts to Vietnam. Now the central character is \\"Joker\\" (Matthew Modine). Then again, the movie is told from Joker's perspective, but he is rarely seen in the first half. He's now a journalist working for Stars and Stripes and he is then sent out into combat to get a good story, later to be in actual combat for the first time. From here, this section of the film seems out of place and the Vietnam setting doesn't necessarily look quite like Vietnam. Sure, the gunfights are loaded with action and explosions, but it's... unconvincing. Partly due to the fact that the movie wasn't filmed in Vietnam (or a similar locale), but rather at some studio in England. And at times, it seems that Kubrick was trying to mimick Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (one scene had a film crew making a documentary of the war... just like in \\"Apocalypse Now\\"). But unlike how \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was primarily in the jungle, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is in towns that lay in ruins. <br /> <br />In one sequence, the reckless gunfire of the soldiers fire recklessly in the same direction a man of their own runs towards. I wonder how lucky that one soldier (among few later) wasn't hit by ANY of those bullets... <br /> <br />Aside from these minor qualms, the action is still brilliant... just don't expect \\"Private Ryan\\"-style. <br /> <br />Joker's story is his boot-camp training coming to full effect in the second act. It develops slowly over time as he experiences the deaths of soldiers (including a friend of his), but then develops at the end when he kills a Vietnamese woman. He faced quite a conflict, but he managed to pull through. <br /> <br />The showing of the dehumanization of soldiers isn't particularily anything new. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" showed that, only better (even \\"Platoon\\"). And I felt that Kubrick was trying hard to make his own version of Coppola's classic. The only thing Kubrick pulled off well was the first half of this movie. The harshness of boot camp at the time and what effect it had on one person. It may have been exaggerated, but it still shows this character's slow descent into madness triggered by the drill instructor (in truth, he might've just packed up and left rather than kill his drill instructor and himself). And R. Lee Ermey steals the movie even from its main character (Joker). <br /> <br />The movie kinda misled me and the Vietnam setting wasn't too convincing. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" was filmed in California (I think...), and it looked more like Vietnam than how \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" portrayed the place. But nonetheless, Kubrick still gave one heck of a war movie, even if it didn't focus on the war itself (which it didn't). Rather, the focus is what war has on the human mind. <br /> <br />Watch, but don't expect something better than \\"Apocalypse Now\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"
B00005JNEI|1.0|This film is an example of how Hollywood can take facts and turn them for their own spin.  Michael Moore does this in spades! <br />He uses some facts and then turns them around for entertainment...not truth. <br />An excellent DVD, if you've seen this picture, is \\"Fahrenhype 911\\".  At least you will get more honest facts and not have them turned in a certain way to exploit your way of thinking with any regard for what's the truth. <br />Michael Moore has a political agenda and he uses it to slant this film. <br />If a film crew were to follow him around with their own agenda, they could make Michael out to be a right wing anorexic, with traditional values (using Michael Moores style of journalism)! <br />If you look at this film for entertainment only...then it has some humorous moments and some shocking moments that could entertain...but that was not the goal of this film project and that is why this reviewer gives it one star at best!
0141301139|5.0|In Roald Dahl's chapter book, Fantastic Mr. Fox, he tells a traditional story in which Fantastic Mr. Fox outsmarts three halfwit farmers. Like most foxes, Fantastic Mr. Fox is sharp and cunning. He lives near three farms that belong to very unpleasant farmers. The farmers are described as having nasty personalities, horrible eating habits, and disgusting features. Each night, Mr. Fox steals food from the farmers to feed his own family. The farmers are furious and band together to find Mr. Fox and 'string him up by his tail.' They find his hole and wait for him to come out so they can shoot him.  <br /> When Mr. Fox refuses to surrender, the angry men try to dig him out with shovels and then with farm equipment and bulldozers. Eventually, they take all the workers from their farms and scatter them over the hill in order to stand guard so that the foxes cannot escape. As the farmers wait, the Fox family is slowly starving. Mr. Fox gets a brilliant idea and soon he and all of the underground animals find a way to pull the biggest trick of all on the three nasty farmers. They get food for their families off of the farmers' own ignorance and the farmers continue to miserably wait for Mr. Fox to emerge from his hole.  <br /> This book is a classic example of Dahl's writing style. The adults are always mean and rotten, while the children and animals are smart and good. This book raises a number of questions that could make for a very interesting discussion. Mr. Fox feeds his family by stealing food from the farmers. Does that makes stealing ok just because the men he stole from were mean? The Badger brings up this important issue and Mr. Fox sweet talks himself out of trouble, but should stealing ever be considered ok?  <br /> This book has a good plot and inspires creativity and problem solving skills. The characters have strong personalities and are involved in hopeless yet humorous predicaments. Kids will laugh at the farmers' misfortunes, enjoy the unusual undergroundsetting and cheer on Mr. Fox and his fantastic schemes. I love the way Roald Dahl gives his characters such unusual qualities. This book was an entertaining and enjoyable read. <br /> <br />
B00008J4P5|5.0|I think the Stripes are the most talented band to come around in a long time.  Vocals - killer.  Drums - Bonham-esque.  So many gems on this album - and that's not counting the radio cuts you've heard ad-nauseum.  I have gotten totally aboard the White Stripes hype train.  They are worth every rave you've heard.  They have the stuff to last!
068987474X|4.0|Women need to hear this stuff. Though I'd like to qualify that though one answer might be that \\"He's Not that Into You\\", it probably is more likely that he's just a stupid man who doesn't know how to respond to your hints. One of the man's roles is to follow the body language and energy of the woman and respond accordingly. If he isn't doing that, chances are he's just a loser who isn't worth your time any way. Consider yourself lucky to find this out now, BEFORE you get into a toxic and self-defeating relationship with him, and move on. <br /> <br />Women, understand that men almost NEVER go though the same sort of mental process that you do when looking for a mate. \\"Maybe he doesn't want to ruin the frendship\\": men are sexually-juiced creatures. They don't think much about the weighing the relative merits of a frendship vs sex, what they think about is how much you are turning them on or not. If they aren't turned on in some way (NOT necessarily only by you looks), then they aren't going to be all that interested. \\"Maybe he's intimidated by me\\": if he is, then he's a loser. You can only tone yourself down so much. If you tone it down and he doesn't respond, then he's never going to. <br /> <br />Also, women need to understand that the whole \\"who asks who out\\" frame is lame. Me personally, if a woman isn't strong enough to be willing to ask ME out, then I know she's a loser. First, there ARE guys out there who care about more then a woman's looks. If a woman doesn't show me she has a strong personality to back up those looks, then I'm not going to be interested, because I know she doesn't value her own self-worth. A strong woman is SEXY. <br /> <br />Also, there is no LAW that says the man always has to ask the woman out. Men need to do the work, it's true. But if a man does the work by talking to you first, making you feel good, etc., and you don't respond by taking the next step, then you are dis-respecting the man. The man can't do EVERYTHING- it's a two-way street. If the man is doing everything, then realize that he has no self-respect, and ultimately you are not going to going to be happy with him.
B000089CJI|1.0|I bought this album based on the appeal of the radio single (\\"such great heights\\") but found the rest of the album to be trite AND uninteresting musically.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|People look for different things in a movie, ultimately choosing from their own value system. I thought that Lost was  realistic in a sense that life is made up of many small moments and relationships, that eventually adds up to a lifetime of experiences whatever they may be.  The relationship  between  Bill and Scarlett is not the typical one that one see in a \\"hollywood type \\"of movie but closer to a foreign film where relationships between people and their surroundings are explored  a little more deeply developed and not as shallow  which I think makes for a thoughtful and well acted film, something one can learn something meaningful from. Hats off to Sofia, and the main characters for a fine directed and well acted film.
B00030590I|5.0|If you are one of those that like to see violence just for the sake of it, avoid this movie at all costs. I tell you from now that all the blood you are going to see is one drop. But for everyone else, this movie is a masterpiece. You don't even need to listen to the movie (not that you would understand unless you understand mandarin) but the graphics say it all. The colors set the mood of the scene and all shots are beutiful, particularly the one in the woods with all those orange leaves. If you, like me, are one of those people that can stand in front of a good painting contemplating it for a long time, this movie is just that, except that it has movement.
B000002HGD|5.0|I only recently got into Moby. <br />He really is awesome. <br /> <br />So original and melodic.
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you like fiction, how someone can edit and manipulate interviews to present his view, rahter than the person he interviewed, this movie is for you. Luckily, I never spent a dime  to watch this movie; I went to the cinema, paid for a different movie, but walked into the one showing this movie, and only because so many Bush-haters talked about it. It really is a movie for people who hate Bush [...], people who want to believe (regardless of facts) all of Bush's doings being wrong. Apparently, the movie did not help Kerry win the election. Fortunately, many Americans realized what Bush is doing, is right. I am a Democrat, but after 9/11 I voted for Bush. If you like to watch a really good DVD, have a look at FahrenHYPE 9/11, the movie shows all the lies of Michael Moore.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|This album is alot of fun. One aspect about the strokes I really like is their distinct style of music in a genre where bands like the Killers and Franz Ferdinand all sound the same. Their lead singer really sets the tone for the band and really makes the songs on this album enjoyable. Some tracks on the CD can be a bit whiney , like the first one, but most of them aren't. Another thing I really like is the incorporation of synthasizers into songs. It's not the body of their music, but it does make it interesting and upbeat. The baseline is somewhat lacking, however, which is dissapointing although not at uncommon for the music genre. My advice is that if you like emo, you'll probably like this CD (although I wouldn't call this CD emo). If you like modern rock, this CD provides a fresh sound that gets you moving with some good guitar riffs and creative lyrics.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|It isn't often that a movie gets my heart pumping, especially the second time I see it.  I'm fairly desensitized to most of the tricks up Hollywood's sleeve.  The Bourne Supremacy is different - they sought out an independent director with a compelling style, and they shot much of the movie as though you're a witness in the scene.  I highly recommend it.
B0006399FS|5.0|I was really excited about this new album coming out and have been looking forward to it very much.  There are a few very rare albums that catch you immediately and don't lose their grip. I will admit that the first time I listened to the album, I didn't feel that way save for a couple of songs, namely \\"A Man and a Woman\\" (gotta love that guitar and bass) and City of Blinding Lights.....but you know, it took a few more listens for me to realize that it is exactly what I would want and expect from U2. I love this album!  I can listen to it over and over again. Like most of U2's music, there is a tenderness and beauty about some of the lyrics, and I found that that kind of feeling was evident in songs like Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, Man and a Woman, and Original of the Species..... <br /> <br />Yes, Bono's voice is raspy at times (someone tell him to quit smoking already!), but the passion is still there. This album is not empty. It is real, and like someone recently said in discussing the album, it's like a soundtrack for your life....and this album fits in just perfectly.  It makes you happy, it makes you sad, it makes you rock, but it all feels good because you feel good about who it's coming from...... <br /> <br />This is definitely one of my favorite U2 albums.... <br /> <br />One more note, the last song, which is a bonus track, \\"Fast Cars\\", is a fun, tripped out ride......can't you just see this being filmed out in the middle of Joshua Tree?!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I think the movie was interesting and great. <BR>The movie was like you have to go back wards, and change everything. Change everything to the way it was, but not everything.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|it's funny to me, i use amazon a lot and love reading the reviews, sometimes good sometimes bad.  for this flick i find a mix of reviews some people loved it some people hated it.  truthfully these are all just opinions.  yes it is a slow movie, rather depressing and lonely, but some of you may not know much about that and may not relate to the movie as well as others may.  all i wanna say is that these reviews are all just opinions and i must tell you if you've read this far not to to be a follower and listen to everyone else's opinion...FORM YOUR OWN
B0000TLA9G|3.0|When I heard Geffen was bringing out a Greatest Hits album for one of the Greatest rock bands in the world- Guns N Roses, I was over the moon. <br /> <br />But when the tracklisting came out I was disappointed. <br /> <br />Sure there were the ledgendary Gunners songs off Appetite- Welcome To The Jungle, Paradise City and Sweet Child Of Mine- Great, but this GH album lacked songs such as My Michelle, Mr Brownstone, Nightrain etc. <br /> <br />Songs off the UYI albums were poorly represented- November Rain, Dont Cry, Civil War and You Could Be Mine were great choices but selecting the covers of Bob Dylans Knockin On Heavens Door over 14 Years, The Garden, Right Next door to hell, Dust n Bones, and Estranged- WTF?! <br /> <br />Not to mention the representation of The Spaghetti Incident? <br />This is a greatest Hits Album not the bands f******g best of our Covers  <br />

B000002JSR|5.0|Long before rarities and alternate takes in boxed sets existed,Jimmy Page compiled this album which summarizes the 12 years of Led Zeppelin's career in a single album in 1982,back then the idea of a double album was considered \\"self-indulgent\\",let alone multiple-item sets,which now are commonplace.Thus Page pieced together truly unheard-of material such as the live pair from the Albert Hall '70 'We're Gonna Groove' and 'I Can't Quit You Baby' now available in the DVD \\"Led Zeppelin\\". <br />'Poor Tom' is an outtake from LZ III and is truly outstanding,with a merge of country blues and british folk precisely underlined by a drum loop by John Bonham. <br /> From 1972 'Walter's Walk'is a heavy rocker with overdubs done in '82(Vocals and guitar),hints of this great piece can be heard on 'Dazed and Cofused' from \\"How The West Was Won\\".A headbanger's delight. <br /> From '76 a drum melodic piece called 'Bonzo's Motreaux' done in Switzerland with Bonzo playing a drum orchestra and Page doing electronic tratments,quite unique. <br /> From '78 'Darlene'a great rockabilly-like number with superb piano by John Paul Jones and Plant's lusty vocals.Page does some great guitar work and Bonzo is devastating.Also from this era 'Ozone Baby' is a Pop-oriented rocker meant to test the waters,even hinting-at,the upcoming 'New Wave' with interesting effects and riffs by Page and infectuous chorus by Plant. <br /> The closer is Zeppelin's challenge at Punk,'Wearing and Tearing' is the most unjustly overlooked and ignored track of the band's catalogue.All built around incessant riffs,starts and stops,it packs incredible power,instead of solos Page plays rhythm-driven guitar parts as Jones and Bonham(amazing bass drum patterns by the way)keep a frightening pace as Plant keeps screaming \\"MEDICATION,MEDICATION!!!\\",has to be heard to be belived.This was not an album to break in new material  but an overall look at a tweve-year career with all that was the essence of the band perfectly represented.    <br />
B0000024YL|3.0|This is really a fine album, and I think the alternate versions of some of the tracks add to the value of the collection. There are also some tracks where crowd noise intrudes into the start of some studio tracks. But really, this cd needs to be remastered with master source tapes. It's not a sonic disaster and will probably be adequate for listeners without great audio gear, but audiophiles will probably find this disc sounding muffled and harsh sounding in spots. Having said all that, If you buy this I suggest buying a used copy dirt cheap.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|I am so happy with this album - after what I thought were a few missteps on Nocturama, Nick has come back with stronger songs. He has definitely fallen much more into the vein of his croony Boatman's Call style, but has managed to re-incorporate a lot more of the raucous sounds which made him famous in the first place - sparingly, elegantly, and, as ever, lovingly.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Although I read Asimov when I was young, I didn't recall enough of it to spoil the movie for me.  In fact, I read elsewhere that the movie only loosely follows pieces of Asimov's famous short story collection. <br /> <br />That being said, I loved the movie - it was highly entertaining, and a little philosophical, but not over-the-top philosophical like AI was (and nowhere near as lengthy).  Will Smith does his usual fine job on screen, so you won't be disappointed with the acting. Don't listen to the critics who warned you away from seeing this movie - they were wrong again, as usual. <br /> <br />It didn't occur to me when I read Asimov years ago, but I finally \\"got\\" the significance of Dr. Calvin's name...  John Calvin was a theologian of the reformation who argued that humans are pre-destined by God, and therefore do not have free will.  Asimov's Dr. Calvin believes that the three laws of robotics make it impossible for a robot to have their own free will, and in a sense pre-destines their fate with humanity.  Oh well, enough philosophy for a simple movie review.  You'll have to see the movie if you want to know more. <br /> <br />The DVD also comes w/ some nice featurettes on the making of the movie, cast & director interviews, the writings of Asimov on robots, and various other of the usual things the studio throws in whenever they have some space left over on the disc. <br /> <br />My final recommendation is: five stars for the movie, and four stars for the supplemental material and packaging.  This will make a great Christmas present for that sci-fi fan in your family.
B00008BLB8|5.0|When I first heard this cd in November 2001, it captured the band sounding their best with their revamp instruments and CRAIG FROST'S keyboards that made all their power trio songs sound a whole lot better during their 1975 tour.  It's a shame that CRAIG did not reunit with GRAND FUNK RIALROAD for their reunion tour.  Furthermore, the songs TNUC, INSIDE LO0KING OUT, AND HEARTBREAKER on this live album that were also on the 1970 LIVE ALBUM and the 1997 BOSNIA album have a whole lot more powerful and better sounding rock and roll power.  I wish their  orchestra intro that was played on tape was at the beginning of this live album.  The organ-driven FOOT STOMPIN' MUSIC is outstanding is the added clavinet by CRAIG and organ riffs and guitar solos by lead singer MARK FARNER who delivers outstanding lead vocals through this album.  ROCK AND ROLL SOUL that features the ROCK AND ROLL PARTY intro has a more powerful rock and roll feeling than the studio version.  The next that is the FM radio I'M YOUR CAPTAIN with a different intro is the best song on this album, although half of it is missing.  CRAIG'S mellotron gives this song a more powerful psycohdelic sound than an orchestra.  It's a shame that my two favorite ballads MEMORIES and BAD TIME that are unfortunely about MARK'S divorce could not have been performed during this tour and closed this album.  Then comes the the blues -driven HEARTBREAKER with the added keyboards by CRAIG.  Unfortunately, my least favorite song in general is SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL, but this version of SHININ' ON is excellent with MARK and DON trading lead vocals, as is LOCO-MOTION, BLACK LICORICE, THE RAILROAD, and the DON BREWER penned guitar rock classic WE'RE AN AMERICAN BAND, with his lead vocals, CRAIG'S keyboard riffs, MEL'S bass guitar riffs, MARK'S guitar solos and harmony vocals.  Now we are back to the power trio days of GRAND FUNK RAILROAD, starting with TNUC that sounds a whole lot better than the studio version.  But, I have also heard that the TNUC (MARK'S voice on this song sounds a whole lot like STING) drum solo is edited; however, DON BREWER definitely should have shorten the drum solo during the concert performances in the first place.  Plus, they also could have shorten their performance of INSIDE LOOKING OUT as well, in order to put more songs on this album, but this is definitely an outstanding version that I have heard.  And GIMMI SHELTER is also electrifying on this album.  I think the band could have done without the female singers, although is was not a bad idea at all.  One more thing, I don't have the recent reissue of this cd; however, the 1996 reissue is gggrrreeeaaattttt, and definitely a must have for all GRAND FUNK RAILROAD fans.  Why this album did not go gold is definitely a mystery to me.
B000654Z2I|5.0|Only joking!! Probably just about the best album ever created apart from the one after this; Ege bamyasi. Seriously i wasted many years listening to imitations of can until i discovered the real thing. I would have to say that \\"can\\" along with the early funk/soul e.g sly and the family stone pretty much is contempary music single handedly laid out
0765301598|2.0|I've completed the Battle of Corrin and was pretty dissapointed.  This really should have been two books.  In fact, fundamental questions about the spacing guild, congress of royal houses, the benejeserit, really take a back seat what seems like a schedule of events that unfold.  Character development is almost completely abandoned in the entire 2nd half of the book.  Erasmus for example, a robot whose purpose is to provide an unimpeded methodical and amoral examination of human behavior begins to and does act in a radical and emotional way.  However, no reflection is given to why this transformation takes place.   <br /> <br />Two elements of the original Dune works stand out as missing in most all of the prequels.  The first is the element of mysticism.  Poisons, institutions, assumptions, and \\"plans within plans\\" are all a part of the Dune world created by Frank Herbert.  Those unknows forced the reader to reflect on the situations created by the interactions of individuals confident in their own agendas and beliefs.  A second element missing is the depth of character.  In fact, what a person really believes in the prequels are summed up in the brief snipets from other works at the beginning of each chapter.  This attempt at character development is more form than function.  The entire origin of the conflict between the houses of Atraides and Harkonnen are relegated to an afterthought of a few pages and no sympathy is given to the position of Abulerd Harkonnen.  It's like the whole reason for the original Dune series is based on just a misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Corrin definitely follows an action genre type of formula in that introspective examination is almost null.  The condition of humanity is never examined. There are no mantras, no internal conflicts, and no characters undergo personal revelations or growth.  Each character tends to follow their own roles and therefore, the book is somewhat predictible.   <br /> <br />Overall I gave it a2.
B00062J00S|5.0|I don't think some of the key negative aspects of this holiday film have truly been discussed in depth enough. Near the beginning of the film when the old druggist slaps the young George Bailey on the side of his head several times, the husband of the teacher who punches George in the face in the bar, George's own turn to violence, the man in the crowd who yells out \\"Someone hit him over the head with a bottle!\\" when George is trying to find out if anyone in town knows him after the angel grants his wish of never being born, and of course the hateful Mr. Potter. The film can definitely show the negative dark side of human nature if one looks for it. It reminds me of a teacher who once wanted all of her students to take time out of the regular class schedule to practice for a Christmas PTA show for a bunch of hypocrits and resorted to using a threatening dark tone to try and make the students show up for the \\"show\\". <br />Aside from the dark aspects, the film does endure as a classic even though real life stories don't always turn out like the climax of this film. The black and white cinematography is nicely done and on another positive note, everyone should be more like the angel Clarence in the film, happy and free and ordering his \\"flaming rum punch\\" or whatever his drink of choice was at Martini's bar. <br />Cheers.
0140277447|5.0|The rape of Nanking in 1937 is the very definition of barbarity. Just as it is a crime against humanity to perpetrate such an inhumane act it is also a crime against humanity for the rest of the world not to recognize it. <br /> However it is also important to remember that the Japanese people in general are not bad. They were brain washed and trained to be totally devoid of pity for enemy or for self. <br /> As imperialism and fascism, any nation and any human being can become brain washed and be the perpetrator of such crimes. It is NOT just a certain race or people. In turn it is our duty as human beings to learn from this atrocity so that no nation or people will ever be subjected to commit such a brutal crime or become victims of this behaviour.<br /> This book is not based loosely. There are literally thousands of eye witness accounts, diaries and pictures to support that the massacre took place. However some authors and historians differ on the actual number of people who were murdered, some say 200,000 while others say up to 600,000 were killed.
B0006419J6|5.0|I really enjoyed this SCI-FI thriller.  It was really cool to see Chicago in 2035, with robots walking around and working alongside humans.<br /><br />Will Smith did a fantastic job portraying Detective Del Spooner, a man who is very leery of the huge population of robots and their inability to make emotionally based decisions or calculations.  A lot of people criticise Will Smith's acting ability. I can't undersatnd why - this man has proven himself time after time.  This movie is NO different.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie is the lack of slow time.  There is just the right amount of action at just the right locations in this film.  There are also plenty of subplots which make the movie interesting and not just your typical action film.<br /><br />The special effects are very good in \\"I, Robot\\".  I'm sure there are some who would disagree, as some of the scenes were very difficult to create on film, so they are NOT perfect.  But all and all, I really enjoyed the futuristic advancements portrayed in the movie - most items and backgrounds looked totally believable.<br /><br />Kudos to all the other actors in this film.  I wouldn't want to make it seem like Smith made this movie a success all by himself, 'cause he didn't.  All the actors and actresses did a great job.<br /><br />So if you are looking for an action packed film that involves plenty of SCI-FI adventure, this is the film for you.  I rented this movie from the video store, but on Friday I will be purchasing it.  It's that good!<br /><br />See ya next review.
0393307050|5.0|If you can read English and have your heart where it should be, there's no reason why you shouldn't like this book. In fact, you will probably love it, and the whole series that follows too. Smooth sailing all the way - unputdownable. Good story, wonderful characters and true \\"feel\\" for the times and places. O'Brian's use of language is pure joy and often very funny, like when he makes some of his characters talk in their own special way. Go on, read them all.
B000002UA5|3.0|This double album represents the band at a turning point in their career. Their previous official album, A Saucerful Of Secrets, had found them recovering from the trauma of losing their principal singer, songwriter and lead guitarist, and against the odds, coming up with a winner.<br /><br />The sci-fi leanings of Syd Barrett's Astronomy Domine had been matched with Roger Waters' compositions Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun and Let There Be More Light, and Richard Wright had contributed two whimsical pieces, Remember A Day and See Saw. Their new direction, however, was determined by the closing track in which they were given the freedom to do whatever they wanted, A Saucerful Of Secrets itself, a 12-minute epic combining four separately composed instrumental pieces, Something Else, Syncopated Pandemonium, Storm Signal,  and Celestial Voices. It set the pattern for the new Pink Floyd.<br /><br />The idea of this double album was to wrap up their old repertoire with a live album of stage favourites, while launching their re-invented selves with a second studio album in which each of the four members would contribute a quarter in the form of solo performances or constructions.<br /><br />The Pink Floyd had already launched new material in their More Furious Madness From The Massed Gadgets of Auximenes concerts, but for the Ummagumma sets stuck to familiar material. Recordings for the live album were made at 3 locations - Bromley Technical College, Bromley Common, Kent (26 April 1969); Mothers Club, Erdington, Birmingham (27 April 1969 - a gig I attended) and the College of Commerce, Manchester (2 May 1969). The Bromley concert recording was not used whilst it appears composites from the other two appearances were edited together to form the four song track list of the Live Album. \\"Parts of Saucerful on Ummagumma came from the Birmingham gig, which we put together with the Manchester stuff,\\" said Richard Wright of the process. The plan rather backfired as the Live Album proved so popular that the band were obliged to continue to play them in their sets thereafter.<br /><br />The Studio Album proves the adage that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Rick Wright's Sysyphus suite is portentous and somewhat overblown and Nick Mason's Grand Vizier's Birthday Party fares less well. Roger Waters has two pieces, of which the pastoral Grantchester Meadows is the one to which I most return, and both of which provide the lightest and most humorous touches to the record. David Gilmour asked him to write some lyrics for his own piece and Roger Waters probably did him a favour by refusing since The Narrow Way must have shown him that he could write his own lyrics as it was one of the first of a long line of work from his pen. It was either brave or indulgent for the members of the band to expose their strengths and weaknesses in this way, but it cleared the way for more fully realised work by the whole band such as 1970's ambitious Atom Heart Mother, and the superb Echoes on 1971's Meddleoved so popular that the band were obliged to continue to play them in their sets thereafter. <br />The Studio Album proves the adage that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

0060930349|1.0|Ha-ha. Another Paul Johnson gem. Had this been labeled \\"fiction\\" I'd give it five stars. Basically, this untiring Anlo-Saxon supremacist wants us to belive that Britain is the flower of humanity and the Americans are really well-disguised Englishmen. Oh, and the French are EVIL.
B000065PUE|5.0|In 1986 a Californian anthropology major in Puerto Rico named Charles Thompson IV, studying Spanish on an exchange program, dropped out to form a band with his room-mate. They moved to Boston MA and put an advert in the papers for a bass guitarist \\"into Husker Du and Peter, Paul And Mary\\". That band became the Pixies, and Doolittle, their third album, from 1989, represents their commercial and artistic peak.<br /><br />Not only did it mark the apotheosis of indie guitar rock, it also paved the way for future landmark records in other genres, such as Nevermind, Daydream Nation and OK, Computer. The subject matter is dark, but the approach is celebratory and full of exuberant energy and unbounded confidence. The lyrics are intelligent, yet self-deprecating in their wit. Dead, for instance, is the story of the affair between David and Bathsheba, while the single Debaser is inspired by Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou, but debunks itself in the line \\"but I am un chien Andalusia.\\" Another single, Monkey Gone To Heaven, elliptically explores myth, death, good, evil and the environment, all in a few casual lines.<br /><br />Initially signed by the British indie Four A.D. label, this was the first Pixies album to be licensed in America to a major label (Elektra). However, with songs like I Bleed and Gouge Away it is clear that no artistic compromise is involved.<br /><br />Using cheap thrills and spills, B-movie and comic book teen horror imagery as metaphors for the big themes examined herein, the Pixies subvert content so that nothing is what it is. The sound is taut and focused (15 tracks in under 40 minutes) and structurally diverse, ranging from twisted spaghetti western (Silver) to the pop sensibilities of There Goes Your Man. Whilst Wave Of Mutilation takes the perils of surfing in cars as its subject, the sound of the surf guitar is reserved for the almost throwaway La La Love You. The undisputed considerable creative talents of Kim Deal, Joey Santiago and David Lovering are here sublimated in the greater cause of the initial vision as steered to its resolution by Thompson, by now known onstage in his alter-ego guise of Black Francisted in the greater cause of the initial vision as steered to its resolution by Thompson, by now known onstage in his alter-ego guise of Black Francis

B0002858YS|4.0|I admit that I'm a sucker for all things 80s.  So with many bands now with an 80s sound, I'm intrigued. <br /> <br />I was first introduced to The Killers while driving, and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" came on the radio.  I was a little unsure at first, but by the time the song was over, I was hooked.   <br /> <br />\\"Hot Fuss\\" is a nice debut.  It's a great album to listen to while driving down the road.  It's not always the most original sounding, but it does stand out from the crowd.  I could see The Killers getting better with experience.  They are definitely a band to keep your eye, and ear, on.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album as one of the best debuts of 2004.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is a classic thrash album.  If you consider yourself a thrash or Megadeth fan and don't own this album, you better reconsider yourself.  Much better than the previous and the next efforts.  It might be a little better than Rust in Peace.  I can't really say, they're both great albums.  I love the hit Peace sells because the bass line is cool and the guitar riffs are insane.  Another one of my favorites would be Wake Up Dead.  The riffs on that song are crazy as well.  The other songs are really good too.  This is Megadeth's, Master of Puppets.  I would encourage you to buy this album as soon as you can.   <br /> <br />You decide...
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|It's hard to deny the charm of \\"Mary Poppins,\\" the enchantingly colorful movie, from an era where Disney had outstanding movies up the wazoo, rather than one every now and then. Now for the fortieth anniversary of this enchanting movie, it's been rereleased with a slew of bonus features -- and for lovers of this movie, it's worth every second.<br /><br />Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) have a tendency to drive their nannies crazy. So when their strict father (David Tomlinson) puts out a call for a new nanny, he's startled when only one woman comes -- and Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) answered the request letter his children gave him, which he threw away. Mary Poppins's magical talents and offbeat pals soon endear her to the kids, especially when they romp through a chalk painting and have tea parties on the ceiling.<br /><br />But things take a darker turn when Mr. Banks takes the children to the bank where he works (get it? Banks? Bank? Yeah, whatever). After the kids inadvertantly cause a riot, they are taken along by Mary Poppins' friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a goodhearted Cockney. And then things take an unexpected turn when Mr. Banks is in danger of losing his job, forcing him to realize what is really important in his life.<br /><br />Walt Disney (the man as well as the corporation) was at his peak when \\"Mary Poppins\\" debuted, starring rubbery comic Dick Van Dyke and Broadway star Julie Andrews. Even though the film was made forty years ago, the special effects and blend of animation and reality are remarkably fresh and undated -- from the cartoon foxhunt to the rival nannies being blown down the street by a strong wind. And the story is a timeless one -- family should come first.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie's more sober, melancholy second half makes it more palatable to adults. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but you don't want too much sugar (ex. the cartoon chalk drawing, the goofy Uncle Albert who acts like he's on ecstacy) The fluff is toned down with the threat of unemployment and parental estrangement.<br /><br />What makes the bonus DVD worth getting? It seems to be mostly aimed at the target group (kids) rather than nostalgic adults -- there is a rather peculiar animated short, based on one of the Mary Poppins novels by the original author. There's also the \\"I Love to Laugh\\" game, which is basically answering questions to get Uncle Albert off the ceiling, a singalong, and a reconstructed concept-art song that was deleted from the final product, \\"Chimpanzoo.\\"<br /><br />Fun for kids, but adults will skip right over to the audio commentary (Andrews and van Dyke) and historical reminiscing, which include a making-of featurette and a look at the musical creations in this film. A particular bonus is a reunion with Andrews, van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman around a piano -- it's just very relaxed, laid-back and well-made.<br /><br />One of the best things is that the entire film has been remastered. Half of \\"Mary Poppins'\\" charm is in the visuals and songs. So it's great to see the color and sound cleaned up and sharpened -- it has the slight fuzz of a film that needed a bit more work (or maybe that's my old TV), but overall the work is good.<br /><br />Forty years have passed, and \\"Mary Poppins'\\" charm is undiminished. So in celebration of that, the anniversary edition with all the bonus material is definitely worth getting.acts like he's on ecstacy) The fluff is toned down with the threat of unemployment and parental estrangement.  <br /> <br />What makes the bonus DVD worth getting?

0060526491|5.0|The poetry itself is Dr. Seuss-quality (i.e. simplistic and rhyming), but that's not the appeal of this book. Get it for Tim Burton's macabre sense of humor and his quirky artwork. It's tons of fun!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Even with all of the hype of Wrestlemania 20, lest face it, in the end it didn't live up to the hype. Apart from the triple threat world heavyweight title match the other matches were o.k. however I believe that if the WWE are as clever as they make they are then they will try to make Wrestlemaina 21 the biggest one yet. This means big hype, big matches and major superstars returning to the squared circle once again. I also think that the cross-over promotional matches from last year were an excellent idea and should happen again at Wrestlemania 21. Last year there were three matches, Kane Vs Undertaker, Brock Lesnar Vs Goldberg and the divas match.  <br /> <br />Here are the matches that I would like to see at Wrestlemania 21: <br /> <br />Match 1: Fatal-4-Way for the U.S Title <br />Rey Mysterio vs. RVD vs. Eddie Gurrerro vs. Carlito Caribbean Cool (Champion) <br /> <br />This will be an excellent opener with lots of high flying moves and fast paced action. There should be a part at the end of the match where Rey and Carlito are down and so Eddie does the frog splash on Carlito at the same time as RVD does the 5 star frog splash on Rey and so both go for the cover at the same time and the referee does not know who to count for. I would like RVD to win this match as he truly deserves a major title and not just the tag team titles. (The match would be a 5/5 rating) <br /> <br />Match 2: WWE Women's Championship Match <br />Trish Stratus vs. Lita (Champ) <br />I must admit I always thought that women's matches only took place for the divas to show off but I was surprised when I saw Lita vs. Trish on Raw (6th December). The match was actually quite entertaining with some close pin falls and some cool moves by either woman, though saying that Lita still needs to improve on her in ring movement as it is still quite sloppy. Anyway their Raw match was good let's hope that if they wrestle again at Wrestlemania it is a better match. (Should; be a 3/5 rating). <br /> <br />Match 3: Inter-promotional Match - Iron Man Match <br />Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit <br /> <br />These two have had many matches over the years some were instant classics (ultimate submission) and some were not. But these two are still two of the best technical wrestlers alive today and I believe would make an amazing Ironman match. This rivalry would begin at the Royal Rumble where Angle is being interviewed and is claming to be the best wrestler in the WWE today and as always boasting about his Gold Medals when Benoit interrupts the interview and begins to insult Angle. Angle then claims that he will win the royal rumble and win the WWE Title at Wrestlemania 21. Benoit laughs and asks Angle about how last year (Wrestlemania 20) how he won the Royal Rumble even though he came in number one and then went on to win the World Heavyweight Title whereas on the same night Angle lost to Eddie Gurrerro because of his boot slipping off. Benoit laughs at how Angle has not won the title since and has not even been in a WWE title match. They both argue and then in the Rumble Benoit Eliminates Angle. Then Angle comes back in and hits Benoit with a chair. After the rumble Angle interferes in Benoit's matches on Raw. The rivalry continues when Benoit causes Angle to lose his match at No Way Out. Then Angle demands Vince to make the match and so the iron man match is made.  <br />The match itself will be excellent with Angle tapping out to cross face and Benoit to the Anklelock. I would like Benoit to win the match  (Match would be a 5/5 rating). <br /> <br />Match 4: Fatal-4-way Ladder match for the Intercontinental Title. <br />Edge vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin (champion) <br /> <br />This will obviously be one of the best matches of the night. Lots of excitement that happens in ladder matches and the ladder is used in many innovative ways to bust the superstars open. Jericho does the walls of Jericho on Christian on top of the ladder. Also when Christianis hanging from the title Edge does a flying spear from the top rope. Jericho does a moonsault from the ladder to Edge through a table. Jericho wins the match and becomes the intercontinental champ for the eighth time. (Defiantly would be 5/5 and one of the best ladder matches ever) <br /> <br />Match 5: Triple H vs. The Rock <br /> <br />The Rock returns just before Wrestlemania as he did last year and as he usually does will insult Triple H. This match was set up when Eugene told The Rock that Triple H is his favourite wrestler but because of the Rocks Hollywood career it was left undeveloped. But hopefully these two will build a rivalry until Eric Bishoff makes the match and it should be a good match but not the best of the night. Triple H has lost some of his in ring ability and can sometime underperform. I would want Tripe H to win as I can't stand The Rock (3/5 rated match) <br /> <br />Match 6: World Tag Team Title Match - A 3-team tag team turmoil. <br /> <br />Rhyno & Tajiri vs. La Resistance vs. Eugene & William Regal (champions) <br /> <br />Should be a normal tag team match with Eugene doing his usual frolicking around. Hopefully Rhyno and Tajiri will win, as they truly deserve them. (2/5 rating)  <br /> <br />Match 8: WWE Cruiserweight Title Match  <br /> <br />Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman (champion - after beating Funaki on Smackdown) <br />These two hate each other to the max and after Chavo's return from his injury; have not yet been in a singles match so Chavo has not got his true revenge on Kidman for what he did to him. This will be an excellent match with highflying moves and lots of close pin falls. Kidman will hit the shooting start press but Chavo will kick out of the pin. Chavo will hit the gori-bomb but Kidman will kick out. Finally Chavo will do the shooting start press, pin Kidman and win the title as well as getting his revenge. (4/5 rating) <br /> <br />Match 9: WWE Tag Team Title Match - 4 team Tag Team Turmoil <br /> <br />Dudley Boys vs. Hardcore Holly & Daniel Puder vs. Rene Dupree & Kenzo Suzuki vs. Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak (champions) <br /> <br />Should be a better than the Raw Tag team title matches with more intense fighting. Luther will dominate and there will be some close pin falls. Luther and Jindrak should retain the titles but I think Hardcore Holly & Puder will win so that WWE can boost the promotion of Daniel Puder as a real wrestler. (3/5 match)  <br /> <br />Match 10: Booker T vs. JBL <br />This match would take place because Booker T would come out on Smackdown and make fun of JBL for losing the title to Undertaker at No Way Out. JBL would get his cabinet to attack Booker T. Theodore Long would make a tag match on Smackdown being JBL & Orlando Jordan vs. Undertaker & Booker T. JBL would cheat and pin Booker T causing Booker to demand a match against JBL at Wrestlemania. (To be honest I don't think this match will really happen I'm just saying it, as I have not put them in a match yet) If the match happened will be better than their Survivor Series match and will be an o.k. Match. I would want Booker T to win, as JBL is getting boring now. (Should be a 3/5 rating) <br /> <br />Match 11: Last man Standing Match <br />Batista vs. Kane <br /> <br />I've always wanted these two to have a proper match with no interferences. Even though they have had matches in the past they have usually been interrupted or someone has helped Batista to win and so these two have not had a proper match. I believe that these two are of equal strength and power and so could make an excellent last man standing match. A normal match would not be enough for what these two can truly do to each other. This rivalry will start at the Royal Rumble where Batista Impressively Lifts Kane up in the air and throws him out of the ring. Kane will get furious and will go back in and the two will start to fight until Kane is forced out by the referees. The rivalry will continue to develop on Raw week after week asboth say they are better and bigger than the other. Bishoff will then say that the bigger and better man will be the man who is the last man standing at Wrestlemania 21. This match itself should be a classic and in the words of JR \\" a true slobberknocker\\". There will be no Interference, as Evolution would have already split up by the Royal Rumble. Both men will be busted open and Kane will Choke slam Batista through the Spanish Announce table. This should be long match. I would like Batista to win and be the last man standing as I believe he is better than Kane. (4/5 Should be a Brutal and awesome match) <br />    <br />Match 11: Inter-promotional Match <br /> <br />Randy Orton vs. John Cena <br /> <br />For some reason I believe that this match will defiantly take place at Wrestlemania 21 and I will be quite surprised if it doesn't. These two came into the WWE at roughly the same time and are almost the same age. They are both young and are excellent athletes; they both are very popular with the fans and are worthy of being in main events. I also remember that there was a confrontation between these two backstage at a recent PPV but I'm not sure which one. I believe this match has already been promoted, if you have played the new video game Smackdown Vs Raw then you would know that in the beginning intro we here JR shouting \\"oh my god its Raw Vs Smackdown\\" and we see Orton and Cena fighting in the ring. I believe that if this match happened it will a superb match with close falls and some awesome wrestling. Orton would be on the top rope and would do his trademark splash but Cena will catch him on his shoulders and do the FU. I wouldn't care who wins that match as in my view both are as good as each other and both deserve to win. (Would be a 5/5 rated match) <br /> <br />Match 11: WWE Title Match - Triple threat match  <br /> <br />Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker (champion)  <br /> <br />Ok... o.k...  I know why Brock Lesnar? But I would not have includedhim if not for one thing. I saw Armageddon 2004 two days before I wrote this review and if you remember in the 3-on-1-handicap match Big show used an F-5 to pin Mark Jindrak and win. Now this may be just me but why would they make Big Show use an F-5 all of a sudden, WWE don't usually do this unless there is a specific reason. In my view this usually means two things: 1 being that Brock has defiantly left WWE for good and so his finisher was given to Big Show permanently, or 2 for causing a storyline in which Brock makes his return. Brock would show up at the Royal Rumble and eliminate the Big Show. Then these two would argue for who should face Undertaker at Wrestlemania 21 for the WWE title. They would have singles match at No Way Out, which Lesnar would win, but by cheating. Theodore Long would settle the argument by making this triple threat match for Wrestlemania 21. The match will be excellent with all three superstars giving their best. Taker would tombstone Lesnar but Lesnar will kick out. Big Show will double chokeslam on Lesnar and Taker though the Smackdown Announce table. This will be a good long match, and I would want Undertaker to win as he deserves to remain the champion for longer, and plus he would continue his Wrestlemania winning streak. (Should be a 5/5 rating match). <br />BUT: if Lesnar doesn't not return then it would be Big Show vs. Undertaker and would still be a good match.  <br /> <br />Match 12: World Heavyweight Title Match - Hell In A Cell  <br /> <br />Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels (champion) <br /> <br />I know... I know a dream match... is very unlikely for it to actually happen, but come on you know if it did it would probably be the match of the night. Even if it was not a Hell in A cell and just a singles match it would still be amazing. This is how I think this match would be set up. Shawn Michaels will return on Raw and would win the vacated World heavyweight Title by beating Edge (this would allow him to get the title as well as having his revenge on Edge for costing him the title at Taboo Tuesday). Then at the Royal Rumble Stone Cold Steve Austin would make his shocking return by knocking out Christian and taking his place in the Rumble match. He would win the Royal Rumble and so it would mean that he faces Michaels at Wrestlemania. Even though I would prefer it to be a Hell in A cell the match would still be good if it was not. If it is a Hell in A Cell the match will be absolutely amazing. Will be long and very bloody. Both me will give it their all and would be exhausted by the end of the match. They would leave the cell and climb on the top where they fight each other and try to push each other from the top. Austin would DDT Michaels on the top of the cell causing it to break and they would fall in the ring. Both men would be down and then Michaels gets up and sets Austin up for the sweet chin music just as he is going to hit Austin, he blocks it and hits the Stunner. Both men then collapse but Austin manages to fall on top of Michaels and the ref counts three causing Austin to win the World Heavyweight title. Sounds good but is very unlikely to happen. I would want Austin to win because we all want to see him as the champ again. (Would be the best match of the night - 5/5). I think I speak for every WWE fan when I say \\"PLEASE WWE MAKE THIS MATCH\\"  <br /> <br />So there it is, Wrestlemania 21 - the way I would make it if I were making the matches. 12 superb matches, some realistic some just plain dream matches but if this happened then it would defiantly be the greatest Wrestlemania of ALL time and by god I mean it.  <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I fell in love with this movie from the get-go. Somehow, I avoided seeing it in the theatre, but rented it soon after the DVD release. Instant obsession.  <br /> <br />It boils down to this, though: If you hate musicals, you will hate this movie. Because IT IS A MUSICAL. If you love musicals, you will probably love this movie. If you love musicals, Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGreggor, Baz Luhrmann, and the early 1900s in Paris, you will adore this movie. <br /> <br />The DVD is fantastic. Buy this!
B0000AQVCL|2.0|Ok, I'm not going to go on a long rant, but I would like to say I bought this CD based on its superb ratings on amazon and the three cool songs already released on the radio...what a mistake.  Beyond \\"Cold Hard B*tch\\", \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", and \\"Rollover DJ\\", there is nothing to this album.  The lyrics are weak and the music uses the same three or four chords of every other crap rock band, not to mention that it all sound the same.  Truly a waste of money and time.  Download the three good ones and save your money.
B000089RVX|2.0|It really is a shame, because Evanescence has a lot of potential. When I first heard them on the radio, Amy Lee's vocals captivated me and their sound drew me in.  When I listened to this album, I was sorely disappointed. <br /> <br />You would do well in sticking to just a single because the album pretty much all sounds the same. It's as though they liked one song and decided to make the rest a slight variation of the first one they recorded.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, goth-rock you may be, but not everyone is so obssessed with the vampire mystique, and it seems every song here could apply to the undead. Been done before, and quite frankly, it's sort of boring and pretentious. <br /> <br />Maybe they will evolve, and I hope they do, because Amy Lee can seriously sing, and hers is a distinct voice that deserves to be heard.
B0002234LS|2.0|I remember seeing this movie before when it was called \\"The Shining.\\"  I liked that one better.<br /><br />The paper-thin story is derivative at best.  One of the story elements that I particularly don't care for is the Omniscient, Omnipotent Villain (OOV).  And the OOV is definitely a main feature of this film.  The \\"twist\\" is not particularly surprising, although it does show a bit of directorial flair absent from the remainder of the movie.  Further, the pacing of this movie, which I'm sure was characterized by the studio as \\"deliberate,\\" descends beyond that into \\"tedious.\\"<br /><br />The performances can't be faulted; they are all very good.  In particular, Johnny Depp carries this entire film on his shoulders.  I suspect this would have been a one-star film with anyone but Depp in the lead role.  However, great performances alone can't carry the entire weight of a movie, and this one collapses on the shaky foundation of its script.
B00005RYL2|5.0|Forget the series, and please, please, forget the stupid sequels. This is the only Highlander that matters because anything that came after it was just plain idiotic.    Christopher Lambert is an Immortal. Unless you lop off his head, he will live on forever and ever. This doesn't necessarily go over well in his 16th century Scottish village, but that is the least of his problems. We get the background in a series of flashbacks from the 20th century MacLeod, and to me, the past was always more interesting than the present. Not that the present is not interesting either. In fact, the movie as a whole, is mesmerizing.    There can only be one, and Kurgan, a rather nasty Immortal, is out to find our Highlander and do him like he did MacLeod's mentor (Sean Connery), which is basically lop off his head and drain him of his power. Mind you, MacLeod is out to do the same to Kurgan because there can be only one!    This is a rather simplistic overview of the plot, but to sit here and explain it in detail would be confusing to both the reader and the author of this review. There is simply too much to tell and explain, and what is the fun in that? This is a magical movie, and you just don't give away the good stuff. This is the type of movie that you just sit down, watch, and lose yourself in.    The 20th century love interest is the weakest part in this movie. Brenda (Roxanne Hart), is hardly compelling, a bit on the annoying side, and her look was dated even in 1986.  She can't act to save her life. But it doesn't matter, because this fantasy-adventure has everything that Hollywood lacked at the time, and everyone else did an outstanding job, giving this movie the cult classic status it deserves. Christopher Lambert never did anything that mattered again as far as I am concerned.    The soundtrack, by Queen, is phenomenal, and though a soundtrack does not make a movie, unless it's \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Tommy\\", it is worth mentioning because it is truly beautiful.

B00007EBAG|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a total TTD fan (Sananda)and that I wanted so badly to like this cd however, it was a total disappointment.<br /><br />Every song on here is dull... tired... low energy.  What happened to the raw passion... the funk... the voice that when heard, evoked a mixture of Otis Redding and Janis Joplin with a just let it RIP!!! sound.<br /><br />Sounds like he is holding back on every song and what is up with this band... even when he does try to give you a sampling of what was, the band falls short.<br /><br />True story... my nephew who his 16 years old (totally into RAP... I don't think he has ever heard any of TTD music) was riding with me in my car.. I popped in Vibrator.. Holding on to You to be exact, and my nephew made the statement... \\"who is that... he sho nuff sound like he is holdin on for dear life!\\"<br /><br />That's the TTD (Sananda) that would make you listen... even if you didn't want to!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't knock spiritually, evolution, change, etc. however, seems like he has MORPHED into the run of the mill POP singer.<br /><br />Whoa is me!!!!  Where did the funk... the stank go.  Bring it back please!
140004281X|5.0|Ms. Alice Munro once again shows her unique understanding of the feminine spirit in this collection of short story treasures of women searching their souls, seeking and finding themselves through the triumph and tragedy of the journey that is life. Highly recommend. Another women's classic
B000092ZYX|5.0|I know most die-hard fans won't agree but i can listen to this over and over
B00005LC1H|5.0|It's a crime I say!!!  How can there only be 12 of these gems in the world?  I searched and searched and then I found out that this is all there is.  There ain't no more folks.  Fawlty Towers is funny for more than one reason.  Generally, British sitcoms are not as rigid as American sitcoms.  Then there is the language itself.  Pronounciations and accents make things sound even funnier.  I would imagine that you've never called your wife a \\"stupid cloth eared beet\\" before.  John Cleese is simply mad.  He's very tall and the sight of him doing his slapstick physical comedy is hilarious.   <br /> <br />You can usually see Fawlty Towers and all the other \\"Britcoms\\" on PBS but they go through periods where they remove certain shows from the air from time to time.  You may remember John Cleese from his younger days with Monty Python's Flying Circus, which I didn't watch for years because I thought it was a circus show.  What a fool was I. <br /> <br /> <br />Here are some of my favorites that you simply must see: <br /> <br />The Corpse and the Kipper - A guest dies during the night but when Basil Fawlty brings his breafast in the morning he doesn't even notice the guy is dead! <br /> <br />The Health Inspector - The Health Inspector comes to perform a suprise inspection.  Little does Basil know that Manuel has a pet rat that gets loose in the hotel.  Manuel thinks it's a hamster.  Everyone tries to catch the rat while keeping it hush-hush from the inspector.  This episode is wild. <br /> <br />The Germans - Basil Fawlty's done himself a mischief and gotten a concusion.  He leaves the hospital insisting that he's okay because the Germans are coming and he must be there.  Add that to the fact that he can't speak German and watch the fun. <br /> <br />Gourmet Night - Basil tries to cater to the upper crust of British Society by offering a Gourmet Night at the hotel.  It doesn't go well.  The chef (a male) gets drunk and falls in love with Manuel.   There's no dinner to serve and Basil orders it from another restaurant.  He has to pick it up but he gets stuck because the car that he tried to fix himself stops running.   He threatens the car but when that doesn't work, he decides to beat the car with a switch!  When he finally gets back his dinner is not quite what he expected. <br /> <br />The Anniversary - Basil and his wife have a bit of a row (fight) and she leaves just when he's all set to suprise her with a party.  He decides to have the maid pretend that she is his wife.  I can't even explain the rest.  It's too nuts! <br /> <br />You must get this DVD especially if you love Britcoms.  You'll laugh from beginning to end.
1573301183|5.0|I don't know why that loser James G's comment is at the top, but Alice in Chains and Layne's performance were both amazing.  Maybe James G needs to have his music processed and run through the mix board, or just can't appreciate live music, but Layne was awesome in this Unplugged.  Got Me Wrong was WAY better than on SAP.  It is actually the song that got me into AIC.  The video also has a few funny moments and a screw-up on Layne's behalf that is quite comical.  RIP Layne  PS  Bass Guitar is easy.  That is why Mike Starr was easily replaced.  Will never replace Layne.
0060594888|5.0|After getting The Success Principles home, I was totally blown away at its thorough coverage of the subject. I am so used to getting a book of 7 this or 10 that's, that now those books seem very incomplete in comparison. This book has 64 chapters each devoted to addressing success from all standpoints, and just as important, giving me the 'how' to get there from where I am. I am so inspired to try everything out! There are also personal true stories to show how these principles work in the real world. There is a chapter on \\"Tell the Truth Faster\\" and even though I feel I am a very honest person, the story about Marilyn Tam telling the truth to the CEO of Nike really impressed me. I realized that telling the truth is more than saying the truth, it is also not withholding things that might be uncomfortable, shocking, risky, or controversial. I now have a concrete example of how it worked for Marilyn and Nike and am now committed to using it more in my life.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that the chapters are all self contained. I'm so busy, I seldom read novels and I prefer short stories. I can open this book to any interesting topic from \\"Ask! Ask! Ask!\\"  to \\" Transform your inner critic into an inner coach\\" and in no time I have new revelations.  By the way, even on the subject of asking which I thought I knew something about, the contents brought a smile to my face because I know the 5 tips described there could get me powerful results. All the chapters seem well thought out, but this one might have an especially strong punch because it says that Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen wrote a whole book just on the science of asking. This includes anything from a favor to a raise, or even a large contract. The fifth tip by the way is \\"Ask repeatedly.\\" Even though 5 year-old's know this, as adults we are conditioned to forget to ask again, or we take a no as a personal rejection, or we just give up. However, conditions and people change with time and a yes on the third asking can be just as sweet. Even in relationships how often has one even failed to ask the first time and then blamed the other for now fulfilling a desire? The Success Principles has really opened my eyes in the area of asking.<br /><br />The only downside to this book that I can think of is wishing it had been published about 10 years ago. However, using the title of chapter 63, \\"Start Now!... Just Do It!\\"  I'm taking a chapter/concept at a time, right now, and applying it in my life. This book is now my trusted guide and inspiring motivator for success.
B00005O5CM|4.0|This movie is a classic -- and a classic example of \\"you can't catch lightning in a bottle twice\\" (the sequel was dreadful).  It sets out to be a totlally formula movie -- then violates the formula at every possible point.  Is Reese Witherspoon a great actress?  No.  But she carries this role -- including the transition between CULA and Harvard Law School.  Even the idea that she doesn't get her boyfriend back at the end because she DOESN'T WANT HIM is fresh and original.  And who can forget the director pulling the camera back from her pool-scene video admissions essay to that room full of Harvard \\"suits\\" discussing why she should be admitted.   <br /> <br />The script is intelligent, and if it includes a few logical holes, so what?  It carries them off.  I have to say that the actress (I don't remember her name) who played Brooke Taylor Windham was wonderful.  Her innocence, her unaltering faith in Elle, and so on were understated and believable. <br /> <br />But of all the bits in the film, the most brilliant (aside from uncovering that the pool boy was gay) was the use of Racquel Welch as Windham's ex-wife.  Glamour woman extraordinaire, and the first look we have of her is in the mud-room in a spa, wrapped in a blanket, with a mud-pack on her face and a cucumber slice in each eye.  It takes an actor with a real sense of the absurd to parody herself like that. <br /> <br />Oh, yes.  The resolution of the plot may have been absurd too, but it hangs together logically.  Quite a coup, considering the light touch of the whole film. <br /> <br />But no more sequels.
B0001I55OC|2.0|I must agree with most who say the acting in this movie was beyond sub par.  The script made little sense and had so many plot holes that it was hard to stick with it to the end.  If there is a God, Paul Walkers' movie career should end here.  His \\"whoa, dude\\" style of performance was completely out of place in the film, and I really doubt that he has the talent to pull off any other type of role.  Avoid [...] and hopefully Crichton will have the sense to be more careful when green-lighting adaptations of his novels.
B00009Z576|4.0|I'm so glad to listen to Drama again after many years. This is a truly fantastic album, despite its changes to the \\"classic\\" lineup. I didn't discover Yes until the 80's, so I can understand if Yes fans in 1980 were in an uproar that Anderson was missing. But, from a more objective point of view, the music on this album is fantastic! I personally love every track. \\"Does It Really Happen?\\" is a lost gem classic, and \\"Machine Messiah\\" and \\"Fugit\\" are just too perfect to quibble with. Downes *and* Horn are great on this CD, in my opinion, and Howe/Squire/White have something to write home about with their delivery, and finally sound great (unlike the poorly produced Tormato). <br /> <br />I never realized how grateful I was that Anderson & Wakeman left until I heard these Paris session bonus tracks. Yuck! At least they had the good sense to know it wasn't happening and left. Jon went on to make a great CD, in my opinion (even though much of it is more pop) with Song of Seven which sounds way better than these outtakes. They actually kept Yes' integrity by leaving the band instead of making uninspired music (a move which arguably was not always exercised at other times of the band's history). <br /> <br />So, we get the best of what the boys were able to write at the time: an incredible revamped Yes (who actually were being *progressive*!) and a good Anderson solo album. I've gotta say, I wouldn't have minded a follow-up album from this line-up to see what else they could cook up, esp. if Squire & Howe kept up the aggressive edge.
B00004Z400|5.0|The Deftones progression through what really should be considered metal has been steady, however the evolution of their music has never seen the kind of leap they took with White Pony.  The album is really driven by its simple chord progression, but the way Moreno's eclectic voice pierces through the background works to beautiful results.  This is one of those albums which doesn't have a single second of filler, and keeps your interest through its entirety.  If the Deftones ever put out another album that even comes close to this, it just might put them at the absolute top of their genre.  Judging by the way White Pony sounds, we can only pray that they do.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I am very disappointed with the majority of the reviews I have read for this DVD.  I pretty much see either a one-star review with a particularly right-wing rant or a five-star review with a leftist rant.  Unfortunately, I would be willing to bet that a lot of the one-star reviews came from people who did not watch the movive, and the five-star reviews came from people who did not pay too much attention to it. <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentry that was compiled brilliantly.  Yes, there is a liberal spin on it.  It's Michael Moore, what do you expect?  If you get over it, you will learn quite a bit from this movie.  It is quite obvious when there is a slight distortion of stats; you can look past it.  The vast majority of the information in this movie is, in fact, true.  The conservative 'documentry' that was made in response to this movie, 'Fahrenhype 9/11', actually contains a lot less truth than this one. <br /> <br />I really suggest that you put your politcal sentiments aside and enjoy this movie.  Watch it looking neither to bash the president or with such a closed mind that you won't accept any information as fact.  This is a critically acclaimed documentary for a reason: it was put together very well, and no one should question Michael Moore's skill at drawing the emotions he intended to draw.  Get over politics and learn something about current events.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is more informative than CNN or Fox News was during the past couple months. <br /> <br />In short: if you're intelligent enough to look past the liberal bias and/or watch this movie with an open mind, I strongly suggest it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Years ago, another little band from California tried to write a \\"punk opera\\" of sorts, to positive but mixed results.  That band was NOFX, and the album was called \\"The Decline.\\"  They were also a established punk band trying to push the envelope and do something different, but it lacked the commercial appeal to really get noticed.  Years later, Green Day attempts to accomplish the same task, and succeeds better than anyone could have imagined.<br /><br />This is an album which can be enjoyed by any fan of melodic rock, but the ones who can really appreciate it are the same who have been fans of the band since the early Lookout! records days.  This album is a movement, which should be listened to from top to bottom.  If you don't mind reading through the lines at some points, most of this album gives us a accurate report of American Society in 2004.  It almost predicts that this America will re-elect someone like George Bush, and still wonder why their job security is worse than it's ever been.  Every track on the disc has its place, but my 2 standouts are the epic jams \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and especially \\"Homecoming.\\"
B00003CXCT|3.0|My brother got me started on StarWars when I was probably 6yrs of age and Now I am 18 and I still love starwars, but This DVD set kinda blows. I actually went to several Half Price Book stores just so I can find The Original unrestored releases of the New Hope, empire strikes back, and return of the jedi. <br />I think George Lucas is a brilliant writer and Director but he is too much of a perfectionist. He even went as far as to take out the Original Anakin Skywalker from the ending of Return OF the Jedi and replaced him with Anakin from Episode 2. <br /> <br />I like the fact that the sound and picture have been restored. <br />And That this set include a 4th disk which contains behind the scenes material. <br />What I started to do was transfer my original unrestored starwars movies over to DVD's. <br />This is the hardware that i have that lets me do it. <br />Leadtek TV tuner <br />Plextor DVD RW drive <br />and a big harddrive
B00063EMJ6|2.0|Agree with others who've said, Neil is the best, this is amazing stuff, but it's mostly on Decade. Why bother releasing this material yet again? Common Shakey....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I took a bit of a risk buying this set.  I'd never seen a single episode, but read the super positive reviews on Amazon and figured I couldn't not like it.  While it took a few episodes to kick in, Firefly proved to be a very unique, original and wonderful series! <br /> <br />Typical of any Joss Whedon show (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel), Firefly is filled with humorous and witty dialogue, well thought-out and deep characters, and a plethora of secrets within the episodic plot.  Underlying the entire show is a very original and interesting mix of a futuristic world with the familiar elements of the \\"wild west\\".  There's one scene with a gang of henchmen riding through the desert on horseback  while the rich man rides on a slick hovercraft!   <br /> <br />The only drawback of this show is the fact that it's incomplete due to the fact that it was cancelled mid-season!  Such a shame, because there's so much potential for it to blossom into a REALLY GOOD SHOW!  So much was left unanswered.  Why is River wanted so badly by the authorities?  What's gonna happen between Malcolm and Inara?  What's gonna happen with Simon and Kaylee?  What is Shepherd Book all about? <br /> <br />Hopefully, some of those questions will be answered in the upcoming film version of the show, called Serenity.  But if you're a sci-fi fan, Buffy fan, Joss fan, or just a fan of great TV shows, I highly recommend you check out Firefly.  It's truly one of the best shows I've ever seen.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|As far as big-studio Hollywood movies go, this is a worthy movie delivered in a subtly slick fashion, wrapped around a good heart -- namely that of Jamie Foxx's character, a cab driver who aspires to be more, and perhaps in another life, his big heart would have taken him onto a more lucrative path, or one more fulfilling. His dreams lead him to get into his cab everyday, serving people who have places to go, helping them along their own dreams, while his own get put on hold. But the movie's not as deep as it sounds. It's a rather straightforward, simple movie that goes easily on a linear path from point A to point B. If it weren't for Jamie Foxx's well-delivered, kind-hearted portrayal, (one that we can readily feel/empathize with), this movie would be yet another one for the low-budget, clearance bin. This is a step in the right direction for American filmmakers and studios who tend to place CGI, special effects and car chases over everything else, but the film as a whole lacks heart -- and simply having \\"quiet\\" scenes with melancholy music as Foxx's character's cab drives lonely, nighttime stretches of highway doesn't substitute for substance/depth. If only the film aimed a little bit higher, for a more wise, intelligent audience, it could have been one to buy and deserve repeated viewings. But as it is, it's a nice-looking, ultimately feel-good movie colored with dark blue hew of night. And unfortunately, once it hits its near-the-end climax, most viewers will already know what's going to happen and who's going to be there at the end as the credits roll. If only it aimed a little higher, and not for the simpleton audiences that regard the likes of \\"The Last Samurai,\\" \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (with Ben Affleck) and other big-name blockbuster-type movies as great films. As it stands, it's a mere, superficially entertaining movie which tries to pass off slick cinematography and melancholy notes as heart/substance -- a nice diversion for a couple hours, but not all too memorable, with little that you can't catch upon your first viewing.ble, with little that you can't catch upon your first viewing.
B00005JN0T|2.0|The Region 4 release in Australia has TWO discs with lots of behind-the-scenes and deleted scenes etc, it also has not one but three commentaries! I would normally purchase the Region 1 version from Amazon in NTSC because it is running at the correct speed of 24fps, but with all the extras available here in Sydney, Ive decided to get the PAL version at 25fps. Perhaps they will announce a special addition after you have already brought the U.S. version!!!! The same thing happened with the Australian 2-disc of The Day After Tomorrow -  it has a separate disc with a lot more special features. Has the studio tried to fit everything on one disc and therefore removed alot of the special features? Also, because these Australian versions have only the movie on one disc, there is far less compression.
B0000027RL|5.0|Truly one of the best albums of all time. There are people listing each song and giving a rating or comparing them to Nirvana, or dear God a much newer band that has since broken up that I won't even mention. This is not Pearl Jam's greatest hits, it's their record they put out in 1991. They have since put out very good records with very good tracks, including their latest effort. All this time and I'm not even talking about the record, ask yourself these 2 questions. 1.Do I like rock music? 2.Do I like alternate music? If your answers are both yes, you need to own this album, period. 95/100
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I cannot understand where some of these negative reviews are coming from.  Boring?  This was one of the most action-packed movies of the summer.  The club scene was about as good as the club scene in Blade.  The story DID NOT suck.  It was awesome.  It had mystery and suspense, and I had my eyes fixed to the screen throughout the entire 2 hours.  If you don't believe me, try renting it before you buy it.  It is definetly worth renting for all you skeptics out there.  <br />(P.S. Cruise is the man.)
B00005JMCN|1.0|If you're into American Idol, if you like Nicholas Sparks books, and if you're excited about Lindsay Lohan's new album, this movie is totally for you.  If, however, you have read a book or grown up outside of a cave, you will thoroughly detest this awful, awful movie.  Seeing how many positive, glowing reviews this horrific movie received is sincerely scary.  No wonder so many modern movies are terrible if this movie is apparently so well liked.
B000669GAI|5.0|\\"Jeremy\\" got me hooked, Eddie's voice kept me interested, and solid album after album put them in the history books.<br /><br />Looking back over the years and all of the albums Pearl Jam has put out, you'll see each album was completely different in every way from the next.  I've never seen a band offer so many different sounds.  Sure, there's no denying Eddie lost his voice around the \\"No Code\\" album, and it got progressively worse over the years.  Even with their front man being a shadow vocally of what he once was, they still made some amazing music.<br /><br />Nirvana may have opened the flood gates for Grunge/Alternative music, but Pearl Jam is the band that put Seattle on the map, as far as I see it.<br /><br />Most Pearl Jam fans have every song in this collection, but those of you who read this who gave up on Pearl Jam after the \\"Vitalogy\\" album (like most people did), then you're in for a treat.  The combination of Eddie's declining vocal power, the ticketmaster thing, and Pearl Jam refusing to make videos anymore kind of shut them off from being mainstream any longer.  It's all as well though... they still made some classic music over those years, and aren't done yet.
B00004T9UF|5.0|have you ever been unexpressably angry? well so has Eminem but he can express it. there is no way to say it, this album is only for you if you have been chewed up and spat out atleast 4 times in your life. if not you will not listen to the words he says and most importantly the ones he dosen't say. with eminem charistic wit and lyrical portrates. he lets you deeper into his life and mind as twisted as any. take him or leave him alone. that is clear hear the samples.
1592400876|4.0|It has always amazed me how tolerant we are of poor spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  These skills are the building block of education and professionalism.  Imagine my surprise when someone actually decided to write a book about proper punctuation!<br /><br />What's great about this book isn't how witty it is (or isn't).  What's great about this book is that it was badly needed and then written in such a palatable manner.<br /><br />I think this book would make a great present, especially for your friends or family members who have gotten lazy with two of their three R's.  That's probably a lot of your family and friends.
B00069YDXU|1.0|I soooo wanted to like this DVD concert, and soooo looked forward to it.  I'm an original ELP nut, going back to having seen their shows after the Brain Salad Surgery release and on the Works tour (lucky enought to have seen them with the full orchestra).  In the mid-70's and early 80's nobody was a bigger ELP fan than I. <br /> <br />That said, I can't excuse the terrible production values of this DVD.  I'm so sick of concert DVD's released with sound quality that no one would ever accept from a current movie release.  The sound here simply sucks - and this thru a system with more than $40,000 of equipment.  Keith's keyboards come in at various volumes, Carl's drums are not distinct in the least, and Greg's bass and singing are a muddy mess.  This might be one of those instances that those with lesser home theater system might not notice - but state of the art this is not (not even average compared to today's best).  It all sounds like something recorded by a bootlegger in the audience. <br /> <br />Performance-wise, the boys are clearly past their prime here, and it's a shame to see a once unbelievable performance band reduced to kinda-getting-by.  Keith's keyboards are not as sharp as the once were, and he occassionally seems to be off, time-wise, with his mates.  Carl was once the most promising of the rock drummers, with technical skill and energy that were far above his peers.  His playing here has none of the fire and technical acumen it once had.  Greg seems solid by comparison; both in playing and singing, but the aforementioned poor sound quality makes it hard to tell. <br /> <br />Unless you gotta have something to remind you of what this band once was, I'd save your money.  This is nothing like the greatness of their prime performances.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I'll be the first to admit, when I heard the beginning of Capricorn on my tv one day I was like \\"what the heck is this?!\\" and continued to scowl and whathaveyou. After the song finished, however, I almost immediately went to download it. Can't. Get. Enough. Of. This. Band. Jared Leto, I have to say, has an incredible voice; something you really don't expect from actor-turned-musicians nowadays. It's shocking.  <br />This is a cd you have to sit down and listen to though, at least the first time. I was completely entranced and could do nothing else but listen. The combination of Leto's vocals and that beautiful spacy guitar sound is hypnotic... in a good way. Once this band has got you, you're gone for good. A+++++++++++.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|Return of the Living Dead may be one of those movies that I rate higher then it deserves, probably because I saw it as a kid and loved it. The original ROTLD had me on the edge of my seat, but I was no fan of the ending, but this one here, I can honestly say, out of all of the 5 ROTLD movies, this is the only one that has a satisfying ending.  This one kicks off with the Army moving canisters of the toxic gas, as seen in the first movie, that when exposed to dead things that where alive, like humans, they reanimate and return from the dead... or if exposed to the living people, it makes you very sick till you die and become a zombie yourself. One of the canisters being transported falls off the back of one of the army trucks, and is eventually discovered by 3 young boys, 2 of which will not leave it alone and you can guess they are the ones responsible for the gas to be leaked out into the public, which just happens to be conveniently located next to the towns cemetery. Much like the first one, it's about the people trying to survive a zombie outbreak... will they make it or not? Well if you haven't seen the movie you will have to find out for yourself.  I really like this movie better then the first one. Sure, Tarman looked better in the first, and a few ideas had there moment, but the acting in this one surpassed the original in most actors case here. The first one had some over the top acting and guys who really needed acting school, and sure, someone will slam with a negative rating for saying it, but if you really ask yourself, and be honest, you know the acting in the first one was not that great. Even tho this sequel is meant to be more funnier, the acting I feel is a lot better and so the characters to not become as annoying in the end.  These movies contain some pretty good effects. Another Tarman-like creature rises from the toxin barrel, and a few homages to the original movie appear along the way, even getting 2 or 3 cast members of the first film to return playing different characters... yet, much the same characters in ways. That fact confused some people when watching this film, as they wondered if they where the same character and if this was meant to be a prequel? But no, it is not, I guess the filmamkers felt they should have some returning actors from the first one to get fan interest in going to see it.  On this DVD many people are complaining that the original score has been replaced... really, it's only as few songs here and there that the company who made this must not have gotten the copyrights to again to release them on this DVD. But hey, I don't see those complaining about it complaining that the first one suffered the same fate and it's had songs changed and voices re-recorded. I'm not 100% positive, but I think the region 2 (UK) and Region 4 (Australia) versions have not been altered. I managed to get a download version of the original release, and honestly, I didn't hear any difference, and mine is region 4. Don't quote me on it tho, I didn't bother to analyze every second of the film.  Bonus features include an audio commentary and a trailer. For better bonus content, check out \\"More Brains! A Return to the Living Dead\\"
B000002GLE|5.0|A great live-release, the sound is great, the songs are great, the performing is great - and yes - Sting is great, performing with his great band at their very best! <br /> <br />Low Life, We Work The Black Seam, I Burn For You and Consider Me Gone are my personal favorites on the album - but as I am sitting here now I feel like I am forgetting something (As these words were spoken, I swear... yes well...) <br /> <br />As mentioned the sound and recording (of course) is nearly perfect - unexpected for the time of this release - and I never get tired of listening to Branford Marsailles (wrong spelled?) perform on I Burn For You, the solo is great - and clear, and just flows into the room when played loud.  <br /> <br />Sting was performing with his Blue Turtles on The Dream...-tour, so it is a jazzy-experimental-project \\"eternalyzed\\" on the Bring On The Night-release, apparently handpicked songs from different shows on the tour, this is not one Live-show recorded. <br /> <br />He also performs a couple of previously unreleased songs (I think) written in the Police-period (Low Life and Another Day - I hope I'm not wrong here) - other than that he also performs some Police-classics (including a great version of Tea In The Sahara). Of course it includes material from his first solo-album as well. <br /> <br />Are you a fan, but haven't heard this - then do it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Science fiction, when it's good it is inspiring, when it is bad I yell at the TV and throw socks at the screen.  I am not a fan of most of the cheesy sci-fi shows that most people love.  I'm not a fan of any of the new Star Trek's, or Farscape or the Hercules/Zena shows.  I have greatly enjoyed Stargate SG-1 and thought it was the end all of TV sci-fi.  Then a friend sat me down and forced me to watch Firefly.  Five minutes into the pilot episode, a person should know that they are watching something SPECIAL.  No sound in space AND IT WORKS!  Artsy-fartsy camera angles and zoom effects make the CG look as if it were actually filmed and not just rendered.  My wife hates sci-fi and she fell in love with the characters and stories, and has asked to watch episodes back-to-back since getting the DVD.  You can't ask for better character development or for better actors to bring the wonderful script to life. <br /> <br />If you love the Anime movies that come out as boxed sets, you WILL love Firefly.  It is a masterpiece.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The all-new 40th Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is definitely a must-own for all fans of the movie, and has been well worth the wait.  As the editorial review states, this is the third DVD of MARY POPPINS to be released.  The last edition (on the Gold Classics label) featured a great print but scant extras and fans simply knew that the Disney company should have done a better job remastering and releasing one of their most beloved films.  Our prayers have been answered!<br /><br />This brand-new MARY POPPINS features a state-of-the-art new digital restored print (similar to that done on the SNOW WHITE Platinum Edition), and a veritable carpetbag-full of extra features, the big highlight being an audio commentary by Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Karen Dotrice among others.<br /><br />It is indeed a thrilling movie experience.  Out of the dreary London skies soars Mary Poppins, who sets about restoring the love and friendships in the fractured Banks family.  Along the way Mary leads us through many magical adventures including a 'Jolly Holiday' inside a pavement chalk picture, a tea party on the ceiling with Uncle Albert and a dance on the rooftops with Bert and his chimney-sweep pals.<br /><br />Other 'Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious' extras include a sequence deleted from the picture (\\"Chimpanzoo\\"), to an all-new retrospective documemtary with interviews with all the surviving lead cast-members.  Julie Andrews (who has renewed her ties to the Disney family with her role as Queen Clarisse in the PRINCESS DIARIES films) also has a lovely chat with Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman as they reminisce about making the movie.<br /><br />If you own the earlier DVD edition and think you've seen MARY POPPINS think again!  This all-new 40th Anniversary tribute is the ultimate testament to this magical Disney masterpiece!  Buy it today!
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's amazing what songs you remember when you hear the name Green Day. Many probably think of \\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),\\" even though they probably don't know the actual name. And because of that song, Green Day is thought of as a certain kind of band. <br /> <br />With this album, Green Day steps up to the microphone and proudly proclaims \\"We are good, no matter what we do.\\" And it's true, with the Indian sound of \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" and the slow paced \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" proving to fans around the world that Green Day is the best at what they do, and there's a reason they are so popular.  <br /> <br />Anyone who does not have this CD is missing out on what will some day be on the same page as Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" album.
B000002UR7|4.0|Yeah, these guys sound stilted and earnest here, which is probably why I still like it--so was I, listening to this at age 15 when it first came out.  They've transcended so much, and not only themselves, since \\"Creep.\\"  But the high point on this album is the wall of sound that hits you in the mouth on \\"Blow Out\\" after the lilting intro.  The whole album builds toward it and then it explodes.  Their first soundscape, purely guitar-driven and yet a sign of things to come.  It's definitely worth checking out, just for that, if you like their later stuff.
B000093BDX|5.0|Over the years as the Beach Boys faded from the top of the charts and before \\"Kokomo\\", I would see a \\"new\\" Beach Boys album, check it out and it had virtually the same songs (mostly hits) as the previous Beach Boys compilation.  What's with that? Here we have another.  If you don't have one (or several) of the original albums or compilations, I heartily recommend this package to you.  I don't ask for inspired album cuts from \\"Pet Sounds\\" or other albums.  This is all you really need unless you have endless hours to listen.  (If you do, there's enough BB music to sate your obsession).  There's plenty of good music and memories for many of us.  This compilation will do very nicely, thank you, until the next one comes along.  (Check back next week).
B000002KHH|3.0|this music is a little weird.but it's cool in some kind of errie way.ozzie ozbourne did a great job but this is not my cup of tea.stick to \\"ozzie\\" though my fellow metal fans because he is the king of metal!
0156027321|4.0|Other reviews explain the story line very well so I'm writing my segment to let everyone know that this is a wonderful story but I wasn't caught up in it at the beginning.  It wasn't until Part 2 of the book when Pi was out on the Pacific Ocean that I could say the book found my undivided attention.  It is a story of spirituality as well as survival.  I guess when you come right down to it you can't have one without the other.  This is a story for any age.  One that will capture your attention and take your mind to a place it has never ventured.  Yann Martell is a wonderful storyteller.  I believe you will enjoy this story if you don't give up on it at the beginning.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol never disappoints, if you are a person who cherishes innovation , originality, and unadulterated talent. If, however, you are the kind who expects repitition and stagnation, you perhaps will be better off elsewhere.  <br /> <br />Billy Idol will always surprise you, and among his strong points (along with the Bangles) is that you can always tell which album a song comes from. With every album his sound EVOLVES. As the Phoenix self-immolates and then rises anew from its own ashes, Bill Idol discovers himself and his newest music FRESHLY with each album, allowing the album to become its own identity rather than attempting to force it to be something stale that conforms to a mold of what people will EXPECT it SHOULD be.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I, like many, have seen the commericials for Closer, and everytime it came on I would totally swoon over the music, however I never thought much of looking it up. <br /> <br />Big mistake. <br /> <br />A few nights ago I was watching the television show Huff, when at the very end of episode there was this very emotional segment and they were playing 'Delicate'. I right away fell in love with the song and quickly looked it up. To my surprise that sexy voice of Damien Rice was also the singer of 'The Blower's Daughter'. My immediate reaction \\"SCORE!\\" And went out as fast as I could to get the cd. <br /> <br />The moral of the story: <br /> <br />Own this cd, because it will own you. <br /> <br />Need I say more about the sexy voice, the gripping lyrics, the soft music? Well, I think you get the general idea...
B000063DIH|5.0|I am Maiden's #1 fan, so believe me when I say this: DO NOT listen to the bad reviews for this album.  Ignore the critics and the so-called metal fans who call it weak.  It is, quite simply, one of Maiden's top five best ever, and easily the most underrated metal album of all time. <br /> <br />Ah yes, FEAR OF THE DARK.  The last album with Bruce Dickinson.  It followed NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING, which got disastrous reviews but was actually very good.  This is definitely Maiden's most unique and intriguing album.  Nine of the songs are awesome, only three are average. <br /> <br />BE QUICK OR BE DEAD: The heaviest, most aggressive album opener they ever made (although \\"Moonchild\\" will always be the greatest).  Borderline thrash metal, with it's earth-shaking riff and Bruce's nasty vocals.  I love it when he sings in that snarling tone.  This tune rips out of your speakers like a stampede of angry rhinos!  Metallica - eat your hearts out. <br /> <br />FROM HERE TO ETERNITY: How awesome is that chorus?!  Those chants are simply killer!  Classic metal. <br /> <br />AFRAID TO SHOOT STRANGERS: Masterpiece.  The first half of the song is a ballad, in which Bruce proves that he really can sing softer stuff when he wants to.  A very hypnotic vocal melody.  Then, it changes gears and a wonderful guitar riff comes in, followed by a crushing riff and some insane soloing.  Then it reverts back to it's original mellow form.  Excellent song. <br /> <br />FEAR IS THE KEY: One of my top five favorite Maiden songs ever.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why everyone puts down this song.  I don't get it.  The pounding riff, the fascinating vocal melody, the part where it changes tempo in the middle, etc.  Aw God, it's incredible.  It's really more along the lines of Rainbow or someone like that.  My favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />CHILDHOOD'S END: Perhaps the most unique song they ever recorded.  That drum beat is tops, complemented by a rather haunting synth riff.  And again, a killer vocal melody here.  These guys were really on their game when they wrote this stuff!! <br /> <br />WASTING LOVE: Until Bruce comes in with the vocals, it sounds like just another cheesy metal ballad.  But Bruce really saves it from becoming that.  He gives a wonderful performance here, one of his best. <br /> <br />THE FUGITIVE: Aw man, that's gotta be the heaviest riff they ever came up with.  Definitely.  Wall-shaking stuff here!  I love the chorus, and those guitar runs at 3:49 are absolutely mesmerizing.  Whether it was Dave or Janick, I don't know, but it absolutely kills. <br /> <br />CHAINS OF MISERY: Like \\"From Here To Eternity\\", this one has a chanted chorus that will stick in your brain forever.  I still can't get it out of my head. <br /> <br />THE APPARITION: Uh, not that great.  Maybe their weakest song ever. <br /> <br />JUDAS BE MY GUIDE: Nothing special. <br /> <br />WEEKEND WARRIOR: Nothing special. <br /> <br />FEAR OF THE DARK: Now we're cookin'!  Regarded by fans as one of their greatest songs, and I fully agree.  The beggining is very moody, with Bruce giving an almost creepy vocal performance before a devastating riff comes in and it starts to rock like you wouldn't believe!  That riff just might be my favorite of all time.  It positively kicks ass!!  And it ends the same way it began, with a very eerie atmosphere.   <br /> <br />All in all, this album is definitely on par with any of their earlier ones, no matter what anyone says.  Trust me.  Buy it now.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie was terribly boring.  I went with two die-hard liberals and a conservative; everyone but me was asleep for more than half of this movie!  Not to mention if you did research you would discover the truth behind this movie.  It is founded upon lies, misconceptions, and a twisted view of the truth.  Michael Moore has lost all respect and reliability as a movie-maker.  This movie should not be filed under documentary, it should be filed under historical fiction.  Roger and Me was a good movie.  Some of his other work was enjoyable.  This film shows Michael Moore falling to a horrible low.
0062502182|2.0|Thankfully, this book considers itself a 'fable' and not a novel. It reads much like one of those cliched self help manuals we often see in bargin bins at book stores, full of buzz phrases and meaningless cheery advice. The premise of the story is stolen from a '1001 Arabian Nights' tale and the characters come off more like mouth peices for the author than actual characters, but after all it is just a fable. There are a few plus sides to 'The Alchemest'at least. You don't have to agree with everything the author says, but, if anything, this story will at least get you to think. It's a short read too.  It's the type of book I'd recommend only if you have a long bus, train, or plane ride, with little to do.
6304806418|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber in my mind is God.  He is wonderful, and I love his works.  I was thrilled when 'Evita' came to the big screen.  I had mixed feelings on Madonna playing the role, but those feelings were soothed.  She is perfect as Eva Peron.  She has so much passion for the role!  This is the part she was born to play.  Antonio Banderas can sing--who knew?  He is perfect as Che, Eva's opposition.  And can he carry a tune!  Listen to him especially during 'High Flying Adored.'  Wow!!  And let's not forget the legendary Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron.  He, like Madonna, has so much passion for the role.  Would you expect anything else from The Engineer from 'Miss Saigon'?  Make sure you pay attention to 'You Must Love Me,' the song that won the Oscar.<br /><br />Lloyd Webber gives us one of the best productions I have ever seen.  And although 'Cats' is my favorite musical of all time, 'Evita' is my favorite movie.  It's so easy to see why it won the Golden Globe for best picture.  To quote Time magazine, 'You must see \\"Evita.\\"'  Yes, you must.
B0001CCXZW|1.0|This is one of the WB's premiere primetime shows in HD.  Why 1:33 full frame?  Such a good show, such a big mistake.  This DVD set should be in widescreen, period.  4 star show, 1 star DVD set.
B000062YAZ|5.0|In lots of reviews I've written over the years I've made quite a few at least somewhat derogatory comments regarding this album, (though I've certainly never said or believed that it was bad) usually related to a variety of facts, i.e. this is not the most brutal album ever and it never actually was (Seven Churches...), and neither  of those claims would objectively prove this the greatest metal or thrash album ever, even if they were true.  And yeah, I still believe all that, and yeah I still like South of Heaven quite a bit more, but this is still an awesome album, and a deserving classic.<br /><br />While this isn't the heaviest album ever, it is the most unrelentingly intense thrash album I've ever heard. (Darkness Descends is heavier and more intense most of the time, but it lets off and slows down more often)  And, though I prefer the longer thrash songs most of the time, there's something to be said for the straightforward and blazing 2 minute thrash onslaught.  However, this has a negative effect, as well, the individual tracks aren't as impressive as on lots of other particularly strong thrash efforts.  This isn't so much a problem of repetitiousness as it is that the thrash songs that tend to impress me most do so by combining a lot of strong traits, solid solos, longer instrumental sections, more complex arrangements and whatnot. Still, it does what it does, and everything on here works quite well, with the exception of Necropobic, which I find kinda weak, and, in the end, it all adds up to more than a sum of it's parts.<br /><br />The guitar tone on this album is pretty much insane. It isn't as thick as some other thrash tones I've heard, but it's very likely the harshest.  It pretty much takes the distortion as far as it can go without becoming an utterly incoherent roar.  Lots of the time, trem riffs come off as light and weak, because the guitar tone isn't jagged enough. (Hell Awaits, anyone?) Fortunately, that is never the case here, and although it particularly emphasizes endless speed-picked riffs, it never turns into a groove-free black metal blur. (Not that that is always inappropriate, just not appropriate here.)  And, though I still wouldn't call the leads 'good', I've grown less and less irritated by them as the years go by, and now don't mind them, and I suppose they work pretty well from an atmospheric standpoint.  Still, they certainly aren't memorable.  Dave Lombardo's drum performance is nowhere near as effective as it would be on the next two albums, but he's still a pretty devastating drummer.  The album lacks the amazing fills he'd add later, but he's still pretty spectacularly propulsive here.  Araya's bass is MIA, but I don't really care, and he's one of the very best voices in thrash, imho.  He does over do it sometimes on this album, and they sometimes cram too many syllables into too small of a space, but he actually has a voice which is appropriate for the music they're playing. (Something I can't say for about half the rest of the thrash vocalists I've heard).  And, Slayer manages to write some fairly memorable vocal lines some of the time, even if they are so in a rhythmic sense more than a melodic one.<br /><br />As I said before, most of the songs on here aren't truly great, but they have the energy and intensity to carry momentum throughout.  'Angel of Death' is an exception, however, and is every bit the classic it's made out to be.  Everything here fits just right, with solid riffwork from beginning to end a great chorus, and a devastating middle break.  'Raining Blood' is a definite standout too, though it's definitely not quite on the same level as 'Angel of Death'.  Still, a great song, and ya gotta love that main riff/lick.  Postmortem is definitely underrated.  It's contrasts nicely with most the rest of the album, with the solid, crunchy main riff rather than the tremolo madness you here throughout most of the album. (Plus, this makes it all the more effective when it kicks itup to full speed for the final section.) Altar of Sacrifice has some particularly strong, memorable and surprisingly melodic riffing.  It didn't really stick out to me much at first, but it grows on ya.  Criminally Insane is noteworthy too, with possibly the best chorus on the album.<br /><br />Also, the lyrics suck, but who cares, and the artwork is pretty sweet, but that doesn't matter much either. Yeah. That's it. END REVIEW NOW!cks it up to full speed for the final section.) Altar of Sacrifice has some particularly strong, memorable and surprisingly melodic riffing.

B0000DD7LC|3.0|I love Alicia Keys. She's very talented and has an obvious talent for piano and songwriting. Her radio singles are always strong and great R&B/soul songs. Her albums are a mixed bag, though. \\"The Diary\\" has the same problem as her debut. Both start off with a punch, but just grow tiring and repetitive halfway through. <br /> <br />The first half of this album is awesome. \\"Harlem's Nocturne\\" is a cool opening. \\"Karma\\" and \\"Heartburn\\" are catchy R&B songs and I love the medley of \\"If I Was Your Woman/Walk on By.\\" The first single \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" definitely catches yoour ear with its retro soul vibe. The real stand-out is by far her soul ballad \\"IF I Ain't Got You\\" which was one of the best singles of the past year. She sounds flawless on it. \\"Diary\\" was also very good, but after it, you can't help but start to tune out. The rest of the songs run together and are hard to enjoy. \\"When You Really Love Someone\\" is ok, but it kind of similar to her 2001 breakthrough \\"Fallen.\\"  <br /> <br />This is a decent purchase from an outstanding artist, but be prepared for some outstanding soul cuts and some downright typical, boring R&B.
1563894696|5.0|Growing up, Batman was my favorite comic book and I loved the animated series.  I have to admit though that I lost interest in it when I hit high school.  A friend of mine was moving and gave me his comics collection and The Long Halloween was in it.  It was incredible!  The storyline was on point and the simplicity of the artwork makes the words stand out even more.  I recommend this comic to anyone that loves comics and, like me, needs a great story.
B00000G3PA|5.0|What's with that ultra-cynical, inaccurate, wrong-headed review from Mr Dave McCoy? There are two kinds of movies in this world: Type A, which leave you thinking; and Type B, which you either switch off or keep watching. This is a highly watchable Type B; and Type A standards don't apply. Forget the totally incredible scenes in outer space. Pretty well everything is technically wrong with them. But survival is just one damn thing after another out there in these two hours. What's the next crisis going to be? How will the dirty, chaotic, ham-fisted handful save humanity? Who's going to check in his chips? What stoopid suit is going to make the next dumb decision? Great stuff for boys of all ages.
0553275976|5.0|Although several reviewers have claimed that elements of this novel have dated the essence of this novel will always be relevant. True this was written pre-internet, pre-Clinton, pre 9/11 but the vanities that drive the chattering classes, so perfectly satirised by the author, are an inherent characteristic of moneyed urban dwellors anywhere on this planet. The spiralling nature of the plot complements the authors heady character descriptions and set-pieces.  <br /> <br />I know several people who have read and hated this novel because of its ultimately bleak portrayal of humanity. I however found it marvellously uplifting (not to mention hilarious) and view the book more as a dark fable on the perils of ambition in a capitalist society. The reader should note that most of the novel's characters would be regarded as successful in their respective professional lives and that each of those characters have lost a little bit of their soul to get where they are. What Wolfe allows us to ponder is : Is this what it takes to get to the top?
B000002IZ4|5.0|\\"core\\" was hard to top.you wouldnt think that any band could outdo themselves.that is,until stone temple pilots emerged with \\"purple\\",a veritable mellow step down from \\"core\\"'s aggression and heaviness.\\"meatplow\\" is a straight forward modern rock song that gets the album going.\\"vasoline\\",a quick and catchy tune was the first single and really kicks the cd into high gear.\\"interstate love song\\" was the mellow,hit single radio was looking for and it piloted the band to mainstream success (although not one of my favorites).\\"still remains\\"-if there is a better stone tmeple pilots track post \\"core\\",you let me know because i could listen to that song day in and day out forever.unbelieveable.\\"silvergun superman\\" picks up in the wake of \\"meatplow\\" and \\"vasoline\\" while \\"big empty\\",the track made famous by \\"the crow\\" provieds soft verses and a heavy chorus.\\"unglued\\",the fast punk rock song seems out of place but it is soo amazing.\\"kitchenware and candybars\\" is the epic ending and although very long, it is a great mellwoed out track and fun to listen to.all in all, STP have eclipsed the greatness of \\"core\\" and their 1994 album \\"purple\\" remains one of my favorites of all time.sheer genius.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The extras on this version are wonderful. The best bonus on it is the backstage look at the making of the movie. Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, among others, share stories about Walt and their experiences while making the movie. There are some especially touching stories about Walt Disney, and the elderly lady appearing in the song \\"feed the birds,\\" which happened to be one of Walt's favorite songs.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed on the dvd, is footage from the 1964 gala premiere with some color footage even. There are numerous little facts and stories all throughout the bonus features that are sure to interest fans. Watching this dvd has made me like the movie even more, from realizing all the work that went into making this film. From the live action and animation combinations, to the choreography- Mary Poppins is one fine Disney classic and this is a very well put together dvd.
B000001DTM|5.0|Could a successful band totally revamp their sound and manage to not alienate their fans? Well in 1991 that is exactly what U2 pulled off. This is a remarkable album full of art pieces. Every song feels larger than life and rightfully so, this album is larger than life. Bono's lyrics are as ironic and dark as ever, yet he still keeps the genuine heartfelt emotion throughout various songs. The Edge penned the magnificent \\"One\\" which is by far U2's greatest song, in my humble opinion that is. All I can say to any fan of U2 or to anyone getting into the band for the first time, this could be a great place to start, this album and the Joshua Tree are high reccomendations of mine. Take care and enjoy the music

B0002IVN9W|4.0|Hi peeps. Newest review for somethng worthwhile. Here it is. <br />This doesnt sound like Pulp, or Modest Mouse. It actually has a certain flavor that is all its own while simultaneously sounding like the early Talking Heads and the Pixies and the other great Canadian band Broken Social Scene. All in all this is nothing new, so all the people flipping over \\"album of the year!\\" and \\"newest thing in post rock indie blah blah!\\" should chill. Its a great album full of a good variety of songs. Most of the emotion centers around longing and growing up. Standard fare for indie rock. The lyrics are specifically good at bringing feelings and nostalgia to the forefront. The singers voice is the reason for alot of that. For this alot of people will like it and call it one of their favorites. The second song \\"neighborhood 2\\" is the best song the Talking Heads never wrote. The third song \\"Une Aimee Sans Lumiere\\" couldve been on The Pixies \\"Trompe Le Monde\\" but it is still a wonderful track that pulls a shudder of a tear. There are a few songs that are a little melodramatic for my tastes. That brings it to a four star review. \\"Crown of Love\\" and \\"Neighborhood 4\\" will make some people happy, but for me they just drag. The album picks up again after that with the beautiful \\"Haiti\\" and its gentle island percussion (This song couldve been a Broken Social Scene song) A few of the tracks are dancy and upbeat and these, I am sure, you will love. All in all, good album, the good songs are great and the rest is okay. Nothing new but definitely worth having for the pitchforkmedia.com readers and definitely for any fans of all the above bands. peace.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I enjoyed volumes 1 and 2, but I think two was better.  The lighting, camera angles, etc, I thought were all great.  It was exceptionally pleasing to the eye to watch, and I found myself more involved in the story than in the first one. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that it doesn't tie up all the loose ends as nicely as I might have liked.  However, this didn't prevent me from enjoying the movie.
B00009W0U4|3.0|<br />    Why does No one who`s reviewed this film, make mention that the guy who raped ALEX got away with it?...It was NOT him who got his head crushed with the fire extinguisher!! right after the final blow...the camera pans on the one who did the rape!.Look at the clothes, or his face!
B0001HAISG|5.0|From the moment this movie began, my breath was taken away and I believe my feet may have even left the floor, for I was a part of the story. Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) stole my heart and Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood, an amazing debut role) is so full of life and independence, yet searching for that first love.  <br /> <br />Are you brave enough to experience a secret place, confident enough to let go of being an adult to experience the magic of flight again? Or maybe, this will be your first time. Either way, I promise, you will not be disappointed, only more aware of the existence of your inner child and the magic that he/she still can bring into your life! <br />
B000002WCJ|2.0|When I read the reviews of this album on Amazon, I rushed down to the music store expecting to purchase an truly epic metal album. Boy, was I disappointed. Most of this album plays like a kind of rock soundtrack to a Terry Gilliam novel. There are only really two decent tracks, 'Save Us' and 'March On Time' the rest is just weirdly insane babling. The reviewer who said that certain tracks send a cool sensation down your spine, must live in a world of his own.
B000002J0B|5.0|This album was the first led zeppelin album i bought, and it will not be the last.  Led zeppelin is a great band because of how musically diverse they are.  For example, in just this one album they have very good hard rocking songs like the ocean and dancing days.  Howeaver it also has a reggae song (dyer maker) wich is still cool, and a funky song called the crunge wich is cool, altough Robert plants voice is kinda wierd it and at the end there is something about a bridge were they talk.  They also have an acousticy ballad called the rain song and a song called the song remains the same, wich i dont really care for.  All of these songs however are not near as good as Over the hills and far away, or no quarter. Over the hills and far away starts off with really cool acousic cords and sigle notes and then builds up to some really hard rocking [...] parts.  No quarter, in my oppinion the best song on this album, is kind ov a slow song with a synthesizer that is very dark and almost creepy. A very good song.  And all in all a very good album and led zeppelin is a very good band
B00003CXGG|3.0|Warner Bros would like you to think that 'Romeo Must Die' is a new take on the action genre - a film that not only delivers great action and excitement, but really builds deep and meaningful characters. Well, they're half right - it does deliver great action and excitement, but the plot is about as thin as the smile on the face of a used car salesman.  <br />We are following the story of Han (Jet Li) and Trish (Aaliyah), the children of rival crime lords who have recently entered an agreement that is set to make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. The relationship is strained however when Han's brother turns up dead, hung from a light-pole. The remainder of the plot consists of the two children finding that they are perfect for each other, much to the chagrin of their parents - hence the Romeo of the title - and battling a conspiracy (consisting of lots of Bad Guys for Han to bash) that threatens to destroy both their families. It is somewhat amusing to see that while Hollywood has stretched as far as having an interracial couple in a major film, the two never so much as kiss, and only even hug once during the entire film - so it would seem there is still somewhat of a hang-up in that regard.  <br />It should be noted that this is one of only two films completed by Aaliyah before her tragic and untimely demise on August 25th, 2001. As the other is the truly abominable Queen Of The Damned, this is a far more fitting tribute to her.  <br />
0446677450|2.0|While I thought this book was still a valuable tool it has one problem.  There is no \\"rich dad,\\"  Rich Dad was a lie fabricated to sell the book, which worked VERY WELL.  On top of that it has been verified much of the info in the book was made up on the fly.  All in all, the book wont really teach you much.  But there are a couple points I thought that were VERY... no sorry, EXTREMELY valuable. <br /> <br />*If you are young, like I am... pay close attention to the RAT RACE.  Its a great term for the financial trap most people get themselves into in their early 20s.  I can thank this book for steering me away from it! <br />*ASSET vs LIABILITY   awsome thing to keep in your head at all times when your in a spendy mood! <br /> <br />All in all it was a pretty good book for me for just those two reasons.  Unfortunately I cannot give it more than 2 stars for the simple fact that most of the book lives a lie!

B00004RFFS|5.0|Tom Cruise gives one of his better performances alongside the always good Brad Pitt and the extraordinary debut of Kirsten Dunst in this well made adaptation of Anne Rice's novel Interview with the Vampire. Though fans, and Ms. Rice, initially howled at the idea of pretty boy Cruise playing the lead role of ageless vampire Lestat he ends up doing a creditable job. My main concern at the time was not so much Cruise's selection but that of director Neil Jordan but here as well the producers made a fine choice - Jordon does a terrific job of creating a lush, decadent, decayed neo-gothic atmosphere. Antonio Banderas shows up for an effective turn as Lestat's rival Armand to round out a highly polished and effective cast. <br /> <br />Highly recommended both to fans of Rice's novel and to horror and gothic romance lovers as well.  <br />
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have three main complaints about this film:<br /><br />1) Jar Jar Binks. He is everything that was wrong with Return of the Jedi all over again (cutesy Ewoks, rolled up into one annoying alien).<br /><br />2) Bad acting. Jake Lloyd was terrible, as were Pernilla August and Natalie Portman. I don't know why people like her. She's borderline Keanu Reeves/Uma Thurman bad. If you're looking for someone to just read lines, cast me - I'll work for cheap.<br /><br />3) Bad story flow. This movie was long, but it felt long. Too long. It just didn't come across the way I was expecting it to come across - as the first chapter in a grand tale, where the viewer cares about the main characters, and is taken in by the grand scale of the beautiful and free pre-Empire world.<br /><br />Having said all that, I still loved the movie, despite its many many many imperfections. I grew up with these movies, going to the Star Wars opening weekend in Walnut Creek, CA when I was six. I remember clearly standing in line with my dad and brother, amazed at the massive crowds. I even remember my dad complaining that he had never experienced such hooplah.<br /><br />Yes, the movie answers questions and sets the stage for the films to follow, but it should have gone beyond that and did a better of job of selling us on the characters. There is no character development, period. Their relationships with each other are cold, and sterile. We all overlooked Luke's bad acting the first time round -- we liked him because we saw him grow and deal with things, and loved his interactions with Han and Vader and Obi -- and we cared. Not so much this time around.<br /><br />But the film has some visually beautiful scenes, such as the battle of the Gungans versus the droids. Loved the lush green, obviously-computer-generated-but-still-way-cool scenes. And the whole underwater ride through the center of the planet. Fantastic.
B00005KAQP|4.0|This is my favourite Whoopi Goldberg comedy. It's fun from beginning to end and perfect for watching when you just need a laugh or want to sit and and relax for 90-odd minutes. If you want to look deeper, then there's a not-too-hard-to-find message about getting out and living life and taking a chance rather than always choosing the safe alternative. There's also one about not being self-centred but rather being generous towards others. But you really don't have to worry too much about these - just sit down in your favourite chair and prepare to laugh.
B00030590I|3.0|Wuxia Pian, in Chinese Hanyu Pingying, means Martial Arts Hero flicks in literal translation, is a class on its own. Hong Kong had made tons of it and created a whole industry out of it. From these films, pops out past legendary names like Wang Yu, Cheng Pei Pei (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger) and as recent as Jet Li. It has also provided a whole host of inspiration for autuers like Ang Lee and Tarantino for their films. <br /> <br />Now it has fallen upon China's Oscar darling boy Zhang Yimou who takes it upon himself that it is every Chinese director's dream that he should make a swordsplay flick himself. And so he has. Two, in fact. The other, House of Flying Daggers, is still playing in theatres at this time of writing. <br /> <br />Zhang's movie is simplistic in nature. Harvesting from historical folklore regarding China's \\"first\\" and most ruthless emperor of all, Qin Shi HuangDi. This is the monarch who engineered the construction of the Great Wall of China. <br /> <br />The story concerns on the ascension of the Qin emperor as the emperor of all China once he had united all seven warring states at that time. Naturally, with all despotic tyrants comes disgruntled assassins hellbent on dispatching the revered emperor. According to legend, three assassins had sworn to this task. <br /> <br />Jet Li is an anonymous swordsman aptly named, \\"Nameless\\". His prowress were said to be so legendary that he had already dispatched all three assassins, said to be excellent martial artists themselves. The movie then unfolds in Rashomon style whereby Nameless relates his tale to the emperor and the ensuing subtefuge that peels off inevitably one layer at a time. <br /> <br />Zhang can be applauded for the look and feel of the movie. He proves himself to be as good a cinemtographer as he was in the past before he became a director. The costumes and sets are exquisite as well as exotic. However, the plot remains lacking. Chinese patriotism in the Chinese Communist Party style still remains in an exacting, yet curiously post-Deng manner. The CCP probably wrote the script themselves. <br /> <br />This movie is worth a watch for two scenes. The fight between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. It's a pleasure to see a cinematic rematch between real-life two martial arts champions who were last seen in \\"Once Upon A Time in China 2\\". The other is the lake skipping scene between Jet and Tony Leung. Utterly heartbreaking beautiful. This DVD edition is the theatrical version. For fans of this movie, you might want to purchase the director's cut available only on the China Region 0 DVD.
B00006JDVV|3.0|'Reign Of Fire' is probably the first in what is likely to be a number of cash-in attempts on a small trilogy known as 'The Lord Of The Rings'. At first it may not seem like it fits that category - it is set in 2020, and in a world that looks suspiciously post-apocalyptic. But it is what caused that apocalypse that places this movie squarely in the fantasy genre - dragons. In a way it is an interesting movie, a sci-fi dragon movie, and it is a combination that a lot of people just didn't seem to handle on its initial release. Faced with the total fantasy of a dragon, the human characters and story were often pulled to pieces for being unrealistic. Ah, that was a dragon swooping by - exactly where is reality in this movie?  <br />What does work, and work incredibly well for 'Reign Of Fire' is the effects. You will believe that dragons exist and are ravaging the world. Some of the effects are jaw-dropping, and this is largely due to the way Bowman, using his years of experience on 'The X-Files', knows to the second and millimetre the exact time and the exact amount to show of his monsters. They are not used too much, but at the same time, they are not hidden right up until the big reveal at the end (which of course usually results in disappointment). Another reason why this is an interesting movie is that it is Bowman's first feature since moving away from 'The X-Files' (for which he directed the movie, and countless episodes), and if this is anything to go by, an extremely capable action director has been found.  <br />'Reign Of Fire' was never going to be anything but a B-movie, a genre-film, a monster movie, and in that regard it succeeds well. With a few more tweaks, and a little less bravado, it could have been a near-perfect action movie, but as is, it is still a very worthy watch for fans of the genre.  <br /> <br />
B00005JN0T|5.0|Personally i never read the books (in fact i dont read books period, theyre too damn boring) so im not offended that this movie wasnt like some stupid book, it was a very good entertaining film, its a movie not a book, if you want to be bored and are too narrowminded to appreciate entertainment then dont watch movies, go read your freakin book.  Now onto the movie, it had a great story (i dont care if its like the book, who does? some nerd, o freakin well, cry me a river), it was very funny throughout, it had some drama, not heartwrenching but still pretty sad stuff, and the humor didnt hurt the drama or the film it added to the entertainment (unlike comedies whcih suck).  The action was good, not great, there were 2 big action scenes and a few other little ones, what was there was well done, intense, and creative, but we could use alittle more, thats the only thing wrong with the movie, just needs to be longer with more action, but since i already bought the dvd i hope they dont double dip this one, so im satisfied, got my moneys worth.  9 out of a 10.
B000002W8O|5.0|This was Elvis's first Christmas album, recorded in 1957.  It's a certifiable classic.  Side one featured Elvis doing secular Christmas songs.  \\"Santa Claus is Back in Town\\" is an awesome blues song that features D.J. Fontana's best drumming ever, arguably.  \\"White Christmas\\" is a fine performance that owes a lot to the Drifters' version.  \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" is a cool rockabilly style performance.  \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" is a good ballad.  \\"Blue Christmas\\" is Elvis's best Christmas song, and it made everyone forget the original Ernest Tubb version.  Side one closed with the original pop rocker \\"Santa Bring My Baby Back\\".  Side two of the album featured religious songs.  However, only two of the songs are actual Christmas songs.  The last four songs are taken from the previously released \\"Peace in the Valley\\" EP.  But when the songs are as great as these four are, why complain?  I highly recommend this CD.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is, by far, the most astonishing yet mesmerizing collection of music I have ever heard.  Opening with the strange yet beautiful \\"I  Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" the album takes off into a wierd blend of pop, electronica and country.  \\"Kamera\\" is rather poppy, but is still very good.  Now, although I have always seen \\"War on War\\" as a sort of emotional lead-in to \\"Jesus, Etc.\\", it deserves to be recognized in its own right as a good, catchy tune with wonderful lyrics.  \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" is certainly one of, if not the best song on this album, and that is saying something.  With a beautiful, quiet beat that matches the lyrics perfectly, it coalesces into a beautiful harmony, that in the right situation (such as a rainy night on the open highway) creates a beauty that has brought me to tears repeated.  \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" really DOES bring to mind a sort of \\"ground zero\\" effect, as one reviewer put it, leaving the audience with a feeling of a sad emptiness rendered in black and white.  A cute pop tune, \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is a fun return to a happier day from the melancholy of its predecessors.  It has all the elements of a good pop song: catchy lyrics, a nice consistent beat, and well-played instruments.  \\"I'm the Man that Loves You\\" is hardly a poor song, but it is really just more of the same (but not in a bad way).  \\"Pot Kettle Black\\" I still appreciate more every time I hear it.  The instrumentals and the wonderful melody are such that no words can do it justice, and \\"pop\\" is a term far too sullied by Britney Spears and 'N Sync to be applicable.  I like to think of \\"Poor Places\\", in addition to being one of the greatest tracks on the disc, as a sort of transition between the beautiful catchiness of \\"Pot Kettle Black\\" to the deep, liquid ambience of \\"Reservations\\".  The end of this disc is something that you cannot \\"listen\\" to per se, you have to feel it.  Lie back, relax, and let the sound wash over you.  Although at first it may seem to be random noise, you will soon realize that it is an aural ocean, whose depths a review can hardly penetrate.  I really suggest that you give this album a chance to be good: a good long chance at that.  It takes time to appreciate, but once you do, not only will you be stunned by its sheer beauty, but it will open your mind to a whole new world of music.
B000069AUI|5.0|i recently rediscovered this cd  a few days ago. i hadnt listened to it in months. its almost as if ive heard it for the first time. this cd stirs things in me and its kinda scary. its in my top ten of all time best cds ever. track #8 The Warning Sign, Wow!!! You feel the emotion and pain in that song and you cant say that about to many songs today. that song is quickly becoming my favorite. Its on of the few cds besides the coldplay debut that one can actually listen to all the way through. its no wonder that hip stars to pop stars love coldplay, i mean its nothing like them out there.
B00005JMUL|5.0|Saw this twice in IMAX 3D already, and hope they would have the dvd release in 3D as well.  It's that good.  Not for cynics.
B0002JJBZY|3.0|Why can't these be released in a regular boxed set? I would like to have these series of Star Trek but I won't buy these because they come in the funky off shaped boxes that don't fit in with the rest of my dvd collection. Am I crazy? Or just way too picky? Note to those who are selling these discs: If you put them into more conventional packaging (i.e. standard dvd sized rectangular boxed sets), you may get more sales. At least one more sale.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I am now several months removed from seeing this film.  Sadly, all that remains is remembrance of the extreme violence.  I remember nothing about the man, nothing about his message, nothing about what he did.  All I remember are the scenes of blood and gore.  That isn't really a judgment as the film was intended to be a no-holds-barred rendering of the final hours of his life.    I do remember that the cinematography is phenomenal and the score quite haunting.  As a film, it is powerful.  The film has something of a mystical, other-worldly feel to it and the flashback sequences do provide some grounding (and relief) from the overall achingly somber tone of the film.      Without resorting to theological nitpicking, it seems to me that there was little to chew on for those who may not be coming from a Christian backround.  I come from a Christian background and was not enthralled with the film.  I felt as if I should have been deeply moved by the film but, in fact, I generally find myself with the minority opinion among Christian believers.      It was appalling violence inflicted upon one man but I simply failed to make the connection within the context of the film for such treatment.  Only my understanding of Christian theology enabled the connection to be made.    It is ironic that a film by Gibson, who is from a particularly devout Catholic sect, is praised by evangelical Christians who might otherwise take issue with his Catholicism.  From a hopeful point of view it renders one to conclude that perhaps differing denominations can truly be one body; the cynic says that ultimately we are just opportunists.  But he has put it all out there on the table.  Like him or not, like the film or not, it is kind of hard to ignore.     As a film, it is powerful and well worth watching at least once.  I doubt I will watch it again.  As an evangelical or Christian witness tool, it seems to me it has its limits.

0767830555|4.0|Taxi Driver shocked movie audiences when it first came out in 1976.  People gasped out loud at DeNiro's graphic and casual reference to what went on in the backseat of his New York taxi. People were also extremely shocked by Jodie Foster playing a hardened twelve year-old prostitute. There is a gory bloodbath at the end. By today's standards, Taxi Driver is not very shocking; there is so much sex, gore, violence, and shooting in movies today that people are used to it. Nevertheless, Taxi Driver was a groundbreaking film.  Many movies after it have used its themes and style.<br /><br />In 1976, New York City had a parade of prostitutes, pimps, and porno theaters.  Twenty-seven year-old Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) gets a job driving a cab, primarily because he can't sleep.  He is willing to drive \\"anyplace, anytime.\\"  The former Marine and Vietnam Veteran is a loner, interacting awkwardly with the other cabbies and with Betsy, a girl he falls in love with (Cybil Shepherd).  Betsy is a campaign worker for Senator Palantine, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president.<br /><br />DeNiro strides into the campaign headquarters and charms her into a date for coffee.  He then takes her to A PORNO THEATER, innocently thinking that because he has seen couples there, that this is an appropriate place for a date.  Betsy storms off.  DeNiro's confusion at her anger is a clear sign that he is mentally unstable.<br /><br />Betsy refuses to see him anymore.  This is the catalyst that sends Travis over the edge.  He purchases every piece in a \\"traveling salesman's\\" arsenal, and pumps his thin body up.  He is planning something big.  To the viewer's horror, you realize he wants to assassinate Palantine to get back at Betsy, even though Palantine rode in his cab and DeNiro even has his posters in his apartment.<br /><br />DeNiro then meets twelve year-old prostitute Iris (Foster).  he wants to save her from her pimp, Sport, played by Harvey Keitel, and her life as a prostitute.  Keitel looks and acts so much like Kevin Spacey does now, you have to see it!  It is unreal.<br /><br />Every movie fan should see Taxi Driver.  Martin Scorcese, the director, also has a cameo and some of the most graphic lines.  And you get to see a young Ray Romano's \\"Dad,\\" Peter Boyle, as seasoned cabby \\"Wizard.\\"e as a prostitute.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii was a great concert film. Filmed in Pompeii, Italy in October of 1971. This DVD contains great songs like Echoes, Set the Controls, One of These Days and a few others. Contrary to what the foolish last reviewer said, David Gilmour did not quit Floyd, Floyd disbanded in 1983 and appeared with Arcadia(the poor Roxy Music facsimile Duran Duran spinoff) as a guest musician on only TWO songs so he didn't join as Floyd reunited in 1986. Anyhoo, this DVD is recommended!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is indeed one of the 10 greatest albums ever, of any genre, of any time. The influence of this album reverberated throughtout not only the blues world, but through ever style of music. Numerous artists since have called this one of their greatest influences, and to listen to it as a whole (very important) is to know why. I have only heard the original 9 tracks, which represent absolute perfection of completeness. I have not heard the bonus tracks, so I will not comment on them, though I find I am usually dissappointed in the mediocre crap thrown on the extra space of CDs. Nevertheless, any way possible, the original album must be a part of any great collection.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2s new album is very good, I mean what the heak did you expect. <br /> <br />It may be a little bit dissapointing on the whole (was expecting some straight forward songs such as  <br />\\"Staring at the sun\\" and \\"One\\") <br />but its still very good. <br /> <br />It is a little bland overall though and i think thats why some people dislike it so much. <br />It could of been improved alot more, but its still good and thats all that matter I guess.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about thirteen and thought it was cheesy. <br />I watched it again not too long ago and my opinion was changed completely. Anyone who's in love will definitely smile and cry and adore this movie for its sweetly powerful plot. <br />Visually, this film is beautiful: full of art with lots of color and outstanding visual effects, but it's a lot more than just an aesthetically pleasing art film. It is a powerful story about love and soulmates which puts forth some very interesting, thought-provoking, and also comforting ideas about life after death.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I remember seeing Renee every other Firday in Long Beach singing with Eddie Reed's swing combo.  She always knew how to deliver a swing standard ,and she sang better then Reeds' other girl singers, who were twice as old as the then 13 year old Olstead.  It is a pleasant surprise that she has released this cd which features her singing superior versions of Summertime and a few other jazz standards.  For those looking for fresh interpetations of old jazz standards, here you go...
B000066744|4.0|There are several interesting metaphors in this film, one of them is that Nineteen Hundred  refused to live  the modernity or pos-modernity of the times, he did not want to live  in the 1900, for he never left the ship. The uncertainty of a life which  can bring daily millions of possible  choices for him was unbearable. His question \\" How can you make music out  of an infinite keyboard\\"?  really represents the fear and anxiety generated by  the enormity of social connections and possibilities, which were made possible through the expansion of Capitalism in the twentieth century. As Bauman puts it: \\"Today the problem of identity arises  mostly from  the difficulty of holding to any identity for long. (...) It is not  so much  the co-presence of many kinds that is the source  of confusion  and anxiety, but their fluidity, the notorious difficulty  in pinpointing them and defining - all this  harking back to the most central and painful anxieties: one that is related to  the instability of one's own identity and the absence of lasting, trustworthy  and reliable reference  points which  would help to  render  the identity more safe and secure.\\"  <br />So, in post-modern times, or in our times, for many people(that's just a part of the world, for at the same time we're post-modern,  we can be pre modern, modern or medieval - anyway that's the part of the world I find myself in),  there can be no end, the number  of  probabilities is infinite depending on your social positions and personal skills. Most of the times we don' t see ourselves  in a position where you can see an end. How do we choose? How must we choose? Those our central questions for many people  nowadays. Once  you're given the possibility of moving, of taking up different professions, in different places, of meeting all kinds of different people this question is a part of our lives.  <br />For Bauman, postmodern discontents are born of freedom, instead of oppression. Society offers more individual freedomat the price of no security and no certainties at all. One of Nineteen Hundred's last lines  is, \\"Life passed me by,  while I was on this ship, but 2000 people at a time\\". For Umberto Eco, as Bauman quotes him,  that is precisely the reason why so many people  are driven to the entertainment industry of fiction, because there  you can get what you cannot have in  real life, that is, the complexity of life is simplified, the characters and acts  are selected  , \\" the infinite chaos of reality is cut down  to an intellectually manageable , comprehensible  and apparently logical size\\". So, that was  the  situation  Nineteen Hundred lived when he was  on the ship, and he wasn't willing to give it up. <br />\\"Land is a ship too big for me, its music I don't know how to make\\". So here  goes the question, how do we  try to make music out of  our daily discontents of chaotic and  apparently purposeless  existence? Do we  really try to get some sense out of it? Do people really care about that  or do they just refuse to discuss it or even to think about it.? If you really face it , the anxiety that comes along is enormous. Numbing our senses is probably the easiest thing to do, which can be easily achieved by any sort of obsessive activity  compelling us to refuse to stop and think about our lives, about other people's suffering, about how our sufferings are interconnected. This way, there's no  time left for any kind of self  or the other's perception. <br /> <br />But still, at least for me, making/listening to music out of this disorder is a challenge. Yes, there can be  music in the world, you just have to listen carefully. I think sometimes the world around me sounds like a  tragic opera, or an Albinoni's Adagio, sometimes like an exciting Rock sometimes like a numbing techno and sometimes I can't really hear anything out of it except confusion and purposelessness. But anyway, those moments go by and  there has to come some music out of it, some hidden order in the chaos. Refusing to believe so would make life unbearable and would truly justify Nineteen Hundred's own-chosen death, exploding with the wrecks of the ship in the end of the movie.  <br /> <br />

B00003CX5A|5.0|Tim Burton's take on Washington Irving's spooky headless horseman tale is one of the most fantastic horror movies ever made. An unsettling and sometimes shocking film, this is stylish, sexy and wonderful cinema that should not be missed by any fan of the genre. A long-time fan of Johnny Depp and owner of 25 of his movies, I have always loved Hollow since it scared the hell out of me in the cinema. Depp turns in one of his best performances yet, playing the queasy doctor Ichabod Crane to pleasing effect. Danny Elfman draws on past BATMAN music for the unsettling but refreshingly original score. STAR WARS fans should also note that this is the only film to have actors Ian MicDiarmid, Christopher Lee and Ray Park (Darth Sidious, Count Dooku and Darth Maul respectively) Considering this, it would have been good to sneak in David Prowse (Darth Vader). Anyway, this is my favorite Burton film and a modern classic, worthy of the title \\"Most beautiful horror movie ever made\\".<br /><br />After the hiccup that was Mars Attacks, Tim Burton, Hollywood's most eccentric director, is back on form. Adapted from Washington Irving's classic tale The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Burton's stylish take on the story of the headless horseman (Played occasionally by a freaky Christopher Walken) is Burton at his most macabre. Everything from the Burton outr&eacute; culminates in the film; the bats from Batman, the jack o' lantern from A Nightmare Before Christmas, and, as Ichabod Crane, Johnny Depp from Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Burton's visionary touch takes the tone much deeper than the animated 1958 Disney version, with the headless horseman lopping off heads all over the place. The desaturated color and stunning cinematography goes a long way to making the action and shocking decapitations just that bit more gruesome, yet at some times, strangely poetic. The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en and 8mm) is fitting to the film's thematic touch and overall bizzaro Burton. Danny Elfman's downright chilling score takes the darkness even further. But there is humor amidst the full-blooded ghost story; Depp's fainting at the sights of the Horseman's handiwork, and the sharp script lets the actors, mainly Depp, have more fun. This is Burton's weirdest film since Batman Returns. Excellent.Elfman's downright chilling score takes the darkness even further.

B00005JNEI|3.0|I just recently watched this movie, not out of any sort of want on my own behalf, but because all my family and friends raved at me to do so. As the wife of a soldier serving in Iraq I feel very passonaitly about photo and vidoe clips from the war. I thought that the news was bad enough! Just a warning to anyone who may be sensitive to seeing very dramatic images of war and soldiers: <br /> <br />DO NOT WATCH <br /> <br />As far as the political side of the movie, that was great. I just wish I could have fast forwarded through the nasty parts.
B000000993|5.0|I hear many people ranting and raving over tool; how great they are how beutifully maynard sings and how well adam and danny play. This is a wonderful, dark, and heavy masterpiece not to be overlooked. This is tool at their finest, their instrumental and lyrical best. Maynard throws dark, but deep thought full lyrics while adam accopanies him with not so average guitar riffs. Danny makes unbelivable drum rythms to add to the effect. But there is one thing people always overlook in a band, something that at first never seems to matter, the BASS GUITAR player. Paul D'amour is perhaps the reason undertow sounds so great. He doesnt need all of the special effects and pedals that Justin (new bass player) uses. Paul uses thick, decisive bass lines to hold up every song and at points show off his skill. Some notable tracks would be: Intolerance, Prison Sex, Crawl away, Swamp song, and if you have 15 minutes! Disgustipated.
0375507256|5.0|After picking up Cloud Atlas, I spent all my free time reading it until I had finished. It is a page turner of the best kind. The six different plots are each unique, told as a travel journal, letters, a mystery story, a memoir, an interogation, and a storyteller's tale (told in at first hard to comprehend pidgin). Each storyline rushes along full throttle, stopping just at the most exciting moment to go on to the next. As a result, the first half of the book is a total cliffhanger, and the second half is full of resolutions.  You'll have to decide for yourself what and if the overlying theme connecting these stories is. There are some obvious things, like a reoccuring birthmark, and the appearance of each story in the next (the protagonist of story #2 finds the journal that is story #1, and so on).  The entire book is a very quick and satisfying read, a wonderful sampling of genres.  Each character has their own voice that comes across clearly and seperately, but manages to connect to the whole.   I enjoyed this book tremendously, and highly recommend it.
B00004WG2X|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favourite book of all time by my favourite author, and I first saw this adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece when I was still at school. <BR>It was originally shown as an episodic serial over several weeks on BBC2.<BR>I first bought it as a complete work on VHS in ooh must have been the late 1980's, when it first became available, and I have watched it many times.<BR>I also own and have watched the Andrew Davies adaptation from 1995 and the MGM movie made in 1940.<BR>All these productions have their merits and in their way are beautifully done, but without any question this is the version most faithful to the book, in both content and style.<BR>Elizabeth Garvie should have become a huge star as a result of this performance, but she has since chosen to work almost exclusively in the theatre, and David Rintoul is her perfect foil. His Darcy almost anal retentive in his stiff upper lippedness.<BR>And how prophetic, now that he has sold Diana's private video's to the American media, that Peter Settelen should have made such a wonderfully slimy and sycophantic Wickham. <BR>If ever a Wickham deserved a Lydia....his did.<BR>I'm sure there will be those who find the tempo of the piece somewhat pedestrian, but that was the nature of the beast in 19th century England. <BR>The 1995 version, [oh and for the record may I clear up a misconception that some people seem to be under. The 1995 version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, was and is a BBC production. It may have been released under license in the USA by A&E, but it is NOT and never was an A&E production.]<BR>...anyway..<BR>The 1995 version was much faster paced, and the smouldering relationship between Lizzy and Darcy intensely exciting for the viewer to watch, however, many of the nuances of the piece are far too modern to represent a truly faithful adaptation.<BR>For example, if Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship had indeed been as toe curlingly sexy as portrayed, Elizabeth's shock and dismay at Darcy's proposal would have been ingenuous to say the least.<BR>I also take issue with the portrayal of: Mrs Bennett, who though undoubtedly ditsy was never a common vulgar fishwife, and a far too old and far too buxom Lydia.<BR>And whilst much more accurate than the 1940 movie version, this production was not also entirely faithful to the original text Add to this the excruciating performances of Alison Steadman and Julia Sawalha, both fine actresses, who on this occasion were just horribly miscast, and the 1980 version is a clear favourite for those of us who don't like their Austen tinkered with too much.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Having just once again been unable to not play the entire CD when I intended just to listen to Dig a Pony, it was time to weigh in.  An average of less than four stars?  Gimme a break.  Maybe you have to have every Beatles note starting with the first American radio broadcast of I Wanna Hold Your Hand wired into your neural networks, into the very fabric of your being to understand that hearing these stripped down studio versions is pretty much just even that much more potent Beatles heroin.  It was worth the 35 year wait.  The only problem is, it *is* 2004 and blasting music has suffered the tragic fate of smoking in public -- especially in far too politically correct Los Angeles.  (Not that I don't love L.A.  I do.  Very much.)  If you've been putting off buying this, don't be ridiculous.  Buy it now and spend some well deserved time under your earphones.

B00000JZI9|4.0|The odd thing about SILVERADO is that it was panned by critics and didn't do well in the theatres and more than once I've heard it referred to as a flop. That's so weird, since I thought it was a really GOOD show, as did everybody I knew! I'm not a fan of Westerns, but my father is; he liked it for being a Western, and I liked it for having a combination of good acting and often subtle, very droll humor that no 'old' Western I've ever seen has had. (And the music is as inspiring, in a trumpeting-western way, as the Pirates of the Carribean theme was in a more orchestral way.) It manages to combine the qualities and basic plot of an old western, with the better moviemaking/drama of a modern movie, with a rather more mature--in my opinion--combination of elements, from humor to intimacy, than are found in many movies of any kind let alone that genre. I was sorry that some of the romance was left on the editor's floor, as there was a small but noticeable nonsequiter in plot as a result (the reason I give it 4 stars, not 5). I really recommend this movie. It's both tragic and fun, action-oriented and sometimes funny.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under my skin is an awesome cd. At the very beggining I thought that this record was very boring with only two cool musics. But in a second time I noticed how great was the cd and I can stop listen to it. <br />I think that this work is much better then the first, speacially because Avril wrote all the lyrics wich are amazing Avril's voice is depper and captures me, making me like each song of the cd. <br />For sure, it is a must buy cd !!
B0000CO0VR|5.0|This is a band were u certainly would buy their CD before even listening to any track! and just like all the previous ones which personally i keepon listening to with much admiration, this one is highly energetic, creative, with absolutely fasanating pieces, it just keeps on getting better, some might think it is not as GOOD as the rest, but personally i think they added much to their track history and the quality is as distinctive as ever.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|I don't disagree with the good things most reviewers said about this film. It is intelligently done and includes statements on most of the important sessions in Robert McNamara's life.<br /><br />However, it is clear from watching this that many of McNamara's perceived \\"lessons\\" of war are cast from his own personal guilt over his role in fire bombing Japanese cities in World War II and the foolishness of American involvement in Vietnam beginning in 1964. McNamara clearly is uneasy with his personal history, and that unease has much to say about his \\"lessons\\".<br /><br />Furthermore, I'd have been happier if he's just come out and admitted that the Tonkin Gulf event never happened instead of simply implying such. This was the linchpin event leading to American involvement in Vietnam, after all. It would be good to have on the record, finally, that is never occurred.<br /><br />The most telling portion of the film is McNamara's description of events surrounding the blockade in Cuba during the so-called Cuban missile crisis. The events McNamara describes were almost perfectly realized by characters in the 1964 film \\"Fail Safe\\". For me, this was the most enlightening section of the biograph.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film but, after reading about it for months, was a bit let down by McNamara's real guilt over events from his life. I found this more of a lesson in McNamaraism than in history, to be honest.
0812548094|4.0|After reading the first book, I didn't know if I should invest the time and keep reading this series or stop right then and there.  I couldn't stand all the cheesey dialogue and childish romance between Richard and Kahlan. <br /> <br />Althought Stone of Tears still has that underlying love story, this tale has now matured.  Plot developments are more enriched, and Richard and Kahlan keep the cliche out of their love. <br /> <br />I liked this book 10 times more than the first and am excited to start Blood of the Fold.

B0002YLC24|5.0|It's been nine years since Richard Linklater's thoughtful and touching romance, Before Sunrise graced screens. Since then fans of the movie have wondered and ruminated about what happened to the two main characters. Did they meet up as promised or go their separate ways forever? Linklater and his two leads, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, have decided to revisit these characters and try to recreate the magic of this first film, so cherished by its admirers.<br /><br />The good news for fans of Before Sunrise is that Linklater, Hawke and Delpy are able to recreate the chemistry that their two characters had in the first movie. As soon as they start talking, it comes back almost immediately, as if they never stopped talking since that last time. Like the first film, Before Sunset (2004) is a dialogue-driven movie, effortlessly picking up where the other left off.<br /><br />\\"On the Set of Before Sunset\\" featurette has Linklater talking about how he kept imagining and thinking about these characters over the years. Hawke and Delpy brought a lot of their own ideas and stories to the film. This was clearly a labour of love for all three as they figured that it would only appeal to the small following who intensely loved the first movie.<br /><br />With sequels there is always the trepidation of whether or not the magic of the first film can be recreated. It is safe to say that Linklater and co. have done it. Fans of the first movie will no doubt fall in love with these characters all over again as they talk and rekindle their friendship. During the course of the movie you can sense that Jesse and Celine don't want their brief time to end and neither do we.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|An AMAZING movie. Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott are GREAT in this! Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, a smart, independent, passionate young woman in the 16th century, France. She is forced by her scheming stepmother (most excellently played by Anjelica Huston), to be a servant in the house, ever since her father died. Danielle's stepmother plots to marry off the favorite of her two daughters, Marguerite, to Prince Henry (played by the hot Dougray Scott). But when Danielle's stepmother goes too far and sells one of Danielle's servant friends, Maurice, saying that he's a criminal, Danielle doesn't stand for it. She dresses as a courtier, and demands that they set him free. Henry, a bored prince who finds everything and everyone dull, sees Danielle and is captivated. after many run-ins and meetings, Henry falls in love with Danielle, the odd, \\"modern\\" girl. also, instead of a Fairy Godmother, Danielle has even better: Leonardo da Vinci!!<br /><br />I highly reccomend this wonderful movie, for all ages.
B00005JMAH|5.0|At first, it seems like rather an odd choice picking the director of the racy, coming-of-age road movie, Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n, to direct the latest Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Studios are notoriously protective of their cash cow franchises-especially ones targeted at a young audience demographic. But, in a way, it makes sense that Cuar&oacute;n was chosen. Both movies are coming-of-age tales documenting the awkward growing pains of their respective protagonists. It is a fascinating blend of big budget pyrotechnics with a director who has a particular vision.<br /><br />For the first time in the series there is a director with a distinctive style behind the camera. Cuar&oacute;n instills each frame of this movie with infectious energy. He presents a wonderfully magical world filled with books with snapping teeth and a triple-decker bus that can make it thin and squeeze between two other buses at will. Every scene seems to move and there is a layering of styles. Every shot is drenched in atmosphere. The more multi-dimensional a film is, the easier it is to get pulled into it. The first two films felt like two-dimensional pictures trying to be three-dimensional. It took someone like Cuar&oacute;n to bring this franchise alive and he does it within the first ten minutes.<br /><br />The second disc contains the rest of the extra material which is a nice mix of behind-the-scenes featurettes and interactive games. Even the animated menus are done in a way that keeps in spirit with the movie, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />\\"Trelawney's Crystal Ball\\" features five deleted or unfinished scenes, including more with Harry on the bus and a new (and foolish) portrait that guards the boys' dorm room.<br /><br />The most substantive extra on this disc is \\"Creating the Vision,\\" a 12-minute look at the making of the movie with Cuar&oacute;n and author J.K. Rowling. They talk about adapting her novel and Cuar&oacute;n talks about dealing with the abstraction of time travel.<br /><br />\\"Head to Shrunken Head\\" is the most entertaining extra and features a series of interviews with the cast and crew of the movie. Our three heroes (Radcliffe, Grint and Watson) talk about how Cuar&oacute;n asked them to write a page essay about their characters (Watson wrote 16 pages!) and how they are dealing with the overwhelming fame garnered from these movies. For the adults, the interview with Gary Oldman and David Thewlis is a real treat as the two veteran actors tease each other and talk about how much their kids were thrilled that they appeared in this movie. Cuar&oacute;n talks briefly about moving the production to Scotland to shoot the outdoor scenes.<br /><br />\\"Catch Scabbers!\\" is a game where you have to catch Ron's pet mouse, Scabbers, with three increasingly difficult levels of play. This takes some deft maneuvering with your DVD remote.<br /><br />\\"Choir Practice\\" is a karaoke sing-a-long for the \\"Double Trouble\\" song from the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Quest of Sir Cadogan\\" allows you to step into the armor of this clumsy knight and perform a series of tasks that involve a mix of memory games and quick navigation skills. Again, this is another one that requires you to be quick with your DVD remote.<br /><br />\\"Hagrid's Hut\\" is a substantial Making Of featurette that starts with a look at how some of the real animals in the film were trained. Also included is a look at how Oldman was transformed into Sirius Black and how they did Thewlis' werewolf transformation (a clever mix of prosthetics and CGI). We also get a glimpse of how the creatures were designed and created. Cuar&oacute;n preferred old school effects to that of CGI but in some cases using computers was unavoidable.<br /><br />\\"Tour of Honeydukes\\" is a really cool 360 degree tour of the candy store that makes you feel as if you are really there.<br /><br />\\"Magic You May Have Missed\\" tests your memory as you must spot something specific that stands out or is missing from a scene.<br /><br />Finally, there is another 360 degree virtual tour, this time of Professor Lupin's classroom. This is a really nice looking extra that makes one feel as if they are in the movie.<br /><br />With Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban, Cuar&oacute;n joins the ranks of Terry Gilliam, Tim Burton and Peter Jackson as a filmmaker capable of creating textured fantasy films that don't talk down to kids and still appeals to adults. The characters have layers of grey areas-they aren't purely good or evil.another 360 degree virtual tour, this time of Professor Lupin's classroom.

B00006DEFA|5.0|I've got to relate a short story regarding my first experience with this movie.  It was spring,1984, I was full of life and hope. I had just realized my dream of buying a consumer  electronics franchise store, and was doing a crash three-week training in Denver, at that time probably my favorite city.  I'd become very close to one of the trainers. One evening he invited me to dinner at his house, and I accepted.  As we were eating (and drinking), we started talking about entertainment, movies in particular, and how things were changing.  He lamented the fact that there was only one of the old glorious \\"surround screen\\" theatres left in Denver, and it was only 15 minutes from where he lived.  I asked what was playing there.  He grabbed a paper and said \\"Amadeus!!!\\"  I said \\"when does it start?\\"  He says \\"15 minutes\\" and I said \\"what are we waiting for?\\"<br /><br />The movie opened just as we were walking to our seat.  We were both immediately so absorbed that we just stood there, awestruck.  The dramatic opening combined with the huge screen and overwheming sound totally mesmerized us.  We finally found our way to a seat, and for the next 2 hours and 40 minutes, I can remember nothing but being totally transfixed by and trasported to a world totally its own.  It was beyond suspension of disbelieve; I was part of this experience, inside the world that was created by Forman.<br /><br />As the Forman and Shaffer state, the music was a character, perhaps the main character, in the film.  The music served to enhance the characters, enhance the plot, and enhance the screenplay itself.  Every aspect of the film was beyond perfection, every performance transparant.  The fact that it explored so many ironies, explored them so well, and let the music take front and center stage separates this film from other \\"bio-flicks\\"; indeed separates this film from any other ever made.<br /><br />Don't let the fact that it's not based on fact (entirely) dissuade you.  The liberties Shaffer takes are all justified by the magnificent plot he creates.  Don't let the length dissuade you.  If you can devote three hours (if you watch the director's cut) to this, you would have to plain dislike music, all music, to dislike this film.  Rather, this film will enrich, provoke, entertain and make us feel our own mortality in a way that makes us feel better.  Anyone who is untouched by the final scene just might be incapable of being touched by anything.<br /><br />I you are a music lover and have not seen this film, shame on you.  If you want to know the truth concerning Mozart's life, there are plenty of libraries to obtain what is known.  But if you want to capture the spirt of the music, the spirit of the man (Mozart), the torment of his competitor (Salieri), and a true taste of what the world was like in Mozart's time and place, there is no better place to go than this film.

If you could care less about all that and just want to see a good movie, there is no better place to go than to this film. <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|I felt this Harry Potter is the cream-of-the-crop in terms of style and originality. Some may disagree, pointing out the missing information on the Marauder's Map and its creators, but I felt even with the small tid-bits of info missing (they aren't important in the main scheme, only for fans who want to know why some things are so) the movie was tremendous.     Alfonso Cuarn is probably the best director for this movie. His darker designs (especially for the Dementors) along with the usage of clocks (with some fantastic cinematography) makes this more of an artistic film with an adventure than an adventure with some artsy camera work. Don't expect \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or \\"North by Northwest\\" but still, this is by far my favorite of the three.    The extras are hard to navigate, but once you find them, it's quite enjoyable.     Storywise, while he may add a little minor detail that wasn't in the book, he still sticks to the central plot without deviating (meaning he DOESN'T kill Harry or have Ron and Hermione start passionately making love, reminicent of his widely known \\"Y tu Mama Tambien\\").     The only thing which may deviate parents from letting kids watch this is the Dementors (immensely creepy in my opinion) and a horror-like fight scene between a large dog and a werewolf which some reviewers found quite unnecissary (I felt it acceptable but not for younger kids).    Depending on whether you're a purist or a fan, you might hate this or love it. I found it quite enjoyable and recommend it to mature children of at least 10.

0064409422|5.0|Carole Seneker <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe <br />Author:  C. S. Lewis   Illustrator:  Pauline Barnes <br /> <br /> There are many fantasy elements in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  The first fantasy is entering the world of Narnia through the back of a wardrobe full of coats.  Constant winter without father Christmas due to the power of the witch is a fantasy.  The children are able to talk to the animals and they respond with speech.  The animals live like humans with furniture and they cook and even sew.  The Faun, Mr. Tumnus, had the human value of self-sacrifice when he put his life in jeopardy to save Lucy.  The witch had the ability to turn living creatures (including people) to stone.  The lion returned to life from death and changed the stone statues back into living creatures. <br /> The story is believable because the author has used the element of TIME.  Time in our world is different from the world of Narnia.  No matter how long the children stay in Narnia, there is no appreciable passing of elapsed time when they return to the wardrobe and the wardrobe room. <br /> The story is written in a logical and consistent manner.  Edmond gets in over his head with the witch, and his two sisters and brother team up with the animals and lion to save him.  The plot is ingenious the way the animals and people interact together to solve a problem (the witch) to help Edmond and benefit all creatures and people in Narnia.  As the story builds the pieces fall together perfectly as in a puzzle. <br /> There is universal truth underlying the metaphor of the fantasy.  C.S. Lewis has created an allegory of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.  The Lion, Aslan, represents Jesus in the story.  The witch represents satan.  When Aslan mysteriously fed the children and animals, the author was referring to when Jesus fed the five thousand.  Elements of the lion's death mirror the crucifixion of Christ Jesus our Lord.  Aslan goes to his death willingly to save Edmond when he could have saved himself.  Jesus sacrificed His life to save us.  Aslan endured the kicking, hitting, spitting, and jeering from the crowd somewhat similar to what transpired in the time leading up to the crucifixion of Christ Jesus.  After Aslan returned to life he returned the statues back to life.  This represents the eternal life a person acquires when they accept Jesus as their Personal Savior. <br /> The change in the TIME element represents God's time.  Time in heaven is not the same as it is on earth.  Good triumphs over evil in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as it is written in the Bible. <br /> The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe has the qualifications of a high fantasy story.  The story takes place in a created world and uses the allegory of Christianity to address the conflict of good and evil.  The story is written with protagonist of high fantasy (the lion) who teaches the values of goodness, truth, courage, and wisdom. <br />
B00008972S|5.0|\\"West Side Story\\" is proof that the sum of its parts can not only be greater than the whole, but possibly be the greatest!    Little known writer in Elizabethian England pens a drama about two star-crossed lovers. Flash ahead to the turbulent streets of New York in the late 1950s and early 60s. Turn feuding families to rival gangs. Add music, choreography, make it vital. Then find a brilliant director who knows what to show, and watch as it takes home every Oscar it can.    We know the story of this film but what's important for you to know about here are the extras you get in this package that make it worth your while: The first disc is the film, preserved perfectly. And the second disc has your special features.     First, you get a great documentary on the making of the film. Titled \\"West Side Memories,\\" Principals like Sondheim, Moreno, Chakiris, Beymer and more sit before the cameras and explain the process of preparing and executing what could be the finest example of the Hollywood Musical, ever. It's a piece that's could have been a stand alone DVD, it's so rich with insights.    You also get an interesting \\"Storyboard to Film\\" montage, where you see the artist's renderings of the scenes, and how those shots looked when they appeared in the film. You get to study these storyboards more carefully in several galleries on the disc. Lots of other goodies, like the theatrical trailers and photos galore... everything from Jerome Robbins's cattle call for dancers to location shots during production!    And if that wasn't enough, there's a massive book that comes with the set, that includes the complete script of the film, the original lobby brouchure that theater patrons who attended the film received, which has more photos and info, and the newspaper clippings lauding the film as it took its place in movie musical legend.    It's simply a valentine to a remarkable film, and a fantastic package, all the way around.    Highly recommended.

0613325419|5.0|First I would like to say how much I enjoyed this book, despite its shortness.  It offers insight into animals we have already seen and some that we will(hopefully).  While I wish that the descriptions were much, much longer, it offers a breif description of many animals from around the world. <br /> <br />Some people are complaining that certain animals are not in this book.  Here is why: <br /> <br />Voldemorts snake: It is a Basilisk <br /> <br />Thestral: Look under \\"Winged Horse.\\" Only one sentence though <br /> <br />Blask-Ended Skrewts: Because Hagrid bred these monsters illegally, he is the only one to know this and has not registered them with the MoM <br /> <br />The only monster that I can think of right now that is not included is the boggart, though I am sure that there are others.  I think that Rowling should write some more books like this one in order to give us more info into the world of HP.  I would like to see one on things like vampires, hags, and goblins, since they are not in this book because they are termed \\"beings\\" (able to speek and comprehend the human language), and one on the MoM and wizards in other countries (schools; MoM's; and habbits, such as flying carpets in the middle east). <br /> <br />
B000005S0E|2.0|The Top is definitely the strangest cure album available.  This album is extremely eclectic and at times is embarrassingly stupid.  However there are a few decent tracks on this one and there is a feeling of energy which is lacking on some of the late Cure albums.  Unfortunately like the Cures latest album \\"The Cure\\", The Top has too much rubbish material on it to make it worth your time.  However, for what its worth I do prefer this album to Wild Mood Swings and The Cure.    Overall, the general public should stay away from this one and only Cure fans should bother.
B0000027RL|4.0|MTV stopped playing music videos altogether, so don't go looking for any Peal Jam videos there. What will come as a shock to anyone who still thinks VH1 is only for their parents, VH1 does play videos by Pearl Jam several times a week. VH1 rarely plays Nirvana (because Nirvana were always a very trendy fad, and the hosts frequently point that out). If you listened to anything besides Nirvana in the early 90's, you'd be aware that there were some amazing bands still going strong while the trend of liking Nirvana fizzled out in 1994 after Cobain blew his brains out. Zach needs a to get aquatinted with bands like Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Public Image Ltd, Depeche Mode, King Missile, They Might Be Giants, Guns & Roses, Spin Doctors, The Dead Milkmen, and Ministry while the rest of us laugh him off the reviewing circuit.
B00008S2VG|2.0|A Few of the tracks like lover profusion, hollywood, and im so stupid take time.  Madonna rapping HELL TO THE NO!!!!  Hun what are You thinking???  You Were so innovative on other releases.  What happened?  This ish sucks!!!
B000005S0D|2.0|This is Camel's tenth studio album.  It is the second one that is truly a solo project by Andy Lattimer.  It is 42 minutes long. <br /> <br />This CD sounds just like an Alan Parsons album.  It has the same feel, structure, quality and style.  With Chris Rainbow on vocals on Cloak and Dagger, this song could have easily been on Parsons' Eye In the Sky.   <br /> <br />If you like everything that Alan Parsons has done, then you will love this album.  I like many of Alan Parsons' CD's but did not care for the more commercial ones like Eye In the Sky or Turn of A Friendly Card.  Stationary Traveler is like Parsons at his commercial worst, looking for a hit. <br /> <br />This isn't a horrible album like Camel's previous album, Single Factor.  It doesn't have any really bad tracks on it. And like all Camel albums, there are some really nice guitar parts from Lattimer.  It just doesn't have any that really stands out.  I would rate it around three stars.  If I lost it, I wouldn't bother to replace it. <br /> <br />This is really a solo effort from Lattimer.  He plays most of the instruments on most of the songs.  Mel Collins does add in some nice sax parts. <br /> <br />
6305718954|5.0|This movie is one of my absolute favorites (and I've seen a lot of movies).  It is all about conflict - the conflict that Frankie experiences with the stigmata (fighting for her life, essentially), the conflict that Andrew faces within himself because of his attraction to Frankie and the vow that he took for the church, the conflict between authority and subordinates (the church's attempts to suppress information).  The film is beautifully directed with amazing angles, and a lot of work was put into production (view with director's commentary - he'll explain a lot in it). <br />The actors are also amazing - I am really impressed with Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of Father Kierning.  He is very expressive and is able to relay emotion without speaking, which is a great gift.  (And he's really easy on the eyes, too, lol.)  Patricia Arquette also is amazing - she makes Frankie a very strong woman and someone who isn't in the \\"mainstream\\" but who is very logical and intelligent.  Despite the bad rap that ravers get, most are thinkers, which I see in Frankie.  The supporting role by Nia Long is extremely well-done.  As the best friend, she brings to the role a caring person who's always by Frankie's side; she's concerned without being cheesy, which is a touch of realism that I'm glad was included in the movie. <br />The look of the film, the colors, the way that the film was processed (with \\"skipping,\\" which is explained on the DVD) also give it a dark yet light and ethereal look which I think was essential to making this movie work. <br />As far as the topics of the movie (because there is more than one), they are all thought-provoking and should be examined closely to really be absorbed.  If you like make-you-think movies, you will definitely love this movie. <br />The one beef I had with this DVD was the director's alternate ending.  I think that the theatrical ending is much better because it leaves more to the imagination.  The viewer can see the ending however he or she pleases; interpretation is at the hands of the viewer.  The movie itself however, is awesome, and had I been able to give it ten stars, I would've.  I cannot say how amazing I think this movie is (because I don't have the space, lol), but I just think that it's very worthy and deserving of 5 stars.  An AMAZING film.
B000089RV6|1.0|I don't like this album, I don't even like any of the songs on <br />it, all the songs are just mean, dirty, and just worse than Appetite for Destruction. In fact, this album has lots of sex, drugs. I only added their best album from one year earlier, \\"Highway to Hell\\", I've owned this album so long <br />and the fact about when I last listened to it, I don't like the <br />songs, I've liked all 3 songs on Back in Black, but they're all <br />so mean, Hells Bells is such a dirty sexy drug song and a never <br />tune to listen to, and same thing for Back in Black, I'd never <br />would recommend this item, and I wish nobody bought it, or I wish <br />that this album never came out, or I wish that Bon Scott from the <br />last album sings on this, and then I would recommend it. But for <br />now I don't.  <br />My suggestion, <br />Don't buy it.
0393317552|5.0|My main area of interest over the past few years has been in the growth and emergence of ancient civilisations  in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, particularly, on how they developed from seemingly simple hunter gatherer societies to large states and empires of considerable complexity and sophistication.  This is the first book I have read which has focussed on explaining the basic conditions required for this transformational process, and why these civilizations were able to develop in some places but not in others.  The author's motivation (in answer to a question put to him by a politician of New Guinea) is to explain why the great leap forward to our modern civilization occurred in western Europe  rather than in Africa or  the Americas where many earlier civilizations had developed and flowered before anything  similar existed in that region.<br />In his prologue, Jared Diamond, whose scientific research is in molecular physiology, evolutionary biology and biogeography,  has written an eloquent essay on the issues and considerations to be taken into account in answering  this question, and how and why he has structured his book the way he has.  His basic thesis on the factors involved in the development of civilization is summarized in a schematic overview on Page 87 of the book, which includes the domestication of wild grasses, and animals as the first step on the way to developing food surpluses and hence allowing specialization in trades other than those required for the basic needs of obtaining food and shelter.  He explains that this step occurred in most continents of the world, but not  necessarily at the same time, and not with the same degree of success.  <br />In Chapter 9 of the book he explains why some animals can be domesticated and others not, the key requirement being the social structure of the species.  He explains that big mammalian species react to danger from predators or humans in different ways with some species (such as deer and antelope) being nervous, fast, and programmed for instant flight when they perceive a threat, while other species (such as sheep or goats) are slower, less nervous, seek protection in herds, stand their ground when threatened, and dont run until necessary.  Attempts to domesticate the first type of animal has generally been a failure.  The table of the Ancient fourteen species of big herbivorous animals is a very helpful summary of his major points.  He also explains that in the Americas and Australasia, such species did not exist, possibly because they were wiped out during the early migrations of man into those continents, and that in Africa, nearly all of the large mammals  were of the type of species which could not be domesticated.<br />In chapter 10 of the book he explains the importance of the major axes of the continents in the spread of domestication of grasses and animals, and that it was the East/West orientation of Eurasia which  was most suitable for this.  Chapter 11 is also very important in that it explains the lethal gift of livestock in the spread of epidemics of disease, which although disastrous for the populations affected, did in the end provide a certain immunity from such diseases as smallpox from which the American Indian was not immune.<br />Having explained these basic facts of life, the rest of his thesis falls naturally into place, and he points out that the European and Asian civilizations came into being primarily because of geographical advantages.  He deflates any arguments about intellectual superiority of the Eurasians , and shows quite convincingly  how quickly the native peoples of the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, and Australia adapted to the use of the horse, cattle, and other items of civilisation once they had access to them<br />I found this book to be interesting and convincing.  There were so many new facts of which I was not aware, that it will take time to absorb and fully understand them,  which means it's going to be necessary to read it again.  There is an extensive section of further readings with a useful bibliography for each chapter, which clearly demonstrates that Dr Jareds thesis is based on solid foundations.  I give this book 5 stars, not only because it gave me a new perspective on how civilisation began, but because it so well written and readable.
B000068TPN|4.0|We Were Soldiers is a refreshingly uncommon war movie. The movie disapproves of war.  However, acknowledging that war does exist, this movie celebrates the heroism that can be found in it.    <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers not only gives us a look at the soldiers whose side we're on, but the enemy soldiers as well.  It shows that these are people too; they have girlfriends, wives, sons and daughters, just as `our guys' do. The movie also shows us very accurately how war can affect these people who have relationships with the soldiers. <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers takes place in 1965; America has just entered the Vietnam War.   The movie is centered on the 7th Air Cavalry unit.  This new form of cavalry rides into battle not on horses, but in helicopters.  The movie focuses on the soldiers, their relationships with one another and their relationships with their families.  <br /> <br />The combination of realistic characters, a dramatic script and a heart-rending story may make viewers' emotions run high.  The movie was much more than gunfights and special effects.  Relationships were explored, and emotion was evident in each character, not always being expressed, but you could see it lying just under the surface.  It would be difficult to see the film in its entirety without tearing up. <br /> <br />Inspiring acts of heroism are celebrated throughout the movie. Selfless acts of bravery were apparent throughout the film.  People had to make sacrifices, and they were rarely for their own benefit.  These acts were also ironic in that many men died for the dead. <br /> <br />A huge slice at the beginning of the movie is used to get the audience familiar to the soldiers in the 7th Air Cavalry.  You get to know their families and their daily lives.  This is especially the case with young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) whose wife is due with a baby.  Klein played a much more sophisticated character in Geoghegan than he is used to (2001's American Pie 2, 2002's Rollerball).  Despite this, I think he did a commendable job.   <br /> <br />Getting familiar with the soldiers only serves to make the deaths of the soldiers hit us harder.  The deaths of the soldiers hurt us more when we find out news of their death is sent from Vietnam via telegrams.  It falls to Moore's wife to deliver these telegrams to the various families of the deceased, and we see these epitaphs in all their misery. These poignant scenes show us the full extent of the tragedy of death. They also force the viewers to ask some questions about war that one doesn't always keep in mind.  Is it really worth it? In war you need to know that the forces that made the war occur tried to do everything they could to prevent it from happening. War needs to be a last resort. This is clear from the outright pain and grief it causes other human beings. <br />  <br />The beginning also creates a sense of foreboding.  The first scene of the movie is of a French troupe of soldiers being massacred in the la Drang Valley.  This is the same valley in which the battle between Moore's troops and the Vietnamese was fought. Also, the name of Moore's troops, the 7th cavalry, is identical to that of the fabled General Custer.  Custer was a successful commander like Moore himself until his entire unit was massacred. Foreshadowing perhaps?   <br /> <br />Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is an accomplished commander that is appointed as the leader of this unit.  Mel Gibson (1995's Braveheart, 2000's What Women Want) delivers a stunning performance as Moore, the loyal leader who commands the 7th Air Cavalry. Gibson is familiar with the role of a courageous, inspiring leader (Braveheart, The Patriot).  Therefore, playing Moore probably wasn't a challenge for Gibson.  However, I can forgive him because he played the part flawlessly.  The character Gibson plays is both concerned about and dedicated to the troops he leads.  On the eve of the cavalry's departure to Vietnam, Moore proclaims, \\"When we go into battle, I will be the first to step on the field and I will be the last to step off.\\"  Soon, the unit is called into battle and they travel to Vietnam, to a world of war, violence, and destruction. <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young written by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L. Galloway. Randall Wallace, who directed it, also wrote the screenplay. Wallace also wrote 1995's Braveheart, 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, and 2001's Pearl Harbor. Wallace and Gibson have paired up before, and in Braveheart, the two were extremely successful together.  Wallace is obviously no newcomer to screenwriting and did a nice job converting the book into a form suitable for film.  He also does a good job directing the film.  He had previously directed 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, so this was not his first movie.  Violent war movies can be a tricky and nauseating experience if the battle scenes aren't filmed with expertise. The war scenes in the film were organized and clear, however they didn't fail to portray the reality of a real life gun battle.  Specifically the scene with the \\"hot LZ\\" was particularly well done.  Somehow Randall gave us a clear picture of the mayhem that was there along with showing us coherent shots that left us with no questions as to what was occurring. <br /> <br />Although We Were Soldiers might at times be graphic and at others emotionally tough, there is some comic relief.  Sgt. Maj. Plumley (Sam Elliott) is Colonel Moore's strict second-in-command. Elliot is an experienced actor who has been on the scene since the late 60's (1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1998's The Big Lewbowski).  However, I think Plumley posed a fun and fresh character for Elliot, and he played it to perfection.  Elliot's experience was an invaluable asset to the film.  Plumley's demeanor alone was always enough to give me a hearty chuckle. I found myself repeating one of Plumley's lines on multiple occasions, one that involves a fellow soldiers comment on the weather.  <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers is rated R, and for good reason.  Many of the gunfights in the la Drang valley and instances with napalm at the end of the movie are hard to stomach.  However, it is my belief that you need to show the world what war really is, how horrific and gruesome it can get. Powdering war up like a geisha is as good as lying to someone.  We Were Soldiers is the real deal; it gives us the impact of war and the reality of it in its entirety. People should see this movie, as it not only entertaining and captivating, but will also develop your understanding of war.  And in this, world, we desperately need this understanding.  Especially in the one we live in today. <br /> <br />
B00030590I|4.0|One of the primary pleasures of Hero is that Maggie Cheung is  remarkably resplendent in every frame in which she is present.  As a whole the  cinematography, set designs, action direction and special effects coalesce to create a bevy of astonishingly memorable scenes. <br /> <br />While Hero boasts a top-billing cast, the acting is a bit stilted, but it has an elegance to it that fits with the antiquated setting.   <br /> <br />A recommended gift for anyone who expressed the slightest interest after seeing the trailers.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Has anyone else noticed that all good coming-of-age films take place in the era of the Vietnam War? The turbulent times make for good cinema, even if the movie never deals directly with the war. In fact, the only reference to 'Nam in this film is a brief cameo by Brendan Fraser, as a disillusioned soldier.  <br />This film is full of clever, meaningful quotes. They often seem cheesy, but when taken into actual considerations, the messages in this film are truly inspiring.  <br />In the suburbs of thew early 1970's, four girls live and breath for eachother. There is the sensitive and curious Samantha (Gaby Hoffman), and her precocious best friend Teeny (Thora Birch), who is in a hurry to grow up. Their unlikely companions are the tough tomboy Roberta (Christina Ricci), and the innocent but insecure Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore). After a seance in the cemetary, they embark on the adventure that will inevitably claim the end of their childhood.  <br />All four of the girls give decent performances. The script is witty, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's sentimental candy, that will most be enjoyed by women.
1400034779|1.0|This is the first time in my life where I have bought a book, based on the printed reviews, and found them to be totally misleading!  <br /> <br />I am VERY displeased. The review on the cover of this book was definitely misleading. There was not one hilarious or even mildly funny episode in the ENTIRE book. I unfortunately kept reading it until the very end, thinking it has to get better. Where's all the funny stuff!!  <br /> <br />It was not written well. The story did not flow well. It is nothing but short stories about a few investigations and then WAH--LA she decides its time to get married...the end. This has to be the worst book I have ever read!  <br /> <br />I am really sorry I forked out my twelve bucks at an airport bookstore for this one.

Lo recomiendo abiertamente
B00005YW4H|5.0|this album surprised me. many of my friends had already bought and been devouring it, song by song, while i had heard some of the radio hits, like \\"dont know why\\", which they overplayed to death. once i burned it from a friend, though, i found a wealth of hidden gems on the record, things i hadnt expected: \\"seven years\\", sad and delicate, and \\"shoot the moon\\", full of romantic longing and its own unique norah jones-ish sort of sexual passion. i believe these two pieces are new compositions (correct me if im wrong), and as such, i have to disagree with the amazon.com reviewer, who claimed that the original pieces pale in comparison to the \\"great hits\\" of the album. Of course \\"the nearness of you\\" is a masterpiece, but i think the original songs possess a special, understated charm you cant find listening to an uber-famous, over-covered song for the umpteenth time.
0141301155|5.0|This is an excellent book for kids and adults.

B00005A46T|2.0|I just bought this CD 3 days ago. I sorta liked it at first, but i'm already tired of it. So tired of it. Some songs are filled with noise instead of actual riffs. And the songs don't sound very well organised. The guitars sound quite messy and weak. It isn't very heavy either, not that that's a bad thing. Not everything revolves around how heavy the music is, but i'm just saying that if you prefer heavy music over mellow music then this might not be the album for you. Although i must admit that Corey and Joey did a pretty good job on this album. And don't think that the reason i don't like this album is because they're mainstream. I couldn't care less if they're mainstream or underground, it does NOT change the music in any way.

B0000026NC|4.0|\\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" was the last of the live albums I needed to have all the live one's Pink Floyd released. I had no real desire to listen to it, but, as I am a bit of a collector, I needed it to help complete the collection.    It didn't start too promisingly. The version of \\"Shine On\\" is pretty rank. PULSE's is much better. But all the other cuts on the disc are good. Well, all but \\"Dogs of War\\" which is terrible anywhere, though it is MUCH improved over the studio version. The version of \\"Sorrow\\" here beats PULSE's by a mile. But the real treat here is \\"On The Turning Away.\\" The studio version was one of my favorite songs, so I was very pleased, so say the least, to discover that the live version puts it to shame. It's insanely good, and I wish I'd been there to see them perform it.    The second disc starts out very nicely. The version of \\"One of These Days\\" is very trippy and excellent. The version of \\"Time\\" however\\" is none too good. Wright's vocals aren't their best, and they leave out the \\"Breath (Reprise)\\" part. Without it, the song doesn't have it's, for lack of a better word, 'power.'    Also, the version of \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" is the absolute worst version I've ever heard. Man, it's bad. Just lifeless, and Dave's vocals are horrible. PULSE's is much better.    I really like the version of \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" The 'Doctor' vocals are much better here than on PULSE. The solo isn't as good though.     If you're gonna buy a Floyd live album, I'd say get this one last. I did, and I'm glad that's so. Go for IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE? first, then UMMAGUMMA for disc one, and PULSE. Then if you need more, get this. It's decent enough to spend $30 on.
B00018D3JQ|4.0|This album is one of the most ingenious things I have ever heard: covering songs like \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" and \\"I Melt With You,\\" among other songs, with acoustic guitars, synths and jazzy drums, making the album more suitable for easy listening than rocking out.  All the vocals are good, but some are weak, such as Camille's vocal on \\"Too Drunk to $%*#\\" (listening to the squealing on that song is very painful).  Overall I recommend this album to people that usually like their music eclectic and their electronica  downtempo.
B00008YJH5|5.0|From start to finish, something that will forever make me smile and remember when things were so much more fun. Couple of years back. Complete lack of any responsibilities. Close friends. Sitting under stars on the cricket pitch getting caned. Parties at peoples' mom's house. Drunk. Happiest time of life. Innocent. And every perfect moment of Surfer Rosa reminds me of this. Sublime. Cactus has the best rhyming couplet ever. Bone Machine makes me dance like a robot. Suffice to say, if you don't own this then you need to. And every other Pixies album. They're all nice.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|When I started listening to Rush two years ago (only 18, cut me some slack on that one), I started with their early stuff, 2112 (still my favorite), A Farewell to Kings, Fly By Night, etc. Then I progressed (pun intended) to their \\"middle\\" era, of Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures. I finally picked up Counterparts when the remaster was released, and was surprised to hear such a solid album. I enjoy Signals, but Presto didn't impress me all that much, and neither had Test for Echo. Counterparts, however, is a gem. Nobody's Hero, Between Sun & Moon, Alien Shores, and Double Agent are the standouts for me, but it is truely a sold album. I highly recommend it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This cd is one of the very few cd's i did not skip through when i first played it. <br />The lyric's are out of this world with real emiotons- greenday put ALOT of work into this cd and it shows. this is one of their best ever- <br /> <br />I have yet to HEAR one bad thing about this cd, I work at hot topic and I get to talk to alot of people daily and everyone who I talked to owns this cd. if you are thinking about getting this cd, think no more- you will go crazy and play it over, and over, andover heeh. (4 and 7 are my favroites)

B000089RVX|1.0|As a metal fan from the days of the Clash of the Titans tour, I am absolutely disgusted with these pop singers posing as metal, punk, and gothic artists.  The record industry has hit a new low with this one.  Evanescence is just the first in many industry moves to manufacture these wanabe gothic artists, another example is Avril Lavigne.  The songs of Evanescence are nothing more than pop songs beaten down your throat by a major label to sucker dim-witted teenagers out of their money and lying to these same teenagers that this music is dark.  This isn't dark.  If you want dark try Cradle of Filth, Black Zodiac, or the kings Slayer.  The major's couldn't get the goth kids to buy into the boy bands and Brittany Spear's clones, so they created Evanescence and Avril Lavigne.  The major's will stop putting out these albums if we the consumer refuse to buy them.  Instead of buying this album, try the albums recomended to buy instead.  Those artist are the real creators.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Have you ever been in a real ER during a real situation?  Seems like a strange question to lead off with, but there is method to my madness here.  There are two types present in the ER during a crisis.  The ER docs and nurses are all professional detachment.  They must refuse to see people and see instead busted body parts needing triage and repair.  This is necessary to survive the drama of the auto accident/plane wreck/etc.  The other type is in for a longer night.  The family and friends of the \\"busted parts\\" come in terrified and in tears.  They see loved ones horribly disfigured and in peril.         You cannot watch this movie as the ER doc or nurse.  You will see and remember only the graphically accurate spectacle-execution that was Roman crucifixion, which Mel has reproduced so clearly.  You will see a man reduced to busted and bloody parts that cannot and do not survive the day.  You will be one of the disgusted reviewers on this page who thinks the movie was all spurting blood and violence.         Put your defenses aside.  There is only one way to watch this movie.  Go as the family in the ER.         Yes, this means the impact of the film will slam into you with full force.  That is the point.  That's how you get the full meaning of the film as well.  The movie is not a festival of flying whips, nails and blood without context when you watch it as the family rather than the detached ER practitioner.  Half of this film is spent on both the reactions of those closest to Jesus to the present turmoil and on flashbacks to other moments of Jesus' life and the connection they have to the present torment he is enduring.  The critical quotes from the Gospels are there in the flashbacks to provide context to the sacrifice taking place so vividly before your eyes.  If you take it on squarely and fairly and let the imagery slam home, you may find yourself getting religion.  I did.        This will require courage.  It is easier to work yourself up into the tough ER-doc-type, especially on the small screen.  It is much harder to watch with an open mind and an open heart.  Give it a try, though, and you will find the loving context and the happy ending that gave meaning to the violent sacrifice.          This is a great movie.
0790731479|5.0|When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.  <br /> <br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note.

B00005JNDZ|2.0|Movies usually don't turn out better than the books they are based upon. Movie sequels, unless part of a trilogy, rarely turn out better than the original movies. However, movie sequels based upon book sequels usually turn out better (see THE LOST WORLD for example). BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't one of those cases. In fact, it's the exact opposite. This movie is an example of what happens when you make a copy of a copy a couple of times over. The original film adaptation of BRIDGET JONES was a joy to watch and in many ways improved upon the original novel. However, the book sequel was a disappointment and this movie sequel is a pure disaster. The film is one of the worst movies I have seen in a theatre in a long time and if it wasn't for the presence of Colin Firth, it wouldn't be worth watching ever.<br /><br />The first film stayed fairly close to the novel. This movie doesn't. That's not necessarily bad, especially seeing that the novel's sequel is inferior to the original writing as well. However, the way the filmmakers chose to veer away from the novel's plot is just so wrong. From the commuted stay and sentence in Thailand with very little background information to the turning of Bridget's nemesis Rebecca into a lesbian out to seduce her and not Mark Darcy to the complete disappearance of certain important events, situations, and people (e.g. naked housekeeper's son, the party at the summer house, Wellington) the book rarely uses the original text as an outline. Like I mentioned before, that's not necessarily bad, but instead of straying away from the text to improve upon it, the book swerves completely away.<br /><br />Then of course there are all the extras that were added. Supposedly to make the script more interesting: Bridget trying to buy a pregnancy test somewhere in, Austria I guess. Or how about the fistfight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant--the only reason that scene is even in the movie is so the directors could have some excuse to have Colin Firth fall in a fountain of water again and get soaking wet so that the ladies of England would lick their lips. Scenes like these add nothing to the story whatsoever. Not only that, they aren't even funny; not in a typical American-type ha-ha-funny, not in the usual droll British guffaw type funny. The only people who would get a serious laugh out of those scenes are people who aren't going to be watching the movie (the REAL WORLD/MTV crowed will be watching things like AMERICAN PIE, not BRIDGET JONES) to begin with. So why even bother to putt them in as filler?<br /><br />Besides all that, there's also the actors' enthusiasm. In the first movie, everyone seemed liked the must have really had a good time making the movie. In THE EDGE OF REASON, everyone but Colin Firth seems like they are just there to pick up a paycheck. Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress who is one of my favorites and one an Oscar nod for her first performance. In this movie, Zellweger appears as though all the weight gaining/loosing/gaining and other physical demands she has placed upon herself have gotten to her. Bridget no longer seems perky and adorable, but down and almost pathetic. Colin Firth does the best job out of all the actors, but even he at times seems like he's just walking through the paces following the tape on the floor. It just goes to show, if you're going to copy a copy of a copy of a copy, change it up a little bit and make it more original. Originality can be a lifesaver because Colin Firth isn't always going to be around.e Colin Firth fall in a fountain of water again and get soaking wet so that the ladies of England would lick their lips.

B0000004V2|5.0|With their soaring vocal melodies and virtuosos playing guitar, bass, and drums, the Stone Roses were poised to be the biggest band in the world until it went all wrong in the 1990's.  This is their debut and their absolute zenith.  From the haunting build-up in I Wanna Be Adores to the sheer happiness of She Bangs the Drums and Elephant Stone, to the jaw-dropping psychdelic freak-out jam that ends the sublime I Am the Resurrection, and the tripped-out dancebeats of Fools Gold (tacked on the USA version...it was originally a single), this album is just awesome. Essential listening.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|I guess that comes from the fact that this is an album of \\"singles\\", and the singles GNR chose off of the Use Your Illusion albums were mostly very poor choices.  But come on, there are 5 cover songs on this so called \\"Greatest Hits\\" album.  Two of the few singles off of UYI that they got right, Estranged (one of the greatest rock songs ever written) and The Garden, are nowhere to be found.  Since they insist on using \\"singles\\", why not put It's So Easy from AFD?
068484267X|5.0|In Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt describes his childhood in the impoverished town of Limerick with such lyricism and tongue-in-cheek retellings that the reader wants to laugh, cry, and raise an eyebrow in disbelief all at the same time. McCourt first lays down the foundations of his story in the events.  <br /> The book moves rather quickly from event to event: the reader sees his father and mother mourning over the death of their young daughter in America and then sees the entire family sleeping in a prison in Ireland because they have no money. McCourt so wonderfully recounts his memories, such as his experiences in the hospital to his adventures as a mail courier, with the same tone and opinions of his younger self that the reader can almost hear the young Francis talk to the angel on the seventh step or read aloud his composition to his class. McCourt manages to describe the most dismal situation with a tongue-in-cheek comment or an optimistic ending.  Along with the tone, the imagery in this novel is vivid. <br /> McCourt recounts such unique details, such as the newspaper wrapping of a hog's head falling apart to children competing for a teacher's apple peelings, that the reader is pulled into his life because it so different from their own and because there is so much emotion invested in these details. McCourt makes sure that when he describes his life, it will be totally singular in its description. <br /> Overall, Angela's Ashes was simply amazing. Even though the reader is swept into a unique childhood full of hunger and starvation, McCourt manages to a \\"silver lining\\" in his despair.
0140277447|1.0|<br />Iris Chang seems to have set out to capture the Rape of Nanking in an objective fashion in her \\"Rape of Nanking.\\" Instead we get an unbelievably flawed book. From facts and sources that are made up to doctored photographs, Chang plays with the reader's emotions. Don't be fooled, to hear Chang tell it is to have it lose its importance amongst unrepresentative anecdotes and uncited details.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is due to be one of their biggest selling CDs to date, as of now it's at 9 million and counting.  <br /> <br />It covers a lot in very little time, and sticks to just the #1 hits, which also means a lot of songs people love are omitted. 62-66 and 67-70 covers a lot more territory, but most people will just buy all of the CDs.  <br /> <br />But this collection hits you with wall to wall classic songs. The first 14 is the Beatlemania era material, from 15 on it starts getting into their more \\"experimental\\" era. Nothing from Sgt. Pepper or the White Album make it on because there were no singles from those albums at the time.  <br /> <br />I think that for people who haven't bought a Beatles CD and are interested in 60s music, this one is a great starter of the biggest band of that era.  <br /> <br />However, it would have been great if they had made this one with a DVD of their videos and TV appearances like the Beach Boys did with \\"Sights and Sounds\\". \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" were the only ones not to have promo videos (although the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" film would've been fine). Most of the clips are on \\"Anthology\\", but how many times is someone actually going to watch that just for the music part?   <br /> <br />If they are going to repackage the \\"hits\\", why not do something like a \\"singles collection\\" box set that covers the singles and EPs put out in America and the UK (which comes out to 30 US and 35UK-UK had more EPs), as well as a 2 CD set that covers both hits and album cuts more than 62-66 and 67-70 do?  <br /> <br />

B000002AS3|5.0|Oasis emerged out of the woodwork in a sudden moment in mid-1994 to become one of the most remarkable rock bands in recent memory. <br /> <br />It was this album, Definitely Maybe, that started Oasis-mania; or in graver terms, the new britpop invasion of the world.  <br /> <br />Definitely Maybe is definitely a classic. Noel Gallagher, the band's lead guitarist and songwriter, gives out one classic song after another. Whether it's the cool rock phenomena of Supersonic and Live Forever, the best composition Noel has written over the past 10 years. Fan favorites Columbia, Rock 'N Roll Star, Shakermaker, and Slide Away all have equal power to blow you away. The roof raising Up In The Sky is yet another example of Noel's writing genius. The low key but very blunt and funny Married With Children is the album closer leaving the listener with a nice tune to bid farewell to this rock epic before pressing the play button again! <br />Liam Gallagher, Noel's younger brother who also happens to be the band's vocalist frontman, is probably one of the best rock vocalists of the past twenty years. His voice shines on tracks like Slide Away, Live Forever, and Married With Children. <br /> <br />Today, Oasis are still a force to be reckoned with in the british charts, but elsewhere, their magnifying glory has either washed away or stumbled a bit. There's always Definitely Maybe and the follow up What's The Story Morning Glory to remind people that these guys aren't just some one hit wonders. They are in fact, in the Gallaghers' words, \\"the best band in the world\\" <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|There are no world domination conspiracies.  No extravagant super-gadgets.  No deadly supermodels and megalomaniac geniuses.  Just Bourne, his wits, a couple of guns, and whatever else he can get his hands on. <br /> <br />Firmly entrenched in reality (as much as having a martial arts expert with photographic memory, incredible marksmanship and driving skills, coupled with fluency in at least four languages, and spycraft/black ops training is feasible in the real world), The Bourne Supremacy follows in the footsteps of The Bourne Identity to deliver solid action which is a refreshing break from the cartoon shenanigans of Bond. <br /> <br />The film opens two years after the events of The Bourne Identity, where Jason Bourne, a black ops assassin played by Matt Damon, had become amnesiac and severed his ties with the CIA.  Jason and his lover, Maria, played once again by the German actress Franka Potente, have been skipping around the globe and are currently hiding in India.  However, events beyond his control conspire to drag him back to the conspiracies and machinations of hidden players.  An undercover CIA agent is murdered in Berlin, and all the evidence points to Bourne.  Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and some minor players return from the first movie, and Joan Allen is introduced as a high level CIA administrator who wants to track Bourne down.  There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, lots of globetrotting, including visits to Paris, Berlin, and Moscow, and great set pieces. <br /> <br />The return of most of the cast from the first movie serves as a great means of establishing continuity.  Strangely enough, Ms. Stiles is once again delegated to a very minor role (in the first movie, she was little more than a glorified phone operator), but this time around, she has a key scene with Mr. Damon.  Ms. Allen has great presence and manages to hold her own in her many scenes with Mr. Cox.  Mr. Damon thoroughly inhabits the role of Bourne, convincingly playing aruthless assassin who, despite intense conditioning to be a remorseless killer, is struggling to regain his humanity.  Mr. Damon has once again spent considerable time conditioning himself for the role, and it shows.  He is lean, fit, and utterly believable in his fighting sequences.  However, more than being just another action hero, Mr. Damon also brings convincing intelligence to the role.  The audience can believe that Bourne is constantly thinking two steps ahead of everyone else, that anything can become a weapon in his hands, that he is always considering a way out, and that every act, even simply picking up a bottle of vodka, has a reason. <br /> <br />The image quality of the DVD is excellent, although in parts it seemed too dark.  The filming technique used by the director, which involves extensive use of hand-held and shoulder-mounted cameras, has been much criticized, and must have been a dizzying experience in the movie theater, but in the confines of a big screen TV, it serves to bring the viewer right into the action.  Granted, some of the quick editing and shaky camera work make a few of the fight scenes claustrophobic and confusing, but that seems to be the desired effect.  There are a handful of deleted scenes (which are of much lower video quality and don't really add much to the plot; they are also all strung together - one cannot select individual deleted scenes), director's comment track, and some other production segments.  I have not heard the director's commentary or examined the other documentaries, yet.  One nitpick of the DVD is Universal's decision to add unskippable advertising at the beginning.  One cannot press menu to escape; one is forced to fast forward through the useless ads. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0060958324|5.0|I've procrastinated for months before writing this review because I was afraid of doing the book a disservice. But....the time has come :-)<br /><br />I love this book - for its excellent handling of an oblique subject, and for giving us a message for the times.<br /><br />In Pirsig's words, ZATAOMM has acquired \\"kulturbearer\\" status - i.e., it encompasses entire realms of thought within our present culture, and it attempts to carry these things into cultures of the future.<br /><br />It talks about the split between Art and Technology and the unease of regarding one from the other standpoint. It discourses about the innermost mechanisms that make \\"Hip\\" and \\"Square\\" two distinct schools, and how they actually represent two different worldviews. But Pirsig is about unifying, not dividing. He delineates the divisions, only to unify them later.<br /><br />The book seeks to create a framework (of thought) from which such  concepts - Art/Technology, Hip/Square , Groovy/Classical - need no longer be treated as disparate entities. This is an ambitious work all right. Pirsig points you to subtle concepts - he needs to uncover the very nature of our natures before he can show you what's wrong with it. To do this, Pirsig deconstructs Perception to study why we believe what we believe - this involves discourses on Myth and Legend (my other hero, Joseph Campbell came to mind a lot in these passages).<br /><br />He goes back in history to the ancient Greek schools - Stoics, Aristotle, and the beginnings of Dialectic and Rhetoric. The last part of the book is pure detective work, where he uses thought structures as clues and tracks down the perpetrator of the crime; the crime being the modern disconnect between Form and Function, and the perpetrator being the person who dominated early Western thought and created the philosophical foundations of the Modern Western Industralised World. I won't reveal this villain here - go read the book.<br /><br />Pirsig opines that humans took a wrong turn at that point in history, and grew into a race of beings that only recognised Good-Bad, Right-Wrong, Theory-Proof, i.e. a \\"Dialectic Approach\\"  ; Pirsig blames this worldview for many modern evils.<br /><br />Pirsig claims to have studied Eastern philosophy - spent time in Benares, India and so forth. But his deconstruction is mainly relevant to Western thought, or Dialectic Reality. Some of his conclusions are indeed mirrored in Vedantic teachings. But, this reworking for a modern audience is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />The practical relevance of this philosophical tour-de-force is the message of Quality, its relation to happiness, and how to achieve it. Pirsig's Quality is not the ubiquitous quality - it is far more involved but very simple when you understand it. The book's final assertion is \\"From Caring comes Quality, from which comes happiness\\". \\"Gumption\\" is noted as something that will help achieve Quality, and Pirsig uses motorcycle maintenance as an illustration.<br /><br />Although the subject is so arcane, it is very interestingly rendered. The philosophical plot is masterfully interwoven with the mundane plot with descriptions of life on the road and with friends, and with his son, which are all relevant to the philosophy that follows it. And, there's also a dramatic twist in the story regarding the main characters in the book - i.e., Pirsig and his son, which really elevates the book.<br /><br />For all the heavy language and unintentional high-brow, this is a very humanistic work with a timeless message. This book will cease to be important the day happiness goes out of fashion.

B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|Bought this along with The Moody Blues' December cd when I realized just recently these were released last year. What a great surprise! Oh...and buy The Moodies' December if you liked this one. Tull's effort on this Christmas cd is just exceptional. From the music to the lyrics....this may be the best cd they have done since the early 80's...Ian never ceases to amaze me with his brilliant compositions and lyrics.
B000002I6V|4.0|Graham Nash has had five shots at solo albums, and this is the best by far.  I'll bet a lot of people were surprised at the quality of this effort, even though the album also makes it abundantly clear why Nash needed Stephen Stills, and to a lesser degree David Crosby, so much.  There is an overabundance of mid-tempo ballads here, and by the time you reach the two weaker tracks, 'Man In the Mirror' and the absurd 'There's Only One', you'll be searching for the skip button.  Unfortunately, the only song for us beginners that kicks [...] is the opener, 'Military Madness', and it isn't until track #10 that you come even close to toe-tapping again.  Nevertheless, you can't overlook most of what comes in between.    Nash assembled an interesting cast of characters for this 1971 'solo' debut.  'Crosby, Stills and Nash' veterans Johnny Barbata (drums) and Calvin Samuels (bass) are frequently featured, and Rita Coolidge provides ethereal background vocals and even some piano work.  The disc opens with one of Nash's finest compositions, 'Military Madness'.  It features a prominent and thoroughly enjoyable wah-pedal guitar front-and-center, compliments of Dave Mason.  Another guitar god, Jerry Garcia, makes two appearances on slide guitar, and David Lindley, best known for his work with Jackson Browne, offers fiddle on 'Simple Man'.  Stills is nowhere to be seen, and believe it or not, David Crosby only offers background vocals on one track.    All the songs are written by Nash, with one co-credit to Terry Reid ('Be Yourself').  The songs are classic circa-1970 fare.  Nash always prided himself on social consciousness ('Military Madness', 'Chicago', and 'We Can Change the World'), introspection ('I Use To Be a King', 'Be Yourself', 'Simple Man', and 'Man In the Mirror'), and intimate relationships ('Wounded Bird', 'Better Days', and 'Sleep Song'), and the album offers a nice balance among those interests.  There are some potent and thoughtful lyrics (\\"serenade your angel witha love song from your eyes\\" and \\"someone is going to take my heart but no one is going to break my heart again\\") and others that would be cheesy if they weren't delivered with such sincerity (\\"we can change the world, rearrange the world, it's dying to get better\\", \\"we needed a tutor, so built a computer, and programmed ourselves not to see, the truth and the lying, the dead and the dying, a silent majority\\").  Unfortunatley the lyrics to 'There's Only One' read like bad emementary school rhyming (\\"Do we stand the pace, or do we let the case go to waste, do you like the taste\\"), and some lyics are a bit absurd today as the ideals of the 1960's have crumbled (\\"rearrange the world...it's dying, rules and regulations who needs them, open up the door\\").    The first six songs on the disc together with the final three tracks possess substance and are sufficiently diverse to entertain and enlighten for about 23 minutes total, or what use to amount to one lengthy album side.  The liner notes include lyrics (YES!) and track listings with credits to the performers and running times.  Unfortunatey the disc is not remastered, but the sound is strong and vibrant.  If you like Nash's contributions on CSN albums, you're likely to like this.  Essential for CSN fans, definitely on the cusp for the casual fan.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Okay, so obviously many reviewers totally did not enjoy this movie, and do not find it believable - which is fine. However, taken as it is, a piece of fiction in film, I think that it was successful. <br /> <br />Let's face it: the effects of global warming are indeed all around us, with acid rain and the spread of once tropic-exclusive diseases, but I think that \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" does exemplify the effects of our pollution, but for a point. Toward the end of the film, I thought that it was a bit preachy about what we should be doing with the world's resources, but you have to admit that the film was rather entertaining. <br /> <br />First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely divine in just about everything, from \\"Donnie Darko\\" to \\"The Good Girl,\\" so it's no surprise that he did a great acting job in \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" either. <br /> <br />There are emotional aspects to the film, also, with children being left behind in a cancer ward of a hospital, to people freezing alive in the eye of the storm, to a father fighting to save his son. <br /> <br />Like I already mentioned, I don't think that the plot is currently feasible, but instead serves as a warning to what may come in many, many, many years. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the film and would watch it again. I recommend it to fans of Gyllenhaal and advocates for the environment. Keep an open mind and remember that another ice age probably won't happen for many years to come (despite the fact that the film scared my 16-year-old sister silly). If your kids are sensitive or scare easily, monitor the film while watching.
B000067CQK|2.0|Needless to say this is a CLASSIC album, surely one of Bowie's best. But this re-issue leaves me a little cold. The demos are of little consequence, far inferior to their ultimate recorded versions, and are of interest only to hard core fans( which, I suppose, is what this is aimed for ). The new version of \\"Moonage Daydream\\" also cannot touch the original. And the liner notes...uuuugh. Who REALLY cares about the impact of this album on Gary Kemp or Ian McCulloch,  for pete's sake??? I would have rather read more quotes and interviews from those involved in the making of the album, not from  members of  long forgotten, marginally successful early eighties pop bands. My final compaint is the packaging itself. As one reviewer here noted, the case is flimsy and mine is also already falling apart, and the slipcases  that house the discs themselves are too tight and are causing  scratches when taken in and out.If you already have Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars on cd, do yourself a favour and keep it, and  don't bother with this over-priced re-issue.
B000003TAW|5.0|rivers cuomo is arguably the best songwriter of this time.  Of course i wont argue it.  This album is the perfect example of great songwriting.  rivers knows how to craft amazing melodies and turn them into wonderful pop tunes.  And the great thing about weezer, this album especially is the fact that they can pull off having a kind of polished pop sound to their punk/alternative/garage sound.  Weezer is a great band and this is a great album.
B00023B1LC|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a splendid cross between The Terminator and Three Days of the Condor. Jason Bourne is a highly trained government agent whose $33 million dollar pricetag has just been exceeded by his liability to the government. Virtually a killing machine, he has one overarching problem; he can't remember who he is. But when highly trained agents like him become activated and begin looking for him, the action is non-stop.<br /><br />I usually judge movies up to four stars and this is a great three star movies. (Lately I've been enjoying superb three-star movies like Spider-man 2 better than 4-star introspective movies hailed by the industry.)<br /><br />The extras are junk and I'd advise against watching the alternative ending and the extended farmhouse scene. Both ended up on the cutting room floor for excellent reasons.<br /><br />On the other hand, unlike Spider-man 2, this probably isn't a movie you'll want to watch over and over. Once you know what happens, the suspense on which this film hangs dissipates. So consider renting it before buying it. Still, it's fun to watch with people who have never seen the movie.<br /><br />We need more films like this.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is the most brilliant piece of artwork I have ever heard.  Though very non-accessible, the lyrics are, for a lack of better words, genius.  If you don't believe me or have any trouble getting the idea behind the songs, feel free to visit songmeanings.net and look at my explanations of each song.  Once you hear this album and understand the point of each song, you will love it to death.  On top of the lyrics being pure genius, the melodies and harmony are absolutely beautiful, especially if you are a stoner lol.  Rick Wright and Syd Barrett team up to make some of the best keyboard/organ and guitar sounds you will ever hear.  I have always made an argument that pink floyd, from this album all the way to the wall, has the best guitar playing ever.  The guitars speak for the singer, and the singer supports the guitar with amazing vocals.  Buy this, and buy The Wall.  You will be glad you did.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I am a big anime fan. I love Miyazaki's work. I've seen and own Princess Mononoke, I've <br />seen Spirited Away (I'd don't own it yet but plan to), and I've seen Castle in the sky. This <br />movie, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind is probably, in MY opinion, his best work. <br />This movie has been though a lot though. This movie was released a long time ago, <br />without Miyazaki's permission, as a horribly cut up version of the original film called <br />Warriors of the Wind. I have Warriors of the Wind on VHS. Even horribly cut up, this <br />was probably one of the best animated films I have seen. The first time I saw the movie it <br />had me sitting on the edge of my seat, it made me laugh, and it made me cry, but the <br />greatest feeling I got was from the ending (I will not spoil it for those of you who haven't <br />seen it). This movie has the same gorgeous artwork that Mononoke has, the same <br />wonderful uplifting music, and I think good voice-overs (mind you I saw the Warriors of <br />the wind version so the voices might be different on this one). If you like Miyazaki films, if <br />you like gorgeous artwork and awesome music, then you must see this work of art, <br />because that is what Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind is, a true work of art.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this album is simply amazing. If you are one of those kids who will not listin to anything except Simple Plan and Good Charlette this is not for you.
B000000W3G|5.0|ive been listin to the pumpkins for about 12 years now, and this is their best, by far, machina is DEFINITELY their second best, it is not just some b-side to MCIS it is its own album, all the songgs are good enough to be cover songs. yea, they are my fav band and stuff, but i aint given u some damn crappy review, im giving you the best i can give a five star rating and id give it more if i could! well thats it id buy it if i were you, i did and im quite pleased.

6300273199|5.0|An awesome classic concert for sure! I'm glad they finally decided to release this on DVD!
B00064AM6C|5.0|Wow, I mean WOW!!  What can you say?  Come on people, get off your butts and watch this!  Next time I look this up I want to see 100 reviews!  If you care about music, are passionate about it, love it, then this is for you.  This is pure Rock and Roll, pure energy, pure talent.  When something like this comes along it renews my faith in the youth, if they are putting this out, and kids are digging it, then all will be good.  There is no hype in the case of the White Stripes because it is all TRUE.  They are simply BRILLIANT.  Anybody who enjoys good rock and roll will be blown away by this.  Buy this!  And then go and see the tour the next time they hit the road.  Hey, this is only because I care man.
B00005HYH6|3.0|Okay, this is next to impossible to critique, but let me say that if you like strange, you'll like this.  Above all else, this is strange. <br /> <br />On its original 1970 recording, the 23+ minute 'Atom Heart Mother' suite squeezed out every groove available on the virgin vinyl.  Why is anyone's guess.  You could easily cut out a minute here or a minute there and not impact the overall effect an iota.  I'm not entirely sure what value the patchwork of orchestrations, rock and roll flourishes, or sound effects have.  I suppose this could be inspirational background music for an artist in their studio, or a refreshing change of pace for a road warrior who has tired of traditional musical formats on their endless travels.  I'm not saying this isn't creative or intriguing or entertaining... it's just so wierd (though not as weird as The Beatle's 'Revolution #9\\") that I'm not sure what to do with it.  Ditto for 'Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast', 'structured' around the random conversations, clatterings, and sizzling present in a breakfast scene.  Artistically it's the equivilent of Jerry Seinfeld's 'show about nothing', but without the laughs. <br /> <br />The disc does feature three songs that are more traditional in their organization.  I would swear however that Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Richard Wright sat down and decided they would all write one laid-back ballad for the disc.  These three tunes, 'If', 'Fat Old Sun', and 'Summer'68' are all lovely, nuanced compositions, though none stand out like 'Breathe' from 'Dark Side of the Moon', or 'Pillow of Winds' from 'Meddle'.  Only Gilmour's 'Fat Old Sun' breaks out for some inspired psychedelic guitar work, one of Floyd's trademarks.  They're nice enough sounding, with somewhat mysterious lyrics. <br /> <br />The weirdness continues with the photography featured in the inserts and on the disc itself, heavy on cows and the material culture of cow life.  We have a close up of a snout and an udderly hooked-up mechanical milking device.  These photographs would seem to accompany some of the song titles, such as 'Breast Milky', and the predictable shovel-shot for 'Funky Dung'.  Whoever came up with all this, and what did they expect listeners to do with it?  I suppose the mystery is somewhat (but only somewhat) entertaining in itself.  <br /> <br />I am convinced there will never be another 'Atom Heart Mother'.  I just don't know if that's good or bad.
B0006399FS|1.0|This band is fronted by Bono--[...]    Bono is a hypocritical egomaniac.  I hate it when ENTERTAINERS go political!  Did somebody forget to tap Bono on the shoulder and tell him he's not a politician?  Oh wait, he already knows that!  But he'd never admit it to his gullable fanbase.  Every trip he makes to Africa, every charity he donates to, every benefit concert he plays...all of these things fuel the propaganda machine that has kept this awful band on top of the charts since the 1970s.    Don't buy into the hype about Bono.  He's a hypocrite, just like Jim Baker or Jimmy Swaggart.  This multi-millionaire keeps claiming that he \\"wants to help people\\".  Yet every time he \\"helps people\\" it draws more attention to himself and U2's record sales go through the roof.    Bono's \\"humanitarian work\\" is nothing more than a washed up rock star stroking his ego.  Can't you see?  Bono couldn't care less about the world's problems.  Bono is a phony!
B00004SVID|4.0|According to several Floyd biographies I have read, the Wall concert was staged and filmed twice by Alan Parker ( who directed the feature film of the same name ) for inclusion in the movie that eventually came out in 1982. That footage was never used in the film, obviously. SOMEWHERE out there in the vaults is a terrific concert just crying out to be released on DVD. This should have happened here, but didn't. Having said that, this is a terrific live album. Very well played, and it sounds good. The photos in the deluxe book I bought left me wanting more, though. I wanted to SEE the concert as well as hear it. The cynic in me makes me think that in a few years, when the money starts getting a little low the Floyd  will release this one again, and give the fans the real treat of the Wall concert on DVD. Look for it around Christmas, as this was about the time this one was released  :-P
0679746048|5.0|Set in a psychiatric hospital in 1967, the story is told by 18-year-old Susanna, who is dealing with depression and spending her days in McLean Hospital near Boston. We learn about the hospital and all the different patients through her eyes, while trying to understand her mental illness. First there was the suicide attempt, a halfhearted one because Kaysen made a phone call before popping 50 aspirins, leaving enough time to pump out her stomach. The next year it was McLean, which she entered after one session with a bullying doctor, a total stranger. Still, she signed herself in: \\"Reality was getting too dense...all my integrity seemed to lie in saying No.\\"  <br /> <br />I like this book a lot. I'm not a big reader, but when I do get into a book it's usually a biography or something that could really happen in life. This book shows mental illness from a point of view you wouldn't normally expect to see it from unless you experienced it yourself.  For such a serious subject, I personally think it's told in a very playful way, almost sarcastically. But it's what happened to Kaysen, so considering she did a very good job of not making it boring there was always something going on.  It also shows you how things were dealt with back in the late 60's. And how they are dealt with so differently know.  It really makes you look at life in a different way. It really helps you to think about your life and choices you have to make. It makes you goes deep into your heart and mind.   <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about real life situations. If you like to read a book with a lot of opinion, this is a good one. I really liked Girl Interrupted. It taught me a lot about how life is, and how you have to take it as it comes at you. <br /> <br /> _ <br />
0316666343|3.0|The book begins with a brilliant 5 chapters that are powerful, emotive and compelling. The way Sebold portrays the horror and grief of the family is incredibly moving.   However as the main action happens at the beginning of the novel, the story rapidly goes downhill.  Sebold seems to struggle for something to write and  therefore dwells on inconsequential details, which makes the rest of the book rather tedious to read. The book's pace also seems erratic. Several chapters are spent describing a couple of months, and then several years are skipped in a paragraph before another couple of months are detailed again. <br /> <br />Towards the end there is a truly pathetic sexual act that betrays the fact that it was a child, not a red blooded woman,  that was killed. I thought the fact that Sebold did not have the tidy ending where justice prevailed, was bold but the killer's end is rather contrived.   <br /> <br />All in all, Sebold has written a book with a fantastic opening, it's a shame the rest of the book does not live up to its promise.
0446310786|5.0|I think many people have missed the point of the book. The book is a classic coming of age story about two young siblings in the south. It's told from the point of view of Scout, a preteen girl. The different events in the book are relevant because they lead to Scout's maturity. She goes from an innocent child, to a maturing preteen. Example: In the begining of the novel, Scout and her brother Jem are obsessed with the idea of Boo Radley. They don't view him as a human being. He is this scary thing that they don't quite believe is real. They come up with ideas to get him to come out of the house. They even try to look through his windows to catch a glimpse of him. Later, when Boo saves Scout and Jem from Mr. Ewell, Scout feels ashamed of she and her brother's previous treatment of Boo Radley. She realizes that he's just another human being. He's nothing to be afraid. He deserves to be treated the same as everyone else. That moment was when Scout left her childhood behind. The rape trial is also another turning point in Scout's maturity. It's not about rape or racism. Those themes help to shape the person that Scout will become. I loved this book and I plan on buying it so I can read it whenever I feel like it. I've read some of the reviews here. I think it's sad that many people missed the point of the book. I also think that this book might not be for everyone. I think southerners will relate to the book better than anyone else. I found Scout and Jem's way of life to be very much like my own growing up. I think the book is a must read for everyone, but people need to open their minds and look deeper. Look past the rape and racism. The book is about so much more than that.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This edition of Mary Poppins will captivate you and entertain you to no end! GRIN Finally, a QUALITY two DVD set of this awesome classic Disney picture! I remember seeing Mary Poppins when I was much younger and this release does not disappoint! It is loaded with extras and the quality of the picture and sound is excellent!<br /><br />The plot of the movie involves Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who becomes the governess of the Banks children who have a stuffed shirt father. (By the way, this part is similar to the role Julie would play the following year as Maria in The Sound of Music.) How Mary finds out about the job is in itself magical since the father of the Banks children had thrown away the letter they wrote asking for a nanny! We never get to know where she came from, either! Mary uses her love and natural powers to bring joy to the Banks children without ever being too overbearingly \\"preachy.\\" Later on in the movie the father is faced with the possible loss of his job and the moral of the story is delivered to the audience in a very well done fashion.<br /><br />The acting is superlative and the musical numbers are unforgettable. To this day \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" remains an extremely catchy song and the other songs like \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" and \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" are completely enchanting!<br /><br />But there's more! This DVD set is loaded--and I mean loaded--with valuable extras that will entertain you and raise your understanding of how the film was made as well as its history. For example, there's \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins\\" - a new 50-minute documentary, footage of the \\"Gala Movie Premiere,\\" and a make up test for Dyke Van Dyke. There are songs and games for children (and the children in us), too!<br /><br />After you see this you will understand why the movie got Julie Andrews a Best Actress Oscar (in her film debut, no less) and why Dick Van Dyke is so talented and perfect for his role as Mary's boyfriend. (Look for Van Dyke also in the role of the senior officer of the bank!) All together the film received 13 Oscar nominations including Best Song for \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee!\\" Although some of the technical effects are not the state of today's art, the film did receive Oscar awards for technical effects and music. Simply put, I highly recommend this two DVD set for Disney fans, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke fans, and fans of musicals.

B00003CXA2|5.0|<br />What can I say? This movie is simply amazing, and Tom Hanks is definitely the best actor of the century.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is easily a huge step up from Songs in A-Minor.  With some of the best tracks of the year, Alicia has re-established herself as the r&b's top female, ahead of Beyonce, Ashanti, and the rest.  All have immense talent, but Alicia has an extra something that separates her from the rest of the pack.  Whether it be her rich, powerful voice, her seamless ability to run her fingers across the piano and sing in perfect synchronization, her abilty to captivate an audience with a single note, her heartfelt, moving lyrics, or just her beautiful face, Alicia has really shown that she is the best in the biz.  This album is a real stunner, with its flowing, smooth r&b perfection.  The first single You Don't Know My Name, co-written with Kanye West, is a solid smooth track, but it is Alicia's second hit, If I Ain't Got You, that brought her back to the top.  One of the best r&b songs ever, Alicia's music, lyrics, and voice blend together perfectly, and became one of 2004's biggest.  After the short, but breathtaking intro, comes Alicia's fourth single from Diary, Karma.  One of the best tracks of the album, Karma is flawless and addictive from start to finish.  Heartburn follows as it throws you back a few decades (I think!) and makes you wanna get up and dance!  Another highlight is Alicia's third single of the album and the title track, Diary.  A very relaxing, smooth r&b song that shows Alicia's mastery of her voice and the piano.  While Dragon Days is leaving some people scratching their heads, I think it is a very interesting track and blends Alicia's soulful voice with some edgier music.  Other highlights include Wake Up, the superb When You Really Love Someone, and Slow Down.  My one complaint is that it doesn't have very many upbeat tracks and she doesn't sample more hip-hop material like Beyonce did.  Beyonce's album starts with some hot hip-hop tracks and mellows out with ballads during the middle of the album and towards the end.  I wish Aliciawould have done the same and added a Naughty Girl or Baby Boy, but Diary is still a winning, hit formula.  The album does have a few dry spots here and there, but all in all, a wonderfully crafted album that will satisfy any r&b fan!  Very worthy of being one of 2004's biggest selling albums! Now I just hope she'll have a new album out soon or at least release one of those money-stealing re-releases (I'm desperate for a copy with the amazing Usher remix of If I Ain't Got You or one of my faves, My Boo)!
B00005QFE5|5.0|I am not a big fan of Zhang ZiYi, however, I did like \\"Road Home\\" a lot! Comparing her usual roles as a tough sword fighter such as in \\"Hidden Draggon Crouching Tiger\\" or \\"House of Flying Daggers\\", I think this kind of movie suits a lot better for Zhang ZiYi. Speaking from Asian point of view, she is not the prettiest girl you can find in Asia but she definitely has the quality of sweetness and confidence in her look, which fits perfectly with the role in this movie. <br /> <br />The story is indeed a celebration of great and undying love between lovers. What gives a greater impact on this movie is the way the story is set in a backward Chinese village where grand love is least expected to be found. The kind of simple yet passionate love between the two lovers in the movie has almost become extinct in reality.  <br /> <br />This kind of movie is very refreshing to the audience because it does not follow the typicality of most American movies where stories start off happily and end happinly.  <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this movie!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The humor is subtle and off the wall. Fantastic film. I'm voting for Pedro.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|\\"Lost In Translation\\" was unbelievably slow and boring. The story was set in Japan. The story was about the rising and falling emotions between a newly wedded young girl whose marriage has just passed on from the honeymoon period, and a 40 year old man who is having a mid-life crisis. The girl is bored in her marriage, so is he. What seemed strange was that the movie's name is \\"Lost In Translation\\", and since the story is set in Japan, you would think this might be some kind of love story between an American and a Japanese. But it turned out that it was a story between two Americans. This totally defeats the purpose of having the movie set in Japan. The only thing that is remotely related to Japan is when they shamelessly make fun of Japanese people and the cultural differences.     There isn't a structured plot in this moive. Mostly it is just random scenes put together, added by a couple of funny scenes of making fun of Japanese people. The scenes moved on extremely slowly. Sometimes it just makes you want to scream to the screen \\"Go to the next scene already!!\\"    I totally didn't get this movie. I remember after watching the movie, I was just sitting there thinking about what I just saw and I tried to come to a conclusion of the movie, but I couldn't. I still can't.     If you got couple of hours to kill, watch this movie. But don't expect to understand it.     Purple_Garden
B00005JLTN|1.0|What more is there to say than this was utterly predictable and a complete waste of time? It actually is amazing that so many people were involved with the film and such a large amount of money was spent on it, and all they did was steal from other movies and leave the viewer saying, \\"That's it?\\" Avoid this garbage from here on out.  <br /> <br />
B00005J79H|4.0|I don't know what is with me and Acoustic/Unplugged releases and how they are presented. Not even close to a Nirvana production, but yet, still good. Do I agree with some of the choices of songs...obviously not. But I am intrigued with this.....along with shows involving STP. It is stripped down and I actually think it works.....if they had carefully thought this out, I would have rated higher. <br /> <br />Let me say this, before continuing to read on. I am not a Mega-Scorpions fan. I havn't bought every release they ever produced. I have owned maybe (3) of their releases over time. <br /> <br />I do like a majority of the so-called \\"Stripped Down\\" versions of classic material. Songs like \\"Holiday\\", I have a mixed feelings about. On one hand, I like what they did, BUT, I still miss the Live Interaction with the concert goers this song has generated before in the past. Not the case here. <br /> <br />Things about this I do not like......1 of 3 decent covers which could have easially replaced original material. \\"Love of my Life\\" is more than suitable for my taste. After that....no thank you! Other things......not the complete show. Should not have to say more. <br /> <br />Is it a Must.....probably not....but, its still a good listen, from time to time. And if you can tolerate watching many quick shots of an attractive dancer, than check out the video version of this release!?!?!?!?
031286504X|2.0|Average storyline from the 1950's, taken from existential plays, Matheson's writing style doesn't really seem important enough to give us an edge towards the book. All the character does is \\"drink all day and smoke\\".  He seems to have left the book awhile before returning to the ending which seemed far fetched and absurd.  Other stories in here include boring cliched type horror stuff that isnt really stimulating.  This book would have been good if I was 14 but now it is just average.
B00005JMAH|5.0|When I first saw \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" in the theaters, I was a bit pissed off, to say the least. A lot had been changed and cut from the book, events reordered, Hogwarts' geography seemingly changed, etc. However, now that I've had the chance to see it on DVD, I have warmed to it. Regardless of the changes made, it is a great film in its' own right. I hope to see more of Harry, Prof. Dumbledore (with a better wardrobe) & co. in \\"Goblet of Fire\\".
6305603847|2.0|I often heard how great this film was and finally decided to see for myself if the reviews would stand or not. This is an incredibly shoddy and boring piece of work. There is nothing but boredom in this production. I think the only decent scene was some of the fascist stuff but that was it. Not recommended at all. The director also flopped out with 'Evita' another lacking film.
0486266885|4.0|Quite short story, but one of the best Ive read of RLS. Last book he wrote before he died I think....<BR>Great story, great fast read..<BR>Please check it you for yourself. Youll be happy that you did !!
B00006HBUB|1.0|Boy, this movie was pure junk, imagine the brady bunch meets Hong Kong Fooey and this is what you get. The script was probably written by an exec who was only thinking about money and not realizing that in order to make entertainment work, it has to \\"entertain\\". The list goes on about how to make a better movie but it will never happen since people are gobbling up this poo by the truckloads. And I should mention that Scooby is one of the stupidest creations ever made from a computer, he makes Jar Jar from Star Wars look like a dirty sock hand puppet.
0486282112|5.0|One on a list of many that I always wanted to read... Recently finding the time, i picked it up from the library and read it. It was a great read, its written in old/middle english, but not bad enough that you cant tell whats going on. Its a great story, it really is. Forget what you think you know about the story of Frankenstien, read the book !!!
0790731452|1.0|Tim Burton strikes out again in this inflated rip off of 1950's B Budget films that were actually quite more enjoyable and inventive. This is the shortcoming of Hollywood when a mediocre director gets a ton a money, desirable actors, and does nothing with it except give us cool looking, mischievous aliens that were theived from bubble gum cards. This is an agony to watch because nothing ever happens except a weird 'buzzing' sound that is actually a Theremin machine that was used in the classic sci-fi tradition. You are better served by watching 'War of the Worlds' for the 10th time again. Leave this stinker in the can.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Having enjoyed some really great disaster movies in the past: \\"The Airport Series\\", \\"The Posieden Adventure\\", \\"The Towering Inferno\\", I was eager to see this one.  But about 30 minutes into the movie, I became bored and after about an hour, I was fast forwarding the DVD trying to get to something good. <br /> <br />The special effects were sophomoric, the characters flat, and the ending was a welcome relief. With stars like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, and Jake Gyllenhaal, I had hopes that the acting would be good.  I was wrong.  Their performances were one-dimensional and predictable. <br /> <br />They wasted a lot of money and talent on this dud. Pass on this one.
B00000IBRI|4.0|Argento seems to have lost his complete touch on films after the 1980's but his horror films are still worth watching and above average, almost filled with an artistic intent. Creepers is a little film about an odd case of communicating with bugs and savage killers. I especially liked the weird creature found inside the film, I won't give it away so you have to watch.
B0006399FS|1.0|I have a better title for this album , How to dismantle a legendary band, why? because u2 finally did it , they dropped a stinker , I kept wanting to fall asleep during this album, the lyrics were uncharacteristicly flat and meaningless for a U2 production, even that \\"pop\\" album they did a while back had some compelling singles, this one has no character, it is flat and depthless. there seems to be no other reason for its release other than the compelling desire to fulfill a contractual obligation. I think the other reviewers summed it up with one word, yawwn
B00005JLTN|1.0|What more is there to say than this was utterly predictable and a complete waste of time? It actually is amazing that so many people were involved with the film and such a large amount of money was spent on it, and all they did was steal from other movies and leave the viewer saying, \\"That's it?\\" Avoid this garbage from here on out.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Best album ever. And if anyone who \\"genuinely\\" disagrees with me, that's fine you are entitled to your own opinion-but what really annoys me is when you have certain \\"snob\\" people that think that it's cool to go against the consensus of the majority-therefore bashing a great artist's work simply because they think it's the \\"cool\\" thing to do.  <br /> <br />You know, in a weird way Radiohead and this album Ok Computer in particular are both overrated and underrated. Overrated because of so much hype (which I personally think it is worthy of praise, but too much hype is never good) underrated because of being bashed and looked down upon because of that. The \\"too cool\\" people are the ones that pay too much attention to the hype that they don't give Radiohead and this album a chance and never really allow themselves to enjoy it without being so damn critical. <br /> <br /> This is an album that gets better and better with repeated spins. It registers more as a masterpiece the more you actually get into it because it amazingly has so much unbelievable detail that there is something that always stands out that you didn't appreciate before. I mean when I hear this record now, I am just blown away by the amazing detail and that a band could come up with so much even in the span of one song. Think about how much time they spent in the studio. It's obvious that Radiohead work their asses off and deliver the goods. Everytime too.  <br /> <br />Radiohead are the best band that I can think of. I'll even go as far as saying better than the Beatles. The problem is because people don't like to give props to modern or recent bands (unless they are Nirvana and surrounded by tragedy) they would rathers talk up bands from the 60's and 70's. But someday Radiohead will get their due for ALL of their work and just as a band in general. It may take many years down the road but soon  the \\"too cool\\" people will be all over Radiohead and instead of deeming them overrated (therefore underrating them somehow) they will put them up there with the best. I think personally that they are THE best. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks on OK Computer are.. <br />Exit Music (For a film)-which always gives me chills, Thom Yorke's vocals are beyond amazing on this track. <br />Let Down- which is the most beautiful track on the record and is just gorgeous, simply gorgeous. <br />Climbing UP the Walls- because of Yorke's eerie vocals and Jonny gorgeous guitar <br />No Surprises- because it's just a pure classic. The kind of song you here the puts you in a certain place. I love the lyrics in the song. <br />The Tourist- because of the climax at the height of the song, Jonny's guitar is exquisite (I know he wrote this track) and the way Yorke sings 'Hey man, slow down' it's simply a great closing track. But Radiohead always have great closing songs to their records.
B00008DDSC|4.0|What a gloriously odd movie. When nervy Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), fresh out of the mental institution, gets a job at E. Edward Grey's (James Spader) law firm, it isn't long before standard job practice gives way to outright sadomasochism. Sounds like the stuff exploitation pics are made of? Well, it is, but director Steven Shainberg has crafted a flick that's as much razor-sharp black comedy as it is kinkfest - nay, more so. Gyllenhaal and Spader both give beautifully nuanced turns, sketching a relationship that - all things considered - is curiously heartwarming, not to mention weirdly believable. In other hands, this could've been a horrible mess, but \\"Secretary\\" somehow gets the balance right. Tasteless, maybe, but never distasteful. Romance lurks in weird places these days, it would seem.
B00000AFWW|4.0|Like I have said before the coolest thing about Courtney is in her music (whether solo or with Hole) each record represents exactly what stage she is in in her life. On Celebrity Skin the band achieves with this record exactly what they set out to do in terms of delivery. It's gorgeous and what I call \\"Pretty on the Outside\\" but the lyrics are still very dark and haunting. And those lyrics are all written by Queen Courtney who in my opinion does not get her due as the genius lyricist that she is. Her lyrics are so poetic yet so honest. <br /> <br />Celebrity Skin is the perfect opener to the record. An instant classic. And Melissa Auf Der Mauer's vocals compliment Courtney's perfectly for this record because it keeps up with the theme that they wanted to achieve. Malibu is the perfect example of that. <br /> <br />I'd have to say Boys on the Radio is one of the top 2 songs on the record. And I have no idea why Hole didn't make it one of their singles over Awful (which is also a good song but no Boys on the Radio). I hear that song and I go \\"It sounds like a hit\\" too bad it wasn't. <br /> <br />My favorite favorite song has to be hands down Reasons to be Beautiful. Best Hole/Courtney song ever. One of my favorite songs of all time. It's very well written with great bridges and guitar sounds. It's a very smartly arranged track. And Courtney's vocals are great (though I prefer her vocals more raspy and ragged like America's Sweetheart and Pretty on The Inside and Live Through This\\" the lyrics are phenomenal and it's obviously about her late husband. But she doesn't overdo the \\"widow\\" thing on this album which I respect. Having said all that. I hear this song today and think \\"Isn't this the best song ever\\" Props to Hole for writing this song. Just for Reasons to Beautiful this whole album gets 4 stars. It is THAT good.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is not bad at all. Its very good. But what have you expected? Its Radiohead! Nothing bad has ever come out of this band. The perfect mix of KID A/Amnesiac electronic and Ok Computer rock makes it very good, once you get to know it. Dont be disappointed if you havent got any favorites at first, they will come! Listening to 2+2=5, Sit down.Stand up, Sail to the Moon, There There, We Suck Young Blood and A Wolf at the Door, now, i cant believe i didnt see anything special in them at first. But now i love them. The downside is maybe that the rocking tracks arent that rocky. there isnt any really loud ones here, but when it is that good it doesnt matter all that much!  <br />01 2+2=5. (The Lukewarm). 10/10 a great track. when it comes to Radiohead you can always expect a great opener. <br />02 Sit down. Stand up.(Snakes and Ladders)  9/10 really a good one. its great when the part, where he sings \\"the raindrops, the raindrops\\", comes up in the end <br />03 Sail to the Moon. (Brush the Cobwebs out of the Sky) 9/10 Another great one. <br />04 Backdrifts. (Honeymoon is Over) 8/10 The first part of the CD is just amazing! <br />05 Go to Sleep. (Little Man Being Erased) 9/10 A track that hasnt got computer help. Nice guitars. Its really good <br />06 Where i End and You Begin. (The sky is Falling in) 8/10 Its pretty good, but not the best <br />07 We Suck Young Blood (Your Time is Up) 9/10 Really a good track. The clapping is just great. <br />08 The Gloaming. (Softly Open our Mouths in the Cold) 8/10 Its a very short text, but theres a lot of repeating. Thom Yorke repeats: \\"They should be ringing\\". 12 times! <br />09 There There. (The Boney King of Nowhere) 10/10 My favorite! Its just fantastic! <br />10 I will. (No Mans Land) 7/10 The shortest track on the album. One of the weakest. <br />11 A Punchup at the Wedding. (No no no no no no no no) 8/10 Not the best, but the standard on this album is very high. <br />12 Myxomatosis. (Judge, Jury and Executioner) 9/10 Avery long text and a really great track <br />13 Scatterbrain. (As Dead Leaves) 8/10 The end is the best part on this.    <br />14 A Wolf at the Door. (It Girl. Rag Doll) 10/10 A classic Radiohead track, but with lots of violence!! <br /> <br />Go buy it!            <br />                     <br />
0064407667|1.0|I'm an adult who really enjoyed the Harry Potter Series, and Dahl's numerous books as well.  I bought this book thinking it would be a book of the same quality as these.   It's not, and I can't believe people actually compare this trash to these great books.   This book is about blatant child abuse and have several not so veiled references to sexual abuse.  Kids these days are exposed to enough trash in pop culture don't give them more to read.   The only reason people like these books is because of the artificial hype surrounding them and the upcoming movie.     In my opinion don't bother.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This three disc compilation piles together some of the best recordings of Bruce Springsteen, arguably one of the finest solo rock singers in the genres history. Picking two or three songs from each album, the collection is far from comprehensive but still the best compilation of Springsteen available. <br /> <br />It features the obvious highlights such as Badlands, The Promised Land, Born In The USA, and Born To Run - one of the greatest rock songs ever. But lesser known highlights such as Blinded By The Light and The Ghost of Tom Joad produce a more rounded retrospect of Springsteen's career.  <br /> <br />Since the singers decision to support John Kerry in the recent election, I have noticed many of his `fans' have decided to slate him in these reviews. This surprises me. I am new to Springsteen's music but anyone who has listened to it or read his lyrics should have known all along where his political allegiance lay. Writing the theme tune to Philadelphia, a film that sympathised with aids sufferers, was a clear sign of this. Other songs, such as American Skin, about the gung ho shooting of an African immigrant by New York police is another example, as well as lyrics like `Poor men wanna be rich, rich men wanna be kings, and a king ain't satisfied till he rules eveything'.  <br /> <br />This is a comprehensive introduction to the career of `The Boss'. <br />

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a popular book that has been praised by many reviews, including the New York Times' Book Review, Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune.  Alice Sebold, also the author of the novel, Lucky, wins her stars and stripes with the beautifully composed piece of literature, The Lovely Bones.  Alice Sebold's style of writing is priceless as she gives complex meanings to the average word.  The Lovely Bones has hidden treasures on every page you turn. <br />The Lovely Bones is an enticing story that begins the day of Susie's death, December 6, 1973.  At age 14, Susie is obliged to watch the world from heaven's view.  She watched closely as her family struggles, the community joins together, and she especially watches her murderer fool numerous police officers on his innocence.   <br />Susie's murderer was someone who she'd never had expected.  It was her next door neighbor, Mr. Harvey.  The complexity of Mr. Harvey's actions and behavior puts chills down your spine.  Sebold has chosen the perfect murderer; he is quick, clean, and no one you would ever expect. <br />Mr. Harvey is among a countless list of colorful characters that Susie introduces.  Susie's rebellious sister, Susie's ex-boyfriend, a mother and a father on the verge of divorce, a widow detective, a girl from her school, and much more. <br />Each character has a story to tell, and as they all progress, you share Susie's perspective from heaven.  Sebold knows and loves her characters and writes them beautifully, each with complex personalities to uncover.   <br />As Susie Salmon looks down at the snow globe of what her life used to be, she watches even her closest family move on, and what she eventually finds, is that it's time for her to move on too.
B000089RVX|5.0|That person on here ranting about this cd not sounding like \\"real metal\\" etc etc seems to be upset that nobody buys his favorite bands' cd's.  The fact that he talks more about that than his review of this cd is humorous.  Anyway...Im a GNR fan at heart and am pretty picky about new \\"rock\\" music or this whole \\"nu metal\\" thing, but I admit when I first heard this cd I was pretty floored.  Amy Lee has a ridonculously nice voice and it clashes perfectly with the amped-up background music.  Some of the guitar riffs are pretty catchy, particularly on Tourniquet, my favorite song on the cd.  Its my favorite cause its the best song.  Simple, eh?  Haunted, Everybody's Fool, Tourniquet o' course, all of them great.  I wasn't that big a fan of Bring Me To Life, maybe cause I retch everytime I hear it since it reminds me of that horrible Ben Affleck movie.  Honestly, if you are reading this review and using it to decide if you wanna buy this cd...hm.  Just buy it cause, well, everyone else is doing it, so why aren't you?  You wanna be a cool kid, right?  Ha.  And I'm spent.
1559277254|4.0|I was suprised to read the reviews of other long-time readers of the Stephanie Plum series. For my intro to the series, I found it to be a fun ride. Grandma Mazur is hilarious just like her Granddaughter Stephanie. But I enjoyed the book more for its comic relief and humor than the mystery.  <br /> <br />The plot was fairly predictible and the finale anticlimatic but I really enjoyed the characters. Lorelei King did an excellent job on the dramatization, however her efforts on male voices were not the greatest.
B000067J1Q|5.0|Is there anybody who hasn't seen this great movie at least once?  It was adapted for the screen from the hit Broadway musical by Rodgers & Hammerstein.  Some call it sappy, but there's no denying it's a great feel-good movie, and it remains one of the highest grossing films of all time. <br /> <br />Julie Andrews shines in the lead role, matched by Christopher Plummer and a first-rate supporting cast. <br /> <br />The many great songs have become standards.  If you've never seen it, (and it's hard to believe anybody hasn't,) you owe it to yourself.  It's one of the great classic films of all time.   <br />
B00001OH7P|5.0|This album changed my life.  the songwriting is unbelievable, the emotion is tangible, the concept is excellent and well kept throughout the album.  seven or eight days ago my concept of bowie was Space Oddity and Changes, now he is without a doubt one of my favorite artists.  if you dont buy it, get it soemhow.
B000001FYL|4.0|This is a VERY good album. I've always been a Bon Jovi fan and this is one of my favorites by Jon. I like it even more than most of the albums by him with his band.<br /><br />The album starts out rocking with the great Billy Get Your Gun then moves into the fantastic Blaze Of Glory. My other favorites on here are Miracle and Santa Fe. I think Santa Fe is one of Jon's best vocal performances ever.<br /><br />If you're a Bon Jovi fan and don't have this, then get it. It sounds a little different than Jon's stuff with the band, but it's still very good.
B00066VUPM|4.0|It's been a mere 4-5 years that Travis overtook Oasis as the biggest band in the UK, with the magnificent album \\"The Man Who\\", but alas it was not to last long. Uneven albums afterwards and lil' thing called Coldplay took care of that.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's editorial reviewers heard, but the \\"Singles\\" album that I have does not have 29 tracks as listed on here, but instead 18 tracks (63 min.), all of Travis' singles, plus one new track (the unremarkable \\"Walking in the Sun\\"). There is a lot of great music on here, no question about it, including the 5 singles from \\"Good Feeling\\" and the 4 singles from \\"The Man Who\\". Most annoyingly the songs are not presented chorologically. Thus the beautiful \\"All I Wanna Do Is Rock\\" from their debut album is followed by \\"This Beautiful Occupation\\", a lame song from the lame \\"12 Memories\\" album. This collection does contain the essential \\"Coming Around\\", a mega-hit in Europe in the summer of 2001 and previously only avaiable as a single.<br /><br />As a big Travis fan from the early days, it pains me to see how Fran Healy and the boys have lost the pedals in recent years. While \\"Singles\\" is not a bad collection, if you really want to hear Travis at the top of their game, purchase \\"The Man Who\\", which in the US was released with several bonus tracks that are essential in the Travis catalogue, including \\"Blue Flashing Lights\\", \\"20\\" and \\"Only Molly Knows\\".
B000002NJS|5.0|This is my favorite Madonna CD. I love every single song on it. This CD is very spiritual and the messages are emotional. She talks about fame over love in Drowned World/ Substitute For Love  and now that she had Lourdes she wants more of love and not to be so selfish anymore. Swim is a slow song which begins with water splashing and her singing about the problems facing the world. She also mentions her mother in Mer Girl and how it affected her very touching! The slow ones, Frozen and Drowned World have beautiful music to it and amazing sounds I have never heard off. The fast ones Skin, Sky Fits Heaven, and Ray of Light have immense sounds especially in Sky Fits Heaven, it will stick out once you hear it.  Candy Perfume Girl has electronica mixed in with rock and I love the way it was musically blended together. Shanti is a fast song she sings in a different language. The Power Of Goodbye is a beautful slow ballad after the breathaking Frozen where she sings about \\" learn to say goodbye\\" \\"when your heart is not open\\". Little Star is a beautiful sweet song about her daughter Lourdes. I love when she sings \\"God gave a present to me made of flesh and bone\\". This song shows how much Madonna wanted a child and how Lourdes means the world to her. They have helped me spiritually and it is definately a beautiful album no doubt. Madonna's voice has never sounded any better than on this album. I am glad she sang a lot of these songs  at the DWT tour where I had the great opportunity to see it twice!! Thank you for singing Sky Fits Heaven probably my favorite song from this album and Frozen with the geisha dress awesome at the Drowned World Tour! I highly recommend this CD I would give it 6 stars if I could!!
0394800389|5.0|Mr. Fox is a sneaky little guy in this giggle a minute book by Dr.Seuss. Starting off to tease his friend we hear, \\"Knox on fox in socks in box.\\" and proceed from there to some real put a knot in your tongue twister of words.  Yes,lots of outlandish tongue twisters with great illustrations to add to the pleasure of the read. This book is definitely an exercise for young and old, as you twirl your tongue this way and that and chuckle at your own inability to keep up with Mr. Fox.  If you want to read a book that will make you giggle and jiggle and give your tongue a good wiggle, this is the one.<br /><br />Shirley JOhnson
B000066744|1.0|I first saw this on a cross country flight. I saw it recently on DVD. The DVD is well done- nice quality. Beautiful camera work. But the movie was long, boring and flat. I was reminded while watching that after the first viewing I spent the month it was in inflight rotation- reading instead of movie watching while jetting cross country. This movie is one of the reasons people take their laptops and their own movies on flights today. Pass!
0375422889|5.0|If you haven't read the first Persepolis, you will not fully understand Marjane's story.  And if you have read the first book and have not read this one, you really ought to get your hands on it.<br /><br />The book is in a comic book format, like the first, but this only conveys the author's story even more than if she had just written in a traditional novel format.  Her simple drawings are elegant and convey so much emotion.  We finally get to see what path Marjane's life goes down when fleeing Iran in the 1980's and her return back.  The story itself is amazing.  The art work only makes it more intriquing.
B00005BJ9W|1.0|I wish I had read all the reviews, particularly the 1 star reviews, before I bought the CD versions of Rio and Duran Duran's first album.     When I first listened to these CD's, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.  Why weren't these songs as good as I remembered them to be?  Why were the moans from `Hungry like the Wolf' all but nonexistent in the mix?  Had my hormone-filled adolescent mind of yesteryear imagined them?  Why did the songs seem shorter?  Why were all the cool guitar hooks drowned out by obnoxious, amateurish synth noises?  Where was the piano in `Lonely in your Nightmare'?    I really loved my 1982 vinyl versions (of Rio and their first album), and these CD mixes are a poor substitute for my experience of the \\"original\\" tracks.  From reading the other reviews, I now realize that technically I am listening to the original mixes - that is before they were polished, extended, and made commercially desirable in the States - but these are NOT the mixes that most US Duran Duran fans know and love.      [...]  They have a responsibility and obligation to objectively present the audio quality and properly identify the content that the public is buying.  By saying nothing, and then letting less than audiophile sock-puppets litter the reviews with their 4 & 5 stars to stack the deck, is inexcusable.    Any mainstream US fan who raves about these mixes with nostalgia either has a poor memory, or just heard these songs in passing on a static-filled radio, or was drunk at the time, mindlessly bouncing to the beat and nothing else.      I have no argument with the style, musicianship, songwriting, or the band.  I loved Duran Duran, and that's what I paid good money to hear in the digital domain.  I would have been better off making my own digital copy of my vinyl albums, which is what I now intend to do.    The only reason to buy music again is to hear it with the benefit of advanced technology.  To not warn people that the mix is different from the vinylcopy one probably has, is irresponsible.  To not mention that there was an original, inferior mix, and that this is it, is shameless.   But to actually deceptively tout it to be the \\"original mix\\", fully implying that this what we want to hear, is criminal.     [...]
B0001MDP3G|5.0|The movie is set in the south during the civil war.  It showes Ada and Innman meeting and how they awkwardly begin to fall in love.  However, the war begins before they really could.   <br />    When Ada's father dies she is left along with no real skills to speak of, she doesn't even cook.  Thankfully, Ruby comes along and helps her get back on her feet and Ada starts to become the woman she really is.   <br />    While Ada and Ruby are forming a deep friendship, Innman is walking home to her, and running into all sorts of trouble.  I won't tell you how this movie ends but I'll say this.  You can't help but hold your breath, laugh, and cry.  Sometimes all at once.   <br />    This movie is not so much about the war, (there are very few battle scenes), but more what the war did to people and how they struggled through it.  Together and alone.

0887306667|5.0|Normally when someone things about marketing strategy, they start envisioning how to market their products better than the competition.  A marketer begins to focus on the strengths and weakness of the products they represent in contrast to the strengths and weaknesses of the competitor's products.  After various marketing research techniques have been administered, the customer's wants and needs are analyzed.  Then a marketing strategy is developed, with the consumer's interest in mind, to effectively reach the target market.  In this book, Ries and Trout agree with this broad definition of the marketing approach, however, they further amplify the proper \\"laws\\" of effective marketing strategy.  I will be discussing three of the twenty two important laws for a successful marketing scheme.  According to Ries and Trout following these \\"laws\\" will enable a corporation to maintain their dominance within their industry while minimizing conflicts that may arise. <br />STRENGTHS <br />* \\"Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time\\" <br /> <br />* \\"If your shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader\\" <br />* \\"It is better to be first than it is to be better\\" <br />* \\"Success often leads to arrogance and arrogance leads to failure\\" <br />* \\"You have to give up something in order to get something\\" <br />WEAKNESSES <br /> <br /> I felt that Ries and Trout did a good job in presenting their laws for an effective marketing strategy.  At first I was taken back when I was reading the first chapter because they opened up with it's better to be first and that's all.  So I had the impression that there was no room for second.  All these companies came to mind that I believed were successful and they were not the first in the industry.  After I continued reading however I realized that my perception of what Ries and Trout were saying was incorrect.  The only point I have a hard time agreeing with from this book is the very first law, \\"It's better to be first than better\\".  I agree to a certain extent that the first person to do something will be remembered more frequently then any other individuals to follow.  However, our society has advanced tremendously since the last decade.  I believe it's just as important to make a product more efficient once it has been introduced.  Companies like 3M and DuPont constantly innovate and design products to become more efficient.  I believe that it is important to be first in an industry, but one should make sure the product they are bringing to the industry displays a certain level of quality also.   <br />RECOMMENDATION <br /> I felt that this book was very informative.  The examples of various companies that took a downfall because of incorrect marketing strategies made this book an easy read.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering a career in marketing.  This book makes an individual realize the important guidelines to follow while developing an effective marketing strategy.  Without proper marketing strategy implementation the future of a company's long term objectives may be at risk. <br />
B00005JMAH|3.0|First I must express how much I love the HP series it opens the mind, it bridges young and old and the love for this series is only equal to that of Starwars fans and LOTR fans. <br /> <br />The worst thing ever is this movie will not be remade yet it should, It is one of the best books in the series!  The problem is they cut out 50% of the book and added un-needed things like the knighbuss head that whole scene was over done and bloated! <br /> I know JK Gave freedom to the producer but why would he stray so far from the book why would he leave out so many important things. If I think of watching this movie I read the book again instead!. I Don't think the producer read the books I seriously don't, I think he skimmed them to get ideas then made this attrocity! I know it costs money but hey lets face it this series makes millions of Money.. (I say money because its not all Dollars It is world wide).. back on all the extra stuff.  <br /> <br />I only hope and wish they release a DVD with all the scenes they left out granted it would be about a 4-5 hour movie but look at LOTR-ROTK they did it why cant POA do it!   <br /> <br />If they do, I also hope they add it in like they did in other movies and just accept the viewers will understand the mixed cuts. Rather then making it a game at the end of the movie to find these scenes like in HP 1 & 2. They just need to add in all the extra footage strait into the film.    <br /> <br />I am not buying this movie In hopes they will release an extended version which adds the loss of love the loss of the 50% which made book 3 so good! There is to much for me to tell you on here on what was cut and what was added. All I can say is go read POA ! book 3 and you will understand why everyone feels this way. and you may want to watch the movie first if you havent read book 3 POA because you will have the same dis-taste in your mouth for this production of the movie as those of us who have read all the books and know them chapter by chapter.  <br /> <br />Most of the people who give this a good review are people who have not sat and read the books 1-5 in order and know them chapter by chapter. So they don't know what they are missing which is a shame because people listen to this and think its ok when if they would just open the book they would understand So much love and so much lost! 50% gone and never to be seen except in the mind !
B00068IOWC|4.0|Five factors: <br />1. The spiritual leader, voice and frontman is busy trying to save the world (which is a great job, but when he appears and disappears during the recordings, some things could go wrong) <br />2. A bunch of people involved in the production (I have count eight producers, not to mention the change in the \\"head\\" of production in the middle of the process). <br />3. A defective work with the rhythmic section (I remember that years ago Larry declared something like he felt better with Eno at the controls during the Unforgettable Fire sessions because Lillywhite didn't paid too much attention to drums); just hearing the SNL version of \\"Vertigo\\" you can notice how a song can change with a good sound work on drums. <br />4. Some signs that my favorite band is becoming old (Bono, please, leave the cigar!!!!) and comfortable up there in the throne of \\"best rock band in the world\\". Come on guys, there is space for new experimentations out there! Look at King Crimson, Rush, Peter Gabriel, etc. <br />5. Auto-censorship. The save-the-world job and commitments of Bono prevents him now of writing strong statements about some actual issues of our collapsing world, one of the main virtues of U2 songs. <br />As a \\"bulletproof\\" fan it is difficult to make a simple comment about this set of songs. First, I have to say that I have heard these songs more than 50 times, and in general they are very good (\\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" are the jewels), but for U2, as someone said, \\"good is not enough\\". The problem is that I was expecting a real rocking roller coaster and I received a carousel: a very commercial and easy-to-listen group of songs (when I hear \\"City...\\" I can imagine the opening ceremony of the Olympics). Most of the songs need more \\"depth\\", they sound too flat. I bought this CD with the ones of Killers and Placebo, and what a difference on bass and drums! <br />Second, one reason I can't rate HTDAAB below 4 stars is because of the harmony between lyrics and melody. It seems like Bono and Edge are like mind-twins, thinking in the same images and feelings but expressing them in different ways (words v notes). <br />Third, another reason is that we have to understand something: for me this is not like any other U2 album. It is a tribute album, not only for Bob Hewson but also for all U2's mentors: Beatles, Stones, Clash, Ramones, etc. I am surprised that nobody has noticed that the intro in \\"Vertigo\\" (uno, dos, tres, catorce) is a kind of translation of Ramones' classic intros (one-two-three-four!), not mentioning \\"I will follow\\". <br />The last reason is more personal. It is amazing how since I first heard a song of these four guys, almost every new release of U2 goes perfectly with my own mood at that point of my life. Joshua Tree (last year in school, knowing nothing about my future), Achtung Baby (the Wall, new ideas, structures, friends, love, disappointment, pain), Zooropa (intellectual discoveries, experimentation, Bukowsky), ATYCLB (new beginning, hope, longing). And with HTDAAB, it seems that they have expressed almost every issue that I have now in front of me: life, death, family, fatherhood. Thank you again U2! <br />So, taking account of the whole idea behind this album, you can really enjoy it. It can touch you very deep but you have to listen it a few times. This is a very fine farewell album done by four mature artists, dedicated to past friends, family, idols, and we have to assess it like that. Unfortunately, the production was not as good as the songs. <br />Just a final thought: I hope that when Bono says that his job as a global politician is something he wants to do for the rest of his life, he is not warning us that he is leaving the job as the lead singer and writer of the best band of the last 25 years. In a world that is tumbling down, we need things like U2 songs to believe in life every single day.

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|This album is totally amazing!!! <br />This happens to be the greatest album of marillion since Brave. Marillion are back with a very mellow and smooth progressive album. As the title of this review said, it's the return of Dave Meagan, the same producer of Brave. <br /> <br /> The original version of this album contains 2 cd of studio material (no bonus, no remixes)-(like The wall of pink floyd). The 1 cd version of this album misses 3 songs from original. \\"Genie\\", \\"The damage\\" and the excellent \\"Ocean Cloud\\". Both Genie and the damage are normal songs but Ocean Cloud is a totally fantastic journey through what marillion is able. This a 17 minutes song !  <br /> <br />\\" Drilling holes \\" sucks ! <br /> <br />If there could be a way to replace \\"Drilling holes \\" from the 1 cd version for \\" Ocean Cloud \\", that would make this album in the top 3 album of all time. <br /> <br />The songs are very articulated and the progression is very effective. Really ambiant. Wanna relax ? listen to this. <br /> <br />Best songs: <br /> <br />The invisible man <br />Ocean Cloud <br />Neverland <br />Angelina
B00065JTBA|1.0|I purchased this boxed set the day if came out, Nov. 15. It has taken me one, long PAINFUL month to get through it. I am a Bon Jovi FANatic and couldn't wait till this hit the stores. Much to my disappointment it is all unreleased songs and none of them seem to be catchy tunes to me. Hardly anything deserves a 2nd look, including the book. I LOVE Bon Jovi and while they are truly legends & icons in the industry, outfitting them in gold lame' from head to toe is NOT sexy. It was too over the top, Elvis for me. I would have much rather seen them dressed like they were in the \\"This Left Feels Right\\" Album. Jeans, boots, casual, kicked back. That's vintage Bon Jovi. As for the CD's, since there was 1 dice on CD #1, 2 dice on CD #2 (I thought we were going for a pattern here to number the CD's which I thought was a really cool marketing idea)disks 3-5 each had 2 dice on them. (Maybe the marketing department is who voted on the gold lame' idea too)  <br /> <br />As for the actual songs on the CD's, there is nothing noteworthy to me on CD#1, on CD#2, check out song #3 \\"Maybe Someday\\" (grab a kleenex!), on CD#3, check out #10 \\"If I Can't Have Your Love\\", vocal solo by Richie Sambora (VERY GOOD). On CD#4, check out song #7 \\"Out of Bounds\\" there's a bridge where they sing \\"I'm going down, down, down, down, down\\". It sounds exactly like the same bridge they sing on a song on their Bounce or Crush CD. <br /> <br />Overall I am pretty disappointed with the entire box set and wished I hadn't wasted $40 on it. To me, there's a reason why songs go unreleased and every one of these songs should have stayed that way - unreleased, unheard and unknown. Sorry boys, but I think I'll just keep playing all your other CD's I have over and over again.

B000002JNJ|5.0|Why did they allow this twerp Matrix Mark post these crap about the guitarist Dimebag Darrell?   I know, Mark it is a free country and you can say what you want, but not everyone likes Clay Aiken and Barry Manilow like you do.   I have not been a Pantera fan before because I never got into thrash at all, but I may buy some stuff of theirs just to check out Dime's licks.   Another thing MM, you say that Pantera had no fans before Thursday, but just maybe these are fans paying tribute to their hero?   From what I have seen, this Matrix Mark is a pretty lousy excuse of a human being for doing this.
0441172717|5.0|I admire Frank Herbert for writing what is quite possibly the best science fiction novel ever. The way he created this whole world and these complex characters shows how truly genius he is. I really felt for the characters as I read through the story. I could feel the nervousness in Paul when he realized that he was to become most important of leaders. I look forward to reading further in the Dune series.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The Radiohead magic is an indefinable thing. One might be enticed by their gloomy, multi-layered 4-minute masterpieces, or equally repeled by their sullen, anarchic, cynical odes to mainstream consumerism and American capitalism. Either way, everyone can agree that somehow these unconvential opuses manage to be bizarre but at the same time manage to be listenable and even pleasant. How they manage to do this is a mystery to me, but whatever technique they use to make their music like this nonetheless helps them create masterful works of musical art that have the power to stay in your brain and your heart for days after listening. And you probably won't go days without listening to it, the magnetic force of their music manages to pull you back for another listen every moment you are able. When OK Computer came out it garnered instant praise and now maintains a humble spot among some of the greatest albums ever made. If I had to pin down one particular reason, it's hard, but if I had to, the reason OK Computer is so timeless (and that's a strong word to use on a seven-year-old album) is the intensely abundant layering of complex instrumentation, literate lyrics packed with underlying themes, and a tightly-wound musical intensity cleverly packed into every corner. These qualities combine to form a complex listening experience. One that should confuse almost anyone on their first listen, but upon subsequent listens anyone should be excited to notice little intricacies in the music. And these realizations are what makes OK Computer such a masterpiece. All of Radiohead's albums are amazing and it's near-impossible to choose my favorite record of theirs. But if you were holding a gun to my head, forcing me to choose, I would have to say OK Computer. The sole reason for this is that I find something new every time I give the disc a spin, whether it be noticing a delightful little subtle burst of keyboard or the majorly profound implication behind a lyric. OK Computer and Radiohead is definitely not for everyone, its complexity might turn some impatient listeners away or weird some unsuspecting music enthusiast out. But to this particular listener, the ever-unwrapping OK Computer manages to stay fresh, and always makes for a compelling, intriguing and exciting experience similar to the first time listening to your favorite CD.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|Although using the classic horror monsters from the old movies, its not Peter Cushing/Christoper Lee type horror movie, but this is still a really good fun movie. <br /> <br />The specail effects I have to say were very rich and a great job was done on this. This is a movie to just kick back and enjoy. Classic monsters but with a new twist. <br /> <br />The settings for the movie were also extreamly neat, not wanting to give anything away to anyone who has not seen Van Helsing, but one of My favorite parts in the movie was when Van Helsing and His companion Fryer travel to a remote snow laden village deep in the mountains of Transylvania and battle 3 female vampires who change between human to demon fighting them with a cross bow that fires like a machine gun. <br /> <br />While over the top with James Bond type wepons back supposedly a few centuries ago, the effects were superb and again, just an awsome good fun movie to watch. <br /> <br />I was skeptical when I purchased Van Helsing but Im very happy I did and find its a movie worth watching over and over again :)
B0006399FS|2.0|I'm 37. Been a fan since 82. Since 84 I've purchased every U2 album the first day they were released. They have shaped my thinking and brought so much fun to my life. I love all thier albums with Unforgettable Fire being my favorite. I loved ATYCLB....This album....Uhmmmm. Not so good. Very Very Predictable. A little boring. A little simplistic lyrically. Occasional great moments but really the entire package falls a little flat. I will say that its better than most pop music out there...But I don't hold them to that standard...I hold them to a level of excellence that they have shown year in and year out...And this album is mediocre at best. I feel like bonos voice is layered on top of the songs too much almost like its a bono solo album or him singing Karaoke. Its funny ya know some of the sounds are remniscent of Boy and October but the spirit and energy is lacking. Its like all the parts of a great u2 album are there but it just doesnt add up. I loved Vertigo, Miracle, and Man & Woman....Felt bored with some of the others. I feel as though the same thing has happened to them as what happened to Sting in recent years. Formulaic bordering on self parody. A shame really but I expect a lot as most u2 fans should. I regret having to give this a 5. This would make it thier worst release. Its not awful...But its awful mediocre. To sort of explain the title of \\"Worst u2 album\\" I have rated all their albums on a 1-10 scale below. Unforgettable Fire 10 Joshua Tree 10 War 10 Achtung Baby 10 October 9 Boy 8 All That You Can't Leave Behind 7.5 Rattle & Hum 7 Zooropa 6 Pop 6 How to Dismantle..5 5/10:
B0006GAOBI|5.0|If you are looking for a movie that is both perplexing and fascinating, you will not go wrong with this.  The first time I ran across it was on a pay Movie channel, I got in 20 minutes late, and I immediately realized how great of a movie I had fallen into.  If you are a person that enjoys twist, depth, and emotion in a plot, this movie is definightly a movie to be enjoyed.  It is seldom one is given a chance to appreciate something so original.
0884271153|5.0|This book will give you an excellent understanding of when to use the thinking processes.  If you want to be able to apply the thinking processes without attending a seminar, you need three things: 1) It's Not Luck  2)Thinking for a Change by Lisa Scheinkopf (or one of the other thinking process books, but this one is the best) 3) Practice.  This requires a significant amount of time.   <br />If you do not plan on attending a seminar or taking the time to read and practice the more detailed how-to material on the thinking processes, this book will be a waste of time.  The story isn't as universally appealing as The Goal; it is about understanding when to apply the thinking processes and major pitfalls to avoid. If you decide this book isn't for you, I would still recommend finding a write up of the disolving cloud (aka conflict cloud) method.  This is the one tool from It's Not Luck that really is for everbody.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Probably the best from Green Day since \\"Dookie\\" about a decade ago. Best well-done concept CD release since Queensrype \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" back in 1987.
B000002A46|5.0|We have a huge collection of holiday CD's including everything from Rockapella to Transiberian Orchestra and Manheim Steamroller.   <br />Mariah's Merry Christmas is everyone's favorite for Christmas Eve.  It has become our family tradition and we love it.  Bless Ms. Carey for making this beautiful album.  She treats each song individually, expressing each song differently with her voice; sometimes singing her lungs out, other times singing more softly.
B0002858YS|4.0|Worth a try. Many of the songs remind me of the music I used to listen to in middle and high school in the 80's. The first four tracks are highly recommended. If you like them, I'd also seek out these groups: The Atari's and All American Rejects. Not bad- also I hope they win at least a Grammy for Best New Artist.
0385508417|5.0|This novel was one of the most entertaining and amusing books I have every read.  The colorful characters that he fills the story with keep the reader guessing what will happen next.  This book is not only enjoyable and amusing, but Grisham also captures American society during the holiday season exactly.  He portrays the materialistic nature that consumes all Americans around Christmas by showing it through his characters.  Luther decides to put the $6100 that he would otherwise put towards gifts, decorations, and a party towards a Caribbean cruise with his wife.  Both Nora and Luther face harassment and criticism from their friends and neighbors who think it is disgraceful that they are skipping Christmas.  Grisham displays the common perception of the Christmas season, filled with presents and spending money, through the actions of the Krank's friends and neighbors.  This novel teaches a very important lesson to all people consumed by the materialism of the season by reminding us what Christmas is really about -- love and compassion for family and friends.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|if you really think duran duran is better than Pink Floyd, go screw your gramma and then hang yourself. hermm, sorry had to get that out. anyways....this dvd is kickass footage. The songs are performed flawlessy, and matter of fact are even better than the ones on the original albums (the jam part in \\"echoes\\" for example). You are able to see the band close up, especially waters and gilmour (i figured out how to play the guitar solo is Echoes just by watching the movie). The best about this is that there is nothing from The Wall here. It's mostly from Meddle and some of their ealier stuff, before Waters got control of the band. Overall a must have for any music fan <br /> <br />And a note to all of you who like the original better: the directors cut comes with the original footage in the special feature section. look around for it!!
B0000CAXID|5.0|The Foo Fighters have moved to bigger and better acclaim for their later albums (e.g. _The Colour & The Shape_, et al.), but to me, the albums that followed this one, their debut, while good, were not as compelling, due to the more polished sound that would creep up on those albums. The rawness of this album is what helps give it more of an intimacy, not to mention the fact that, with the exception of one song, the whole album is performed by Dave Grohl: guitars, bass, drums, and vocals -- all Dave. The intimate feel of this album (yeah, an \\"intimate\\" album that \\"rocks,\\" go figure, but it works) is what makes it my absolute favorite in the Foo Fighters catalogue.<br /><br />As many know, Dave was the drummer of Nirvana, and many would think that Dave trying to form his own band after the split-up of those Seattle juggernauts, would prove to be an embarrassing failure. This was *hardly* the case, as The Foo Fighters are an *excellent* band, and I *personally* don't think about Nirvana's ghost while listening to The Foo Fighers; this alone should tell you something (or at least it would tell you that I disagree with the editorial review on this page.) In other words, The Foo Fighters (to me) stand on their own, and don't remind me much of Nirvana.<br /><br />Recorded in one week during October of 1994 (just months after Kurt Cobain's death, and Nirvana's demise), but released in July of 1995, this debut album is jam-packed with chewy, sweet-tasting pop confections -- of course shielded with lush, heavy guitars which produce a thick wall-of-sound -- and is hard not to fall in love with. Like another reviewer stated, it's one thing to know Dave has talent as a vocalist, drummer and tunesmith, but to know he almost *literally* single-handedly did the album by himself -- writing the songs, playing *all* of the instruments -- just makes one a bit envious of his talent. Along with pounding, melodic rockers like \\"This Is A Call,\\" \\"I'll Stick Around,\\" \\"Good Grief,\\" not to mention the pleasantly goofy, get-in-the-mosh-pit intensity of \\"Weenie Beenie,\\" you get tasty Beatle-esque melodicism and craftsmanship in \\"Big Me,\\" and speaking of The Beatles, you get a beautifully-atmospheric rocker in the form of \\"Oh, George,\\" which is a tribute to no other than George Harrison (supposedly his favorite Beatle), and superbly-made tracks like \\"For All The Cows,\\" which amalgamates elegant bluesy 7th chords, fronted by Dave's smooth-as-silk vocals for the soft parts on the verses, before bursting into explosive, heavy choruses. To close out the album, you get the oceanic, atmospheric heaviness of \\"Exhausted.\\"<br /><br />This is an *excellent* album; one of the very best \\"alternative\\" albums of the 90s; an album where *every* track on the album is as good as gold. I'd put it in my \\"top 10\\" of favorites from the 90s \\"alternative\\" scene. It's *that* good, and it holds up quite well after nearly a decade since it's release. Highly recommended.tly goofy, get-in-the-mosh-pit intensity of \\"Weenie Beenie,\\" you get tasty Beatle-esque melodicism and craftsmanship in \\"Big Me,\\" and speaking of The Beatles, you get a beautifully-atmospheric rocker in the form of \\"Oh, George,\\" which is a tribute to no other than George Harrison (supposedly his favorite Beatle), and superbly-made tracks like \\"For All The Cows,\\" which amalgamates elegant bluesy 7th chords, fronted by Dave's smooth-as-silk vocals for the soft parts on the verses, before bursting into explosive, heavy choruses.

B000021Y7X|4.0|I was never fortunate enough to see Talking Heads in concert.  I was never fortunate enough to see Stop Making Sense at a movie theater.  I WAS fortunate enough to buy the LP when I was a teenager.  I finally saw a VHS version of the movie in the late 80's on a small TV screen with a mono speaker - blah.  One of the first LP's I replaced with a CD was Stop Making Sense.  I thought I had taken it as far as I could.  Then I bought the DVD, then I bought a home theater system: <br /> <br />Step 1: I watched this masterpiece in widescreen and stereo sound for the first time.  (Yes, the audio/video sync is off in places, esp. the beginning) <br /> <br />Step 2: I watched the movie again listening to the commentary track by Demme and band members.  Great stuff here. <br /> <br />Step 3: I laid in the middle of the living room,closed my eyes, cranked up the 5.1 Studio Mix and heard this music like I had never heard it before!  WOW! Same music, but what a difference between my old LP version and this DTS sound.  My CD may never get used again. <br /> <br />The DVD isn't perfect, but the movie nearly is.  Demme and Byrne had great vision.  The music is so good, you can easily forgive the overdubs.  I'll join the club: This is the best concert movie ever made.  Daddy like.
1400032717|4.0|I recommand this book to any one who loves math, detective stories and last but not the least, people who would like to gain insight of an autistic person's mind and their perspective of the world.
B00068IOWM|3.0|The album is excellent, I give the album itself 5 stars as it really is a wonderful work for the band reflecting their ability to stay ahead of trends. <br /> <br />The reason why I give this collectors edition only 3 stars is that I feel the packaging is dissapointing.  The CD is housed in a little cardboard pocket, that will make it very easy to get scratched or damaged over time.  The book, while a nice little collectors piece, really seems to be a one time read, devoid of interesting reading or stories.  The Addition of Fast Cars, again seems to be an ode to collectors in the US, as I don't believe the song adds value to the CD as it feels out of place. <br /> <br />Finally, my biggest pet peeve comes with the fact that the two cheaper versions include full lyrics in the insert, while this edition, despite a hardcover book includes no lyrics. <br /> <br />The CD is excellent, the DVD is interesting and worthwile, the Collector's Edition packaging and content leaves much to be desired.  I would have preferred saving money and getting the Deluxe Edition CD/DVD combo.  I recommend that others do the same. <br />
B00062J00S|5.0|Here it is December 16. Last night a small theater in my town <br />showed \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" basically for free (2 canned goods for the food bank were the price of admission). The place was packed. There was applause and not a dry eye when it ended. This is one powerful film. It was a pleasure to see it on the big screen. Don't forget the importance of Mary Bailey, George's wife. She gave her heart to him as a little girl, and never seriously thought about any other man. Remember, she was an unmarried librarian in his flashback. She's the one who offers their honeymoon cash to save the bank. She's the one who organizes the fund-raising campaign while George is off with Clarence. She's the one who wished for their dream house and life together when she threw the rock at that old house. She renovated the old house (with help from Bert and Ernie) while George was on another crusade against Mr. Potter. She didn't get the face time, but Mary Bailey was an immensely important character in the film.  <br />The secondary characters played very important roles too. Everyone wants to have an Uncle Billy. And know guys like Bert & Ernie. The gate keeper on the bridge, Martini, Mr. Gower, Violet, the Bailey family's maid, Nick the bartender, and of course, Clarence. And everyone knows a Mr. Potter, either as a person or as a corporation. <br />Everyone should own a copy of this wonderful film.
B000002G87|5.0|The drug-induced haze that surrounded the recording of this album transcends time....Duane Allman and Clapton render the \\"sickest\\" version of \\"little wing\\" that I have ever heard.  Clapton's pain can be felt as he rips through stunning solos of pure desperation....This album is a must have for any true Clapton fan.
B000002JOH|5.0|This isn't so much of a review as a response to the ignorant comment made by the \\"fan\\" saying Pantera is trendy because of Dimebag's death. I admit his death has sparked renewed interest in the band, but would you expect it to do otherwise? Pantera is classic thrash and Dimebag innovated metal guitar forever. Trends shouldn't even matter. I even like stuff on the top of the pop charts right now, but in my CD changer I'm listening to Cryptopsy, Notorious Big, Pantera,and Death. It's sad someone would lessen Dimebag and Pantera's contribution to music as a whole by calling the recent increase in popularity a trend. And if you think Pantera is trendy, think again buddy. Be weary of anyone who stears clear of music because of so called trends. Music is music, it doesn't matter if it's popular of not, it matters if you like it or not.  <br />

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann's slick, ultra violent thriller \\"Collateral\\" serves as a worthy coming out party for the non comedic talents of Jamie Foxx.  Foxx playing ambitious L.A. cabbie Max Durocher becomes an unwitting accomplice, at gunpoint, to smooth and unruffled hitman Vincent played by a grey coiffed Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Cruise has been employed by a drug kingpin known as Felix who is about to be indicted by federal prosecutors.  Cruise's task is to assassinate five witnesses that have been hidden by both the FBI and L.A.P.D.  He is using Foxx and his cab to chauffeur him his various assignments.  When his first victim falls through a 4th floor window onto the roof of Foxx's cab the reality of the frightful adventure commences.<br /><br />Prior to Foxx's initial brush with Cruise he had picked up federal attorney the beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith.  Their innocent but somewhat hard to believe conversation and encounter,<br /><br />will have major relevance to the later developement of the plot.<br /><br />Mann's direction keeps the flick moving at a crisp pace. The camera work is effective in accomplishing this especially in the frenetic gun battle in the night club.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is superb and heightens the character developement to make them both believable and sympathetic.  The musical score is quite good as well.
B0000026T4|5.0|This was a time when music really rocked. The guitairists had to know more than three chords and the singers could hold their notes. There was obvious talent as well as true melody in every song. \\"Poison\\" stands out as one of the best songs ever done by Alice Cooper. Everyone I've talked to has agreed with me on this. This album is definitely Alice Cooper's best work ever. <br />It fits right in with Slaughter and Kix and the mainstream of awesome music from the year 1989! I highly reccomend and endorse this one!!
B00026WU9Q|5.0|If you only ever buy one Bob Dylan album, this should be the one.  \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" is not a better record than \\"Blood On The Tracks\\", but it is the one where everything comes together for Bob Dylan, creating an incredible blend of folk, blues, and blistering rock n' roll, and it is the one which best represents the depth and versatility of his talent.    Several of the very best songs in Dylan's catalogue are from \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\", including the acoustic numbers \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\", \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", and the gritty hard rock of \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and \\"Maggie's Farm\\".   \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" is one of a handful of truly remarkable rock records. Get it!
B000065U1N|5.0|Can't compare this to any other war movie except maybe \\"Platoon\\" or \\"Hamburger Hill\\".  I see some \\"critics\\" compare this to \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  Pearl Harbor is nothing but a love drama.  How many people who think this movie sucked actuallt seen combat.
B0000024SI|5.0|\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" is an amazingly original record which finds Bob Dylan moving effortlesly between folk rock, blues and flat-out garage rock. <br /> <br />The songs are among the best and most energetic in Dylan's catalogue, and the band, which features Michael Bloomfield, Al Kooper and blues drummer Sam Lay, careen through \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", the acerbic \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man\\", the stylish blues \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\\", and the blistering \\"Highway 61\\". <br /> <br />I still consider \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" and \\"Bring It On Home\\" to be Dylan's best records, but this one is only a fraction behind. \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" is one of a handful of truly essential mid-60s rock records, and it is one of Bob Dylan's very best and most cohesive albums. Truly one of the ones that his reputation rests on.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damiens album is one of the best Ive heard in the last few years and Damien is absolutely brilliant live. (in Ireland anyway although difficult to get tickets). I hope he come s out with a new album soon as its been a while and a lot of people are waiting to see if O is a one hit wonder.  <br />Ive heard it on countless movies, TV programmes etc and i dont think it can ever be overplayed. I love all 10 songs on the album.
0312995423|2.0|Dan Brown's first effort -- Digital Fortress - was modestly entertaining. Had I not read A&D and DC, it may have surprised me. Sadly, it did not. <br /> <br />&#60;spoiler alert -- stop reading if you haven't read the book&#62; <br /> <br />Brown has certainly attached himself to a formula full of predictable plot twists and red herrings. This book was trully obvious from jump street. <br /> <br />The whole thing was far-fetched. The part where the virus was taking security down was hilarious. Either security is up or down:  there is no visual graphic for it. Why would Hulohut kill Tankada from a distance? Why not do it up close and take what he needed? Furthermore, why would he need to kill people who had NO CLUE as to what they saw? Just a risk that made no sense. <br /> <br />I am going to read Deception Point just to finish the body of work. I am hoping for better. With any luck, his 5th book will go down a different path.

I got this as a birthday gift and too bad that \\"Strangelove\\" is not in this cd.  Well, I guess I'll have to buy a cd with that song.  \\"World in My Eyes\\" is intriguing, enigmatic, and explosive.  Love the \\"Policy of Truth\\"...love his deep voice...how can you deny Depeche Mode? Lovelovelove!  Thank you Depeche Mode for creating awesome music.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|The all-new 2004 60th Anniversary Special Edition DVD set of MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS was very highly anticipated prior to its release this past spring, and its not hard to see why.  This is the DVD medium used to the fullest.  The new ultra high resolution transfer is simply glorious in every sense of the word.  The picture is so crisp and clear with beautiful bold colors, you'd swear the picture was made yesterday.  Even with the modern filming technology we have today, you still can't beat the old 3-strip Technicolor process in the quality and depth of the color.  The monaural soundtrack has been very beautifully cleaned up for this release -- no distortion whatsoever (a problem that the most recent VHS release--at least my copy of it--was plagued with).  There are many extras in this set, something for everyone.  Let's hope the EASTER PARADE DVD set, due out sometime in 2005, is just as glorious.    It is a SIN to not have this in your collection.  RUN to buy a copy now.
B000002J09|5.0|This is one great album from Led Zeppelin. Features awesome guitar solos from the guitar master Jimmy Page, and cool drumming from John Bonham. I never get tired of hearing them play together along with vocalist Robert Plant which I think sings great, and awesome bassist John Paul Jones. ALL of them combined into 8 songs you'll never forget. I gotta say for you people that say Stairway To Heaven is overplayed on the radio, I maybe only heard that song on the radio at the most 3 times. I have heard \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Black Dog\\" many many times played on the radio and they all deserve to be listened to by everyone as well as the other great songs.    SONG RATINGS:  1. Black Dog -(4:54)-10/10   2. Rock and Roll -(3:40)-10/10   3. The Battle of Evermore -(5:51)-10/10   4. Stairway to Heaven -(8:10)-10/10   5. Misty Mountain Hop -(4:33)-10/10   6. Four Sticks -(4:44)-8/10   7. Going to California -(3:31)-10/10   8. When the Levee Breaks -(7:07)-10/10
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I have been waiting for the anamorphic version of this movie since the original was released on DVD, which left much to be desired.  The picture quality in this new edition is outstanding, rating up there with some of the newer movie releases. DTS sound is also impressive. I especially enjoyed some of the new special feature interviews, including details and production info which was new to me. I highly recommend this new version!
0066620996|5.0|From the opening line of the book;\\"Good is the enemy of great\\" to the last page, Collins challenges some of the myths perpetuated by the business press.  He attacks the myth of the charismatic leader and particularly is brutal on those who lacked clarity in the name of diversification.<br /><br />As a minister, I have found the book to be helpful as I attempt to lead my church to being more mission focused. By emphasizing effectiveness over charisma, Collins helps me be more comfortable within my own skin and identify those leadership skills that are most important, such as nurturing leaders and refusing to accept anything less than great.  Moreover, the emphasis on putting a great team together to create a vision with their passion and skill seems to open the door to a much more collaborative process.  I keep returning to the importance of the image of getting the right persons on the bus and the wrong persons off.<br /><br />I highly recomend this book
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Although not as well advertised as the Star Wars trilogy or The Return of the King Extended Edition The Ultimate Matrix Collection has acquired rave reviews by many critics although ignored greatly by the general public due to the overshadowing by other large DVD releases like Spiderman 2 released around the same time.<br /><br /> In 1999 The Matrix was released, sending a shock through the movie industry, incredible special effects and an original storyline that blew your mind away got everyone talking about The Matrix not to mention one of the greatest soundtracks in cinema. Later The Matrix became the first DVD to sell 1 million copies.<br /><br />  The Wachowski brothers, who directed the film intended for the story to continue as a trilogy. Production began, and 4 years, hundreds of millions of dollars, and thousands of websites and magazine articles later The Matrix Reloaded was released in May of 2003. Huge box office revenue ensued and a cliffhanger ending allowed for even greater anticipation for the final installment. In November of that same year, The Matrix Revolutions was released putting the story to an end. In between, Enter the Matrix video game was released as well as The Animatrix and now the MMORPG pc game The Matrix Online to keep a huge fan base satisfied.<br /><br />  The Matrix is the story of a virtual world, one created by a futuristic world controlled by machines, humanity is on the brink of extinction, forced to live near the center of the Earth where it is still warm. In the first Matrix we are introduced to the concept of the Matrix, where the laws of physics can be bent and controlled to your advantage. Neo, is freed from the machines that use humans as their power source and feed them a virtual computer generated reality world known as the Matrix. Morpheus, a well respected rebel believes Neo is a reincarnated messiah that will save the human race. Unfortunately Agent Smith and his goons in suits are the protectors of the machine's interests in the Matrix. Morpheus, is taken hostage after one of his crew members betrays them and kills many of the crew. In brief, Neo saves Morpheus and with a little help from Trinity, his love interest, realizes that he is the one, and suddenly has extreme powers in the matrix and seemingly defeats Agent Smith.<br /><br />  The Matrix Reloaded is somewhat bland in plot and does not carry the Matrix story much farther, however the action is simply stunning to say the least, a 12 minute long freeway chase, a \\"burly brawl\\" in which Neo fights a couple dozen Agent Smiths and other fight sequences keep one highly entertained for the duration of the film, new characters are met, like the protector of the Oracle, the architect, the Keymaker, and the merovingian who's wife, Persephone attempts to seduce Neo, however Neo and Trinity's love is strong and will come into play later in the third chapter. The main thing learned in Reloaded is the concept of programming in the Matrix as well as complicated and intellectually provoking ideas such as fate and choice.<br /><br />  The Matrix Revolution is a visual spectacle, although some have complained about it being too cgi and computer generated, Revolutions provides nearly all action, while providing a decent plot to finalize the Matrix story. The Machines are digging to Zion, the last human city, and the humans are mounting a defense consisting of these manned, robot like machinery armed with machine guns. Neo must meet his fate and go to the machine city, to make a peace pact with the machines, but only if Neo defeats Agent Smith, who like a virus has spread and corrupted the entire Matrix. New characters like the Trainman and  are met. And the story of the Matrix is brought to an impressive close.<br /><br />  The final, climactic battles are impressive, and although many have complained about a poor ending, in which Neo is seen as a Christ figure to both the humans and machines, the story all in all is satisfying. Criticsand fans alike have praised the Matrix trilogy for its many original and inventive tactics and features. However, as with many high profile movies, the Matrix trilogy has been berated by those who feel the first was of course the best, and anything after that was too fake and corrupted by high budget. And then there are those that attempt to determine every possible religious, philosophical, or any other extraneous ideas out of a movie that is never talked about by the creators who felt giving away what their purpose is is to defeat the point entirely.<br /><br />  The collection in its self is well presented a box enclosing 10 discs and a pamphlet that is nostalgic of the Godfather box set. In detail, there are 2 discs per movie; each movie includes two commentary tracks, one by two professional philosophers and the other by two critics. For each movie there is a second disc known as Revisited, which existed previously for The Matrix, but is new for the other two films; these discs explore the making of each film through various featurettes. Were the collection to stop here it would already be very satisfying, even for the actual price of the entire set.<br /><br />  The next disc is The Animatrix, a celebration of manga and animation that further explore the Matrix world through 9 short films, the longest and most famous of which, Final flight of the Osiris A few also have featurettes and commentary tracks on the individual short film.<br /><br />  So far we have taken care of seven discs, but what of the other three? Surly the set does not include three entire discs of special features, well yes it does. The first disc is called The Roots of the Matrix, exploring in two documentaries the cinematic, historical, philosophical and technological inspirations in the Wachowski masterpiece. The Burly Man Chronicles is the eighth disc; twenty-one featurettes explore the people and skills involved in making the trilogy and video games. Finally included is the tenth disc, The Zion Archive, a collection of storyboards, drawings, concept artwork, music videos, and trailers.<br /><br />  No doubt the entire thirty-five hours of entertainment provided by this collection will not be seen in one sitting, and many including myself usually never get to watch the special features or listen to commentaries and simply watch the movies as with most DVDs I own, however this may change with The Ultimate Matrix Collection, as the plethora of interesting extras will tempt me to spend entire days of my vacation exploring the Matrix, and with a price tag that rivals many other sets with half of what this has, it's a sure bet it'll be a favorite come Christmas time.ans alike have praised the Matrix trilogy for its many original and inventive tactics and features.

0385513755|4.0|Dan Brown does it again.  This book was amazingly well researched.  Anyone who is going to incriminate.  I say YOU write a better book.  As to Mr. David C. Read.  Read into what you're saying before you spread your misguided opinion to everyone else. According to the \\"prieure documents,\\" a conclave of Calabrian monks who left from the Belgian Abbey of Orval in 1090 helped secure the election of Godfroi de Bouillion as de facto king of Jerusalem during the First Crusade (but as is well known, he refused the title, accepting only Defender of the Holy Sepulchre), based on their belief that he was a descendant of the Merovingians, and by that fact, according to these documents, also a descendant of King David through Jesus and Merovech. In return, Godfroi secured their installation into an Abbey on Mount Sion. These documents also claim that the Ordre of Sion and the Order of the Temple (officially, the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, later known as the Knights Templar, and officially recognized as such in 1118) were, until 1188, one unified organization with the same leadership.
1577311523|1.0|It is amazing that this book has so many supporters.  Get beyond the simple advice of 'live in the now', which is good but somewhat trite and overdone, and there is absolutely nothing there.  Tolle appears to be a charismatic charlatan  making mega-bucks from his supposed enlightenment achieved after a questionable and possibly phsycotic event.  Tolle demonstrates limited understanding of traditional spiritual disciplines by constantly referring to them out of contect.  The Buddha would not be pleased.  It was particularly amusing to read the books 4 footnotes.  Each footnote was unneccessary and appeared to be hurriedly cobbled together for the sole purpose of making the book look researched. But 4 footnotes?  A high school freshman  would have done a better job, or at the very least, understood that the interview format did not require footnotes.  It is great if you can take away something from this book but if you really want to learn to live in the now you might prefer to do some serious work by reading a book on cognitive therapy.  If you just want the flavor of the month - Tolle is for you.   Tickle your ears. You better realize though, he may be laughing all the way to the bank.
B0000035E7|4.0|If you're going to get a Nirvana album, definitely start with Bleach. It has an aggressiveness and a in-your-face honesty that Nevermind and In Utero lacked. On Bleach, Kurt and company didn't care about money like they did with the Nevermind and In Utero tours. All they cared about was playing live and taking a giant road trip across the country. And if they were lucky enough to sleep on a few fans' floors and get paid in a case of beer, then they felt all the more rewarded. It's really disappointing to see other people trying to make more out of Bleach than it really is though. This album isn't an artistic statement or a \\"tuneful approximation of what grunge should sound like\\". All Bleach does sets out to do is rock like a mutha... and it does it well. <br /> <br />Highlights: \\"Negative Creep\\", \\"Sifting\\", and \\"Paper Cuts\\" <br /> <br />May the heaviness be with you.

B0002I831S|4.0|I think the consensus here is pretty clear with regards to \\"Star Trek the Original Series: The Complete First Season.\\"  After waiting for the original series to catch up with all of its descendants and have complete seasons available in a DVD package, it is really disappointing to see such limited extras given the wait (and the price, even with 29 episodes), especially in terms of commentary tracks; there really are not any, just pop-up texts provided by Michael and Denise Okuda on four episodes: the two-parts of \\"The Menagerie,\\" which incorporates the original pilot into the first season continuity, the second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" and, for no really good reason, \\"The Conscience of the King.\\"  The pop-ups are filled with trivia and history (not to mention good jokes), but I really would like to hear somebody talk about some of these classic episodes.  I realize the cast might not be willing to do so, given that after 40 years their memories would be strained and their insights limited, and I do not expect the writers to show up, although the thought of Harlan Ellison trying to talk calmly about \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" would be something to hear, but at this point there is no reason \\"Star Trek\\" cannot go the Criterion Collection route and have honest to Roddenberry \\"Star Trek\\" scholars talk about some of the key episodes in great detail.<br /><br />What extras are here and pretty good, but having only 80 minutes worth seems really lame given what else we have seen out there on lesser television shows and movies.  The interview segments are okay (Shatner, Nimoy and the other cast members are clearly running out of things to say, although some of these observations have become finely honed over the years), and the more personal pieces where Shatner shows off his horses and Nimoy sets the record straight on his character are better.  \\"The Birth of a Timeless Legacy\\" looks at those two pilot episodes and gives us a clear indication of what could have been done on commentary tracks.  \\"To Boldly Go...Season One\\" is on the right trek, so to speak, but could have been longer (again, we have had decades to put together the big picture on this show and its first season).  The same thing could be said for \\"Sci-Fi Visionaries,\\" which only scratches the surface on the show's use of big name science fiction writers.  Overall, I would rate this at 4.5 stars and end up rounding down because the packaging is not really user friendly because they get too cute for their own good here.<br /><br />I still go with season two of \\"Star Trek\\" being slightly better than the first, and I think I have a special affection for the 1965-66 season because it represented the time before James T. Kirk became a lover as well as a fighter.  Part of what made \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" so powerful was that it was a big deal for the captain of the \\"Enterprise.\\"  If I got to pick what episode would have been the show's pilot, I really would have gone with \\"The Corbomite Maneuver,\\" because it had the best sense of the show's mission statement (beyond the boldly glowing bit in the credits).  For me, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" is just as much of an aberration as \\"The Menagerie\\" (especially once you see \\"The Cage\\" on its own).  Besides \\"City,\\" I think the other really great episodes from the first season that would be \\"Balance of Terror,\\" \\"Galileo Seven,\\" and \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"  Yes, I have developed a clear bias for Spock episodes over Kirk episodes, but when you are a half-human Vulcan who disdains emotion you have a big advantage when it comes to having dramatic moments.  Other favorites from the first season would have to include \\"The Naked Time,\\" \\"The Squire of Gothos,\\" \\"Arena,\\" and \\"Space Seed.\\"<br /><br />This is not to say that all of the episodes are great.  \\"The Man Trap\\" and \\"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\\" always left me cold (the worst episode Majel Barrett did on \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" was better thanboth of those put together), and I can live without seeing either of the episodes with Harry Mudd ever again.  But I think the only episodes that really seem dated are those dealing with criminal investigations, specifically \\"The Conscience of the King\\" and \\"Court-Martial\\" (several centuries into the future and being able to identify somebody with a medical record is supposed to be difficult?), because \\"Star Trek\\" was more about people and situations than science and special effects.  Kirk broke the Prime Directive more often than not, but at least there was the idea that in the future we would have a better way of dealing with strangers and their strange lands.<br /><br />Watching these episodes again the two that stood out as defining the parameters of \\"Star Trek\\" were \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\" and \\"The Devil in the Dark.\\"  The former is important because the idea of fighting a war with computers rather than bombs embodies the idea of the double-edged sword of technology.  In the \\"Star Trek\\" universe science does not solve everything and actual creates rather significant problems.  You can trace an anti-science element throughout the series.  The latter represents the idea of recognizing ourselves in aliens, what humanity has always disparaged as the \\"other\\".  Accepting a half-alien crewmember like Spock is hard enough for some members of the \\"Enterprise\\" crew (e.g., \\"Balance of Terror\\"), but when the pergium miners of Janus VI instantly accept the idea they are doing something wrong when they find the Horta is a mother defending her eggs from being destroyed just might be the most optimistic evidence of humanity's nobility in the entire run of \\"Star Trek.\\"gether), and I can live without seeing either of the episodes with Harry Mudd ever again.

B0000C9V3T|2.0|After watching the two movies and buying them on DVD, i figured i'll get the soundtrack from the movie. However, many of the songs on the album are not the ones in the film, and some are not songs at all, just sound effects from the fighting scenes! The fantastic track at the end of the film which plays during the fight between The Bride and Oren isn't even on the Cd, that was a real mistake. Don't bother forking out your bucks for this, theres no point!
6304779356|3.0|I have two major problems with \\"The Lost Boys.\\" The first is that I know way too much about vampires, a data base of knowlege gained from not only watching all those Dracula movies, reading Anne Rice novels, and consuming everything having to do with \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" but from having read pretty much everything in \\"The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead.\\" So when Sam Emerson (Corey Haim) not only discovers that his brother Michael (Jason Patric) has become a vampire, but that there is a way of undoing his being undead, I am no longer willing to suspend my disbelief. I should add that this idea runs into one of my standard pet peeves from the \\"Star Trek\\" universe, which is that while I believe \\"X\\" can cause you to mutate from human to something else, reversing the process should never be as easy as it is. But the idea here is that if you kill Vampire A who created a Vampire B, then Vampire B can stop being a vampire (sort of a twist on the Anne Rice theory of vampires). There is a caveat: you have to do it before they take their first victim. Sure, it sounds simple, but it sure flies in the face of well-established vampire lore.<br /><br />The second problem I have with this 1987 film is that it is supposed to be funny, but it just is not. Sam is aided and abetted in his efforts to save his brother by the Frog Brothers, Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan (Jamison Newlander). The boys work for their doped out hippie parents at the local comic book shop, which sounds like a great idea. Who better to know how to fight the undead they kids raised on comics? But Feldman is trying to do some sort of impersonation of Sylvester Stallone and Newlander goes for something more taciturn, and it just does not work. The comic slapstick smacks of something really juvenile and just turns this into \\"Mommy, My Brother's a Vampire!\\"<br /><br />On the plus side is Keiffer Sutherland. If you thought he was a bully in \\"Stand By Me,\\" then you will enjoy every moment he is on the screen as David, leader of a group of \\"teenage\\" vampires. This is a pretty good idea, talking \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and crossing it with the \\"Wild Bunch.\\" But Sutherland ends up being a bit player in the proceedings while we deal with domestic comedy situations, such as Sam's mom (Diane Weist) trying to date a nice local guy (Edward Herrmann), and the romantic subplot between Michael and the young lady vamp, Star (Jami Gertz). There are a few good ideas thrown in here (e.g., think of a cave as being a giant coffin), but with all the misfires they come across as nicks rather than palatable hits. Cinematographer Michael Chapman provides the appropriate mood, but director Joel Schumacher's story is too complicated and the attempts at comedy too feeble to save this one. However, the less you know about vampires the more you might like this movie.is on the screen as David, leader of a group of \\"teenage\\" vampires.

There are a few good ideas thrown in here (e.g., think of a cave as being a giant coffin), but with all the misfires they come across as nicks rather than palatable hits. Cinematographer Michael Chapman provides the appropriate mood, but director Joel Schumacher's story is too complicated and the attempts at comedy too feeble to save this one. However, the less you know about vampires the more you might like this movie.
B000003TAW|5.0|Ahhh, good old Weezer.  In a time when mainstream music is in the worst state of apostasy ever (2004), I can always turn on the blue Weezer album and smile, knowing that despite all the crap being produced these days, good music did exist at one time.   <br />This album is essential to every music collection.  It consists of ten near-perfect tracks that vary beautifully in content, tempo, and style.  There's an astonishing breadth of music here.  You've probably heard half of the album on the radio, but even the stuff you don't hear is solid.   <br />The best tracks on the album are \\"Say It Ain't So,\\" \\"My Name is Jonas,\\" \\"Buddy Holly,\\" and \\"In the Garage.\\"  I envy anyone who hasn't listened to this album because they're in for the musical adventure of a lifetime.  This album is quite possibly the best album of the 90's.  It appeals to just about everyone.  Check out Pinkerton, also by Weezer.  It's a great, solid album as well.  You can probably get a copy of both at a used CD store for about five bucks.  It will be the best money you'll ever spend.  Trust me.
B00067TVHU|5.0|Shaun of the Dead was definitely a great 13$ spent (ticket price). it was an awesome satiric comedy with a bunch of great new young english actors. I dont want to spoil the plot, or hilarious moments [and there are many in this ghoulish tale] but I will suggest if you're searching for a great laugh and don't mind some blood then look no further. 5 stars, and I'm first on the list to purchase the DVD.
6305508550|5.0|If you work in an office, surrounded by synthetic humanoids who only appear to be alive. If you toil away daily at a desk, in a room with no ceiling, filing reports that have little or no bearing on reality. If your \\"job\\" has driven you to consider suicide, homicide, or grand larceny. If your boss is a smirking, passive-aggressive reptile. If you continually wake up in the morning wondering how it all came to this, you simply MUST see OFFICE SPACE. A riot from start to finish, this movie manages to assault and dismantle the entire culture of anesthetized office-drones we've cultivated. Mike Judge takes aim and blasts away at all the idiotic things that make corporate America such a dull, hideously generic nightmare. Please, watch this movie immediately! It may give you hope. It will definitely make you laugh! Imagine waking up on Monday morning, turning off the alarm, rolling over, and going back to sleep! Imagine ignoring your boss' monotone drivel! Imagine showing up for work late -DAYS late- wearing comfortable clothes, not caring one bit whether you get fired or promoted! OFFICE SPACE shows how truly unnatural and inhuman our workday has become. A modern classic! ...
B000669GAI|5.0|Let me tell you what a huge Pearl Jam I am,I have all their major albums from Ten to Riot Act.I absolutely love this band and admire them for there awesome talent.This greatest hits collection couldnt get that much better.To my suprise,even two of my favorites,\\"once\\" and \\"state of love and trust\\"(from the Singles soundtrack)were included!The only song I would take off is \\"man of the hour\\"(from the Big Fish soundtrack)To me it's very dull and doesnt excite me.The track \\"breath\\"is also a very good touch to this awesome compilation,along with another favorite of mine,\\"i got id\\".I would have also thought that the band would've included \\"crazy mary\\"one of my all time favorite PJ tracks!Personally I would have kept the original versions of all the songs,they sound fine as they are.There are however a few that I would have liked to see on this compilation.In fact I think that they should have pushed for a 3-disc set rather than try to fit all their good songs on 2 cd's,sorry this band is too good it aint happening!Why not make 1 cd of radio hits, and the rest can be mixed.There are a few essential tracks that they left out and I dont understand why because there are simply some of the best!These are \\"why go\\",\\"oceans\\" (from Ten)\\"rats\\",\\"leash\\",\\"glorified g\\" (from Vs.) \\"tremor christ\\",\\"satan's bed\\" (from Vitalogy)\\"mankind\\",\\"smile\\",\\"in my tree\\"(from No Code)\\"in hiding\\",\\"all those yesterdays\\",\\"faithfull\\"(from Yield) \\"thin air\\",\\"insignificance\\" (from Binaural)\\"you are\\",\\"love boat captain\\"(from Riot Act) and lastly \\"crown of thorns\\" and \\"crazy mary\\"Have I forgotten any? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00009W0U4|3.0|This movie was seriously disturbing in so many ways including a murder that is so graphic and real like I was simply astounded.  It took a while to get that image out of my head. It is not for the weak of heart and they also had a rape that though not very graphic was fairly violent.  The movie was of course in reverse but being a DVD you could just rewatch a scene though it still seemed disjointed at times and being in reverse you never develop any kind of attachment to the characters who seem one dimensional.
B000002UAU|4.0|I LOVE BOTH RECORDS, DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT SGT P. IS NOT THE CLASSIC IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE(RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE BEATLES CATALOG) AND MMT IS KIND OF LIKE A SINGLES COLLECTION (AN AMAZING ONE BUT A SINGLES COLLECTION NONE THE LESS). CLOSE THOUGH. SGT P. WOULD HIT THAT 5 STAR STATUS FOR ME IF AMMENDED. DROP \\"WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU\\" & \\"WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR\\". THEY'D MAKE A NICE 45. \\"W Y W Y\\" IS JUST A DATED EXPERIMENT AND \\"W I 64\\" IS AN EXCELLENT SONG IN THE COLE PORTER/POP TRADITION. THE PROBLEM, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, WITH THOSE SONGS IS THAT THEY DON'T ADD TO THE RECORD. AN AWESOME ADDITION MIGHT BE \\"STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER\\" & \\"PENNY LANE\\". WHY NOT? THEY WERE RECORDED DURING THE SGT P. SESSIONS. I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE THAT THEY ARE SONGS WORTH LISTENING TO A MILLION TIMES-KILLER SONGS AND INTRICATE STUDIO PIECES THAT MATCH THE MAGIC OF THE REST OF SGT P. SO, BURN A DISC OR RECORD A TAPE WITH THE NEW CONFIGURATION AND HAVE YOURSELF A CLASSIC \\"SGT. PEPPER'S TOUR\\" ALBUM. PERFECTION.
078322799X|4.0|Less of a feature film than an audition reel of what New Zealand wunderkind director Peter Jackson could do with a decent budget, \\"The Frighteners\\" is a jauntily paced little spookshow with Michael J. Fox in the lead as a paranormal researcher, exorcist, entrepreneur, and great chum to ghosts, who runs a lucrative little enterprise as an \\"exorcist\\" who evicts the very poltergeists who serve as his friends and houseguests. Sheesh, to think what the Ghostbusters might have done had they cut those ectoplasmic pests in on a piece of the action.<br /><br />Let's be honest here. As much as I adore and savor the works of Peter Jackson---particularly \\"Dead/Alive\\" and \\"Bad Taste\\", low-budget splatter-flicks helmed well before he was a Hollywood maven and Tolkien-resurrecting powerhouse---\\"The Frighteners\\" is a sketchy, chaotic, massively flawed film that is all over the map.<br /><br />That doesn't mean it's not fun.<br /><br />Quite the contrary. \\"The Frighteners\\" is an inventive little romp into soul-stealing and besides, it has Jeffrey Combs as a feral, uber-paranoid, necromantic FBI agent, which alone makes it worth a rental. Michael J. Fox turns in a jolly performance as Frank Bannister, a con-artist who capitalizes on his winning relationships with a trio of accommodating spooks (including the great John Astin as \\"The Judge\\").<br /><br />Producing poltergeists---and exorcisizing them---is big business until Bannister runs into the real thing, a Collector of Souls that eats ordinary ghosts for breakfast and throws his ordinarily profitable existence into turmoil. It seems mass murdering grinning-until-the-end asylum guard Johnny Bartlett (a fine turn by Jake Busey) died a miserable death in a mass murder spree, and somehow all of this ties into a ghoulish spectre that sucks the life out of hapless mortals.<br /><br />Add in an inspired performance by Jeffrey Combs as a paranormal and exceptionally sensitive FBI agent (\\"What? Ah-ha, now you're trying to stop *my* heart!\\"), and some genuinely startling special effects, and you have a jolly mishmash of a horror movie that really doesn't know when to stop. That's part of its fevered charm, right to the the final confrontation, though Busey looks far more malefic when covered up in a shroud.<br /><br />What will you get out of \\"The Frighteners\\"? First, this is a schizophrenic movie: Jackson shows off Wingnut's ability to deliver on a wide range of highly startling effects. Second, Jeffrey Combs steals the show, and right down to his final moments on Earth is a laconic, paranoid, inches-from-a-nervous-breakdown wreck of a paranormal investigator. I want to Believe!, indeed.<br /><br />Let's be honest: \\"The Frighteners\\" won't change your life, won't scare you, won't threaten your brain with an aneurism brought on by too much spectral derring-do. But the effects are stellar, the acting is uniformly competent, and the plot, while muddled, is jolly fun.<br /><br />Will it change your view of the universe and shift your political outlook? Absolutely not. Will it entertain for nearly two hours? Totally. Could you ask for more? Possibly, but for a special effects real that led Jackson from his uber-disturbing but underrated \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" to helming up \\"Lord of the Rings\\", let's not get picky.<br /><br />Is \\"Frighteners\\" worth a look? Absolutely. Dust off your Ouija Board, repeat \\"I do, I do, I DO believe in spooks,\\" sit back and relax, and get ready for some spectral, frantic, ectoplasmic goodness seasoned with some startling special effects and served up with a few perfunctory scares.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is not meant for the simple minded. OK Computer is a quantum leap in music. Radiohead is such a different commodity for a rock band (if they can be described as such). This album like most of their music requires almost an initiation period. Just insert into CD drive and leave. You will be amazed by how this music grips you and how you begin to relate to Thom's plaintive vocals and mysterious ramblings. OK Computer is haughtingly beautiful, and bombastic at the same time, and imaginative beyond description. If you want to critique someone's musical intellect simply ask them their opinion of this record. Anyone who describes this album as depressing is simply missing the point. Yorke has his moods but the total experience of listening to OK Computer should also provide you with hope for humanity. That four British lads could create something of such worth and distinction from the same pallet everyone else works from is indeed a remarkable achievement. Pablo Honey showed the pop potential of this band. The Bends showed their eclectic versatility but OK Computer is from a far more distant place.  <br />And lest we not forget the Greenwood boys and their magnificent contributions. Jonny has to be one of the most creative musicians on the planet. I would break down specific tracks but this album (like Dark Side of the Moon) is best heard and defined in it's entirety.  <br />More than seven years later I can recall the first time I heard this album and my astonished reaction. Probably similar to Edison seeing his light bulb work for the first time. A definitive masterpiece.
0385335482|4.0|This book (and the whole series) is hysterical.  I first read them during my lunchbreaks at work and had a co-worker laughing at me because I couldn't stop the following behavior:  laughing out loud, shaking my head, and frequently exclaiming, \\"She's crazy, absolutely crazy!\\" <br />I had a riot reading this book and despite my \\"fear\\" of The Mall...it nearly makes me want to go buy a bunch of stuff.  Although, this book also put the fear of debt into me, so I try to watch it. <br />Highly entertaining, I've passed these books along to my mom and my friends and we all find them really enjoyable and easy to read.
B0001Z37HM|1.0|I saw this when it came out originally, and has been a very, very long time since then.  Not remembering, I purchased this after getting back into the \\"Conan\\" series; what a mistake!  This was so lame I didn't even make it through the finish, turned it off.  The production level is that of \\"Ulyses\\"(sp?), back in the 50's, and the acting level is below rating.  I'd put money on it that [Schwarzenegger] regrets this one....he is the best of it, and he's hampered.  if you're into below \\"B\\" movies, this may be for you!
B00004SAJK|5.0|There is no denying UFO was not the hard rocking force it was just a few years before this release, but Mechanix is still a terrific album. No doubt Mechanix is more commercial and on the lighter side of rock, so what! it still rocks and it's still TOP QUALITY music! The song \\"Doing It All For You\\" alone is worth the price of admission (has anyone heard the amazing live version on the hard-to-find Headstone CD?)     Let me put this straight: UFO ruled the world when Schenker was in, but UFO also produced some of the best rock albums when Paul Chapman was the axeman. Different styles... who cares?! UFO still made some of the best rock music back in 1982. Schenker was NOT UFO, just another very talented member, the man is one of the world's best guitarists but his compositions as a solo artist pale in comparison to the ones he made with UFO... Mechanix with Paul Chapman is much better than other releases from \\"classic bands\\" from that era, including MSG's solo albums, period. An absolute must, but only for real objective ears.
1563899426|4.0|Rose Red is missing, presumed dead and everyone is a suspect. Volume One of Bill Willingham's Fables follows Sam Spade-like detective Bigby Wolf as he investigates the crime and interviews suspects, which include Rose's boyfriend Jack (of Beanstalk fame), her sister Snow White, and the retired pirate Bluebeard. The sudden arrival of Snow White's ex-husband, Prince Charming, only complicates the already bizarre enclave in New York they call Fabletown. <br />Fables: Legends in Exile collects the first story-arch of the award-winning Vertigo comic. I want to describe this as a \\"romp\\" or \\"a lot of fun\\" but that does not do Fables justice; this book is an ethnographic exploration of those who inhabit our stories. The pages of the Grimm Brothers and Rudyard Kipling serve as history here, while a flying monkey acts as the librarian's assistant in City Hall. The Fables seem to know they are fables, giving the book an unresolved and unstated tension. <br />Fans of Neil Gaiman's American Gods or Sandman also will enjoy this book, as it directly confronts the idea of our shared narrative heritage as a living thing. The Fables come across as flawed (often cursed) as the humans who write stories and make cartoons about them, creating more of a statement about our lives than those of people in a land a long time ago who lived happily ever after.
1400031362|2.0|There is too much of this book which reads like a junior-high essay which had to be 500 words or more.  Too many references to the \\"Little white van\\" and \\"Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni\\" which only add text, not meaning.  (I'm sure that this gets written with \\"JLB\\" and then a search and replace with \\"Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni, etc)  The story is formulaic, and the characters are not developed in any way. <br /> <br />If you liked the previous books, you'll like this one.  If you were hoping it got better, it didn't.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This album was absolutley hilarious i mean the drive-thru thing was just incrediblly funny i loved every second of this rollercoaster of fun and funnieness! You must have it in your collection!!!
B0000B1OE7|4.0|This movie is what anime is all about, anyone who says differently is probably watching Sailor Moon.  The illustration is starting to show it's age but the flow of the action doesn't seem to be affected.  If it has Yoshiaki Kawajiri as the director, you won't be dissapointed.  Buy this, then checkout Wicked City. <br /> <br />I haven't seen this particular \\"Anniversay Edition\\", but I've read many reviews that state the the letterbox version is bogus.  They actually cut from the top and bottom to make it widescreen.  That's a new low.
B000022TSW|4.0|I love the series and I do love the movie...to make it short. <br />Longer <br />funnier <br />Kenny dies...probably the most gruesome death ever...Compared to all of his other deaths. <br />And there is lots of foul Language uncensored. <br /> <br />If you happend to like the movie with all its uncensored glory I recommend on watching the very first south park episode that's all over the net.. Titled <br /> <br />The spirit of Christmas.  Offensive but funny just like this film... <br /> <br />so yeah...great film And the series rocks...I've seen everysouth park episode and the movie sort of counts as one so yeah the movie is good but not as good as the newest south park episodes but then again this movie was came out 3-4 years ago in theater so yeah... <br /> <br />Over all 4 stars..Dvd is average...
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I think Whitney Houston \\"One Wish\\" Holiday Album is five stars hands down. My favorites from this amazing album goes as following...Little Drummer Boy, One Wish, The First Noel, and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. I do believe the album is underrated it should have been a best seller...Whitney's version of \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" is the best version of the song, and I'm just not saying that. A must have holiday album!
B000002U9Y|5.0|Originally released in 1968, as this was the band's second record. Technically speaking, 'A Saucerful Of Secrets' may JUST be the first ever 'space rock' album. Remember, even though founder Syd Barrett was booted out of the group after the release of 1967's 'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn' lp, he managed to appear on just one track here, \\"Jugband Blues\\". There are some vintage pieces of work here that I haven't heard in years, until recently. Such as, the anthem-like \\"Let There Be More Light\\", their landmark \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\" (like the longer / live versions of this tune as well), their twelve-minute epic title cut \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" and \\"See-Saw\\". For any 'younger' whipper-snappers out there that may be reading this review, 'Saucerful' is a must-have and a true keeper. Highly recommended.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I just watched this movie for the first time yesterday.  I had reread the book prior to watching the movie, just to get back up to speed with the story.  Well, this movie is just SO sketchy compared to the book!  I realize that lots of things are cut out so we don't have a 5-hour movie, but this felt like a Cliff's Notes version.  To start, everyone except Harry and  Hermione seems reduced to a bit role.  Even Ron and Hagrid don't have more than 15 minutes of total screen time (it seems).  The Weasley twins, Hedwig, Professor Trelawney, Dumbledore, McGonagall - even the Dursley parts seem weeded out and that's saying something, since the Dursley parts are never really that large to begin with.  It feels like a story involving Harry and Hermione, with cameos by all the other people.  Professor Lupin is not really fleshed out, and there's TOO LITTLE SNAPE!  Come on, Snape is the guy we all love to hate, give him more screen time! <br /> <br />I'm hoping the next one will involve more of the characters we have come to be interested in.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|I am a fan of Rush since 1984 and I own everything they have ever released with the exception of the last cover album (which is not essential either). I suffer in saying this but this album is not essential not for the fans (even if I know that every fans will buy this concert) and nor for the casual listeners (because they will find a tired band). I find this event in Rio not essential in the history of Rush even if I bought both the cd and the dvd. And if they would release the third consecutive live album (different stages, rush in rio and maybe rush on the moon...)  I'll surely would buy that one too, because I love the band, I love their music, I love the guys in the band, their musicianship, but all these things don't mean that these live albums would be essential. Probably this Rio concert is a farewell to the fans, the last present from a glorious band to their loyal followers and if it is I understand it's meaning. It's sad, yes. But it's been a thirty years run ... I can understand the guys are tired. We have to respect their wills to retire if they would.<br /><br />Well talking about this Rush in Rio I think that another triple cd live show is not necessary because the Rush catalog is full of live albums (4 official) and this one is even more unnecessary because it's not a great night. The band seems tired to me. Obviously guys in Rush play well and are exceptional musicians. But it's not enough. Here some magic lacks in my opinion. The magic they were full of in the past. This one in Rio is quite clearly the last date of the tour and I can feel that the guys are tired and maybe a little less inspired than in other more lucky occasions. They are not fresh anymore. You can feel it. I think the last two studio albums are there to testify this lack of enthusiasm and freshness in the guys. Test for echo and Vapor trails are surely the worst albums in their entire career (not even comparable to the fantastic gems they released in the past like Moving Pictures, Permanent waves, Hold your fire, Presto .. ) and I can't even tolerate to hear the tunes from those albums which are terrible. Bad, bad, bad material. But I mean, it's  life. Things come and go. Now it's time for Rush to go. They have been an incredible band, they created timeless music.  Now they are at the end of their run as a band.<br /><br />This event in Rio it's not perfect also due to the problems they had in the recording process. Weather was really bad and the crew had a lot of problems in mounting the recording equipment. They didn't even have the time to try a sound check. So this recording has some flaws. But if Rush in Rio it's a farewell, I sadly will appreciate and I'll say \\"thank you guys\\". Thanxs for the music and for your company. Thanxs for the unforgettable moments you gave me with your music in the last twenty years. Thank you guys.<br /><br />PS Cmon guys, don't judge this live album with the fans'eyes ... be honest. I'm saying this because I'm tired to see negative feedbacks each time I write a bad review about something. World isn't perfect and Rush too even if they are a great band. Even Rush can produce bad music nights ... cmon. And it's not that everything you buy is the greatest thing on earth. Everything on amzon is rated five stars. C'mon.

B00064VR0W|4.0|I haven' bought the dvd yet.  There's a question about guest artists.  In Rod's web page, talking about this dvd, it says that E. Clapton, Steve Wonder, Cher, appear in it, but they are not mentioned in these reviews. Where is the truth? <br />I just rated it because i had too, so I could send this question.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|With this new 2-disc release, Disney Studios finally \\"got it right.\\"  Kudos to the technical specialists who cleaned up the animation sequences and the soundtrack irregularities that have plagued every release of \\"Mary Poppins\\" ... until now! The 5.1 Surround Mix is superb and the sound engineers have equalized the voices during the songs that contained dialogue that was dubbed into the sequence, so now it is hardly noticeable. The Disney Home Theater Stereo Mix is even better than the original stereophonic theatrical release. It was just thrilling to watch the opening credits and see the actual care and love gone into cleaning up the original artwork.  Here is a Textbook Example of how to digitally restore a movie without destroying it (are you listening, George Lucas?).<br /><br />A technical note: This edition is listed as being widescreen (1.66:1) whereas my 1998 edition of \\"Mary Poppins\\" listed a screen ratio of 1.88:1.  Whichever it is, it is the same screen ratio as the 1998 edition (thankfully).<br /><br />\\"Mary Poppins,\\" in my opinion, has always been the best film Walt Disney ever produced, and the care he took in producing it is evident in the casting (especially the cameo roles). Robert Stevenson's direction is classic and unobtrusive; the editing is well-paced; the cinematography perfect.  It is no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards, mostly for technical achievements and the music, and of course one big one for Best Actress to Julie Andrews in her film debut!
0440539811|5.0|Well written and just as fun to read now as it was back then.  This book reminds me of stranger in a strange land.
B0002858YS|5.0|i bought the killers cd, not because of somebody told me, but because i just heard they were an absolutely amazing band. so i gave em a try and while listening to the cd, i loved it. i cant stop listening to it. its like mellow, but not to mellow, rock mixed with techno, and believe me its a great combination! my favorite tracks are mr brightside, midnight show, everything will be allright and believe me natalie. i really enjoy this album and cant wait to see them live, cuz i am goin to pretty soon. i reccomend this cd. 10 stars! absolutely awesome!
0805076476|3.0|Its not particularly well written but it keeps you interested. It has some interesting twists and poses very serious questions and ideas in our modern world. The novel is brilliant in some sense in its attacking of subject matter. At the same time, the very very last few pages of the book dismantled quite rapidly (like a bomb) the story the author had been building in a very unsatisfying way.  its like building a very intricate house of cards and then taking an industrial fan to face it and blow them all away. <br /> <br />What is so relevant and important in this novel is the identity of humans and society in a modern age. So much of what is written now is garbage and has no meaning which is why this is so poignant- it has meaning. it is a contradiciton. it is sensitive while being insensitive. the deceptive clearness of the narrator leads to a muddled story. The absurdity of the premise is poetic. and it almost works when the entire house of cards the story is built on topples. almost. Regardless of how many stars it gets, this book is well worth the read if you want to read very recent work.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Heck, VAN HELSING is lots of fun and that's what makes this movie so entertaining for me.  Sure, it's overbrimming with special effects, but they're so cool and well done, I never tired of them, even a few of which were a little over the top.  Director Stephen Sommers who brought us the delightfully campy MUMMY series gives us a riproaring, action packed adventure story, and even though it's camp and humor is not quite as on target as in the Mummy movies, there is still plenty of tongue in cheek humor to soften the monstrous savagery.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman (who would make a good James Bond) stars as the enigmatic Van Helsing, not your typical Peter Cushing Van Helsing, but a strange man who has a clouded past.  Jackman does well in the role, infusing the requisite macho and spiritual qualities.  David Wenham as Carl is wonderful in his low-key, restrained performance.  Wenham, who also appeared in LORD OF THE RINGS, is a capable supporting actor and was fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale is certainly beautiful, but I've never been overly impressed with her acting abilities, but she makes a nice heroine.  Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is a little too effeminate at times, but he is certainly a snarly vampire.  Kevin J. O'Connor behind great make-up plays Igor with a humorous flair.  Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster overcomes his overwrought makeup to portray the man-made \\"monster\\" who wants to be accepted.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's score is appropriately melodramatic and the visuals, cinematography and art direction are Oscar worthy, as are the effects.<br /><br />Critics generally hated this movie, Newsweek's David Ansen placed it in his ten most disappointing movies of the year.  I found it highly entertaining and that's what movie making is supposed to be.
B00008BRB5|5.0|At first when you hear an album like this, it may seem like an average \\"good\\", well constructed pop-album, but it actually contains one of the qualities I love about any good album, it grows on you. Let me tell you, the powerhouse that is Stewart Copeland calls for any serious drummer in any genre to listen and study his approach, not only to pop drumming, but drumming in general. He changed pop-drumming in many ways with his insane hi-hat technique and polyrythmic adventures. With that said, it`s an album with exclusively great songs. Not a single one that`s not a good song in itself. Some songs gets you off at first, while some need a few listenings before it \\"sits\\", but if you can`t get your groove on from this album, you are either deaf, or a republican...
B00005JKG7|3.0|I have seen this movie about 20 times throughout my life and never seem to get tired of it.  It is creepy, funny and has a good plot.  I love the setting of the movie and the cast is fantastic as well.(I believe that Jamie Lee Curtis' mom is one of the townsladies) <br /> <br />While I never get tired of watching this movie, there is also nothing special about it.  It does not have the humor and savagery that the Nightmare on Elm Street series has.  It does not have the wonderful irony and character development seen in Romero's Dead Series.  It is missing the gore found in movies like the Re-Animator and Hellraiser.  And, it does not possess that \\"I must watch to the end\\" quality that a movie like the Exorcist owns.   <br /> <br />All of that said, this is an entertaining movie and one that I couln't imagine horror fans disliking.  I have heard and vaguely remember it doing poorly at the box office, but then again, all horror movies seem to do poorly at the box office. <br /> <br />Buy this movie, because, as a horror fan, you will want to watch it a few times!
B000063UR2|5.0|I need to point out first that I saw this film twice. The first half of the movie, as it turns out, is really boring unless you've already seen the movie the whole way through. The second half is incredible, though. So I advise that you watch the movie twice. I also recommend the director's cut to the theatrical release, as it has infinitely more character development, a better sound score, and some much needed extra dialogue. The acting is also pretty good--I'm not usually a huge fan of Tom Cruise (he's alright, though), but I really enjoyed his performance in this. Of course, as a fantasy film, it has it's moments of cheesiness and downright weirdness. But overall, it's a solid, good fantasy film. Tim Curry plays the best devil I've ever seen. This is probably the first depiction of the devil that actually scared me. So, in short--this movie rocks in all directions. A must for any fantasy fan.

The realease of the lighter twin was extremely graphic and grosteque.  I think this book should not be read for fun or even in schools.  This book is for adults.  I don't like how this book is being pitched to school children as early as grade 6!

My copy is an original 1970 copyright, however I intend to buy this book for my son's pre-school classroom so they can all enjoy it too!  Thank you Ed Emberley!!!
6304696515|3.0|Considering that 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' by Choderlos de Laclos is perhaps my favorite novel (or tied, at least, with 'The Island of the Day Before' by Umberto Eco), I would probably be expected to rate Dangerous Liaisons with a nine, at least, yet I could not do so in good conscience. Frankly, I find this film to be something of an insult.<br /><br />Anybody who has read the novel understands that its brilliant rests in the sublte nuances of dialogue between the vicomte and the marquise and of de Laclos's familiarity and analysis with the unspoken aspects of falling in love, not to mention the eloquence of the writing itself. Unfortunately, very little of the novel's charm shines through in Dangerous Liaisons. The film's attempts to recreate the wit of the novel often seem stale or childish and, worse yet, the the film fails to build up to its rising action and climax, almost assuming that the viewer already knows the story. Before the film properly introduces the characters, already they're making wagers, and how could the beautiful young presidente de tourvel possibly fall in love with such a clumsy snob.<br /><br />How, in fact, could anybody fall in love with a Vicomte de Valmont as played by John Malkovich. Although a spectacular actor, Malkovich would come across more natural in a suit or a tank top, something a bit more masculine; the character of Valmont requires somebody more charming, not only to make the costumes work, but to correctly portray the persona. Watching Malkovich in the role of Valmont is not unlike watching Alan Greenspan dance the Macaraina in short-shorts and a Wham shirt. For that matter, how is the the viewer expected to believe that Uma Thurman is a fifteen year-old ingenue just out of a convent, and that Valmont is really so desparate to go to bed with Glenn Close after having Thurman? The film's saving grace in this regard would certainly be Michelle Pfeiffer who was not only the proper age for her role, but as also able to adapt to her character. Also, Kiannu Reeves as the Chevalier Danceny has probably been his best role to date, although that's not saying a whole lot.<br /><br />Although Dangerous Liaisons fails to live up to the novel of its origin in most respects, the scenery and costumes were beautifully designed. Since Les Liaisons Dangereuses was an epistolary novel, giving de Laclos no reason to go into detail about clothing and furniture, the artists had a fair amount of liberty, and they did spectacular work with it.<br /><br />Anybody interested in the French Baroque period or interior design should find at least some pleasure in watching this film, and even the average viewer should be mildly entertained. Fans of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, however, may be disappointed. Basing a film on a book is a bit like matching black clothing: if you can't do it perfectly, don't do it at all.<br /><br />-derrick<br /><br />P.S. If you happen to purchase the film on DVD, beware: it's the 1997 release is really not of the highest quality. Mine was already skipping just out of the box, and the DVD forces you to sit through the FCC warnings in three different languages.pt to her character.

B00005K3NR|5.0|I first read the book by Steven King and was interested in seeing the movie, and it was just about as good. Dont worry, I wont be one of the people that go on about the book being better, but it will give you a better insight to whats happening on screen.<br /><br />The movie tells pretty much the same story as the book. There is a couple of things not in it, and the ending has been changed, but thats because they didnt have the FX team to make scenes like that, tho they tried a few, and the ending didnt need to be the same to get the idea, but it does not take anything away from the film.<br /><br />Carrie White's not the girl next door, she has the power of telekinisis, which means she can move things with her mind, among other things. She is a highschool student who is very shy, no friends, and is bullied a lot. She gets set up by a group of the other kids to go to the prom, but a cruel prank they preform to humilate her infront of everybody turns out to be the biggest mistake of there lives when they PO Carrie White. ... what does she do? Watch it and find out!<br /><br />The bonus features are pretty good, theres a documentry and reunion footage and talk about the film and how it came about ect... interesting stuff. A few deleted scenes, commentary, production notes ect... I dont know if theres anything else they could have added to make it better value for money, defintily worth replacing the old VHS version for, provided you like movie, if you dont then why would you wanna replace it, let alone have it on VHS?
B0000AMRJD|3.0|Scarface- one of the most intense- yet compelling view of a selfish gangster/cocaine dealer. Al Pacino gives a standout performance and should have been at least nominated for a  Best Actor Oscar, of which he was not. This movie will probably never be forgotten, especially the violent chainsaw scene and the famous phrase, \\"SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!\\" <br /> <br />Orginally, Scarface was rated X (in that time that was the NC-17 rating) due to extreme violence and profanity. But, director Brian De Palma took the MPAA to court, and it finally got an R rating (thank god!) The reason why I am giving this movie three stars is because the story is depressing, but depressing in a way everyone can understand. Overall. it's  a good movie, and I recommend it to mature viewers only.
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic opens with a frightening soundscape that will lure the listener into this dark and isolated world right away. Abrasive electronic beats mesh perfectly with the angelic strings and it makes for quite a combination. A true treat to Bjork fans and music fans alike. This is an album of pure genius from one of the most genius artists currently making music. It will grab you and refuse to let the listener go even after the album is through. A masterpiece from the cosmos is \\"Homogenic\\"
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The Butterfly Effect, in many ways, comes off as a \\"lite\\" version of Donnie Darko - it explores similar premises with a less effective screenplay, less talented actors and a bigger budget. That said, The Butterfly Effect is still a relatively enjoyable movie. It won't provoke as much thought as Darko did, but that's largely because it's been heavily 'Hollywoodized'. As far as acting goes, Kutcher was quite good. As much as I like That 70s Show, it's nice to see him moving into roles that require more of him than simply replicating his role as Kelso. Amy Smart, however, didn't impress me at all and didn't do much for the film. In the supporting roles, Eric Stoltz was excellent as a [...] father and Ethan Suplee, who is one of my favorite supporting actors (you might have seen him in American History X, Cold Mountain or Remember The Titans) is onscreen for such a short time that he doesn't have much impact as Kutcher's goth roommate. The downside of this movie is that, if you start to think about it too hard, plot holes show up at every turn, so it's best to simply enjoy the movie on its own terms.     Also, if you're watching the DVD version, I'd recommend watching the Director's Cut over the Theatrical Version. The theatrical version is a happier ending, but one that doesn't fit nearly as well with the rest of the film and looks to be yet another attempt to Hollywoodize the movie.
0321127420|4.0|You could view this as a rehashing of patterns that have existing for some time - or - you could view this is a collection of those patterns that are still relevant today. Based on how I used this book in my work, I see it from the latter perspective. There's nothing wrong with re-documenting old material when you focus on what's been proven and successful. Plus, there's new content that will be of interest to many as well. Though this book came out a while ago, I feel it is still relevant today.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This movie is one of the best views of Los Angeles crime, period. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro give standout performances, yet the two share so little on screen time together. The action is the best I have ever seen since Die Hard and the Godfather, and the L.A. bank heist Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore pull off is genius and is so well executed that it is one of the greatest action scenes ever put on film.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot was Green Days first No.1 Album, and its easy to see why. The first track was also the first single from the Album, \\"American Idiot\\" which is an Amazing Song.

Definatley Worth buying. <br /> <br />Also Note: If you see on the Internet that this Album has 21 Tracks, and get home to find your album only has 13, Don't Panic. Its Just That Track 2 and Track 12 are 9 Minutes long and are each divided into individual parts. Some Sites List Each Parts as Sepereate Songs, Some Dont.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I am not a really big fan of Tom Cruise or Julianne Moore or William H or Phillip Seymour for that matter most of the people in this movie are people do not like, Cruise is too much of a non-brainer action film star, which I hate. Moore is simply crap and decided to ruin one of the worlds greatest film by making a sequel, the silence of the lambs I'm talking about, and is no good in anything else I have had the misfortune to see her in (Jurassic Park, The Forgotten). William H. is a nobody. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does not possess his dad's unique talents and every character he plays is repulsive and vile to watch such as George Willis Jnr in Scent of a Woman. BUT... Magnolia is completely different, I think this film is a masterpiece, definitely the best film of the year 2000, the story is confusing but intriguing, the characters are mixed up but in a way believable, Cruise actually acts, I think the spectacular film he made a year before it for Stanley Kubrick actually gave him the ability to act, Eyes Wide Shut andMagnolia are his only worthwhile films, even in Rain Man he overdoes it, but in Magnolia he acts with flair, imagination, and passion he is presented as a top quality performer, and it's about time seeing as he's been film for ages, the same applies for Julianne Moore who is good in this but crap in everything else - oh apart from the Fugitive but she's only in it for five minutes. William H. a comedic star from things like Mystery Man plays a weird guy, he does it well, I love the part where he gets drunk and begins to throw his weight about - reminds of something like Cheers. Hoffman is brilliant, he plays a likeable character and does it well he may grow up to be as good as his dad yet this film does him justice, but he'll need to do something pretty good to catch up with Dustin. Yet I think this film is phenomonal, and I know I use this word in a lot of my reviews but it is true, it really is phenomenal, and even though it is around 3 hours or so long it still grips you from start to finish, when I first watched it, it started at eleven o clock and I was tired but I darest not turn my eyes from the screen, the acting is good frim a group of actors known for terrible roles and P T Anderson does a fantastic job of using crisp imagery to manifest the story into you, it is fantastic, I don't care what you say.  <br />
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Charming movie that engages family members of all ages. My kids loved it and I was entertained as well. Good, clean family fun.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|One of the best films of the year, and a certain bold move by Tom Cruise, the real star of this vehicle is Jamie Foxx.  It was a good transition film for him going from those silly \\"Booty Call\\" type of movies to serious work.  Tom Cruise is great as a villain, an assassin who has an agenda and is relentless in his pursuits.  This film has it all.  Great direction from Micheal Mann, and a moving score.  Star making performance for Foxx.  Great action and some comedy too.
B000654YRY|5.0|Mark Knopfler walks on stage and its time to live on solid rock.  Very good performance by Dire Straits and fantastic opportunity to see the white Jimi Hendrix (Yeah baby!) do his latest tricks on the guitar.  How can you go wrong listening to this?<br />Great show!
B00063MBU8|3.0|This review pertains to people who're out of their teens. If you're not, you won't benefit from it: <br /> <br />If you're out of your teens and you like this music, I heap pity upon you. These lyrics are such quintessential teenage-angst that I think they didn't take it from the teenage-angst mold; the mold was created from their music. If was 17 again, and frustrated with things adults know to be unworthy of real stress, then I'd write these exact lyrics. <br /> <br />One caveat is that I could recommend this music to a frustrated, angry, woe-is-me teenager. In truth the music is not bad, which is why I give three stars. And, a clueless teen would probably associate with them nicely. But the lyrics are so obstinately predictable and boring that I cannot bear them.
068987474X|1.0|I have not read this book, but I have flipped through it at a bookstore, and I did watch the Oprah episode.  I find the whole concept kind of creepy and controlling...as many others have mentioned, people are complex and none of us really know what is going on in someone else's mind.  People tend to get so obsessed with self-help books searching for that perfect solution to what are basically just the trials of living life.  My thought is that you should just be yourself and follow your heart- yes, you may get hurt, but what kind of life are you going to lead if you worry about every little signal a guy sends you?

You'll be satisfied if you listen to this, but you'll be wanting a lot more.
0767817478|2.0|Being a fan of Godzilla, I was thrilled to hear that an American version of Godzilla was being made back in the 90's. The first time I actually seen a photo of what the American Godzilla looked like.....well the thrill was gone. Jeez people,....that's not Godzilla for crying out loud.....that's a beefed up mutated Raptor on steroids. Instead of using a cgi Godzilla in this movie, why not just put Arnold the Terminator in a rubber suit??? It was so obvious that Roland Emmerich went to the theater when Jurassic Park came out, and he loved the scenes of Raptors chasing \\"Bones,\\" his woman, and two rug rats around. Sooooooo.....why not rip that scene off by having mutilated iguanas chasing Nik Totopolis Metropolos whatever, a french insurance agent who loves all the bad Elvis movies, an actress who was dragged off the street and told she could act....or tried to anyway, and a camera man from Kodak....or Polaroid one......all around Madison Square Garden. Given the characters of this \\"Always Save [...] Wiper Tissue\\" movie, they should've filmed the Raptor Ripoff scene in a septic tank. I was surprised that a Long John Silvers or Captain D's advertisement wasn't in the scene...what with all the dead fish laying around the huge easter bunny eggs. And what was with all the rain???? Over ninety five percent of the movie it rained????? Was that the director saying \\"well, we'll film just about every scene with rain falling....that way people won't notice that this isn't Godzilla, and the fact that the acting is below sub par\\" ???? Oh there was \\"some\\" acting in the movie, mainly provided by Matthew Brodrick,....but our leading actress....Matthew's love interest....was awful. She looked more like a hooker impersonating a tv reporter with bad facial expressions. A zit could've acted better....and the title would've been changed to \\"Zitzilla!\\" As to how the American Armed Forces are protrayed in this B-movie....well it makes me wonder did we actually win WWII? Oh we can blow the crap out of buildings in New York......but we can't hit a muscular sky scraper of a lizard?????? And we sparingly use tanks in favor of bullets?? Oh sure...a bullet is gonna stop Godzilla like a fan will keep a hurricane away. But at least!.....in the better and original Japanese Godzilla movies....THEY HIT THE DARN THING!....and they use tanks....and even something called a Mazer to give Godzilla shock treatments.....but they nail Godzilla none-the-less. Also in this fart fumed movie we're lead to believe that the city of New York has all been evacuated.....save for the local press natually.....you mean to tell me that there wasn't one fool who stayed around hoping to do some \\"Zilla tipping\\"?? The entire movie is quite irritating to watch...unless you enjoy picking it to pieces, like I do. For instance, look at the scene where our hero's enter Madison Square Garden and find all the eggs....look at where some of the eggs are placed farther up in the seats....y'mean to tell me Godzilla with his massive long tail was able to spurt an egg out of his bottom WITHOUT tearing up part of the arena?? And as tall as \\"Madzilla\\" is....he was able to scrunch down inside the Gardens and flop eggs out???? Bottom line is.....watch the Japanese Godzilla movies and ignore this Americanize excrement.

Yes, they are past their prime, and it shows, but for true fans, it is always a pleasure to watch 'any' performance from such influential artists. It's not like ELP will win a new generation of fans with this DVD, but as a collector, I would hate not having this item in my 'vault'. <br />Rock and/or jazz fans just can't ignore ELP's legacy, and the DVD's song list does a good job representing their style. <br /> <br />Production values could be better, so I can't give it 5 stars.

B0000026NC|5.0|I didn't expect to love this album. The egalitarian live dynamic that made Pink Floyd so incredible from 1969 to 1972 was completely lost by the time this was recorded, with David Gimour dominating the sound, Rick Wright and Nick Mason in the background, and Roger Waters replaced by a studio bassist. The setlist is a combination of stuff most would consider the Floyd's \\"greatest hits;\\" good pop songs, but certainly nothing like \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\" or \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" which made the live disc of Ummagumma one of the best albums in my entire collection. Oh. And did I mention that this was performed in front of a giant arena crowd that may or may not have cared all that much about the music? Yipes. Doesn't sound like much fun to me.  <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised.  <br /> <br />Disc 1 especially stands out. It starts off with the absolute BEST version of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" I've ever heard. David tackles the vocals briliantly and the sax solo goes places I never thought it could. Then, the AMLOR material, which sounded just OK on the album, is brought to life in the most spectacular manner possible. I honestly could not believe that such... well... tacky songs could sound so good and be performed so tastefully. Of special note is \\"On The Turning Away,\\" which has won a special spot in my heart as a true Floyd classic due mainly to this album. The lyrics... the music... it's just phenominal that the Floyd could pull it off without Roger Waters.  <br /> <br />Disc 2 is decent, but certainly not on my \\"frequent play\\" list. Except for \\"One of These Days\\" (which I'm convinced is impossible for any incarnation of Pink Floyd to mess up), it mostly sounds like a cover band of some sort; I don't really feel that special vibe the way I do on Disc 1. Out of the \\"classic\\" songs, I'd say \\"Money\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" are probably the best-rendered, but I've heard much better versions of each.  <br /> <br />I was tempted to give this four stars because this is, in essence, a five-star CD and a three-star CD packaged together, but Disc 1 is just so amazing that I feel the need to inflate my rating a bit.
0805209999|5.0|Really, what are you going to say about Kafka in an Amazon review? If you haven't read it, you should. You really have no excuse.
B00005MCX2|5.0|I came to this review a bit differently than most of the reviewers: I knew of them from right after the release of their 1st album through their US tours, saw their 1st US concert, etc. I first heard of them via the Melody Maker - \\"spacerock\\", etc. I might have even been the first US reviewer to write about them. I thought they'd sound like the Floyd. Their 1st album might lead you to expect that as well.     This album dispels that idea for good. These guys are heavy, heavy metal space travelers on a vastly different mission than Roger Waters and the boys. Just listening to the \\"get in tune, mates!\\" countdown in the beginning of \\"Born To Go\\" still gives me chills as Simon plays across all the tom tom tops. Lemmy (Rickenbacker stereo bass) and Simon King (a really BIG kit of drums) then lay down the thunder like never before. Lemmy actually more or less plays \\"lead\\" on most of this tune, and plays some fine bass solos. This CD (though overpriced - come on, guys!) is probably the most authentic record of what I believe to be the best Hawkwind band.    The reason why there are no breaks between songs is that is how a Hawkwind concert was - a song, some lines from sci-fi writer Michael Moorcock, another song, some synth from Del Dettmar or Dikmik, another song...it was a revelation.    Unfortunately, they didn't fit into anybody's convenient pigeonholes then or now, and in an age of Peter Frampton and disco United Artists US pretty much let them drift away..but you can still have a piece of it, and a ferocious piece at that, on this disc. Listeners who heard the \\"1999 Party\\" live set beware: while it is without doubt the cleanest recording, this is the real concert sound.    There are a few problems with the CD version here, please note. There is no good reason for this material to be on TWO CD's; the producer who converted this to CD cut off 40 sec. of Dave's chord at the end of Master Of The Universe - what a churl.    Whatever format you choose, if you really like Hawkwind, this set is essential. The only thing lacking in their canon is a live gig on DVD which would feature the one thing you can't get from a strictly audio performance - Miss Stacia'a dancing.
B00005AQGH|5.0|IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND HOW MUCH MATERIAL TUPAC RECORDED IN 1996. THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT. EACH SONG IS GREAT. THE PRODUCTION IS GREAT TOO.

0399103422|4.0|I think if you read most reviews here you will see virtually everyone loves \\"The Godfather.\\"  That said let me just say I enjoyed the book but I think I preferred the movie (Actually the book touches on both Godfather I and II) instead.   This is unusual because I almost always enjoy the book over the movie but this is an exception.  Let me explain why: <br /> <br />1.   The book focuses more on the woman Sonny is having an affair than the movie did.  Minimizing her in the movie was a smart idea. <br /> <br />2.   The scene in Godfather I where Micheal descibes how to get away with killing McClusky and Sollozzo seems to be an important turning point in Micheal's \\"career path\\".  In the movie Sonny is surprised his college bound brother wants to get involved in the family.   The book version seems ridiculous, with Sonny saying basically \\"It is about time you joined us...\\" <br /> <br />3.   I liked how the book focuesd more on Johnny Fontaine but it was sort of long winded at times.   I can see why the movie cut that part out. <br /> <br />It is a good book, but to me the movie is just so much better.

B00005RFQ5|2.0|Why is it that on some occasions an incredible artist puts one seemingly obnoxious element on a CD? Is it just to test the loyalty of their constituency? Take Prince's otherwise incredible jazz album \\"The Rainbow Children\\" for example - that stupid pitch-adjusted voice over talking at slow-motion 3 octaves too low simply ruins everything it intrudes upon. It is so disturbing to listen to that it's hard to simply not turn off the player to get through to the rest of the music.<br /><br />The material itself is really great - and shows Prince's great depth and versatility.  Just get rid of the #&*$# voice!!
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a heart throbbing story of two men and their overcoming their shortcomings to reach their dreams.  George and Lennie are complete opposites. George is a short tan skinned man who has it all together while Lennie is an enormous man who is mentally challenged. Together they form a family where they feel that together they will change their fate and own their own farm. Sadly, Lennie's mental illness is too much as he accidentally kills their boss's wife forcing George to give up his life long friend and the dreams they had together. This is an amazing novel and I recommend it for everyone to read.
B00064MW6A|5.0|I loved this movie. Saw it when it first came out in the theaters and just adored it. Then my neice came up for a couple of weeks and so she wanted to go see a movie. I asked her what see wanted to see, and out of all the movies she picked this one. Even over the Hilary Duff movie and she loved her more than anything I was amazed. I have been waiting impaitanently for this movie to come out. Cant Wait.
B00000AFDW|4.0|I bought this album to see how bad it really was. I was greatly surprised. Don't get me wrong, this isn't Exile on Main Street, Quadrophenia, Led Zeppelin 4 or the White Album. But it's a darn fine piece of fun rock'n roll. The tunes are catchy, seemingly heartfelt, and surprisingly diverse. Sure, there's the schmaltzy ballads (I Finally Found My Way). But there are also great uptempo tunes (Into the Void, I Pledge Allegiance...) I heard on the radio interview that Peter Criss hated this album. I think he's just pissed off at his \\"business partners\\" for not renewing his contract. Nontheless, he sounds fine on the album. So does Ace (who has a great rock voice), Gene and Paul (one of the top singers in rock history). Well worth the money (especially if you can get it used.) If you don't have it, get Alive! which is awesome.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Finally a Special Edition of one of the most influential films of the 1980's.  One of the first highly successful films to properly use Music Videos on MTV and a killer soundtrack.  And to top it off -- the film is actually damn good.  Dated in retrospect, but all the themes and storylines are as relevant today as they were then.  Jerry Bruckheimer should pick this DVD up and watch it over and over again -- and try and figure out where he went wrong.  While he still gives us MTV type films with some interesting visuals and some decent sountracks, they lack that certain \\"something\\" to make then really good films.  It was nice to see the interview with the late Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer's former partner.  As a producing duo -- these two owned the 80's in Hollywood.   <br /> <br />Great Special Edition that took far too long to reach our DVD players.
B0001906O0|5.0|Before Join the Dots was even a rumour I spent countless hours over the course of a year on a dial-up computer downloading these tracks from various places. Most of the time the sound was poor or a track cut off too soon or I just couldn't find a particular song. When this appeared I jumped on it and tossed the old copies away. To have these songs in one place, remastered and (almost) complete...well, I just didn't think it could get any better.    And then a few days ago Rhino re-released Three Imaginary Boys (the original UK version of the Cure's first album, Boys Don't Cry) with a bonus disc containing 20 alternate tracks, demos, live performances and more. I've been hoping for a long time that the Cure's original albums would be remastered and to know that Rhino's in charge of the project just makes me glad that the Cure's discography will receive the attention it deserves.    Join the Dots is essential, but now it's revealed to be only the tip of the iceberg. Fans of the Cure should rejoice!

B0002F7I9Y|1.0|Literally sung with his last breath, this is even more ghoulish than the Sinatra duet series.  Shameless exploitation of a dying man.
B000003TAW|5.0|Any band who uses a harmonica is ligit, and Weezer polishes it off nicely, to say the least. There intricate mold of garage rock, and airwave friendly popish sound is absoulute brillance. Rivers Cuomo(Vocals) has a noteable sound that brings emotion as well as a sort of comic blend in his lyrics. The entire album is a giant hook from the begining, it never once puts down the extremes of the melodies they provide. They prove that not only can they put out catchy songs about whatever and make  it good, they can also have an 8 min ballad that causes you to listen to every bit of it.
B000001Y42|3.0|Listening to Limp Bizkit's debut album, \\"3 Dollar Bill Y'all\\" sure takes me back. Limp Bizkit are single-handedly responsible for bringing rap-rock to the mainstream and starting a revolution that would peter off just years later. Sure, Rage Against The Machine had been doing it for years, but no one had done it with quite so much insecurity, misguided anger, and overall, immaturity as Limp Bizkit did. With Korn producer Ross Robinson turning the knobs, Fred Durst and company created a completely new style for themselves. Durst has cited his influences mainly in hip-hop, and although he isn't the world's greatest rapper, such influence is evident on here, and is pushed forward a little bit better by DJ Lethal (formerly of House Of Pain) providing all turntable work. Probably Limp Bizkit's biggest asset, however, is the trio of musicians: guitarist Wes Borland, bassist Sam Rivers and drummer John Otto. As the least recognizable faces, these guys never quite get credit for being the real creative force in Limp Bizkit and being the reason why so many people find this and their other music pleasing to the ears (well, Borland is a little overrated, but you get my point). Borland's guitarwork has a distinct sound, while Rivers lays down some funky and heavy basslines. John Otto, who is schooled in jazz drumming, proves to be the most skilled of the bunch. As far as this album goes, it ranges from being brilliant, to being sloppy. Noisy rockers like \\"Pollution\\" and \\"Leech\\" are only good in small doses, but  songs like \\"Sour\\" and \\"Stinkfinger\\" show a side of Limp Bizkit rarely seen, embracing melody and with some really funky and unqiue music as the background. \\"Counterfeit\\" and \\"Stuck\\" are two of Limp Bizkit's most recognizable tunes, and work well with the loud-to-soft dynamic that Helmet and Korn before them established. \\"Nobody Loves Me\\" has always been my favorite however, Durst's self-hating lyrics are entertaining and the song builds up and seems to explode right out of the speakers. Some moments really fall flat, especially the pointless \\"Thank-you\\" note of \\"Indigo Flow\\" and the seemingly incomplete \\"Clunk,\\" which starts out really great, but just never goes anywhere. And not to mention, Fred Durst's voice sounds really horrible on most of the songs. He never had the best voice, but here he is distorted three quarters of the time, and his yelling can be a bit grating. And of course, my main gripe with Limp Bizkit has always been the lyrics. There are some truly cringe-worthy moments on this disc, as can be found on all four of the bands' discs. But, Ross Robinson's production is raw and the band's playing is pretty passionate and intense, so it's no wonder why many people consider this to be the essential Limp Bizkit album. Although, I prefer \\"Significant Other\\" and even the most recent \\"Results May Vary\\" (gonna miss you, Mike Smith) to this, I can't deny that this is a fun album to pop in from time to time, even if it's just for nostalgic purposes. Three stars is exactly what this album deserves, because it's not bad, but it's not great either.of the speakers.

0800141601|5.0|OK, so I'll admit it- if you're a King Arthur nut, you may not like this movie.  It takes many liberties with the old legend.  If, on the other hand, you just want a good romantic story- this movie is most definitely for you.  Two things really stand out in this movie: the acting and the orchestral score.  Many movies ask us to buy into love only minutes after the lovers have met, and most of the time, it is quite difficult to buy into.  Here, the acting is so credible, especially from Connery and Ormond, that their emotions are easy to feel.  The movie also sports perhaps the most beautiful love theme ever written as well as some very good choral work for the action sequences.  It goes without saying that a movie with such big names comes with big production values as well.  The movie is also very well written...most all of the movie comes off as natural and un-forced, no easy task in an Arthurian movie.  If you haven't seen this and aren't too picky about the details of the legend, then you owe it to yourself to rent this one- or buy it, it can be found for some very scandalous prices now, indeed.
B00000K0DT|5.0|I happened to catch this film just by chance on a movie channel recently. I hadn't seen it again since it came out 10 years ago, but it was just as good the second time around. It's a dark mystery and thriller about what really amounts to the ultimate bogeyman--a criminal mastermind known as Kaiser Sose--a mysterious but quintessentially evil and nefarious criminal no one has ever seen but who seems to know everyone and everything that goes on in the criminal underworld. No matter how clever you are, he can outsmart you; no matter where you try to run or hide, he can find you (he seems to have spies everywhere), and no matter how bad or tough you are, he's badder and tougher. In short, he's like the seemingly invincible criminal masterminds one used to encounter in the old comic book stories, but reinvented in a more adult way in this very well done movie.<br /><br />If you like convoluted and twisted plots, this movie won't disappoint you either, and just that part of the movie practically takes Kaiser Sose's brainpower to follow and unravel, at least for me. :-) The script is terrific, and the acting by the entire cast is also superb. The drama and suspense build up from the opening scene to the final climax, where at least one of the mysteries is resolved--you finally learn who Kaiser Sose really is. Although Sose's omnipotent presence is felt during the entire movie, he's never actually identified until the last scene, although he does appear on screen. I would have never guessed who it finally turned out to be, but see if you can figure it out yourself. :-) Overall, still a fine movie that has held up very well and that I suspect is destined to become a classic of the film noir and detective/crime genre.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I remember seeing the trailer for this in the theatres countless times, and it seemed like it would be good. The release date kept on getting pushed back. So much so that it seemed like I had seen the trailer for a year(no exgageration)and still no movie. Finally, it came out in March of'04 and I was there the day it opened.At the time I didn't know Charlie Kaufman(Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) had written it and I didn't know Michel Gondry had directed it all I knew was that Jim Carrey et al where in it... from the previews my assumption was the characters were insane in some goofy way, but it definitely looked like it was  worth 6.50(or whatever) to see. <br /> <br />During it's 2-month(?) run  I saw 5 or 6 times and I rarely go to see a movie even twice in the theater. That is how great this film is. Gondry's vision of how we remember certain things/ or our dreams is dead on. There have been countless movies that have tried to explore the sub-conscious or the dreamstate but they all look laughable compared to this one. How Gondry shows the erasing of Joel Barrish's(Carrey)memory in and of itself is worth repeated viewing. That's if the story and acting were crap, these elements of the  movie thankfully are also superb. <br /> <br />Charlie Kaufman has written his best script with this one,unlike his previous ones there are no gapping holes or major flaws. He has taken his brillance as a screenwriter and honed it into a perfect script that the bottom doesn't fall out of at the end.And what can I say about Jim Carrey? Everytime I think he hits a peak(The Cable Guy, The Truman Show,Man On The Moon) and he's going to wallow the rest of his carrer in comic  mediocrity he pulls a whole new bag of tricks out, and as Joel Barrish that's exactly what he does. He does not go for any cheap laughs in this movie. The character he plays is someone who is analyitical and lets his hang-ups control him; not a whimsical sort at all. Will Mr. Carrey finally get the recognitionhe well deserves from some out of touch guy named Oscar? Ultmately that's not important. What is though, is that you will be blown away at how amazing he is in this film. Kate Winslet as Clementine is just as hypnotic as Carrey is(as are the others) in this film, but since you kind of expect it from them (Tom Wilkinson, Kristen Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) it's not as noticable. Make no mistake though, all the above mentioned actors turn in a stellar perfomance and play a vital part in the story. <br /> <br />However, it's the incredible work of Gondry that you're left pondering at the end of the film. How he distorts sound and images to show the memory being erased, how he comes back to previously erased memories to show them half-baked, how he combines two or more memories to create an image that would never happen in real life but makes perfect sense in the context of the the movie...all these things(and more) are what make this such an amazing acheivement in movie direction.(Watch the books closely in the scene toward the end of the movie in the bookstore with Joel and Clementine. It's one the best moments in the film direction-wise) <br /> <br />The ending of the movie is left up to your interpretation what is not is the quality
6304696515|4.0|'Dangerous Liaisons' is an adaptation of a scandolous 18th century French book. Glenn Close is the scheming, vicious Marquise De Merteuil, who would like nothing more than to see the man that left her punished. What better way to do this than to have her friend (and ex-lover) the Vicomte De Valmont (John Malkovich) seduce her ex-husband's soon-to-be wife Cecile De Volanges (Uma Thurman).  <br />Whilst we're at it, throw in the virginal Madame De Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom the Vicomte is extremely desirous of seducing, Keanu Reeves as a musician who lusts after Cecile and the Marquise, and the fact that the Vicomte lusts after the Marquise but she will not allow him to have her. All in all, somewhat confusing and dense as regards to whom is sleeping with whom and why, but still nasty vicious fun.  <br />Glenn Close and John Malkovich are excellent in their respective roles, and the supporting cast help them along nicely, but you will need to concentrate to understand this period piece.  <br />
B00000I78Y|5.0|I wasn't gonna write a review(is it necessary, this album is ground zero for what metal should be)until I saw a review that basically says this album is great if you are 15.F**K YOU TOO!!! I'll have you know from the opinion of someone pushing 30 that this album made me realize that not only was metal relevant but vital to our world.I used to be a full on metalhead then the 90s happened and I realized life is too short to swell up your chest with bravado 24/7 and that's all metal was about until Korn came along, but Korn is too imature and trendy for me to champion them. I'll give them their proper respect for breaking new ground but alot of their stuff is boring and drawn out. Then System Of A Down Came along and showed me that you can channel aggression through metal and produce somthing very explosive. I thought Rollins was the only one who knew how to channel aggression properly. System Of A Dowm schooled him. System Of A Down schooled us all. Metal will never be the same, and as long as they countinue to make records, they will be the standard that everyone that has come out after them will be measured against. WAR? is so prophetic, it's scary. Ther is no filler on this album. From Daron's opening harmonic riff to Serj's singing of the word \\"Down\\" at the end it's hard to catch your breath or blink and more importantly it's not necessary.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|The plot is simple. A contract killer is in town (LA) for one night. Five targets. Five locations. He hijacks a cab driver and holds him hostage while he does his rounds. <br /> <br />Cruise as Vincent the killer expounds and philosophicizes on the ends of life to Max played by Jamie Foxx. The whole film is just that. Two strangers from different backgrounds, brought together by unforeseen circumstances and communicates with each other on a personal level. <br /> <br />What sets this movie apart from other conventional thrillers is the smart script and gritty, fly on the wall direction from Michael Mann. Mann, no stranger to the city of LA, paints a grimy picture of the city of angels. It's a dog-eat-dog world, filled with junkies, cops and drug cartels. This is easily Mann's best film in recent years. I didn't like Ali. It looks like a mess, Mann was being \\"miscast\\" as a director for that. He should have stuck to what he does best, urban crime thrillers (Miami Vice, Heat, Manhunter) <br /> <br />This 2-disc set is a revealation. Initially, I resented having the special features separated on another disc but from the first frame of the feature presentation, you can see where the space of the disc go to. The picture is excellent with the contrast and hues being distinct. Although the whole movie is being set at night, each character's face is remarkably sharp. I suspect that Mann might have shot the movie on digital.  <br /> <br />The extras are SOP. We have the obligatory interviews with the director and the stars. Also we have the making of featurettes and as well as an emphasis on the FX aspect of the movie. The trailers are however lacking. The trailers for The Bourne Supremacy and Ron Burgundy:Anchorman are included here, but Collateral's teaser or trailer is not included here. Weird, considering that Bourne Supremacy is released by Universal whereas Collateral is a Dreamworks/Paramound production.
B00009W0WM|5.0|For the Warner Brothers wartime melodrama it was supposed to be, \\"Casablanca\\" feels so much more significant and multi-dimensional, a timeless movie that combines political espionage, romantic intrigue and a clever wit against the broader conflict between democracy and totalitarianism. This is illustrated most memorably by the dueling anthems scene where the German Nazi song \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\" is drowned out by the French, who proudly and tearfully sing their anthem, \\"La Marseillaise\\". It's an unexpectedly powerful scene among so many wonderful moments, certainly enough to inspire Neil Simon to recycle it to comic effect in \\"The Cheap Detective\\", Peter Bogdanovich to send up another classic scene in \\"What's Up, Doc?\\" and Woody Allen to write \\"Play It Again, Sam\\" in tribute to the entire movie.<br /><br />Director Michael Curtiz had a strong track record of success before \\"Casablanca\\" (consider \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\", \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\" and \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\"), but this is clearly his career capper given the perfectly realized mix achieved of script, camerawork, music and cast. The screenplay written mostly by the Warners-bred Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip, along with Howard Koch, was apparently done in haste well after filming began, but you certainly can't tell from the seamless structure, memorable dialogue and plethora of classic lines. Arthur Edeson's striking cinematography and the legendary Max Steiner's musical score also contribute significantly. But of course, one needs to recognize the chemistry between two amazing legends, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Bogart fully captures Rick's cynicism, sentimental interior and ever-hardening moral code in his individually charismatic fashion. Bergman is so glowingly beautiful and affecting as Ilsa that there is no question why Rick continues to pine over her. It is both a shame and something of a relief that they never co-starred with each other again, as there was next to no chance that they could ever top their teaming here.<br /><br />Warner Brothers regular Paul Henried plays Laszlo, the third corner of this romantic triangle with his continental manner grounded by his character's selfless patriotism. Surrounding them is the best of the Warner Brothers backlot of character actors: Sydney Greenstreet as rival proprietor Senor Ferrari, Peter Lorre as a slimy black market dealer, Conrad Veidt as Gestapo commander Major Strasser, S.Z. \\"Cuddles\\" Sakall as the genial German headwaiter, and in particular, Claude Rains as the fey and amusingly corruptible chief-of-police Louis Renault. And of course, there is Dooley Wilson, who effectively plays piano-playing Sam and sings \\"As Time Goes By\\" with the perfect sense of nostalgic languor. It is pointless to go further into plot details as the story flows so flawlessly from Rick's Caf&eacute; Americain through a romantic haze of a flashback in Paris to its inevitable conclusion, which ironically was not so inevitable until the last minute. The ambiguity during filming probably added to the romantic tension since Bergman did not know with which leading man Ilsa was going to run off. Such is the stuff of Hollywood lore, and none, with the possible competition of \\"Gone With the Wind\\", seems to have as much of it as \\"Casablanca\\".<br /><br />The two-disc special edition package contains plenty of extras, some great, others disposable. The audio commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and film historian Rudy Behlmer are interesting for the individual perspectives both bring, though I kept wishing there was a survivor from the original production to provide authentic remembrances. On the second disc, the centerpiece is an 86-minute documentary (produced in 1988) recounting Bogart's career in surprising and often fascinating detail and hosted by a still striking-looking Lauren Bacall. There are some interesting bits like alternate takes of \\"The Big Sleep\\" and home movies taken during the filming of \\"The African Queen\\". There is another half-hour documentary, also interesting and again narrated off-screen by Bacall, on the actual making of \\"Casablanca\\".<br /><br />The extra disc also includes an abbreviated radio version of the movie from 1943 with the three stars, a fitfully funny Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon takeoff called \\"Carrotblanca\\", and a couple of intriguing deleted scenes from the actual movie, sadly without sound. The accompanying outtakes are hardly worth sitting through save for one priceless reaction shot of Bogart as he sits at the bar. There is yet a third documentary, not nearly as interesting as the other two but thankfully brief at seven minutes, which focuses solely on the scripted remembrances of Bogart and Bacall's son, Stephen, and Bergman's daughter, Pia Lindstrom. And certainly the most disposable extra is a rather worthless version of \\"Casablanca\\" taken from a TV series in the 1950's, which ends with an incongruous commercial for a GE iron. Regardless, this is a great package for a true classic and an essential addition to anyone's DVD collection.ur documentary, also interesting and again narrated off-screen by Bacall, on the actual making of \\"Casablanca\\".

B000660UN0|5.0|First of all, I loved Me & Mr. J. But still, I thought he could've done a better job, and he rectifies that by releasing \\"Sessions For Robert J.\\" Done after the band had been touring for a while, the band is concise they jam together great. There are even some solo accoustic performances by Clapton in the same hotel room where Robert Johnson recorded his historic recordings back in the mid '30s. Clapton has never sounded better than he does here. His guitar playing has consistently improved over the years, and so has his singing. The band is tight, and they jam with ease. I've been spinning this cd nonstop since I got it. I really like the versions of Sweet Home Chicago and If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day. This album just seems to be more of a jam-type session, like From The Cradle. And it's all the better for it. <br /> <br />Now, I must take an opportunity to mention Clapton's second guitar player. Many people have asked me who this guy was. His name is Doyle Bramhall II. Y'all may have heard that name before. His dad, Doyle Bramhall Sr., helped write many songs with the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan, particularly hits like Tightrope, The House Is Rockin', and Telephone Song. Doyle II has also played with Stevie's band Double Trouble and singer/guitarist Charlie Sexton in a band called the Arc Angels, which put out an outstanding cd in the early 1990s. Clearly, Doyle has the lineage to be great, and he is! Be sure to check out his cds: Jellycream and Welcome. You won't be disappointed. He's as good a songwriter as he is a guitar player. Marry You and I Wanna Be, which are from Clapton's and B.B. King's great collaboration Riding With The King, are his songs. You can hear them on Jellycream. Remember: if it's good enough for Clapton, it's good enough for you.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Could these Texas boys have ever predicted, way back in 1990, what a lasting impact this album would have on the metal scene? So many current guitarists have listed Dimebag Darrell Abbott (RIP) as an influence, and so many other classic metal bands were great friends with Pantera. It's not hard to understand why on this album... from the killer intro title track, to the groove of \\"Psycho Holiday\\", to the hard-hitting \\"Domination\\", and even the Iron Maiden-ish \\"Shattered\\". This album is metal with a capital M.  <br /> <br />However, the album's biggest curveball is the beautiful ballad, \\"Cemetary Gates\\". Starts off soft and amazing... who knew Pantera could pull it off? Then it gets harder, with an amazing solo, and great, haunting vocals... this is Pantera's \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". <br /> <br />Anyway, if you like hard-hitting, fist-in-your-face metal, this one's for you. <br /> <br />However, I also am using this space to pay respect to one of metal's best guitarists ever, Dimebag Darrell. A week later, I still can't believe what happened...  <br /> <br />On the morning of December 8, I was walking back to my bedroom for some reason when I overheard on the news about how a tragedy struck at a rock concert. That caught my ear. The newscaster mentioned that it was at a Damageplan concert. I knew that was Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul's new band, so I went back out to hear more. The newscaster said that they killed two and injured three, and one of them was guitarist Dimebag Darrell. Of course, she then went right into some other stuff, not telling what happened to him, as if it didn't matter. I frantically went back to my computer, to go on the internet, hoping like crazy that I would read something saying he was allright, in the hospital and expected to make a full recovery... but my stomach dropped when I saw the awful news on the internet... Dimebag Darrell was dead at 38. Truly it was a sad day for metal. <br /> <br />I was about 15 or 16 when I first got into Pantera. Being angry and loving hard music, it was a natural choice for me. I think I was 16ish when I first heard \\"Rise\\", and it blew me away. I knew I had to have that album (Vulgar Display Of Power)!! So I soon got it, and to this day, it remains one of my favorites. Damn, Dimebag was an awesome guitarist. He soloed and shredded like NO ONE's business. I still get that same awesome adrenaline rush listening to VDOP, and I always will. Not to mention this one, FBD, Live 101 Proof, et cetera. If those albums don't make you wanna go punch somebody in the face, ain't nuthin' gonna! <br /> <br />I know I can't possibly imagine the intense devastation that Vinnie Paul, Phil Anselmo, Rex Brown, and the Abbott family must be going through. Me and every other Pantera/Damageplan fan in the world has their backs 150%. My heart and condolences are with them, along with the families of the security guard that was killed, and the innocent fans that were killed. I was relieved to hear that Vinnie was okay, though. <br /> <br />So, the metal world mourns a big loss. Rest in peace, Dimebag Darrell, and thanks for the music, memories, and everything in between. <br /> <br />\\"Believe the word <br />I will unlock my door <br />And pass the cemetary gates...\\"
0676974120|4.0|As someone who has a lot of cookbooks, I must admit that I really do love this particular one.  I especially love the fact that she gives 2 recipes for roasted turkey, 2 recipes for ham's and many other wonderful culinary treasures destined to be traditional fair for many people.  The only reason why I did not give it a full 5 stars, is that in all honesty, Nigella Lawson did include recipes from her previous books.  Too many for my own liking, but on the other hand it did not deter from all the new recipes given.  Some of those recipes, like the Ham cooked in Coca cola included in book 1 and 3, did appear in this new installement, but it was modified enough to make it almost a brand new addition.  Other recipes, for example, I have compared the chocolate cake recipe given in book 3, and the new one of &quot;Feast&quot; and I have concluded that they are different.  So all in all, you are getting value in the pages.  I would deffinitly recommend it for people as gifts, or for themselves.<br />In response to the first review, I would like to quote the author of this book as saying &quot;My view on vegeterianism is much like my view on excercise, that it's all well enough and good just as long as someone else is doing it.&quot; (Please bear with me, as I'm relying on memory for this quote, so your more than welcome to look it up, I believe it was written in the first chapter of Christmas and Thanksgiving).  I think that line does a very good job in telling us why there are simply not that many vegeterian recipes (or so many meat recipes) in this particular book.  <br />Again, it's all about personal tastes.  I am looking foreward to trying to Super Juicy Turkey, gingerbread stuffing, chocolate gingerbread, etc.  Reading &quot;Feast&quot; really makes me enthusiastic about cooking, and really, isn't that one of the purposes of a good cookbook?
B00030EEOU|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the new album but the book this is packaged with is a bit disappointing. First thing you notice is missing is the lyrics to the songs. Then the contents, while interesting, will give you a headache trying to read. The words are in longhand and Bono must have failed penmanship. If you're a U2 fan, you'll still like it; and Fast Cars is one of my favorite songs on the album (surprised it wasn't on the regular album as it's stronger than a few of the songs on it)but I was hoping it would be filled with cool band photos, history of the songs etc...but alas, no. (though you can get all that info on the U2 website)
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is one of my most played cds, and is almos impossible to define. Let me start by saying i was not a big fan of either Sparta or At The Drive In and I love this cd, LOVE. Being a concept album it tells a rather intresting story, the main character, after being mangaled in some sort of accident attempts suicide, failing he goes into a coma, and upon waking finaly is succesfull in taknigk his own life. Give this cd a try, I am sure you will enojy it.
0312263120|3.0|Dan Brown is continuing to impress me.  I have read both Angels and Demons (3 stars) and The Da Vinci Code (5 stars).  I would continue to recommend this book to people who are fond of his writing style. <br /> <br />I believe the book had some technical imperfections.  I am kind of a technical guy, so I found somethings to be laughable, but nothing was so grotesque in mistatement that is ruined the book for me.  More technical people may just find it laughable and be more hung up on those details than I was.  In any case, the book is ultimately a good love story with some predictable highlights throughout the last 1/3 of the book.  <br /> <br />I was again (as in Angels and Demons) a bit disappointed by the ending.  Perhaps it was the somewhat predictive nature or perhaps it was the lack of a clear \\"moment of truth\\" that was not as predictably concluded. <br /> <br />Overall, good but still not up to his best.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Being a huge Tom Cruise fan, I bought this sight unseen. Cruise continues to pick projects that showcase his growth as one of our finest actors. THE LAST SAMURAI, MAGNOLIA, EYES WIDE SHUT, MINORITY REPORT, RAIN MAN, A FEW GOOD MEN, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and a film that has leaped into my top five films of all time, VANILLA SKY. (At the time, Cruise said it was his favorite film to date. You got that right.)<br /><br />I could have cared less about Jamie Foxx being in this. The fact that he was in this made me reconsider buying it. Comedian turned actor? Forget it. Okay, I was wrong. His performance proves he has the chops to become a great actor. Foxx is very good in this film. So why only three STARS?<br /><br />This film has everything going for it: great acting, beautiful cinematography, masterful direction, nice editing, great soundtrack, and some good action sequences. Even the dialogue, at times, is marvelous. BUT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SCENE IN THIS FILM THAT IS BELIEVABLE. Not one. As you move from scene to scene in this film you realize that every situation and set-up here is ABSOLUTELY IMPLAUSIBLE and TELEGRAPHED. None of this makes any sense. It's important to be able to suspend disbelief in a film like this, but I don't think anyone went past the first draft of the screenplay. Too bad. I guess everyone was excited about doing a Michael Mann film. I've seen this sort of implausibility from Mann before. I'm referring to the scene from HEAT when Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have coffee together. And the scene where Val Kilmer slips through the LAPD roadblock at the end of the film. But you overlook it because it's such a great film. Let's face it, Mann is known for doing macho male fantasy flicks, so you expect it going in. But the script for COLLATERAL is SO ABSURD that it makes it hard to enjoy the film.<br /><br />FOR EXAMPLE: At the start, Cruise, the hitman, makes a bag swap and passes through airport security by going down some secret stairwell fully armed. Sure he does. Foxx, the cabby, picks up Jada Pinkett, the beautiful prosecutor, at the beginning of the film and SHE gives HIM her phone number. What? An L.A. TEN? Not in this town. I live here. Not unless he owned a Porsche. What a guy!! Moments later, Cruise gets in the same cab for a night of murder, fun, and jazz. Later the prosecutor turns up on Cruise's hit-list and guess who has the number to call and warn her? That's right!! What a coincidence!! To quote from this movie, \\"L.A. is home to 17 million people who don't know each other.\\" The stars in this flick certainly do. After a victim falls out of a window onto the cab causing a very loud crash, Foxx and Cruise argue and hide the body in the trunk because now, Foxx is a hostage. Only one witness sees something, but he has \\"coke-bottle glasses\\" and the cops can't use the information. Very convenient!! A real hitman would have left the body right where it was. Evidence and all. Later, the cops find evidence of bloody glass at the scene anyway, so Cruise must have forgotten the dustpan and broom to fully cover-up the hit. He did use a waterbottle on the cab to wash off the blood. What a genius!! Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a police cruiser cherries the cab which is carrying Cruise, Foxx, and the dead body in the trunk. The patrolmen spot some blood on the windshield after Foxx tells them he hit a deer in South Central, and with  some suspicion are ready to open the trunk. (Remember, Cruise is supposed to be an ultra-intelligent hitman.) But, they get a \\"shots fired\\" call and have to leave in a hurry. Very convenient indeed!! But these moronic cops still find time to call in the damaged cab. These are very civic minded police officers taking time out from their busy night to phone the cab company!! Foxx's dispatcher calls and wants him to return the cab because the cops called in his broken windshield. Cruise grabs the radio and mouths off to the dispatcher. Some time later, because he's one shrewd hitman, Cruise escorts Foxx to the hospital to see his sick mother because he doesn't want Foxx to break his normal routine. \\"Someone may come looking for you.\\" What a professional!! At the hospital they get on the elevator with the cop who's investigating the murders. Phew!! That was close!! It's the same hospital where the murder victims are stashed. Another coincidence!! Are you buying into this yet? IT GETS WORSE. Foxx throws away Cruise's computer containing all his hit addresses. Darn it all!! A pro would have memorized them so there would be little or no evidence on his person. I'm thinking Chuck Bronson in THE MECHANIC. But the screenwriter wasn't. He'd also be tossing weapons. (And he certainly wouldn't use a cab driver to cover-up his hits.) So, being the unbelievably clever hitman that he is, Cruise gets Foxx to wander into the club of his Columbian drug dealing employer so Foxx can, get this, pretend that HE'S the hitman-for-hire and get the addresses that Cruise so unwittingly lost. (I wouldn't hire Cruise's character to rent out shoes in a bowling alley.) And Foxx steps up to the plate with some cool gangsta posing of his own and scores those elusive little addresses. Of course, Cruise just knew that he could act the part. Then, to top it all off, Cruise is surrounded in a nightclub by murderous drug dealers and cops, who have cordoned off the building. But, he still manages to make the hit and escape in the very same cab that the cops have been looking for. It's parked right out front. Your kidding, right? I wish I was. (groan)Ohhhhhh... On and on. Ad nauseam. I know 6th graders who are smarter movie goers than this!! This script is just DUMB. (That's what professional screenwriter's call amateur writing.)<br /><br />Michael Mann's best films are still THIEF, MANHUNTER, and HEAT.<br /><br />This film gets one STAR each for Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Michael Mann's amazing Los Angeles. Bubblegum action fans may like this one. I'm going to watch COLLATERAL again before I sell it, because it is beautiful to look at. I wanted to like this film. I really did. But the script is AWFUL. (Okay, I tried. I just can't get through it twice. Bleech!!)e escorts Foxx to the hospital to see his sick mother because he doesn't want Foxx to break his normal routine. \\"Someone may come looking for you.\\" What a professional!!

B00006F7S4|5.0|When I heard Beck play the song \\"Lost Cause\\" off his then recent<br />release \\"Sea Change\\" album on the Jay Leno show, I was pleasantly<br />surprised. Considering Beck's slick, Rock sound in the past this acoustic<br />oriented album showed another side or tremendous musical growth<br />from Beck. Something new and beautiful seemed to be brewing in<br />Beck's prodigal mind and I had to hear more. I was fortunate not long<br />after to catch him playing what seemed to be most of the songs off<br />\\"Sea Change\\" on a Friday night music program called Music Choice.<br />The entire album is quite noteworthy and the song that screams or in this<br />case confidently whispers masterpiece, would have to be \\"Round The Bend.\\"<br />This song carries the listener away, touches the spirit, soothes and calms with<br />it's melancholy blissfulness. I've always thought Beck was an exceptional and<br />versatile musical talent and \\"Sea Change\\" not only proves that without a<br />shadow of a doubt but it puts Beck up there with the great musicians with<br />the likes of Nick Drake, Jim Croce, Tim Buckley, and Don McLean. One<br />can't help make strong comparisons to the underrated but recently acclaimed<br />late Nick Drake in that he has the melancholy voice to match this introspective<br />style. \\"Sea Change\\" is one of those few albums that comes along once in a<br />great while and is the best album from anyone in many years, perhaps decades!<br />I know Beck is working on his recent album to be released sometime next year<br />and one can only hope(at least for another album) he doesn't *change* his<br />\\"Sea Change\\" course.<br />-Wayne J. Tirone
0679735909|4.0|Some of the learned reviews are better than the book.  Judging from the number of used copies available, I'd say that not everybody loved this book, but it should appeal to the literary reader.  The novel reminds me of Thomas Wolfe not only in that it combines poetry and prose but in that it seeks to include absolutely everything that happened.  The poetry is better in Wolfe; the prose better in Byatt.  The story line gives a strong boost to the book, but don't expect what you saw in the movie.  The movie handles the mystery much better, and it shows rather than tells the past story glimpse by glimpse.  If you like the parallel story of two romances, one present and one past, you'll also like Tears in the Rain and the novel Always, although Always has more action and more suspense.
0375703764|4.0|A great book, but certainly not for everyone. If you don't feel like taking the risk of actually having to interact with a book in a way that means more than turning pages, you're better without House of Leaves.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Interpreted in one way or another, \\"Donnie Darko\\" delves into the mind of this teenage boy to find a brewing abundance of nightmares and cynical analyzations. <br /> <br />It's not just good for it's characters, cinematography, and dialogue (all of which were nicely portrayed in their simplicity), but it causes one to consider the human condition. It made me think about concepts such as predestination and fate and the possibility of altering such destinies. Sure, this film is science fiction, but such factors should not- do not hinder the lasting effect of the film. You can't help but ponder existence. It's a hair's breadth from impossible to watch this film and not feel something stir within you. <br /> <br />This is a film best viewed without the threat of interruption. If you don't watch it in full, I guarantee that you will miss something, and will therefore not be able to form your own conclusion to the tale. What was the ending's purpose, what were the significances of certain events, and what exactly the movie was about can only be answered when you've experienced a thorough viewing.
B0006284JQ|1.0|I must say I find it rather pitiful artists claiming to be releasing a greatest hits record when they don't even have enough to fill 1/2 a cd. Given \\"...Baby One More Time\\",\\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\",\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" & \\"Toxic\\" were actual hits, where's the rest? I'll tell you where. NO WHERE! Those are her only true hits. Yes, she had some success with \\"Sometimes\\",\\"Crazy\\",\\"Lucky\\", & \\"Me Against The Music\\",but the hardly qualify as \\"Greatest Hits\\". So fine if you want to count them, so that's 8 songs, yet I still see 7 tracks that aren't even remotely 'hits'. These record execs are so dang money hungry, it's ridiculous. Don't waste your hard earned money people. If you want her hits it would take less than 15 minutes to download all four of them ;). I won't even go into her voice or lack there of. Go buy Megan Slankard's \\"A Freak Little Story\\" or Brandy's \\"Afrodisiac\\" or something good like that if you want your money to go to good use.
B000002KCC|5.0|After the smash hit 'After the Goldrush', the record company was itching to get their hands on another similar album.  However, after the recent heroin-related deaths of both roadie Bruce Berry and Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten, Neil was in no position to make a light-hearted sequel.  Instead he went out and, in a recording session where the alcohol flowed like water, recorded most of the tracks for 'Tonight's the Night'.  The album ended up being shelved for two years, deemed unpresentable to the public, and 'On the Beach', an only slightly more upbeat album, was released first.  In 1975, a much different version of 'Tonight's the Night' was released, with only a few cuts from that whiskey drenched version making the cut. <br /> <br />'Tonight's the Night' is, to me, the greatest album of Neil Young's career.  There is not one recognizable hit here and on first listen there doesn't seem to be anything special.  But when you actually sit down and listen it's hard not to be caught up first in the raw emotion behind many of the lyrics, then in the brilliant, laid back music.  Every single song is a classic, there is nothing even resembling filler.   <br /> <br />Part's 1 and 2 of the title song (really just different versions of the same song) of course bookend the album with a rememberance of Bruce Berry, immortalizing the roadie, whose job it was to go unnoticed most of the time behind the scenes.  It has the most straight forward lyrics of the whole album with Neil telling us how \\"it sent a chill up and down my spine...when I heard that he died.\\"  The song itself has a spine chilling effect, with the creepy intro and general scary feel of the whole song.  \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\"  seems at first like a lighthearted rocker, but when you realize the song (written by Danny Whitten) is about having to go into the city for a heroin deal, trying not to get busted, it takes on a whole new tone.  \\"Borrowed Tune\\" with it's sad opening harmonica and quiet pianoperfectly describes Neil's state of mind: <br />\\"I'm climbing this ladder <br />my head in the clouds <br />I hope that it matters <br />I'm having my doubts. <br />I'm singing this borrowed tune <br />I took from the Rolling Stones <br />Alone in this empty room <br />Too wasted to write my own.\\" <br />It really shows how hopeless things must have looked with his friends dropping like flies.  \\"Tired Eyes\\" describes a true story of a coke deal that went bad.  The buyers pulled out guns instead of money and shot four people, killing one.  This happened on Neil's ranch one night during a party and the dead man wasn't discovered until the next morning. <br /> <br />In the midst of all this depression, there are a few signs of light.  In \\"Mellow My Mind\\" Neil seems to take some comfort in girlfriend Carrie Snodgrass, singing: <br />\\"Baby mellow my mind <br />Make me feel like a school boy on good times\\" <br />Also the vocals on this song make it quite apparent how drunk he was during the recording session.  \\"New Mama\\" is a fantastic acoustic song written about Neil's newborn son, with great CSNY-esque harmonizing in the chorus.  In \\"Roll Another Number\\" it's clear that things have changed since the carefree days of the sixties and things aren't likely to be that way again: <br />\\"I'm not going back to Woodstock for a while <br />though I long to hear that lonesome hippy smile <br />I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day <br />No I don't think I'll be going back that way\\" <br /> <br />This is not an album for the casual fan.  I wouldn't make this my first Neil Young CD - \\"After the Goldrush\\" or \\"Harvest would be much better starters.  I would wait and not come to this album until you firmly have a foot in Neil Young territory.  For someone looking to become a hardcore fan, or just interested in learning more, I'd also suggest reading the biography \\"Shakey\\" as it's very, very good and will give you so many insights into the making of this album.
0553274503|5.0|This is a stunning tale told through the eyes of a mentally handicapped man named Charlie. Charlie has an I.Q. of 68 and his dream is to become smart. He wants to be smart so bad that he volunteers himself for an experiment to boost his I.Q. The experiment works and Charlie turns into a genius and is finally able to observe and understand the world around him. However, Charlie soon discovers that the experiment is not permanent and that he will eventually turn back into his old self. As Charlie's mental condition deteriorates, he races against time to answer many questions about his life. <br />This is a wonderfully developed story and I highly recommend it to everyone. It will change your outlook on the mentally handicapped and really make you realize the hardships that many of them endure. It is one of the best books that I have read in a long time and should not be overlooked.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I had the pleasure of going to see the Chili Peppers during this tour with great seats - I was dead center in the pit.  There couldn't have been more than twenty feet seperating me from the band.  Being only a casual RHCP fan, I was blown away by the awesome power of their live performance.  That remains the best concert I've ever been too.  And this DVD is a perfect way to revisit that experience again and again. <br /> <br />If you were also went to see them during that tour, this DVD is essential.  They were smart in that they played almost the same setlist and wore the same clothes even (most remarkably Flea's Skeleton costume - reminiscent of John Entwistle) so that for all intents and purposes no matter where you saw them this concert is almost exactly like the one you saw. <br /> <br />The Chili Peppers were full of great surprises here.  First of all, John Frusciante has new solo's for every song and he's in prime guitar god form.  His improvisations are brilliant, including the intro to \\"By the Way\\" which opened the concert and especially the extended solo after \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" will blow your mind.  I still recall my jaw dropping when watching him perform this live.  Also it's good to see they included his solo performance of \\"Maybe\\", a 60's pop love song, which comes right after \\"Scar Tissue\\" although it's not listed.  That was an odd and memorable part of the show I saw.   <br /> <br />The filmmakers were smart to film the concert from start to finish.  No breaks to hear short interviews from the band.  No 'Song Remains the Same' style movie clips.  Just pure unadulturated Chili Peppers goodness.  There are also some cool effects such as the still-motion, 180 degree, Matrix-style camera trick used to capture and accentuate Anthony Kiedis's crazy jumping around.  I also liked how they focused on the right people at the right time, so that interested guitarists such as myself could see the fretboard during many of Frusciante's solos.   <br /> <br />Overall there's nothing to complain about with this DVD.  It's the best live document of the Chili Peppers that you could hope for.  The only thing I would have liked (if only as a lark) is as an extra feature some footage of opening band French Toast, who came on before Queens of the Stone Age.  My friends and I had many laughs at their expense, especially when we realized the lyrics to one of their songs chorus's was \\"This is what I had for breakfast!\\"  Anyone who came early and saw them knows what I'm talking about.  Anyway, if you were at this tour you would do well to have this as a reminder.  And if you weren't at the tour, buy this to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers at their absolute best.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|First there was Complicated, then Sk8er Boi,then I'm With You. All great Hits.

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Measure by measure this album -to my mind- occupies a predominant place among the twelve greatest live rock albums ever recorded.<br /><br />The other eleven would be -without any specific order-: How the west was won , Made in Japan , Live at Leeds , Hendrix in Woodstock , Uriah Heep live , Humble pie performance ,Iron Butterfly live , Allman Brothers in Fillmore, Pink Floyd in Pompey , Woodstock and Cream live .<br /><br />The ravishing moods of all the band headed for that monster musician and living legend Ian Anderson are present in this historic performing .<br /><br />Consider Aqualung the best version ever recorded by them since its release , Thick is a brick is superb ; and so A new day yesterday , Crossed eyed Mary , Songs from the wood , Haunting girl ; Minister in the gallery or Too old to rock' n' roll.<br /><br />Thnks to Ian Anderson , Martin Barre, john Evan , Barriemore Barlow , David Palmer and John Glasscock for this album with out time and obviously a classic among the classics albums in the rock story .<br /><br />The transfer was glorious fortunately for that generation and the new listeners who will never be able to deny the virtues of that icon band of the last sixties which so many glories and good moments offered us .
B0002JJBZE|5.0|The second season, particularly the latter half, is when this classic series hit its creative peak.  The episodes were at a consistently high level with both the scripts and the acting at their best.  The scripts were thought provoking, including some written by Gene Roddenberry himself.  Humorous scripts (\\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\")were blended nicely with dark themes such as the Jack the Ripper derived episode \\"Wolf in the Fold.\\"  The interplay between Kirk, McCoy and Spock was at its height.  If you are going to get only one season of the original series, make it this one and avoid the grossly inferior third season.
B00030590I|5.0|This film may be disturbing for many people accustomed to the usual patterns of the Western vision about the meaning of the hero .<br /><br />Hero according the Greek meaning has nothing to do with this special hero.<br /><br />The difference is overclear. The hero in the West World works out under individual considerations . Even if you may argue the Heracles ' twelve works ,  the hero never acts under a collective sense .<br /><br />And this is the clue . The Oriental hero will act under a collective criterion :To unify the people and the land . But beware about this point ; the real hero never acts under any ideology because he does not know the rules of the game ; he is a nature force and his actions are out a rational concept . Consider the case of Sigfried in The Ring for instance : He dies precisely when he enters to a conventionalist world with rules and agreements ; those terms are nothing for him.<br /><br />That's is less than understandable for a hero who suddenly resurrected in China .<br /><br />Any other argument is invalid to justify this strange behavior. Every one of the rivals who fight with our hero know they are uncapable to reach the goal because they lack the noblesse and purity of spirit ; as they act under the passion , they know they are not the adequate messengers and obviously they accept involuntarialy he is the only one capable to show the King the hidden desire , the collective voice of that enormous community .<br /><br />The visual splendor illuminates the screen  all along the film .<br /><br />The highlights sequences of the movie are in the field when the yellow leaves are falling and swept by the wind in the female conflict and the other in the Palace under the green curtains falling .<br /><br />Yimou Zang is actually the most remarkable chinese film maker .<br /><br />Watch this amazing fable and convince by yourself the role of the hero has never been reach the throne ; hero's role goes beyond that goal . He is born to intend to change the world no matter how expensive be the prize . And the death is a fellow partner due it will be very hard for any one of us to find a hero writing his memories . His life is brief , his origins are always unknown and his fate  will never be the same of the common man .<br /><br />That is his bliss!e be the prize . And the death is a fellow partner due it will be very hard for any one of us to find a hero writing his memories . His life is brief , his origins are always unknown and his fate  will never be the same of the common man . <br />That is his bliss!
1563890410|5.0|In which our hero reveals that he may not be oh-so invincible after all.  In which he tries to undo a great wrong once performed on an innocent woman.  In which the legions of Hell itself are released into space and Lucifer decides to go into retirement.  And finally, this is a book in which a huge course of events has been begun simply because a brother and a sister have a quarrel.  \\"Season of Mists\\" is the fourth in the collected Sandman chronicles and as such it's an interesting story.  We get to see almost all the Endless siblings gathered together (save one) and we journey from Dreams to Hell and back again.  With this novelette it seems as though Gaiman is beginning to move away from the series' horror-story beginnings into a whole new realm.  It's a refreshing change of scenery.<br /><br />Destiny has called his siblings, Desire, Death, Dream, Delirium (formerly Delight), and Despair together after a visitation by the three sisters (the crone, the maiden, and the matron).  As a result of this meeting, Desire taunts Dream with the fact that he once sentenced an innocent girl to an eternity of Hell simply because she didn't want to stay with him.  Dream is initially angered by this accusation but when Death concurs with the usually malicious Desire, Dream has to face facts.  He has grievously wronged his once beloved Nada.  He anticipates great problems when he returns to Hell to rescue her, but is instead greeted with an empty world. Lucifer himself explains that he's given up the job and as punishment to Dream (who once bested him on his own turf) he gives his guest the key to Hell itself.  Suddenly every mythological god you can think of (Norse, Egyptian, manifestations of order and chaos respectively, etc.) is scrambling to get possession of that key.  Dream can only give it to one group and his beloved Nada is being held as a bargaining chip by one of the factions.  Smart stuff.<br /><br />There are some wonderful mysteries introduced here that we've not seen much of until this time.  For example, there seems to be a missing member of the Endless who, in this collection anyway, remains unnamed.  There are also two infant children born, both of whom have direct ties to the Dream lord.  One is a child of dreams, the other his former lover.  Either good or bad things may come of this.  I enjoyed the fact that characters from previous collections (like Hob, the man who lives forever and the ever malicious Cain with his schlimazel of a sibling Abel) make at least a token appearance in this book.  Gaiman doesn't forget past storylines or people.  It's part of what makes him such an interesting writer.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it's passable.  It does seem a little strange that despite the closeness between Dream and Death, she's only brought up his colossal mistake some ten thousand years after the fact.  But I loved the flow of ideas in this book.  I enjoyed the range of gods that come to feast with Dream and the variety of ways in which they attempt to reason with him.  There's a nice range of different artists in this collection as well, and their skills are honed perfectly with each and every story.  Maybe I found the brief odd tale about the schoolboy in the haunted dormitory a little out of place (why was Death wearing legwarmers?) but if you removed it I fully believe that \\"Season of Mists\\" would be near perfect.<br /><br />Some might call this collection simplistic.  Others might berate it for its scope.  But gol durn it, I like it.  I like almost everything about it.  It's just another great series of Sandman tales, reaching a little further into the mythos and getting a little more interesting each and every time.  A fine fun set.not seen much of until this time.  For example, there seems to be a missing member of the Endless who, in this collection anyway, remains unnamed.

B00006LLLN|5.0|What is there not to love about anyone who can produce quality music without drums?  The plain strings and twangs of Union Station perfectly compliment Alison Krauss's incredibly pure and unblemished voice.  Great songs and great harmony are found in every track.  And as an added bonus, this live CD comes with mixed in diversions into instrumental bluegrass courtesy of Union Station.  Don't worry if you like Alison but not bluegrass, this CD has all of her best songs, so its a deal either way.  Definitely buy this. Peace.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Finally a DVD package that is worthy of this Disney masterpiece, and one that takes you behind the scenes with the truly incomparable Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. <br /> <br />While they each made many memorable movies, this is one that really showcases their almost unique combination of talents. I seriously doubt that there was another couple in Hollywood who could have even done half the job that Dick and Julie did in this utter classic. <br /> <br />This is one of those rare movies that really is as good as you have heard. While I think it was Variety magazine at the time who described the English accents as 'lamentable', for me, as a former Brit, they almost add to the charm, guv'nor. <br /> <br />A cast made in heaven, stunning sets, costumes, impeccable direction and production, some of the best songs and dance routines you could possibly wish for - Van Dyke's sheer genius is a joy to behold - all add up to one magical experience that simply should not be missed. <br /> <br />Julie also worked closely with the brilliant Pamela Travers in order to do justice to the author's creation, and the two really hit it off. The results of her thoughtful collaboration are here to see and savor. <br /> <br />Whether you see the movie as Pamela's homage to the transforming power of the Feminine on the eve of woman suffrage, or just a stunning piece of solid family entertainment (and we could sure use a whole lot more of that, especially these days) Mary Poppins delivers beyond your wildest dreams. <br /> <br />It may be a no brainer to say this, but for more Julie, The Sound Of Music is a must, and for another Dick Van Dyke showcase (including a masterful, complex dance routine), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is also essential viewing. <br /> <br />Then of course, you should really watch the superb David Tomlinson and the divine Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks... sigh... so much brilliance, so little time... <br /> <br />This 40th anniversary (sheesh, I remember its original release) edition is a welcome boost for the Mary Poppins fans, and one that I simply cannot fault. Two absolutely magical people; one absolutely magical movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002IQMKM|5.0|This is a magnificent collection of this unique band's most popular songs. Sure there are omissions, but these tracks are representative of their most accessible music and almost every one is a classic.<br /><br />The opener, Love Goes To Building On Fire is a powerful song with an unorthodox arrangement and evocative imagery, whilst Psycho Killer is a prime example of David Byrne's innovative vocal style.<br /><br />The omission of The Big Country is a pity, but their version of Al Green's Take Me To The River from the same album remains fascinating. Another highlight is the cinematic Once In A Lifetime with its multi-layered rhythms and gripping vocals.<br /><br />Burning Down The House, And She Was and Road To Nowhere were huge hits, the last being very much like a flowing country ballad. And that is what made Talking Heads so special - their brilliant explorations of a wide variety of styles. In the process they extended the musical boundaries of rock and made an innovative contribution to the music of the punk revolution.
B0000507QH|4.0|What is it with middle aged professors anyway?[8-D] I have had the same kind of thoughts and reactions as this professor, but they remained fantasies. It took me one day of teaching, and I discovered how vulnerable these young women are. (My race didnt matter either), they just feel so indebted (guilt for something?) to us and our passion for teaching them. For me its a natural thing to do, for them it is a gift to them. Definitely a such thing as a mid-life trauma or crisis. I would have wanted this girl in the movie too, because a real crisis like this often breaks outside of the social contructs; hence the trauma or crisis. Americans truely have been spoiled by their myopic view of what men want and what is beauty, and that it matters in this particular situation. I must admit that I was struggling with some of my own inadequacies also, which are heightened at this age. Funny how even achieving ones' dreams cannot fully engage total personhood. We must be careful not to get sideswiped by what we think \\"success\\" is. Achieving ones goal is not the time to see that as \\"success\\" (its the journey not the destination-remember that saying?)and then let your guard down. Suggestion: Have human effort but not without humility through a spiritual connection that you see as greater than yourself! It has to become a practice-not a magic trick, but it helps me balance things. PS. Men often avoid the \\"attractive\\" ones because they hide their insecurities, but a young girl who needs someone to think she is attractive... an older male tells her she is... well, it happens.... a lot.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|1990's \\"Rust in Peace\\" found Megadeth undergoing another lineup change, only this one would stay together for a while, and was undoubtadly the best lineup the band ever had.  Joining Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson were guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza, and from the opening track on it is apparent that this was Megadeth at their very best and found the band stepping out of Metallica's shadow.  The vocals have been re-recorded, taking out the reverb and sounding crisper and cleaner than before.  Opening track and fan favorite \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\" sounds better than ever on this remastered edition of the album, along with \\"Hanger 18\\", \\"Take No Prisoners\\", \\"Lucretia\\", and \\"Tornado of Souls\\" sounding better than ever as well.  A few bonus tracks are included as well: demos of \\"Rust in Peace...Polaris\\", \\"Holy Wars\\", and \\"Take No Prisoners\\", along with a previously unreleased track entitled \\"My Creation\\", which are nice little bonuses.  While purists will say the original version of \\"Rust in Peace\\" is the real deal, this is definitely worth buying if you are a Megadeth fan and don't already own it, but if you do don't feel the need to shell out the cash for it.
B000286S8S|4.0|Listen, this is a great CD. Anyone who is in their late 30's to mid 40's knows that Van Halen is part of the bedrock of any head bangers record collection. My only problem with this CD is this. How in the #$%%!!! could anyone put a Van Sammy Hagar Halen song after Eruption? Any card carrying headbanger knows that the only proper song to follow Eruption is You Really Got Me. As long as we are splitting hairs here, the next song should be Ain't Talkin Bout Love. Other than this single incident of blasphemy its a great CD. But what would you expect from corporate @#$% holes
B0002EXH4A|4.0|Megadeth's follow up to their highly influential \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" was an enigmatic album when first released in 1988, with frontman Dave Mustaine noticibly more interested in controled substances than songwriting (\\"502\\" has some of the worst lyrics to ever appear in a Megadeth song), but on it's own \\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\" is still a more than solid metal album, and now this newly released remastered disc finds the production quality cleaned up and sounding better than ever.  \\"Set the World Afire\\" sounds better than ever, while the cover of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\", along with \\"Liar\\", \\"Mary Jane\\", and \\"Hook in Mouth\\" still sound awesome.  Oh yeah, there's a little song on here called \\"In My Darkest Hour\\", which many Megadeth fans consider one of the best songs in the entire catalogue, complete with a new acoustic intro.  The bonus tracks, which include remixes of \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\", \\"Set the World Afire\\", \\"Mary Jane\\", and \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" are almost identical to their original counterparts with some different tempos and more riffage, but they are a nice little bonus.  All in all, \\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\" may not be the best piece of material to come from Megadeth, but it still manages to pack a punch, even to this day.  Just like the other Megadeth re-releases, don't feel the need to shell out the cash for them if you own the originals, but for new fans now is your chance to hear Megadeth better than ever.
1573226521|5.0|when the first time i read about this book i'm really cerious about what is going on in this story. a lot of things which i learn from this book that i can improve my english because i'm not native speaker at all. this book also i can improve my grammar and learn some of new vocabulary so i think this book is excellent. <br /> <br />thanks.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|1992's follow up to the classic \\"Rust in Peace\\", \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" found Megadeth vast commercial success.  This remixed and remastered version doesn't sound too different from the original version, but if you don't own it already I strongly consider picking this up.  It's not the thrash classic that \\"Rust in Peace\\" was, and this signaled Dave and co. toning down their sound, but \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is by far Megadeth's most accomplished album.  Opener \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" is a concert favorite, while singles \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" and \\"Sweating Bullets\\" are fan faves that helped fuel Megadeth's mainstream rise.  \\"Architecture of Aggression\\", \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\", \\"This Was My Life\\", and the title track are excellent songs, all fueled by Mustaine's sneery-voiced lyrics and amazing guitar work.  As a bonus, this remastered disc includes the previously unavailable in the U.S. \\"Crown of Worms\\", along with demos of the title track, \\"Symphony of Destruction\\", and \\"Psychotron\\", all of which are nice little bonuses making this even more worthy of picking up, but only if you don't already own the original.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I loved this CD, it really catchy and upbeat, just like Britney's other albums, but then it also has a serious side to it. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the content of the songs. I am only 16 andI grew up listening to Britney, but the fact is, when my friends and look back and our really young years (5-11),and listened to music like the Spice Girls, backstreet boys, nsync,etc, we were like I CAN\\"T BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY SUNG THESE LYRICS, danced to them and had a good time with them. Tht thing is, about 70% of the songs were about or related to sex. Britney's albums (although a bit milder in her younger days) is all about sex. She talks about hooking up, masturbating, and just having sex in general. I think that since she has such young fans she should think about things like that, although I also think that parents should have some control. But all in all I'm trying to say, this album was defintly not meant for her younger listeners, but it was an excellent album. Its too bad though that Britney has decided to take a break after marrying Kevin Federline.
B00004KD1A|5.0|A good percentage of Gallagher fans will agree with me that Rory's magic was most evident during his live performances and related live recordings. \\"Stagestruck\\" is less blues-tinged than his other live efforts. This album is fueled by the energy of rockers like \\"Shinkicker\\", \\"Moonchild\\" and \\"Bad Penny\\". The version of \\"Last of the Independents\\" is probably worth the price of the CD alone. His guitar work is ambitious and emotional. I recommend all of Rory's live work, but this is my favorite.
B0002I664Y|4.0|I found this disc (the VINA Distributor brand) at a discount clearence type store for $2.99. I had an OK full screen copy of One Eyed Jacks, but it had washed out color, and bad sound (I got it at a dollar store). This disc has Brando in profile on the front with some bad cut-and-paste clip art playing cards, the jack of spades, and the jack of hearts. Both have some digital flames on the top edge. There is \\"***Leonard Maltin\\" under the title, and \\" Never Double-Cross A Partner!\\" in some stupid looking font. This disc is in widescreen letterbox (not anamorphic) and claims on the box to have Dolby Digital sound. It is the cleanest picture of this movie I have ever seen. My other copy has scratches in a lot of scenes, this one has no scratches that I could see. The sound was very clear, and had no hiss or pops, like the other one. There are no features exept a chapter menu. A lot of reviewers on Amazon for this Awesome movie say that the disc they bought is bad, but never give the name of the distributor. I got lucky I guess, two DVD's only $3.99 invested and I got a good one.  <br /> <br />Movie = Ten Stars (out of Five) <br /> <br />DVD = Four Stars (out of Five)
B00005JNSK|5.0|I love the fact that Johnny Depp is playing Willy Wonka, I am sure Robin Williams would have been great 10 or 15 years ago, but not now. <br />With Tim Burton directing and Johnny Depp acting how could you go wrong? <br />Johnny Depp is on a roll and I don't think that it will stop any time soon, everything he touches lately has turned to gold and I can not wait to see how Burton and Depp will expand on the Chocolate Factory story, I have this crazy feeling that it is going to be GREAT!!!!
0972169504|5.0|After taking quals .. I kind of had this little stress out session and felt a little depressed.. (who can explain why??) Anyway.. this book was just what i needed.. I keep it on my desk when I am working and open it to any page and find the humor in this stage of my life...   I have showed the book to so many people and they have had the same result.  One of my favorites is the one where someone new is being introduced and one of the characters asks 'What is the your dissertation topic?\\" and another smacks him and says \\"You might as well ask a woman her weight...!\\" I think this should be a gift for any grad student you know... at first I was worried that the Comp Sci twist on the comic would not be relevant to my phd experiences in education, but it is very relevant and great to know others question the sacrifices of graduate school everyday.
0596007124|4.0|It's rather personal (review), so please do not complain that you think other way. I don't care, really. ;-) <br /> <br />I was very impressed with this book, as with all \\"Head First\\" series. Probably it's one of the best books where general design patterns explained very good, with good examples and in a very funny way. but, I should say that this book was a bit boring for me. I am comparing it with \\"Head First EJB\\", and really think that \\"... Design Patterns\\" does not look that interesting as \\"... EJB\\" was (for me). <br /> <br />The most boring things were \\"talks between master and student\\". They were pretty ugly, and not very informative. <br /> <br />What else? I am not sure that not-including source code for additional patterns (Bridge, Memento, etc. - I am talking about patterns at the end of the book) is a good idea. I know at least five people, who are better in learning \\"design pattern idea\\" from code, not from plain text (even if it's very good). So, I just think that this is just tiny \\"minus\\" for this book. <br /> <br />Also, I think that including part about RMI programming (in Proxy pattern chapter) isn't good idea. This wastes too big part of the chapter, and really not necessary. We all (we == readers) understand that this is book for \\"easy understanding\\" but not for just newbies in everything. Besides, Proxy pattern is a pattern, but not the only way for RMI-based code interaction! <br /> <br />I wish that every pattern would be explained with it's own example from scratch. This book except you to read it from the very beginning, this way you will understand it perfectly well. But in case if you'll just open it in the middle and will find their some pattern, you will see their links to prev. pages, dealing with some things. I am not saying it's bad -- I like reading books from cover to cover, but just it would be more helpful as simple manual if it would have the thing I am talking about! <br /> <br />To crown it all, I should report that I am giving8.5/10 points for \\"Head First Design Patterns\\". For \\"Head First EJB\\" I can fairly give all 10/10! <br /> <br />Important!!! I am not telling this book is bad. It's perfect! Very-very good! As I said - almost the one of the best which exists in this topic area. It even worth at least (2 * IT'S PRICE) :-)  <br />It just has few \\"minuses\\", which of course will be fixed by authors in future editions. ;-) I am sure! <br /> <br />This book is good in understanding design patterns. But not in architecting applications.
0553212443|5.0|I really enjoyed reading A Christmas Carol. I've heard the story many times before, but this was the first time I have read the full novel, and I'm very thankful that I did. It is a great book, full of vivid descriptions, sybolism, and extremely important life lessons. It's a reall page-turner, and it's one of the few books I've read that I've had a hard time putting down.

Every songs in this album are absolutely fabulous and for those who have bought a Christina Aguilera album must kenw that she got a great voice!

B000002I25|5.0|The Doors never got better than their first album. All the right elements are here. Jim's got the usual poetry going, Ray's Vox organ sounds best, Robbie's blowin' off some hot licks and exotic stylings, and John keeps the jazz fill comin'! Now THIS is rock & roll, man. <br /> <br />Break On Through: High energy rocker: just what you need. Live version have better guitar parts, but the simple charm of the original makes it...well...original! <br /> <br />Soul Kitchen: Cool organ, great lyrics, and one of the coolest pickin' solos ever. <br /> <br />The Crystal Ship: Beautiful and eerie. Sounds like funeral music. Of course, it's about drugs <br /> <br />Twentieth Century Fox: Love the title. This one a classic swingin' sixties tune. The guitar is a bit recycled from Sou Kitchen, but why complain? It's a great song! <br /> <br />Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar): You'd think German opera and acid rock wouldn't mix, but they do. If you're lookin; for a fun Doors song, this is it. <br /> <br />Light My Fire: Not only their best song, but one of the best rocks songs ever. It's got the best organ solo of all time, hot guitar solo also, a drum beat that never slows, and a repeating bass line that's hypnotic. And Jim's voice is great. <br /> <br />Backdoor Man: Howlin' Wolf should be proud. They would do this live a lot, but the original is the best. Blues magic all the way. <br /> <br />I Looked At You: Classic happy sixties song with a hot little organ break. Of course, the Doors had to give it a minor key part! <br /> <br />End of The Night: The weakest song, but it's not terrible. Teh organ is creepy and the part where it gets goin' finally is good. <br /> <br />Take It As It Comes: Two fine organ breaks fill this little minor key classic. That's all you need to know. <br /> <br />The End: I won't even begin to describe this 11-minute epic. You'll have to listen yourself. All I'll say is it that it blows everything away. There's some force to it that makes unbelievable, but you have to believe it. You have to. <br /> <br />This is one of rock's finest albums, and the best of California acid rock. You better get it, before it's the end.
B0006284JQ|5.0|If you are a Brit fan, you probably have all of these songs already, except for the three unreleased ones and the AWESOME bonus CD. My Prerogative is great and fun and so are the other 2 songs (nothing special, mind you, just fun pop music) but the bonus disc is just great because you get to hear songs we all know and love turned out a little differently. Sick of Toxic? Now you can listen to it in a whole new way. The Chris Cox megamix is going to show up on cheerleading and danceline competitions, guaranteed. This CD is awesome for Britney fans, probably no one else would even think twice.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Okay. So this movie has its moments. Very magical characters in a whimsical setting... BUT when you put all that fluff aside, the Dad in this movie isn't anything more than a big pompous windbag. The father in this movie just reminded me of all those people that I've bumped into that brag about the same unbelievable things that they have or have done... yet everyone knows that they are just like me and you... boring slobs. For example, when the father blantantly steels his son's thunder at HIS OWN WEDDING! It just makes me cringe. He was no hero. Just an daft old man with a wild imagination.
1564029654|5.0|we have gotten this book from the library several times.  my 4 and 2 year olds love this book, as does their mom.  my 4 year old is particularly sensitive and cries at a lot of movies and books, but this one has never upset her (referring to a reviewer that found the book disturbing).  on the contrary, i think the book reassures the young reader that mommy does always come back, just like she said she would. <br />the illustrations are beautiful and you just want to hug those little owls, especially little Bill. <br />thumbs up!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|As a major Beatles fan I gotta say I'm pretty impressed with this compilation.  While I don't feel it does a particularly great job at reflecting upon their career as a whole, it still does have a lot of terrific songs that defined an entire era of music.  It's a terrific introduction piece for someone just getting into the Beatles.  For instance, I bought it for my sister on her birthday and she loved it - prompted her to get out there and buy all the albums!  So, for that purpose, it deserves 4 stars.  Everyone's gotta start somewhere!  This just makes it a little more easier for most people starting out to pick WHERE.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|An epic sci-fi phenomenon began in 1966 when the first season of \\"Star Trek\\" began to broadcast on U.S. televisions.  Created by the legendary writer Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991), the series was intended to run for five years detailing the missions of the mammoth starship known as the U.S.S. Enterprise, which was only one of several starships that were part of the United Federation of Planets' Starfleet.  Unfortunately, the series was prematurely cancelled after only three complete seasons in spite of efforts of Gene Roddenberry, letter-writing campaigns conducted by fans to keep the show alive and 5 Emmy Award nominations.  Ironically, it was only six weeks after the final third-season episode was broadcast (6/3/1969) that astronauts Neil Armstrong and 'Buzz' Aldrin became the first human beings to ever set foot on an extraterrestrial world, Earth's moon, on 7/20/1969.  Then, instead of being forgotten after cancellation, in syndication, \\"Star Trek\\" began to rise in popularity in the early 1970's to such an extent that Paramount Pictures began toying with the idea of resurrecting the show.  Instead, following the extremely successful 1977 sci-fi blockbuster film \\"Star Wars\\" (written and directed by George Lucas), Paramount Pictures did resurrect the show in the form of several big-screen films beginning in 1979.  With a new generation being introduced to the fantastic universe created by Gene Roddenberry, more \\"Star Trek\\" television series were created.  In total, there have been six \\"Star Trek\\" television series (5 live-action, 1 animated) and ten big-screen films; but all of them owe their thanks not only to Gene Roddenberry, but to the original \\"Star Trek\\" series cast and the many fans that kept the original show in syndication long after it was cancelled. <br /> <br />The main original \\"Star Trek\\" series characters of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Lt. Commander/Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard H. 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999), Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Lt. Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Keonig from 1967-1969), Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney from 1966-1967) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) have become an inseparable part of Americana.  Together, they starred in 79 broadcasted episodes: 29 in the first season, 26 in the second season and 24 in the third & final season.  The show's unaired pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\" (which starred a nearly completely different cast), was recycled during the show's first season as part of the two-part episode \\"The Menagerie\\".  Guest stars that appeared on one or more episodes include (but are not limited to): <br />* Joan Collins (in the only Emmy Award-winning episode, the first season's \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\"). <br />* Roger C. Carmel (1932-1986, in first-season episode \\"Mudd's Women\\" and second-season episode \\"I, Mudd\\"). <br />* Ricardo Montalban (as Khan Noonian Singh in first season episode \\"Space Seed\\", a role he reprised in the 1982 film \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn\\"). <br />* Mark Leonard & Jane Wyatt (as Spock's parents, Sarek & Amanda, in second-season episode \\"Journey to Babel\\", roles they reprised in several big-screen \\"Star Trek\\" films). <br />* Diana Muldaur (in second-season episode \\"Return to Tomorrow\\" and a different character in third-season episode \\"Is There No Truth in Beauty\\"). <br />* Teri Garr (in second-season episode \\"Assignment: Earth\\"). <br /> <br />Originally, when Paramount Pictures first released the original series of \\"Star Trek\\" on DVD in the 1990's, they did so on 40 DVD's, with 2 episodes per DVD.  The full retail cost to own all 40 DVD's was enormous.  Then, starting this year, Paramount Pictures started to re-release the original series in three DVD boxed sets (one set for each season, about 8 DVD's per set) at only a fraction of the cost of the previously released 40-DVD set.  Hence, being able to purchase all three season boxed sets together is still a huge bargain.  Therefore, for being a fantastic TV series that started a phenomenon that continues through to this day and for a great price, I rate the complete \\"Star Trek: The Original Series\\" set of three box sets with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  If you, or anyone you know, doesn't yet own any of the \\"Star Trek\\" boxed sets, this set of all three original series boxed sets would make a fantastic gift!
0451169514|5.0|Sure, its size is intimidating, but this book is absolutley fabulous! It found it among one of the greatest books I have ever read. I was afraid of clowns at first, but gradually, I got over that fear when I encountered Pennywise in this book. The \\"horror\\" is not so much the clown himself, but that fact that he is everyone's worst nightmare! <br /> <br />Reading \\"IT\\" can be boring at times, and the chapters are broken up into several \\"mini-segments.\\" But it isn't too bad. The characters are so real and believeable, it's like reading about yourself! I recommend this book to anyone (over the age of 13). It can be a little scary, especially when read at night...oooo! <br />
0375507256|5.0|I picked up this novel in a bookstore in Canada, and was struck at first by the great design of the book, then by the 'concept'; six stories interweave with each other throughout history. You get the first half of each 'novella' in the first part of the book, then wrap around to their conclusions in the second half. The writing is terrific and really captures the different styles/language of the varied characters. I absolutely recommend this book as a great escapist adventure, but also with smart ideas about history flowing into the future and where that leaves us in the present.
0060512806|5.0|Yep, It's long.  <br />Not everyone will love it; not a problem. <br />Dan Brown? Too simple, transparent, obvious . . .  <br />I hated finishing the book, I felt like I was letting go of something that had come to mean a lot to me. <br />I have passed my copy of the book to 4 friends already, <br />every one of them has felt similarly. <br />Great Job, Neal!
B00005AQE8|5.0|this album is very good, and contains many of the songs featured on  \\"2 pac : greatest hits [2cd]\\". the second cd is not quite as heartfelt, but the first cd is definetely full of classics. the second cd contains the songs picture me rollin and another few classics in the beginning but i noticed a drop in quality right at the end of the second cd. out of respect for tupac, 5 stars is awarded to this amazingly influential talent.
B00005R24K|5.0|\\"The Evil Dead\\", a low-budget horror film directed by the great Sam Raimi, and staring the \\"amazing\\" Bruce Campbell, is by far my favorite horror films of all time. Even though the acting and stuff was really bad, you have to admit that alot of the effects where really good for there time. The story begins when five college friends are traveling up to an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere(literally).When they arive there, they find this recorder with incantations of an ancient book of the dead.On the recording when a certain spell was said, this awoke demon spirit , that would stop for nothing.One by one the colledge kids are possesed and/or killed. Ash(Bruce Campell) plays the hero and takes them out armed with a shotgun and ax. In the end he kills it, but the ending of this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat getting you ready for the sequel. If you like extremely gorey movies, this a must see.
B00029LNHS|1.0|the quality of the beats in very few of the songs are good. the group makes numerous attempts at trying to be hiphop with the woo woo woo stuff everynow and then. this is THE worst audio cd i have ever heard in my entire life; i listened to less than half of the cd and couldnt stand it anymore after the \\"retarded\\" song. yeah and i dont care if they are talking about getting high, all of these songs are bad, period. never buy this cd unless you want to regret it for the rest of your life until you perish.

0393317552|5.0|I read _Guns, Germs and Steel_ in tandem with two other books: Robert Wright's _NonZero_ and Howard Bloom's _Global Brain_. The three books together have led for me to an epiphany about human society, and our relationship to the rest of the natural world.<br /><br />I was taught in grade school, high school and college to view human history as something anecdotal and essentially humanistic in nature, intrinsically separate from the world of science, physics and natural history. But these three books made it clear, in their different but overlapping perspectives, that the study of human societies is merely the study of a kind of relatively complex natural system. Human beings interact with the geography, ecology and energy systems of the planet in a way not essentially different from any other large population of mammals might.<br /><br />The 21st century seems to be emerging as a century of synthesis. Barriers between the physical and social sciences; between sociology, biology, and neurology; and the environmental sciences are falling.<br /><br />Dr. Diamond's book should be required reading in high school, and the synthesist approach of Edward O. Wilson should be taught as well. Things that never made sense to me as I was taught by conventional lesson plans and the standard texts, primarily about the ascendance of the West, make perfect sense in the light of Diamond's ecological perspective.<br /><br />I am convinced that we are poised to make great breakthroughs in the social sciences. We will do so once we acknowledge that human beings comprise merely another kind of adaptive and successful multicellular life form. Like any complex system, prediction of particular details about human society may prove outside our grasp. But do we attempt to predict the movement of particular ants in a given ant hill? Broad patterns about our behavior and relationship to the universe will nonetheless begin to emerge, as we allow ourselves to see our connection to the matter, energy and life systems of the rest of the universe.<br /><br />As this worldview develops, new troubling questions emerge. If human beings have, as Diamond says, been subjecting each other to wholesale slaughter for tens of thousands of years, what becomes of the guilt of the West in our extinction of the Indian cultures of the western hemisphere? If human beings, the original Native Americans, 12,000 years ago hunted all the large mammals of the Americas to extinction, what does this say about our Romantic notions about the \\"noble\\" American aborigines and their supposed respect for all life? What of free will and social responsibility, when every human society seems to act similarly under similar circumstances?<br /><br />There appears, in the past 50,000 years, to be no shortage of terrible violence of man against man and against other life forms. No human race or culture seems to have a monopoly on or exemption from violence, oppression, and self-defeating behavior. We seem to act in an \\"enlightened\\" fashion only when we can afford to do so, when the economic gains from that behavior are clear, or when there is some status to be gained.<br /><br />At what point do human beings stop reacting to the environment, and begin planning ahead, plotting a future with vision?ter, energy and life systems of the rest of the universe. <br />  <br />As this worldview develops, new troubling questions emerge.

078324228X|1.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and was duped into believing the lies and fabrications it peddled.  It's great fiction, but not a single bit of it is based in fact or reality.  I wish I could sue the creators of this propaganda so I can get the money back I spent on it.  Please don't waste your money on this anti-American trash.  It's sole purpose is to further degrade our trust in our government and perpetuate the blacks-as-victims and whites-as-persecutors storyline of the leftist lunatic fringe. I suggest you do a simple internet search and learn the truth about this piece of human garbage called Rubin Carter.
068987474X|5.0|This sounded fun and i saw an Oprah show about it.  I'm not dating but thought i'd read it for entertainment.  It is great!  I wanted to go out and buy copies for all my friends so we could laugh about how honest it is.  (and trust me sometimes it's so honest that you want to think it isn't about an experience you had or isn't true)
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Death metal-heads must proceed with caution!  It's simple to say that any hint of death metal within this album is quite scarce.  (Although, I invite anyone who can draw some similarities between the two, for my knowledge of death metal is extremely slim.)  The actual name of the band could run the risk of throwing people off, but there is one glaring asset that could draw attention: Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age.  Yeah, he's in there somewhere, although not a prominent figure within the recordings. So, drop your expectations of another page in the history of QOTSA. <br />If you take a slab of super-fuzzy and messy stoner rock (like Fu Manchu), slice it into cleaner cut versions and then dip it in some country and blues sauce you would get something like Eagles of Death Metal.  The sometimes-falsetto lead vocal, Jess Hughes, locks right in to the garage rock sound, giving their sound a cutesy and devilish attitude.  Along with all that said, they've also brought back the whole `one more time!' song style, stopping the song, and then drop the beat for another time around....and then maybe just one more time after until you forget, no matter how many times listened, where the song ends.  (There's a slight overuse of this going on, but it's pretty harmless.) <br />\\"I Only Want You\\" kick starts the album right at the beginning, throws you into that ego-bloated state of mind.
B00004W55E|5.0|It's no secret, Rachelle is by far my ALL-TIME FAVORITE. This woman is truly a continual source of inspiration. Recently, I had the GREAT pleasure of seeing her (LIVE), once again, and as usual, she left me (and, everyone else) utterly transfixed. We've heard it, before, but I'll say it again, her gift is ASTOUNDING! You haven't lived unless you've experienced 'THE VOICE', in (real-time). \\"Individuality (Can I Be Me?)\\", although released 4 years ago, remains a priceless, wealth of creative autonomy. 2005 will mark the unveiling of something even greater...A double-CD, entitled: \\"Free, Black & Live\\", which will be distributed on Rachelle's very own label, Evolutionary Records! <br /> <br />God Is A Good God...YES HE IS! ;)
B000002UAF|5.0|which was quite a rarity for the early to mid-1960's.  As folks can see with \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With The Beatles\\" (or \\"Meet the Beatles\\" as it was originally called), solo singers and groups back in those days either covered the earlier rock and roll tunes or they simply sung a songwriters composition.<br /><br />Lennon and McCartney really showed the world that they were serious musicians who were here to stay.  Remember, this album was released right in the middle of the hysteria that was Beatlemania, when the press already wrote them off as the latest bubble gum pop sensation whose bubble was ready to burst at any given second.<br /><br />The movie itself was a spoof of what they went through in those days complete with their characteristic charm and witty asides.  The soundtrack is a great addition to the movie.<br /><br />The Beatles are God divided by four.  They are the alpha and the omega of music.
B00009QG73|5.0|Far from being a \\"nostalgia\\" tour, the show itself was definitely a \\"must-see\\", esp. the venues they were playing in (mostly theaters).  <br /> <br />Fortunately, more Roxy Music footage exists (The High Road's on DVD but somewhat tricky to find, but get it!), Musikladen, and a couple of videos Brian had put out in the 90s that had solo and Roxy, but they really did a great job with this one. Even though he's older and not hitting the notes he did 20 years ago, it's not all that noticable.  <br /> <br />Is it going to warrant repeated viewings and listenings? Absolutely. It even has closed captioning.. But I would recommend the live CD from this tour as well, taking tracks from different shows (or recommend for the company to combo package it), as \\"If There Is Something\\" is on there and not on here and a better version of \\"More Than This\\".   <br />
0767830555|5.0|I realize a lot of people haven't seen this movie, so I'm not going to talk about it too much. I simply want to encourage anyone that hasn't seen it to take a chance and watch it. Sure, you may hate it and decide you've wasted 2 hours, but that's a small price to pay. What's worse is holding off seeing this classic. I'll go ahead and say it's one of my top 5 favorite films: It's one of my top 5 favorite films. <br /> <br />Scorsese takes a real sweet approach to this one. Travis Bickle (Deniro) is just a great character that benefits even more from the way Scorsese zeros in on him. The slow pace of the flick allows for some excellent plot development. Some might argue that this is boring. Don't listen to them. The movie should have you sucked in from the start. The dark, gloomy feeling, the mesmorizing jazz score and the loneliness that is Travis Bickle is fascinating stuff. I've seen this a few times and I can't emphasize how awesome the character of Travis is enough. <br /> <br />So I guess all i'm trying to say is \\"Definitely get this!\\" At the very least bring yourself to see it when it comes on a movie channel or something.
B000056HOZ|4.0|First: They should've waited until \\"The Rising\\".  <br /> <br />Second: Bruce has pro-shot footage dating back to 1972-1973. Starting it at 1978 with \\"Rosalita\\", running through \\"Born in the USA\\" and then \\"Born to Run\\" at the end, not to mention a mid-90s \\"Hungry Heart\\" promo on the second. The continuity is kind of wacky.  <br /> <br />There's a whole show filmed for \\"No Nukes\\". There's \\"Austin City Limits\\" (which no one can find). There's 1975 footage at the Roxy in LA, and a BBC shot show at the Hammersmith as well as other shows that have been circulating on bootlegs. The Neil Young \\"Bridge\\" concert. The Barcelona video's great, but the marathon shows he used to do should really be out there for all of us to see...  <br /> <br />Once Bruce started doing videos, he wound up getting top-name directors like Brian DePalma, John Sayles,Jonathan and Ted Demme. A lot of them are memorable and beautifully shot, but a lot of the \\"Born in the USA\\" footage just makes you wonder why he hasn't put out one of the shows on DVD. You see a bit of E Street history, including the era where he ditched those guys for a while, then working with them on \\"Murder Inc.\\". \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\" and \\"Beautiful Disguise\\" have Bruce singing live to a backing track, very unusual.    <br /> <br />Bruce's fans will love this, but they'll love it more if they put out some of the footage that made people enchanted with his shows.
B000002U8G|4.0|Pink Floyd's Meddle would bring the band out of the funk they were in after Syd Barrett's departure from the band during the recording of the A Saucerful of Secrets album. Although the band would show flashes of brilliance on their next few albums, it was on Meddle where their vision came together and would lead to the overwhelming success of their most popular works Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall.<br /><br />The album starts out with the instrumental \\"One Of These Days\\" which is the most popular track here. Led by the driving rhythm section of Roger Waters and Nick Mason, Rick Wright's spooky organ flourishes, and David Gilmour's moody lead work, it has become of one their most enduring songs and has been a staple of their live show for many years. \\"A Pillow Of Winds\\" is a great track and clearly a prelude to the sound that would comprise their future releases. \\"Fearless\\" with its pretty acoustic guitars and Gilmour's soft vocals along with its snippets of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" is an excellent track and one of their most overlooked. \\"San Tropez\\" is also a strong track carried by Wright's melodic piano lines and Gilmour's playing sounding Hawaiian-like. The track \\"Echoes\\" may be the band's best example of space rock, for better or worse. The first half of the track is great and features some great interplay between the band members. But once the studio effects kick in around the 11-minute mark, the track tends to get boring. Cutting some of this out would have made the song more interesting while still maintaining the solemn mood they were shooting for. The album's remaining track \\"Seamus\\" is a little blues song which is destroyed by its insertion of a howling dog. Overall, Meddle is pretty good and is actually underrated when compared to the rest of their catalog. It's definitely worth checking out for its first four tracks and most of \\"Echoes.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|As a younger, charming, and extremely intelligent fan of music, U2 has become one of my favorite bands...OF ALL TIME! Along with Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, and the Stones, U2 are essentially infallable. In there latest stroll down musical lane U2 blows away, in a way only they can. Im tired of all of you early U2 fans- wearing your ketchup smudged \\"War\\" teeshirts (bought from the tour in the early 80s mind you)- and complaining about how U2 is over the hill. I'm 19 , Im a wee-baby of a man, and How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is my Joshua Tree. U2 has reinvented themselves so cleverly that theyve morphed back into what they originally were in the first place.... an amazing rock and roll 4 peice, hell bent on rock power. And they succeed. Its fresh its clean, its sexy, it smells like a new car...drives faster then your old car, but has a certain feeling to it that leaves you thinking \\"Lordy, Im home\\". The Elevation tour was there best to date, and once the Bomb hits the road there wont be a town left standing.
B00000DFTG|3.0|Ever since 1979, people have been griping that Black Sabbath wasn't Sabbath without Ozzy Osbourne. Despite the fact that Ozzy had gone on to a wildly successful solo career and Tony Iommi continued to guide Black Sabbath through creative, though unnoticed, music, to all but the most open-minded Sabbath fans, it was still \\"Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.\\" \\"War Pigs,\\" \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Iron Man.\\" <br /> <br />Well, what you get here is \\"Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.\\" In fact, many unfamiliar with Ozzy pre-\\"The Osbournes\\" may listen to this and think. \\"Cool. Ozzy's got a cool backing band. Wonder if they'll show up on MTV with him.\\" <br /> <br />As to the album itself, what we have here is a very mixed bag. <br /> <br />GOOD POINTS: <br /> <br />Very, very well recorded. Tony, Geezer and Bill all sound great. In fact, this is probably the best drum sound I've heard Bill get. Sobriety's wonderful, Bill! God bless you! <br /> <br />Surprise inclusion of lesser-known tracks \\"Dirty Women\\" and \\"A Spiral Architect.\\" I'd say Ozzy's best \\"singing\\" is on \\"A Spiral Architect\\" and partially excuses his completely ignoring the final verses of \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.\\" I wouldn't have minded hearing them do \\"It's Alright\\" with Bill Ward on vocals. <br /> <br />There is a sense of historicity here. The prototype heavy metal band, playing in their hometown of Birmingham, England. <br /> <br />There is also a sense of fun here. One can tell the Sabs are enjoying themselves. <br /> <br />The packaging. Very informative and some good pictures (I've always thought that Iommi unshaven looks like Scott Baio!), though I could have done without the one with Ozzy on the toilet. <br /> <br />BAD POINTS: <br /> <br />Ozzy's constant, unnecessary overuse of the \\"F\\" word every time he takes a breath. Come on, he's in his 50s now and certainly recognises his status as one of the founders of heavy metal. He doesn't need to do this. I would probably listen to the album a lot more if not for this. <br /> <br />I detect more thana whiff of \\"sell out\\" and manipulation by Sharon Osbourne (who has somehow got Tony Iommi to consent to not ever using the Sabbath name again unless Ozzy sings on it) here. 1996 Kiss, anyone? To me, this seems like pandering to those still clutching copies of \\"We Sold Our Souls For Rock 'N Roll\\" and not recognising anything that came after. Though he is my favourite guitarist, I lost a lot of respect for Iommi after this. <br /> <br />Sabbath are finished as a creative force. The two studio tracks, \\"Psycho Man\\" and \\"Selling My Soul\\" sound more like latter-day Ozzy solo work than Black Sabbath. With writing only by Ozzy and Iommi, without Geezer's or Bill's input, it's not Black Sabbath. Purists note: \\"Selling My Soul\\" isn't Black Sabbath anyway, not with a drum machine instead of Bill. <br /> <br />There's still plenty of money to be made as a \\"sideshow\\" on OzzFest and I suspect that's what they'll remain doing under the Black Sabbath name. <br /> <br />I never thought I'd say this, as one who stuck by Iommi throughout the '80s and '90s, but the Black Sabbath name should finally be laid to rest. Iommi has proven with the utterly excellent \\"1996 DEP Sessions\\" album with Glenn Hughes that he still has plenty of creativity...he should turn himself to that. <br /> <br />But, if you can overlook the obvious \\"cash-in\\" here and Ozzy trying to be the heavy metal Andrew \\"Dice\\" Clay, you will get a solid live album, though I would much recommend \\"Live Evil\\" or the Ozzy/Randy Rhoads \\"Tribute\\" album.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Star Wars, more like Star bores! These movies are the pits, theyre banthor fodder. If i had it my way id take all the copies of all the movies, and throw them into a cave with a Wampa. Luke...a hero, yah right! His metaclorian count is like not even half of what his fathers was! Not to mention Emporor palpitine what a jerk...he looks like my grandmother...real scary. Im gunna move to the dagoba system if i hear anymore about this film. Anyone who likes star wars is a dork. There mothers didnt love them, their fathers were alcholics, and there sisters did DEATH STICKS!... Once i put the movie on i turned it off in less than 12 parcects... see you on the kessel run!
B000065PUE|5.0|For years I'd heard about how the Pixies influenced Nirvana and Radiohead, and although I was into those other bands, I never really got into the Pixies. Someone played me Surfer Rosa, and I thought \\"not bad\\". I liked a couple of songs, but it didn't really do much for me. Then some one lent me a copy of \\"Doolittle\\". On the first listen I thought it was ok enough to listen to again. On the second listen I was absolutely floored by it. After that it quickly became one of my all time favorite albums. They have other records that I get into (\\"Bossanova\\" and \\"Come On Pilgrim\\"), but \\"Doolittle\\" is the one I play the most.  <br /> <br />There's not a dud in the track listing, but there are some standouts (according to me, that is: I know people who would provide a different listing of the \\"best\\" songs on this album): <br />Debaser, Tame, I Bleed, Mr. Grieves, Crackity Jones, Hey, and Gouge Away <br /> <br />Every aspect of this album is great: the singing, arrangements, guitar parts (particularly on \\"I Bleed\\" and \\"Gouge Away\\" which seems like they might have inspired Radiohead), drums and production are all phenomenal.  <br />
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Buddy is an elf. Well, not really. Buddy is a human who grew up in the North Pole thinking he was an elf.  One Christmas Santa was putting presents under the tree at an orphanage and little Buddy snuck out of his crib and crawled into Santa's sack. Santa didn't know about it until he got back home in the North Pole. By then, he couldn't take the baby back. They would have to wait at least a year. So a kindly Master Elf and his wife who had no children of their own, adopt Buddy and raise them as their son. Buddy, though just doesn't fit as an elf. Not only is he too tall for everything, but he can't work as fast, either. Everyone thinks he's a klutz.  Papa Elf has to tell Buddy the truth and Buddy then leaves the North Pole to search for his biological father (James Caan) in New York City.  Add in a couple of slapstick gags, some really witty and original dialogue, a touch of boy meets girl story, a Scrooge-like man who has a change of heart, and a crash landing of Santa's sleigh in Central Park and it makes for one hilarious and charming Christmas story. Not too mention Bob Newhart.<br /><br />ELF is bound to become a Christmas classic that people watch every year. There aren't very many Christmas movies like that. The majority of Christmas movies that are made are seen once, put on video and DVD, and then forgotten except by strange little trivia lovers like myself. However, every few years a Christmas movie comes along that ends up becoming a new favorite and eventually becomes a classic, like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE CHRISTMAS STORY, and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION.  ELF will be the next movie added to those lists.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is at his comic genius best, portraying just the right mix of innocence and sincerity without seeming to be mushy. One of the best things about the film is seeing Bob Newhart, a comic legend in his own right, teamed up with Ferrell. It's a comedians generational crossover. Ed Asner gets to be a little less cranky than he often is since he plays Santa, and he does a fine job--why wasn't he ever cast in more friendly roles sooner?  James Caan also does a wonderful job as Buddy's long lost father, Walter. Caan isn't given the best lines or material, but is able to make it work. Mary Steenburgen gives a strong supporting performance as Walter's wife and Zooey Deschanel is absolutely adorable as Jovie, the department store clerk who Buddy falls in love with.<br /><br />The movie has a great cast, good writing, intriguing direction, and an involving story. It's slightly quirky, but not so much so to turn anyone off.

1577311523|5.0|I read this book and found that this is not just a book written by a scholar writing with just a borrowed knowledge.All the words of this book are authentic in themselves.Tolle spoke these words on his own behalf and experince but at someplaces he also cared for us poor people and tried to explain the truth from the mouth of Jesus,Krishna or Gautam Budha.But he needs none of these people for himself. <br /> <br />It is a great fortune for West to have a Budhha .Tolle is a blessing for whole of the world.This is a very very rare happening which we are witnessing today.Tolle is not transforming the world by just his books but His being and silence sitting in His home is doing something in the world which is invisible to the sleeping souls. <br /> <br />This book should be in every home and it is more important and holier than any other so called holy books. <br /> <br />Let we be courageous and welcome new age and new humanity and a new man.Old and Past has done enough harm to the humanity. <br />Enlightenmnet is the only revolution.Work for your own enlightenment rather than working for any religion,nation,army or organization.This is the only wisdom.All else is just an illusion and will cause repenting at the time of death. <br /> <br />love <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000993|4.0|Tool's first full-length album is a great, solid effort but, just to address the issue beforehand, the reason I gave all the songs the same rating was because I truly feel that they're all equal after considering their good and bad points. <br /> <br />Intolerance (4/5)- Excellent beginning song with really good lyrics that seem to be an indication of Maynard's departure from negativity that's so prevalent in Opiate.  Still, it doesn't last too long on this CD. <br />Prison Sex (4/5)- One of the songs on the album with a video.  Thankfully, the video has Adam Jones's (the guitarist) cool animation rather than a depiction of the disgusting lyrics.  Awesome song all the same. <br />Sober (4/5)- A classic, it's one of Tool's most radio-friendly songs surprisingly enough when you consider the profane lyrics about Jesus. <br />Bottom (4/5)- Good song that has a spoken poem in the middle of it by Henry Rollins.  It's kind of weird and the words are a bit of a downer but it has a real nice ending. <br />Crawl Away (4/5)- Maynard continues the repeating of verses in this song like on Opiate and keeps up the hateful vibe while throwing in sarcasm by saying \\"This is my love for you.\\"  After that is a kickass double bass breakdown. <br />Swamp Song (4/5)- Again with the repeating of verses but the cool time signatures keep the song very alive.  <br />Undertow (4/5)- The title track is another really cool song on the album due to its bridge that's filled with cool timings, slows down and then leads to a great breakdown that ends the song. <br />4 Degrees (4/5)- This song has a cool sitar intro and odd lyrics.  At one point during the bridge it seems like Maynard has a nervous breakdown. <br />Flood (4/5)- A long instrumental intro is followed by the final official song on the album where Maynard struggles to keep his possessions dry. <br />Disgustipated (4/5)- Although it's a \\"secret\\" track, I figured I'd review it.  The sermon given by reverend Maynard is hilarious    and is alead-in to the actual song which is a tribal sort of chant that's a lot of fun to recite with your friends while drunk.  After the song, there's some silence and then a really strange story that's actually told in the second person like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. <br /> <br />This record would be the last one where Tool uses the typical verse chorus verse structure in all the songs.  It's also the last where all the songs sound similar and Maynard uses his vocals in a guttural manner.  In a sentence, this album marks the end of whatever predictability the band had.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the record that accidentally changed youth culture and rock forever. This wasn't a commercial record... it was never meant to be. Nirvana always did things their own way, and it just so happens that an album meant for the underground ended up multi-platinum. Why? Because stoners and jocks alike realized at the same time that this was very, very good music. Despite that fact, this album as a whole does not define \\"grunge\\" sound. Grunge is better examplified by Bleach or In Utero, or even Incesticide. Besides the classics (do i need to list them?) there are a few tracks on here with definite 80's sound (There was some concern, before the record was released, that it was too mainstream). Even if you own the Nirvana album, there is still a point to owning this CD. 1. Just to own a piece a history 2. It's still good music 3. You have to know your roots 4. There are some excellent songs on here besides what you hear on local radio, such as Polly, Something in the Way, On a Plain, Breed, and Drain You. What is amazing is not that these songs are incedibly complex, but the originality (of both the music and the lyrics), and most importantly the sheer emotion always present in Kurt Cobain's voice. (Yes i'm aware that he can't, in the classical sense, actually sing) Opinions- The version of Polly present is mediocre, due to overdubbing and cutting off the resonance on the end of lines. You can find a better, more emotional version on the MTV Unplugged album, and a harder version on Incesticide. The version of Something in the Way however,is my favorite, as is Breed. These songs don't get \\"old.\\" There is no such thing as sounding \\"outdated\\" besides the changes in recording quality and techniques over the years. Most of these songs were completely different than what was playing at the time. Nirvana has long since been copied, emulated, switched around, chewed up, and spit out as the unoriginal, cliched, soul-less rock on modern radio. But these songs are the originals.The songs that changed music as we know it. Maybe they're not timeless. But they still speak with more volume than anyone thought possible.
B0006399FS|3.0|Yes, Bono's voice is raspy at times (someone tell him to quit smoking already!), but the passion is still there. It makes you  rock, but it all feels good because you feel good about who it's coming from.This is definitely one of my favorite U2 albums....  <br />
0790737345|3.0|\\"Wings of Desire\\" is among of my favorite movies.  To say that \\"City of Angels\\" is a remake of \\"Wings of Desire\\" is wrong.  It is a retelling. \\"City of Angels\\" in my opinion was not as profound as \\"Wings of Desire\\". It lacked the impact of how Angels were portrayed and focused more the underlying theme of love.  Which brings me to my point that \\"City of Angels\\" is just a love story.  And a fairly decent love story it is by Hollywood standards. If I had never seen \\"Wings of Desire\\" then I would've probably liked this movie more.  But being a fan of \\"Wings of Desire\\" has somewhat heightened my expectations of movies that portray Angels.  In \\"Wings of Desire\\" the Angel that chose mortality used love as an inspiration to desire all that life has to offer.  While in \\"City of Angels\\" the Angel there chose mortality because he fell in love with a mortal woman.  It is not as deep and inspirational as \\"Wings of Desire\\". They are two very different movies.
B000058983|5.0|This is by far the greatest album in rock history.  To the un-initiated, that may appear to be a curious claim.  \\"How can it be so great if I have never heard of it,\\" you may ask.  This album is obscure because it was too psychedelic even for the psychedelic 1960s and in later years it got swept under the carpet as other bands and styles became popular.  But the record company kept this album in print, thankfully.  The band it tight, the lyrics trippy and somewhat poetic as Arthur Lee contemplates the world around him and even death.  Multiple acoustic guitars and horns and other string instruments battle the raging electric guitars and the tight instrumentation.  A signpost for the 60s and beyond.  Take it from a fan of the Beatles, Dylan, Hendrix and all the others.  Nothing tops this album.  Nothing.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Ill start off by saying Whitney has always been, despite her personal conflicts, my favorite singer of all time. However i was forced(and trust me it hurt) to rate this album only 4 stars. And although 4 stars may seem \\"good\\", in whitney's case its a disgrace. Whitney sounds just plain good on the album, and good is not usually a word that we associate with Whitney Houston. Her voice doesnt soar with the angelic majesty weve come to appreciate tremendously over the years, however her god given talent is clearly exhibited, and unmistakable. I bought this album and although a little dissapointed, if i could go back i would still buy it cause im a whitney die hard and thats what we die hards do. Ill admit in comparison to another one of my top favorite vocalists (mariah carey) and her christmas album, this album falters. But like an earlier review stated its an unfair comparison considering Mariah was in her vocal prime when she made her christmas album. Surely if Whitney decided to make a christmas album back in her prime, it would have undoubtedly surpassed Mariahs. My final analysis is if u want a solid christmas album then purchase it, However solid is where it ends so if ur expecting Whitney signature voice to be present on this album, then u will be let down.
B000002W9P|5.0|The \\"Keeper of the 7 Keys\\" CDs from Helloween =  The Definition of Power Metal. <br /> <br />If you don't get this CD for any other reason, at least listen to and get it for \\"Twilight of the gods\\".  Awesome awesome song. <br /> <br />I could listen to that song a million times in a row and never get tired of it. <br /> <br />This is Michael Kirsche's (I think I spelled that right?) first CD with Helloween. <br /> <br />No, \\"Keeper Part 1\\" CD is not as heavy as \\"Walls of Jericho\\" CD is, but \\"Keeper Part 1\\" CD did shape and define European Power Metal for years to come. <br /> <br /> <br />Kai Hansen was the singer of the band for the \\"Helloween EP\\" and \\"Walls of Jericho\\" CD, but he steped down from the singing position in the band on this CD.  Kai Hansen is the one playing all the awesome guitar solos on this CD. <br /> <br />\\"Walls of Jericho\\" is actually the one Helloween CD to get, but this CD is about just as good. <br /> <br />
B00063EMJ6|3.0|The impulse to reduce a forty-year career down to 17 tracks is one of the most vulgar manifestations of commercialism. This is the danger that threatens art when it becomes a packaged and commodified product. Neil has, more than most \\"graybeards,\\" done his best to steer clear of these misfortunes. Even \\"Decade\\" was a three-record set on Vinyl. Neil Young is not Jackson Browne. nor is he Gordon Lightfoot, Van Morrison, Jonie Mitchell or whomever else you want to name. Unlike these talented but comparatively minor artists, Neil helped to define a generation and invent a genre, whereas the aforementioned legends merely explored those established boundaries. Thus, a greatest hits set that effectively excludes about 15-years worth of vital recordings can never be worthy of the man. Of course, \\"worthiness\\" is not the motive here. Money is. Nonetheless, any greatest hits CD with Neil's name on it that fails to include material from 1995's \\"Mirror Ball,\\" for which he won a Grammy award, songs like \\"F$#kin' Up,\\" \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" or \\"Love to Burn\\" from 1990's \\"Ragged Glory,\\" the epic \\"Look Out For My Love\\" from 1978's \\"Comes A Time\\" or anything from the definitive \\"On The Beach\\" of 1974 is a deceptive piece of marketing. Equally as disappointing is that this set includes not a single track from Young's recent \\"Greendale,\\" which Rolling Stone voted the second best album of 2003, behind only Warren Zevon's \\"The Wind.\\" At the very least, the thrilling \\"Devil's Sidewalk\\" might have proven to skeptics that Neil's still got plenty left in the tank. My surprise at Neil's participation in such a venture is exceeded only by the lack of imagination with which the included songs were chosen. We are told that these tracks were selected on the basis of airplay and downloading statistics. So, in other words, if you want to hear this CD, listen to FM radio. If you want to hear the best of Neil Young, the only way is the old-fashioned way: from beginning to end.<br /><br />Visit my blog at [...]]
B000009EAD|5.0|This CD is early MetallicA mixed with the \\"Painkiller\\" CD from PRIEST. <br /> <br />Mix the 2 together, and you get ICED EARTH. <br /> <br /> <br />NEVER has ICED EARTH been Power Metal (Helloween type of music). <br /> <br />ICED EARTH has always been Thrash Metal. <br /> <br />There is a huge difference between Thrash Metal and Power Metal. <br /> <br />Stratovarius and Helloween are Power Metal. <br /> <br />ICED EARTH, PanterA, early AnTHRaX, early MetallicA, early MegadetH, and TestAmenT are Thrash Metal. <br /> <br /> <br />If you are looking for awesome kick-butt Thrash Metal, this is it. <br /> <br />I would say, this CD and \\"Rust in Peace\\" CD from MegadetH are one of, if not, the absolute defintion of Thrash Metal. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like the \\"Painkiller\\" CD from PREIST, or \\"Kill 'em All\\" CD from MetallicA, you'll love this CD. <br />

B0000CEB4V|3.0|George Harrison died of cancer on November 29, 2001.  On November 29, 2002, a concert was held in London's Royal Albert Hall in honor of his memory.  This film is a record of that event.<br /><br />Since the DVD version of \\"Concert for George\\" runs roughly two and a half hours, it is inevitable that the film will have a few low spots to go along with its high.  Luckily, the film gets the rough patches out of the way pretty much right up front, so that Harrison's true blue fans can enjoy most of the concert in uninterrupted bliss and rapture.  Admittedly, the film does not have a particularly auspicious beginning.  The first 40 minutes or so, after a few words of rambling tribute from Eric Clapton,  are devoted to Harrison's love of Indian music, with Ravi Shankar's daughter playing and conducting a composition written especially for the occasion (Shankar himself is in attendance and provides a few words of his own to honor his deceased prot&eacute;g&eacute;).  As one who, admittedly, has a tin ear when it comes to sitar music in general, I must confess that I found this section to be something of an endurance contest - a reaction I may not share with vast numbers of Harrison's admirers.  Fortunately, after a few lame comic routines performed by Monty Python, the real concert begins in earnest, with Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston, Tom Petty and others coming on stage to perform a number of Harrison's most well known and well loved songs, both from his tenure as a Beatle and from the successful solo career that came afterwards.  Even Harrison's own son, Danny - who is a dead ringer for his father - joins the veterans on stage, playing acoustic guitar for virtually all of the sets.  The musicians do an excellent job covering Harrison's songs, with \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" \\"Give Me Love,\\" \\"I Need You,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Something,\\" and, of course, \\"My Sweet Lord\\" particular standouts.<br /><br />As a film, \\"Concert for George\\" is relatively straightforward and traditional, providing few glimpses of backstage moments, no on-camera interviews and no subtitled identification of any of the players involved.  However, the picture looks spectacular and the sound is rich, crisp and full-bodied - exactly what one needs to have in a for-the-record concert video.<br /><br />And I defy anyone not to be covered in goose bumps when Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney trundle out on stage to do their thing.<br /><br />As the song so aptly states, \\"All things must pass away...\\"ightforward and traditional, providing few glimpses of backstage moments, no on-camera interviews and no subtitled identification of any of the players involved.

B00004RFCM|5.0|The appeal of this show seems to me, in part, by the fact that there is a little bit of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte in all of us. When Im feeling self-indulgent... or just up for a laugh - this does the trick everytime!!!
B0006A9FMI|4.0|The CG is stunning. DVD is the right medium for this cartoon as the dialogue and scenes sometimes moved so fast that U have to rewind to understand what is going on. I like the original leading female character more than this cyborg eyed guy but he is OK. The story is more complex last time but the graphics is better this time: check out the scenes when they investigate the house repeatedly over and over again with some changes every time (in some sort of feedback loop). The OVA cartoon series is also very interesting, any ghost in a shell fans should check it out.
0440242576|3.0|\\"Skipping Christmas\\" is a nice holiday book with a different pace.  One could say Luther Krank is an updated Ebenezer Scrooge, but of whom come around in their feelings for Christmas just at the peak of the celebrated holiday.  I could relate to the nosey neighbor troubles, since I have a few nosey neighbors around myself (although they probably would not band together like the neighbors did in the book), and although the ending is predictable, it's still moving and comforting.  I did find some of the chapters about people gossiping in the town about the Kranks, along with the Kranks dealing the pesky carolers to be drawn out; furthermore, compared to the rest of the story, the ending was very abrupt.  I haven't seen the movie version, \\"Christmas with the Kranks,\\" so I cannot comment on whether the movie is faithful to the book or not.  If you're looking for something a little different to read this holiday season, then I recommend this book.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love Smallville and it is my FAVOURITE SHOW. I highly recommend all the Smallville boxsets so buy them now! Living in England i haven't seen any of Season 4 yet but it looks the best yet! <br /> <br />To finish Tom Weling is sooooooo sexy! If only he wasn't married (and straight)! I partly watch the show just so i can see Tom Wellings gorgeous body!
B0002XDODU|5.0|I'm going to levy a disclaimer for this one.  If you listen to Rammstein because you like the extremely heavy and fast paced guitar riffs from the other 3 albums, then I'm warning you this album does not have nearly as much of that on it.  However, if you like Rammstein because of the heavy sound, their ability to switch pace mid song, and their incredibly deviant metaphoric lyrics, then this album is perfect for you.   <br /> <br />The band has said that they want to try and make Till sing better instead of just speak, and they want to make their songs more complex, and they did just that.  This is truly a better work of metal musicianship, and these songs have much more melody than most of their previous works.  Of course there are still some good fast paced tracks on there to help keep the overall album moving smoothly and let us know that they still enjoy that style, but for the most part this album is much more 'beautiful' and less 'hardcore' than their other efforts, and I am personally glad that Rammstein has decided to show off their skills a little more and start to stray from the standard formula of industrial heavy metal. <br /> <br />So if you're willing to hear something new, give this album a listen, just don't expect speed metal.  I'm looking forward to seeing them in concert now that they have a diverse array of songs to play, I just hope they come to the states again!
B000087F6M|5.0|I'm a 17 year old movie fan, and just to put my two cents in, I think this movie is awesome. It's not well known, but even so, I watch it every time it's on television. Thumbs up.
068987474X|2.0|The author's of this book arrogantly proclaim that men who are interested in you will do all sorts of creative things to initiate dating, ask a girl out, and come up with all sorts of wonderful, clever romantic things to build your relationship upon - IF they're interested of course.  <br /> <br />However, the reality is that this doesn't hold true for a large % of men. Many of us are shy and avoid the bar/club games, slick come-on lines and all the other things that these authors so steadfastly proclaim that all of us men will do.  <br /> <br />It could VERY WELL be that the man is absolutely interested in you, however, he is too shy to ask you out, he is uncomfortable to walk across the room while you are surrounded with your friends to initiate a conversation, he is perhaps a great guy, however, he isn't Mr. Smooth on how to wine, dine, romance and seduce a woman.  <br /> <br />According the authors, these men must instantly be dismissed forever because \\"he just isn't that into you\\". Ridiculous. In fact, I would also argue that a large % of the time, it isn't so clear as to whether or not the women is into HIM for the exact same reasons - SHE is shy, she isn't making her feelings known, she isn't the clever player who does the dating thing just right, etc.  <br /> <br />I'm sure this book has some helpful advice for women who desperately cling to failed partners, however, without question it should be taken with a grain of salt.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|From Jackman's appallingly ugly hat to the blatantly-ripped-off-from-LXG version of Jekll/Hyde, from the Vatican's knockoff versions of M and Q to Beckinsale's anachronistically skanky Princess Anna, this movie was THE SUCK.   <br /> <br />Frankly, the only good points were the vampires - campy, yes, but wonderfully so.  Particularly the opening sequence, where Dracula's deceptively attractive face is overlaid by flashes of a horrifying monster, and it becomes very clear that this vampire has none of the sweet, cuddly qualities so common in many modern vampire depictions - he is utterly evil.  <br /> <br />But besides Dracula?  THE SUCK.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I'm against all the meddling Lucas has done with these films on pure principle (yes I know they are his films and he does have the right to do what he wants but that doesn't mean I have to LIKE it). Then there is the fact that most of the changes just don't come off very well. The blending of modern digital effects with the old mechanical type usually is not very smooth, leaving these scenes looking patched together and awkward. They look like exactly what they are - scenes from an old movie with some digital affects dropped in.  And in many cases, the new affects pale in comparison to the old fashioned affects that relied on models (the new CGI Jabba the Hutt anyone?).  New scenes are either unnecessary or detrimental, such as Han shooting Guido first or Han stepping on Jabba's tale. I could really do without the childish humor that Lucas has taken to in recent years, especially in the original trilogy. And who does Lucas think he's fooling when he says he always wanted to have Han shoot first but couldn't do it because of \\"editing\\" issues. Right. You could never have had Han shoot first way back in '76, couldn't be done. Comments like this really drive home to me the low regard Lucas has for his own creation and the fans these days. Sad. Hopefully Lucas's greed will lead to a DVD release of the original cut of these films, so there might at least be some silver lining there. The only reason I gave this set two stars is the extras, which I have to admit are plentiful and well done.
0312954468|5.0|I thought I was in love with ancient Egypt then I read Warlock and discovered Wilbur smith's amazingly artistic storytelling.This made me go a-searching and I found River God. I pride myself in being a very critical and cynical person but this book kept me entirely spellbound throughout.It is truly an EPIC, better than anything Hollywood has ever come out with. I like the fact that Taita was perfect except for the fact that he was a eunuch. Everythihng in this book is well written. Mintaka and Nefer stole my heart and even though they could be  larger than life and too good sometimes, you will not hold it against them for a second. It will keep your heart on overdrive even when you've managed to put it down and catch an hour night's sleep. <br />I cried when someone I had coerced into reading it (I feel that the magic should be shared with as many people as possible),  lost my copy. It was that precious. <br />EVERYONE PLEASE READ IT AND SEE!
B0000CAQ27|1.0|<br />I used to be a big Pink's fan. I loved her first CD. It was the only CD I listened to for 5 months straight. Then, her second CD came out. It was a big disappointment. Something in her style changed, which I did not like. But I still faithfully purchased this CD, hoping that she would put out some good music. But I seriously regretted buying the CD.  <br /> <br />I guess now Pink is famous, she gets to decide what direction she wants her music to go. Obviously, she is always been a punk rock chic deep down inside. Now I realized that the style in her first CD wasn't really who she was. It was just something that her record company put her in so that she could be accepted by the general mass. Now Pink has millsions of faithful fans, she can care less about being accpeted. She takes off her mask and we see this rocker girl. Some people love her more, some people like her less. I belong to the latter group.  <br /> <br />The music in this CD is mostly rock with a little bit pop beat. If that's what you like, buy this CD.  <br /> <br />Purple_Garden

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell plays \\"Buddy\\", a human adopted as a baby by Santa's elves and raised at the North Pole.  As an adult, he ventures to New York City to find his father.  It isn't easy for Buddy to suddenly adapt to the very cynical, harsh world of the big city, but watching him plunge into this environment with his naivet&eacute; and unflappable sunny disposition is enjoyable and hilarious.  This is a sugary sweet \\"feel good\\" movie that actually works because it's written so well, and the acting is great.  Will Ferrell is hysterical and truly perfect as this human running around as a giant Elf, and I also really enjoyed Bob Newhart as well.  One of the funnier comedies I have seen, and it's family friendly to boot.
B000002H6C|1.0|I can't express with words how much I loathe this album.  Its just so incredibly gloomy and depressing.  Who wants to sit and listen to 10 minute songs all about death and destruction and darkness?  Not me.  I don't want to be miserable.   <br /> <br />Listening to this entire album will poison your mind.  It will make you miserable, gloomy, and depressed.  It makes you want to kill yourself.  Do you really want to buy an album that will put you in a suicidal state of depression? <br /> <br />I challange any Metallica fan to give up listening to Metallica's suicidal angst music.  I almost guarantee you'll feel better when you aren't listening to Metallica.
0792839749|4.0|I bought the \\"cheap\\" DVD, because little kids don't care about wide-screen or interviews or extras.  They like color, action, interesting characters, and lively songs.  The next day, the girl (5) asked me to play specific scenes:  the song \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" and the \\"dancing dolls\\" routine.  She even liked the name \\"Truly Scrumptious\\".  The only problem with small children is \\"Why ...\\" and \\"How ...\\" every few minutes.  I wasn't sure at first if the adventures in Vulgaria were part of the fantasy story or \\"real\\", so I just kept saying, \\"It's magic\\".  Later, we pretended my Outback could float and fly. <br /> <br />As for me?  I'm a big fan of Dick Van Dyke, so I kind of enjoyed it -- and having never watched films on DVD until recently, I guess I liked the color, action, interesting characters, and lively songs.  How about that?
B000001DTM|5.0|Every song on here is an amazing treasure. This album is still kicking my hind quarters.
B0006284JQ|4.0|........But other than that this greatest hits album is great on the minus side though Songs like Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know and Born To Make you Happy are missing although those songs were never big hits it would've been cool to see those songs make the cut on this Greatest Hits Album also on The Minus side is The Useless Remake of Bobby Brown's My Prerogative.Where Bobby Brown's My Prerogative was a big hit back 1989 where it was fresh and funky Britney's version is more midtempo and the music feels a little blah her version is also like complaining to the media to back up off her and let her live the life she wants to live and this song is nowhere near Perfect as Bobby Brown's Version She defitnietly ruined one of the best R&B/Pop Songs of the 80's.But other than that Her greatest hits album is still worth picking up it features all of her hits including Toxic,Baby One More Time,OOps I did It Again,and Everytime.I give it 4 out of 5 stars A must have for every Britney fan all across the world
B00005JN0T|4.0|Yes the story was common.Yes it was your usual \\"Robots take over the planet\\" type movie, but it was hot.  It was one of those mystery who did it films, which I just love.  And the good thing about it, is that you don't know who to trust in this movie.  Nice little twist in it also.  You can figure out the second twist pretty easily though.  But the Sci-Fi effects, the futuristic scenes.  That kid from Disney channels even Stevens did a good job. Will was Will.  Action-packed, nice little comedy. 1 problem:  The year was 2035.  In thirty years the world will be that much different??? Yeah Right. I guess that was the year in the book, so they just kept it like that.  Overall it was a HOT action-packed Sci-fi thriller.  Holla
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I'm no operaphile, and so cannot offer a sophisticated review as other more opera-savvy reviewers might. However, I have enjoyed and gotten a lot out of this edition of Wagner's Ring. The performances by Hildegard Behrens, Jessye Norman and James Morris are wonderful.<br /><br />I've been watching the series on DVD to prepare for attending the September 2006 Canadian Opera Company (COC) presentation of The Ring in its entirety at the soon-to-be-built opera house in Toronto. I saw the COC production of Die Walkuere earlier this year. It was well done, but I must say that I prefer the version on this DVD, with its traditional sets (other reviewers called the sets blah) and its top-calibre Metropolitan Opera performers and conductor (Levine). The COC presents Siegfried, on its own, in February 2005. ***Note*** the Die Walkuere DVD has its subtitles for Act III screwed up. I emailed Deutsche Grammaphon about this, and they promptly and courteously shipped me a replacement, corrected DVD.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|The movie was well done, put together well and everything.  The acting was tremendous.  The characters did everything that you say in your head that you would do in that situation. I gave it 3 1/2 stars for three reasons. The entire movie was gloomy, it was all during the night.  Not alot of scenery, Not but about 5 or six characters.  The second reason was because you just did not get a chance to know the characters.  They all had very brief introductions.  You never knew who Cruise worked for or who worked for him. Foxx's character had the most involvement of the major characters. Yet you barely knew him.  they should have used more time to get you involved with each of the character's lives. When u don't get a chance to know the characters, it is harder to relate to them. The final reason is because The ending was weak. the entire movie was excellent up until the end. The ending was \\"O.K.\\" Overall it was uhh pretty good. Definitely DVD material.
B00006690G|5.0|eminem is one of the best.  this is a hot album.  if you're a true rap fan you would buy it.  it's sold 19 million worldwide and 9.3 million here in the u.s.  don't hesitate to buy this album.  BUY IT!
B00004XONN|4.0|I find it hilarious that this album is so widely hailed for its originality. It's not the least bit progressive or groundbreaking or new or anything like it. But it's okay. Obviously Thom & the guys have been listening to a lot of Delia Darbyshire recordings (not that that's a bad thing!) The influence of the BBC radiophonic workshop weighs heavily here although the Head fail to come up with anything near as good. People mention Eno and Low (Bowie) as touchstones for this album. I can understand why, but the record it reminds me of most is Simple Minds' lost masterpiece from 1979, 'Real to Real Cacophony'. I'd advise to go buy that instead. <br /> <br />The funny thing is how Radiohead are viewed in America as near visionaries. Even by people who should know better. At best they are a fine rock band with a whiney singer. At worst, self-indulgent music history students with very good taste.  <br /> <br />Still, if this album makes people realize that there's a whole other dimension of music out there then I guess it serves its purpose. Unfortunately, I suspect most people never get any further than the relative safety of something like 'Kid A' and that really is a wasted opportunity. <br />Four stars for effort more than achievement.
B000002B1M|5.0|this album almost but not quite lives up to his debut illmatic.  nas shows he's still one of the best in hip hop and always will be.  in 20 years when you go back to look at the history of rap the main names you're gonna hear are gonna be nas, jay-z, pac, biggie, and eminem.  BUY IT!
B00004BZ16|5.0|Is there a rock song that can compare with Charlie Don't Surf?  Maybe I'm So Bored With The USA, but the list is short.  If you don't own this, get a copy from someone along with The Clash and London Calling and call it quits.
B00004T9UF|5.0|this is no question the best eminem album we'll ever see.  it'll almost impossible for him to outdo this album.  BUY IT!  it's awesome.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Unless you count The Clash.  Sandinista a close second.
B0000029GA|5.0|this is by far one of the best rap albums of all time.  this is nas' debut album and it his best album.  no one will ever match this album lyrically.  this album has unbelievable lyrics on it that only nas could come up with.  BUY IT!!!
B00009MGQL|3.0|In Jeff's own words:\\"I don't think I've ever hated anything I've done more\\".... Guitar Player, Sept 2003  I must admit this isn't one of my favorites, I rank it with the likes of 'Flash' but still JB has the balls to explore and experiment! I would love to see a project with Terry Bozzio, Tony Levin and Tony Hymas... These guys could get Jeff's juices flowing in the proper direction, or should I say the direction I prefer... I've been a fan since 1975, so I'm more condusive to his Blues, Rock and Jazz Fusion sounds - guess I'm getting older... Just ordered 'Jeff Beck Live at BB King Blues Club' - I'll rate that after a spin or two...
0689859368|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the rest I just can't believe there is only 5 !!!!  Maybe they will make this into a movie :)
B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie really makes you think about the highs and lows of what the mess of the world might bring.  Yes as usually they are teasing us Canadians about not being able to survive such an occurrence but hey who lives in the snow people?!?  <BR>The movie itself is wonderfully directed with a great line of talented actors.  It can even bring tears to the eyes of us sanative people and fear as well.<BR>All and all it gets 4 of 5 in my books because though it was a great movie I found it did jumping and after watching a second time I found what I missed the first.<BR>But definitely a must see and collection worthy
B00005JL0I|2.0|I think part of the attraction of this movie is its distinctive Sixties elements.  So psychedelic, so mod, such intrigue.  The music and clothes and sexy women.<br /><br />But CASINO ROYALE is a disaster as a film and a comedy.  It's AUSTIN POWERS without the laughs.<br /><br />It's such a disaster that the star, the emotionally-disturbed Peter Sellers, walked off the movie and they never stopped the production.  (Depending on which books you read, Sellers walked off either after his dead mother visited him in a dream to tell him to, or when Orson Welles mistook him for Woody Allen at an elevator and he ran off in a huff).<br /><br />David Niven is then forced to carry on the chaos as it noisily crashes to its climax, the kind of madness that would be much better used in BLAZING SADDLES seven years later.<br /><br />There are moments, but very few.  Woody Allen's part at the end at last hits on the zaniness that should've been there from the start.<br /><br />Only for pure Sixties nuts.
B0006399FS|2.0|All I have to say is U2 is a fabulous band, and with this new cd Bono has deeply saddened me by singing overtly about Christianity. I understand that his religious and humanitarian related beliefs were always on some sublevel in his music, but thats where they should stay. This new balantness takes down the art to just barely mediocre. If I wanted religious music I would buy it from that horrible \\"Christian rock\\" section in the music store. I just hope this overtness does not prove to be permanent trend in Bono's otherwise beautiful lyrics. <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I hate to be repetative but just remember this wasnt originally intended to be recorded at all and only a spontaneous live event. And all these people grousing about this artist's performance wasn't there because they wouldn't allow it or that one's set was shortened to make room for the more famous acts. Quit your b****in! They didn't even have to make this available to you at all!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Long resistant to film adaptations of her Mary Poppins books, P. L. Travers finally succumbed to the entreaties of Walt Disney, and the result is often considered the finest of Disney's personally supervised films. The Travers stories are bundled together to tell the story of the Edwardian-era British Banks family: the banker father (David Tomlinson), suffragette mother (Glynis Johns), and the two \\"impossible\\" children (Karen Dotrice and Mathew Garber). The kids get the attention of their all-business father by bedevilling every new nanny in the Banks household. Whem Mr. Banks advertises conventionally for another nanny, the kids compose their own ad, asking for someone with a little kindness and imagination. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews in her screen debut) answers the children's ad by arriving at the Banks home from the skies, parachuting downward with her umbrella. She immediately endears herself to the children. The next day they meet Mary's old chum Bert (Dick Van Dyke), currently employed as a sidewalk artist. Mary, Bert and the children hop into one of Bert's chalk drawings and learn the nonsense song \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" in a cartoon countryside. Later, they pay a visit to Bert's Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so hard that he floats to the ceiling. Mr. Banks is pleased that his children are behaving better, but he's not happy with their fantastic stories. To show the children what the real world is like, he takes them to his bank. A series of disasters follow which result in his being fired from his job. Mary Poppins' role in all this leads to some moments when it is possible to fear that all her good work will be undone, but like the magical being she is, all her \\"mistakes\\" lead to a happy result by the end of the film.    As to the soundtrack, its FANTASTIC!   The 5.1 surround soundmix really   puts you right  into   the scenes of whats going on!!  The subwoofer really  kicks in   many  times!!  And you feel as if you are  right  there with  the fireworks going off every which  way when the tune 'Step  In Time\\" comes to its end!      God bless all those who  worked on  making this  2 disc set so very  special!    The extras on  this 2 disc set are fantastic!!   There is so much  new footage shown   from  the time this movie was made,  you will see outtakes and some fun being had on  the set!     This is  such  a great  special  edition  that  anyone who  loves this movie will LOVE having this to own!       Just  wait til you watch  these extras, you will NOT be bored at  all! :)
B0000AQZYM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie full of creativeness. A fish named Nemo will get lost and rely on new friends to help him. This movie is the best I have ever seen. Anybody could watch it. My son who is age 4 understood this movie too. Get this movie for a wonderful time with your family or friends. I give this movie at least 20 stars.
B00005JKN9|1.0|I don't doubt for a New York minute that it really was this bad, and worse, to live in Gotham during the mid 19th century.  There really were gangs like this, and human life was held of largely no consequence in the squalid fight for daily survival.  It was the same in London, too, and Paris.  If you want to read the history, a good place to start is \\"Bloodletters and Badmen\\", an encyclopedia of crime, that has a large entry on these gangs and their doing.    But that's all beside the point.  From this episode of American history where cultures and religions were clashing in a huge city during the bloodiest days of the Civil War, Scorcese has managed to craft a tale about as entertaining as the Classic Comics version would have been.  I never thought I would be disappointed in Daniel Day Lewis, but 1/3 of the way through the movie I wanted to pull that mustache off his face - his accent was hilarious, sort of Archie Bunker mixed with Freddie Kruger.  The plot is predictable.  Leonardo DiCaprio (who isn't believable in anything he does, poor kid...) escapes violent death as a child to take his vengeance later as a man.  Ooh, do you think maybe he'll win the favor of and move in close to the very man he seeks to avenge himself on?  How many times has that old wheeze been pulled out of the magician's hat?      I suppose more than anything else, I'm disappointed.  I love Scorcese, I love D.D. Lewis, and I think this is a fascinating and poorly understood episode of American history, one never mentioned in schools.  So to make all of it into this garbage is just a sad waste of time on everyone's account.  It is equivalent in quality to an ordinary TV miniseries, not a bit better, just as hackneyed, just as stereotyped, just as superficial.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Van Helsing<br /><br />Wow, I really can't say enough bad things about this movie. It is roughly 75% plagerised from various flicks. I am not speaking of the amalgam of classic monsters, rather I am referring to direct and indirect quotes, effects, themes etc...of other popular movies. Such as Lara Croft, Star Wars, Star Trek, Krull, Shrek, Dune, The Matrix and I know I found more, but would have to watch it again to name them all, which I have no intention of doing. I purchased this movie, but will send it out free to anyone who wants it. I sure as (enter swear word of your choice) don't want this piece of garbage in my collection.
B000002H33|5.0|One of the best metal albums of all time! I remember listening to it in high school, and was one my best bands along with Van Halen, Def Leopard and Ozzy Osbourne. It was and still is the best Metallica of all time. If you want to listen to how rock/metal is truly made, you should start with this.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Unfortunately for me I went by the cover and actor when picking out  what I thought would be a good movie. <br /> <br />If anyone reads this and can tell me what they see in the first 45 minutes that was worth any thing to spend there time watching. Please give this review a rebuttal. This movie to me is too Boaring for Words! <br /> <br />Toney Burkhart <br />San Francisco
B000005IU2|3.0|the truth is if this band never existed punk still would have started. Thats why i can not still beleive why so many people call this the beggening or line to punk. The truth it started with velvet underground then new york dolls then the ramones. also the sex pistols and the new york dolls had the same manager. I am really lost where the stooges fit in. Thats what i hear in all the reveiws as to why they are so great. The stooges as a band are nothing really special thats why they where never really that big. The music to me is to grungy. And not alot of bluesy feel to me. The only reason i think so many pumk wanna be's like it is because some band said it inspired them!
0393317552|5.0|It's been several years since I've read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" but I plan to read it again at some point. One interesting thing from the book is Diamond's comparison of China's technological developments to Europe's. China undertook sea exploration early in the 15th century yet desisted not long after because of an imperial edict. In Europe, Columbus was able to gain support from Spain for his voyage after first trying in a few other countries. Generally, China's unity enabled it to innovate earlier than the West, but this same unity also quelled innovation. Just one edict and innovation stopped. In Europe, however, if one country gave up on a technology, another one was likely to pick it up. There was enough communication for sharing of ideas, but not enough centralization to completely kill an idea. We'd do well to learn from this dichotomy in the current age of increased centralization of media, government, and culture.
0226443221|3.0|Over the summer of 1995, the area surrounding Chicago experienced extreme weather conditions that exposed people to a heat index reaching 126 degrees.  The result was devastating to the community; a record number of deceased bodies were discovered as a direct result of heat exposure.  The hot, humid air stalled over Chicago for one long week.  When it was finally dissipated, it left residents of Chicago scared and confused.  City streets had failed, electricity use had peaked and many lost power, and power grids had completely collapsed.  It was a disaster that was heard around the world.<br /><br /> Between the dates of July 14 and July 20, 739 Chicago residents died from heat exposure.  Every year, heat waves kill more people than all other natural disasters combined.  However, they often are not heard of or spoken about.  This is due to the fact that they are not physically damaging and that most heat wave victims are those who are socially isolated from their community.  These groups often are composed primarily of elderly, poor, and those who choose to be isolated.<br /><br /> Heat waves directly are linked to these isolated groups, and until now, were not given any attention.  Many are left vulnerable to disaster by not being connected into the community. Eric Klinenberg examines the tragedy that took place in Chicago and draws attention to the social, political, and institutional groups that all were involved in the situation.  Heat Wave ties in isolation, inner-city neighborhoods, city services, and the news media as integral parts of the disaster that resulted from the heat wave in Chicago.<br /><br /> The first problem examined by Klinenberg was isolation.  Many of the victims perished alone, without any companions nearby.  Of the 739 bodies that were found dead, 170 of them went unclaimed showing the intensity of loneliness of those who perished.  Klinenberg says that elderly isolation is the result of demographic shifts, crime, spatial transformation, and substance abuse problems.  Adding to the problem, many of the elderly people lived in sealed rooms that did not allow for windows to be opened.<br /><br /> In the following chapter, Klinenberg examines the urban neighborhood and relates social structure to the isolation theory.  He concludes that high poverty plays an important role when evaluating who is at risk for heat waves.  Klinenberg emphasizes that these segregated areas do not allow people to establish social connections.  Depleted buildings and violent crimes lead to further isolation.  Once isolated, an event such as a heat wave disproportionately places certain individuals at an elevated risk to be affected by a disaster situation.<br /><br /> After examining the urban neighborhood, Klinenberg discovers that services provided by the city were not equally distributed.  He concludes that support services should not be in the hands of government control.  When you place the power into institutional organizations, services are distributed unequally and only offer aid to certain groups of people.  Many people struggle to keep up with those benefiting and give up the chase for the services offered.  Without adequate services, such as air-conditioning, people are placed at elevated risks from dying from a heat wave.<br /><br /> In his last analysis of the Chicago catastrophe, Klinenberg ties in the news media and their relevance to the heat wave in Chicago.  The way the news is distributed is tied in to fit what specific people want to hear.  For example, suburban residents were often not informed of the underlying problems related to the heat wave.  Instead, the mayor spoke only of the event as being a natural disaster that could not have been avoided.  Often, the people not affected by disasters are those that speak of the event.  They are able to shape what is talked about and displace talk over the social problems related to the disaster.<br /><br /> Together, the factors discussed helped shape the eventsinvolved with the heat wave in Chicago.  The socially isolated people seemed to be at the highest risk from the disaster.  This incident represented how different groups and unrepresented and how certain people can control what is taken out of an event.  Klinenberg closely examines the socially isolated to show that connections are important, and one is in threat without having connections.<br /><br /> However, Klinenberg fails to mention how certain people are motivated in different ways.  He follows the thought of being isolated as a threat to one's health.  Little talk is given to those who choose to be isolated.  While some people feel as though they need people around them, others feel that isolation is the only way to break away from the mass crowd.  Isolation does not result from one factor alone.  People choose to remove themselves from society for many different reasons.<br /><br /> Also, Klinenberg fails to mention what is needed to change the current situations in Chicago.  It is important to understand what happened in Chicago, but it would be hard to change the situation without a well-thought plan.  Social and political institutions seem to be a starting point for most changes.  We need to draw attention on how to change corrupt practice from political institutions.  We must establish equal rights again and allow everyone to have access to city services.  Without a plan, things will continue to go as they always have and attention on unequal practices will be displaced.<br /><br /> The disaster that occurred in Chicago was not the heat wave itself; it was the underlying social problems that stemmed from the heat wave.  This put certain groups of people at elevated risks for heat related death.  Attention must be given to heat wave disasters; they cause more deaths every year than all other natural disasters.  The victims deserve equal rights and services.  By doing so, life can be protected and shared among all groups of people.e in Chicago.

0345350499|5.0|I agree with the reviewer below who took issue with labelling this book as a \\"feminist\\" retelling of the Arthurian legend. Last I checked, feminism was rooted in female solidarity and sisterhood. I challenge any reader to find a single female character in this book who does a single kind, generous or supportive thing to/for another woman, with no gain for herself. The female relationships are largely shallow or antagonistic, and the male-female relationships take up a far greater chunk of the plot and character development. Just like in the traditional versions.  <br /> <br />That doesn't mean it's not great. It's fantastically written. The range of characters Bradley brings to life is nearly unbelievable. I can open it literally anywhere and become absorbed in reading--seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling, tasting everything. Definitely Bradley's best work. But be warned: Arthurian tales are always dark (they have to be), but the way the women treat themselves and each other here is just plain depressing.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This is another excellent film from the great director Michael Mann, Also another stunning portrait of L.A. as scene in Heat ( 1995 ). If you liked the film Heat then the chances of you liking this film are very high. Although the story sometimes seems a little predictable and unprobable it's a great one. Tom Cruise plays a hitman named Vincent, which he portrays beautifully, on a job in L.A. where he has a taxi chauffeur him around to his 5 hits. Max, portrayed by the extremely talented Jamie Foxx, is the cab driver Vincent decides to take a ride from. On their trail is Detective Fanning, a great supporting character played by Mark Ruffalo. In my opinion this is a performance for Tom Cruise that shows his acting talents better than ever before. Although Tom Cruise is great he is slightly upstaged by Jamie Foxx. In a role that shows his acting talents better than before, Foxx is wonderful as the down to earth and funny Max. This movie is for anyone who finds themselves a fan of Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Mann and anyone who just likes well made suspenseful movies.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I think this film would have been much more enjoyable if I had gone out for pizza before going to the theater, as I had originally planned. Instead, I waited until after, and could think of little during the movie but thick dough, tantalizing sauce, and melted cheese. There were a few points in the movie where I thought about soda with big chunks of ice in it, but for the most part, I was completely focused on pizza.  <br />Dave Fischer <br /> <br />
B000065V9Y|5.0|Peter Gabriel immersed himself in the opening of his recording studio two years before releasing Us in 1992. He meticulously picked out all the equipment and oversaw its construction. It all led to the culminating recording of his career, Us, a sonically perfect album where musical nuances can easily be picked out even by the most amateur ear. <br /> It was no mistake that Gabriel hired the best-and for the most part, his usual-studio musicians. He wanted every note played to be essential to the album as a whole, or as fleeting as pop music allows a note to be. Drummer Manu Katch had never been so incisive in his craft, playing in a controlled and precise manner, setting a new bar for all drummers. The same can be said about guitarist/producer David Rhodes.  <br /> This recording is a painstaking study of human relationships-more specifically heartbreak-with the exception of two tracks, \\"Steam\\" and \\"Kiss that Frog.\\" They seem to belong to a different album; they are not-so-subtle references to sexual acts. Lyrics such as \\"Let me introduce his frogness, you alone can get him singing,\\" make their content quite clear. <br />  The album opens with \\"Come Talk to Me,\\" a plea reminiscent of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique's subtext. The music sways with a distorted string section and a bagpipe, painting a dramatic picture and scoring a wrenching supplication for attention. \\"Blood of Eden\\" tells an almost biblical story, one of birth and death, love and hate, creation and destruction. The stanzas are arranged like folk songs from parts of Africa, in cyclical form and with codas. \\"The Washing of the Water\\" is a prayerlike song where the \\"river\\" could be a deity and the singer is seeking release from unrequited love. Again, Berlioz's subtext comes into play. <br /> Us opened the door to new musical sensibilities in 1990s popular music. It's hard to imagine the success of bands like Phish or Rusted Root without this recording. <br />
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Search no more for the perfect gift for the kids. The position has been filled by \\"Mary Poppins.\\"  <br /> <br />The 1964 musical about the \\"practically perfect\\" nanny sails into stores this week in a refined and polished two-disc anniversary-edition DVD.  <br />      <br />Poppins brings a much-needed sense of joy to the strict Banks household in 1910 London. She's the answer to her two young charges' prayers.  <br /> <br />\\"In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun,\\" she tells them. \\"You find the fun and - snap - the job's a game.\\"  <br /> <br />Poppins' panache and a magic carpetbag of tricks made the film a huge hit, rescuing the financially struggling Disney studio. It was Broadway star Julie Andrews' first film, the third for co-star Dick Van Dyke and the last for Arthur Treacher (Constable Jones).  <br /> <br />It won five Oscars, the most for any Disney film, including best actress for Andrews and best song, \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee,\\" by composer brothers Richard and Robert Sherman. But Oscar easily could have picked \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\\" or Disney's favorite, \\"Feed the Birds.\\"  <br /> <br />The supercalifragilisticexpialidocious DVD set includes lots of new bonus material, including a cartoon starring Andrews, a game and a deleted song, \\"Chimpanzoo.\\" Andrews and Van Dyke provide audio commentary and appear in a musical reunion.  <br /> <br />The best extra is a 50-minute featurette that describes Walt Disney's 20-year struggle to make the film. Also, Van Dyke laughs about his fake cockney accent. \\"It's amazing how the British forgave me,\\" he says. Glynis Johns tells how Disney had to sweet-talk her to play Mrs. Banks. \\"When I think of how nearly I didn't do it, it's amazing, because I'm so proud to be a part of it,\\" she says  <br />
B000001ESP|5.0|It can be hard for a neophyte to pick a specific recording for proper introduction to Rush, as their career spans 17 studio albums. Most fans would point said newbie to Moving Pictures, the best selling Rush album-four times platinum in the U.S.-and the recording that defined the band's fortunes thereafter. <br /> At its release time, Moving Pictures was considered to be a Heavy Metal album. This assertion is wrong, for it was the first time bassist and lead vocalist Geddy Lee toned down his signature shriek, and guitarist Alex Lifeson focused his guitar sound more than ever before. A good example of this \\"mellower\\" Rush is \\"Vital Signs,\\" where there are no over-the-top guitar riffs, intricate synthesizer arrangements, or odd time signatures. <br /> The album starts with four fundamental songs of the Rush catalogue-\\"Tom Sawyer\\" being the staple of the band to this date-and finishes with three of the better songs from the aforementioned. \\"Through the Camera Eye,\\" a 10-minute etude of daily life in London and New York City, has every trait that should be important in a song: solid production values, clear and balanced sound, meaningful lyrics, a striking equilibrium of major and minor keys modulating to evoke a sentiment, and virtuosic playing.  <br /> \\"Witch Hunt\\" is the production piece of the album. The band has admitted to a heavy rerecording and retooling of the song. Lyrically, it is an indictment of the mob mentality and a song that remains current with our times. Sonically, Lifeson had never been so sinister in his arrangements and choice of sounds.  <br /> Arguably, intellectual rock `n' roll reached its zenith with this recording. Every Rush knockoff band-A Perfect Circle, Dream Theatre, Coheed & Cambria-has tried to emulate Moving Pictures at some point during their careers to no avail. <br />
B00005JNLY|3.0|It's fitting that James L. Brooks would call his new movie \\"Spanglish.\\" He certainly knows a thing or two about jamming two distinct languages together to make a messy, vivid, wildly popular hybrid.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for someone to thank (or blame) for the merging of television and movies into a new, mongrel language, Brooks is your man. He worked first in television, creating the touchstone 1970s sitcoms \\"Taxi\\" and \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" and its spinoffs.  <br /> <br />In the '80s, he jumped to movies -- a much bigger leap in those days -- winning multiple Oscars his first time out, with \\"Terms of Endearment,\\" and following up with the hit \\"Broadcast News.\\"  <br /> <br />Along the way, he practically invented the dramedy, that audience-pleasing combination of the TV sitcom and the movie tear-jerker that forces you -- even against your will -- to laugh through your tears.  <br /> <br />With \\"Spanglish,\\" his fifth film as writer-director, Brooks produces plenty of laughter and tears. But he does not produce either a coherent, focused story or the sort of complex, full-blooded characters who can take the movie beyond sitcom punch lines and the heartwarming lessons of the \\"very special episode.\\"  <br /> <br />Flor (Paz Vega) moves from Mexico to Los Angeles in search of a better life for her daughter, 12-year-old Cristina (Shelbie Bruce). The search leads her to the exotic land of Bel Air, where she takes a job as a housekeeper for the rich, successful, desperately unhappy Clasky family.  <br /> <br />Why all the unhappiness? Astonishingly for such a smart writer, Brooks pins the blame on one person: Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni), a neurotic, self-involved woman who is so tightly wound you expect her head to start spinning like Linda Blair's in \\"The Exorcist.\\"  <br /> <br />The comparison is not out of line. Deborah is possessed by the competitive, consumerist demons of upper-middle-class America, and they have turned her into a monster who humiliates her children, neglects her husband, betrays those she loves and exercises herself to the point of exhaustion. Leoni, an agile comedian, does her best to make Deborah human, but her writer-director is working against her.  <br /> <br />First, Brooks gives her a husband (Adam Sandler) so kind, forgiving and self-effacing even his mother-in-law (the hilarious Cloris Leachman, in the film's best performance) warns Deborah she won't find another man as good as he is.  <br /> <br />Then Brooks offers up Deborah's opposite, Flor, who is not only a great mother but also -- as Deborah notices immediately -- absolutely gorgeous.  <br /> <br />Brooks puts these three characters, along with Cristina and the Clasky's vulnerable, chubby daughter, Bernice, into a series of sketches that clunk along, without narrative flow, to something of a resolution.  <br /> <br />That resolution comes, of course, with a laugh followed by a lump in the throat. After all this time, Brooks knows how to pull those strings. But this time the strings are visible, and you may want to yank back.  <br />
B00005JN4O|5.0|This is my new favorite Johnny Dep movie.  In fact the whole movie was beautifully cast, in my opinion, and it is a fitting tribute to the writer of one of my all-time favorite movies, Peter Pan. <br />     The story was moving, humorous, and inspiring for all ages.  My 15-year-old grandson immediately wanted to get a leather-bound journal and start jotting down his own ideas for stories; although the 6 year old thought is moved too slowly. <br />     We saw it twice at the theatre and can hardly wait for it to come out on DVD.
B0006J28KU|5.0|I've been waiting for this since DVDs were introduced. The original pressings of Heat were among the very first generation of DVDs released- poor encoding quality, little or no extras. With commentary, deleted scenes and extras- this edition finally rights a criminal wrong. Fans of Michael Mann, Al Pacino, DeNiro, Kilmer, etc will be richly rewarded. Heat owns all crime films and if you just saw Collateral you saw a fizzy remix of this classic. \\"30 seconds flat if you spot the Heat around the corner. That's the discipline.\\"
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This CD is great and in my opinion it is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. First off you have one of the greatest guitarist of all time the mighty Van Halen, who truely displays his genius on this album and you got the great david lee roth, one of my favorte singers of all time. The songs all rock to, my favorite is probably the kinks cover You really got me or running with devil but all the songs kick ass.  Also you got eruption on here one of the greatest guitar solos of all time. No rock and roll collection is complete without this brilliant CD, pure rock and roll.  I would also like to say keep Rock and Roll alive and check out the kick ass new band SILVERTIDE!!  I would just like to tell Henry Mcputer to shut the hell up, Limp Bizkit is one of the least talented rock bands to ever walk this world, well Van Halen are rock greats.    down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.  The Darkness  Jet   Hurricane Party  Parchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)  Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)  and the best new band Silvertide
B0002G2B2M|5.0|This is a brilliant movie.  But it is `different'. <br /> <br />It makes you think. <br /> <br />The acting is great.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is in my opinion AC/DC's best album. Bon Scott also was a great singer and shows what rock and roll is about on this album. This CD should without a doubt be listed up there with all the other great rock and roll albums. Best tunes on here are probably Highway to Hell and Touch to Much. I would also like to say if you like rock and roll and want to see it live on check out the rocking band silvertide.  down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.  The Darkness  Jet   Hurricane Party  Parchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)  Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)  and the best new band Silvertide
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This has always been a sentimental favorite of mine, and is the type a film you can easily relate to, as it readily reminds many of us what life was like as a teenager in high school. The plot is not hard to figure out: five teens from seemingly diverse backgrounds are sent to spend a day in detention. One is a wrestler, one is a popular \\"princess,\\" one is a brainy goody-goody, one is a criminal, and the other is a quiet, closed-off loner. Throughout the day, they spend moments picking at one another, only to eventually open up to each other, to discover that they all aren't that different from one another. The transition that takes place in this film -- done in quite a beautifully dramatic and cathartic way -- is something that's hard not to be moved by.<br /><br />Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy did fantastic jobs in their respective roles, and special mention must be given to Paul Gleason as the obstinate school principal. An excellent film that will provide many with laughs, and genuinely heartwarming, poignant moments. A classic.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop is definitely one of the top 3 U2 CDs for me. I was stunned when it was panned so harshly when it came out. I was revelling in the sound of the CD. NONE of the music is techno, not even mofo. For real techno music, find some Plaid or Orbital. Mofo has some industrial leanings, but it's basically a driving, rhythmic track which bursts with emotion. It is electronic in nature, but IMO, that doesn't make it techno.    This CD has what I consider to be the BEST U2 single ever, \\"If God Would Send His Angels\\". The remixed version on the single is a bit better than this album version, but the album version is no slouch.     Then you have Please with that glorious bassline and ominous sound and, what I think is hilarious, \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" which hauled out all the topical cheesy American society issues at that time.    There are some of U2's best melodies on this CD too--very very melodic CD including aforementioned \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\", \\"Please\\", and \\"Do You Feel Loved\\".  This CD IS NOT EXPERIMENTAL.  It is a good artistic statement by U2, but it is VERY listenable and deep nonetheless.    From the starting, accessible, track of Discoteque, on to \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", which is a real jam, through the closer of \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\", this is a GREAT POP/ROCK CD that was horribly and wrongly maligned for years. This CD is excellent.
B000002GYR|5.0|I am one of those listeners who don't believe drug abuse and alcoholic behaviors an artist make. Just as I think Billy Holiday and Janis Joplins early recordings when their voice weren't ravaged with drinking are sublime, I think Tom Waits first album is up there as one of his best (if NOT the best). <br /> <br />Closing Time is an amazing album when you consider the time period that it was recorded. It has a different sound to everything else that was going on and a very intimate, un-slick production feel. <br /> <br />His voice, while gravely, is incredibly strong and also sweet-not the raspy \\"cool\\" Tom Waits we know today. While not a hugely experimental (by today's standards CDs) album, it has a dark beauty that reminds me of Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake. This is a man who FEELS, people, and yes, is actually terrified to show it! <br /> <br />I first started listening to this CD after a late night shift while it was dark and raining. When the first piano chords came in over the speakers, I knew I was in for something incredibly different. A genuine story teller with a gift for portraying intimate stories in way that becomes humanely universal, the soft horns and fade outs add to this atmospheric album. I honestly felt like I had stumbled onto a chain-smoking failing musician who was playing his demons out onto the piano in a church basement. At times overwhelming and romantically depressing, sometimes I am shocked that Tom Waits is around today. <br /> <br />His other albums are powerful as well, but there is something special about the intimacy and fully-fleshed feel of his first album. I personally suggest you listen to it late at night while looking out of a window into a rainy city block. <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|2.0|Okay, since there are almost a 1000 posts all I really want to say is that it really, really bothered me that they weren't wearing their robes throughout most of the movie.  It distorted my \\"suspension of disbelief\\".  That and the sets were not like what was described in the book.  I mean, come on, where in the HP series does Harry have to go down a long bridge and rocky crags to get to Hagrid's hut?  They also could have had more Hagrid and Snape scenes.  I am such a fan of the series and I just felt so let down by this movie.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I found this show, now in its 5th season on the WB, on one of my local stations in re-runs of its earlier seasons.  I am also a fan of similar WB shows like Everwood and Dawson's Creek but the writing and performance of the cast on Gilmore Girls is outstanding.  All of the characters work so well together and the quick comedy quips are very funny.  After watching the show in re-runs, I had to get the first season to see how it all began and I was not disappointed.  The episodes are great and the extras were ok too.  I would reccomend this show to anyone that likes quality and very funny tv shows.  Overall a great DVD set and cant wait to get season 2.
B000003TA4|1.0|Everyone who likes nirvana tell us what you like about them. If you like the guitar then you never heard Guns n' Roses or music like that. I you like the lyrics then i'm amazed you can understand them. if its the drumming then you got a little taste but not much. so do tell!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie was good, and it deserves the props it gets. Tom Cruise did a tremendous job playing a hit man who goes on a one-night killing spree with the (unwilling) help of Jamie Foxx, who continues to step his game up. Jada Pinkett plays a supporting role in the film, and she does a great job too. This is a movie review and not a book review, so I'm not going to make this long. All I can tell you is if you are a fan of Cruise or Foxx, you will enjoy this movie for the fact that you get to see them in a different light.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|After hearing all the rave reviews about this album, I had to check it out. I was not disappointed. It's not very often that a person can find an album and enjoy every song on it. I personally enjoy Rebellion(Lies), Neighborhood #3 (Power Outage), and Crown of Love. Not to disclaim any of the other songs, they're all great. I can see how some may compare this band to Modest Mouse and the like, but I feel the they differentiate themselves from the rest. Go and buy this album!
6302516919|5.0|Born in Detroit but powered from the nether world.  Christine was four-wheeled evil in the horror movie that bore her name.  The '58 Plymouth Fury was acquired by a high school student by the name of Arnie Cunningham.  When he 1st bought Christine she was a rusted out pile of junk.  With hard work and effort he was able to transform this wreck into a thing of awesome power and beauty, and she was something to behold.    To begin with Arnie was a nurd, and was bullied by everyone at school, and nagged constantly by his parents.  Though Christine's powers Arnie was transformed into a very outgoing, handsome and physically powerful dude who took no crap from anyone, including his Mom and Dad.  He no longer allowed himself to be bullied or pushed around by family, friends or anyone who came between he and his beauty Christine.  He worshiped her and she took care of and protected him to the very end.  Theirs was a true love - hate relationship.  She was very jealous and would not allow anyone to come between she and Arnie.      If anyone tried to break up this very powerful relationship they would come to pay dearly.  Christine would wreak vengence on any one who dared to cross her or Arnie.  Those mesmerized by her fire engine red beauty, dual carbs, dual exhaust with tremendous power were in for a rude awakening - that is if they even managed to wake up from the nightmare called Christine.    Of all the movies I've watched, this one is without any doubt my favorite.  I have lost tract of all the times I've watched it.  I never tire or seeing it.  After I've seen most movies once I don't care to watch them again.  I recorded it on VCR when it first played on TV and a year or so back when the DVD came out I had to have it.  I love this movie.     Probably a lot has to do with my love of cars.  I once had a 1950 Ford with a flathead mill, and dual exhaust that no one could touch.  I also owned a 1987 Camaro which was the last year General Motors installed a four barrel carb.  The next year they went to fuel injection.  There were not too many that could take me and my car in a race.  The mill was more powerful then the then Corvette engines that were coming out.  One guy wanted to just buy the engine.      I also have over 400 small scale 'die cast' cars, trucks, hot rods and motorcycles in display cases.  Mostly Franklin Mint and Danbury Mint 1/24 scale.   I just received my 1/18 die cast of Christine from the 'Collectors Guild' today from UPS and she is 'cherry.'  Even though it is not in 1/24 and is the larger 1/18 I still had to have her.  She is  Red with a white top, gold side strip, highly detailed interior and chassis, extremely detailed interior and chasis, steerable front wheels, opening doors, hood and trunk, dual exhaust, dual carbs.  She is a beauty.  I love her.    My favorite part of the movie is when Arnie and Dennis are speeding down the highway at night in Christine.  Arnie says, \\"There is nothing finer than a man driving, behind the wheel of his own car.\\"  I would have to add, a car that he loves and cherishes.    Rent the DVD or Video, or better yet buy one.  If you love cars like I do you won't regret it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I thought they would never improve on Nimrod, but this just rocks.They have improved and matured so much it's unbelievable. <br />Is it punk? Is it pop? Do we care? It's punkier than London Calling, and we didn't think to quibble then did we! They have totally spat in the face of the critics who wrote them off, with this one, and bloody good luck to them too. I haven't played anything else all week and the radio is REALLY boring unless a Green Day track comes on.Love the Who-like mini rock operas (and I think I hear a bit of Mott The Hoople too!).I just can't see how they can top this. <br />Buy it,burn it or steal it now!
B000002GLE|5.0|Okay, so admittedly, this is a reactionary review because I've seen too many people give misleading and superficial representations of this album (kind of annoying, no?).  Onto the review... <br /> <br />It's a great live double-disc set and it is heavily influenced by Sting's band comprised of jazz musicians.  But, only one song could be considered jazz (Dream of the Blue Turtles) and that's the one without much of a solo section (very un-jazz-like).  This lineup is one of the best I've ever come across in pop music.  The keyboard solos on some of these songs are so smokin' I shake my head and laugh sometimes when I'm listening to it. <br /> <br />Another quick thing to clear up.  On this album and on Dream of The Blue Turtles, Sting gives up the bass (replaced by Darryl Jones) and plays guitar.  He's actually a pretty good rhythm guitar player. <br /> <br />So is it good?  Absolutely.  And you get to hear quite a few of Sting's solo songs as well as some Police material.  It's a great album with lots of color and excitement.  You can even appreciate Branford Marsalis doing a mid-80's rap over one of the choruses.  It's kind of cheezy now, but given the time period, it was fresh and fun. <br /> <br />So, as a recommendation, let me say that I taped a copy of this CD way back when I didn't have a CD player in my car and would just let it repeat itself over and over in my car wherever I went.  I think you'll really dig this album.
B00063EMJG|2.0|This retrospective explores the music of sixties/seventies rocker Neil Young, who apparently has done little recording in the last 25 years. In fact, the newest recording in this collection dates back to the early '90s. Even before that, it seems Young's output was so sparse and sporadic that almost every song on \\"Greatest Hits\\" has already been released about six times. <br /> <br />So, whatever happened to this guy? Did he rake in so much money from his handful of records that he retired? Or did he OD in the back of a limo, forgotten and irrelevant? There's no clue on \\"Greatest Hits.\\" It's too bad he disappeared, because the inescapable conclusion one draws from listening to this album is that the guy had a lot of potential. <br /> <br />Anyway, these tracks bring back a lot of memories of my high school and college days, but I have a vague recollection that Young released some other songs back then that were less repetitive and more adventurous, but it's hard to say, because I don't get that impression from this album.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I bought this CD from Amazon.com the day after I saw the movie.  The CD is fantastic esepcially \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\" and Believe by Josh Groban.  I am certain Believe will be nominated for best song at the Oscars.  What really surprised me was the quality of the sound - the orchestra sounds like they are in your car.
B00005JN0T|5.0|From start to finish, this DVD  is just magnificent. <br />The Sound is engineered superbly, and you absolutely MUST  have 5.1 surround to comprehend things. <br />The cast is great, but the FX  are beyond great. <br />This version of the film includes few extras ( technically one major one ), but the scenes are just brilliant, and each eye-popping surprise is just excellent. <br />Aurally, and visually, a stunning work, that is worth every penny for the DVD. Crank up the sound too ... the opening credits are just great.
B00005JKES|1.0|2005 is 15 days away, and still no pilot.  This incomplete set was released almost 4 years ago, and still the pilot has not been released for U.S. viewers on DVD.  Such a shame.   <br />  I cant understand how all of you are giving this set 4 and 5 stars, WTF are you thinking?  Review the DVD, not the show.  The show was awesome, groundbreaking, but this DVD set sux.  And why doesnt the Amazon reviewer make any mention of the missing 2 hour pilot?  So sad.  Sorry to say, but this DVD release is not worth 30 bucks, maybe if it included the COMPLETE UNCUT FIRST SEASON... <br />  Such a shame that a wonderful show has been treated so poorly by the powers that be.  Obviously they only care about the bottom line, otherwise Artisan, Paramount and Viacom would have done this right the first time and included the pilot that started the freakin show.  DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />  The fact that VHS copies of the pilot cost like 80 bucks, and the imported crappy DVD of the pilot is almost as much should be a wake up call to execs.  WE WANT THE PILOT ON DVD RELEASED ALREADY, otherwise what's the point of this set?  I mean seriously, you tell me.  It's not the first season if it doesn't include THE FREAKIN EPISODE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!
0226443221|3.0|Countless movies and books have been based on natural disasters. After all, what is more powerful or awe-inspiring than an F5 tornado, blowing away heavy machinery as if it were nothing? Who isn't slightly alarmed at the possibility of a dormant volcano suddenly erupting and blanketing a sleep mountain town in lava? But sociologist Eric Klinenberg's Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago examines a quieter, less thought about natural disaster: heat waves. More specifically he examines the famous heat wave that hit Chicago in 1995, ultimately causing over 700 deaths. Furthermore, he examines how, in this day and age, so many people could be so profoundly affected by something that we would appear to have a handle on. The main aspect Klinenberg brings up is that of social isolation and how this pervasive trend could end up ultimately costing us our lives. But how does something like this happen, he wonders; how, with all of our modern technology and community outreach programs are people still \\"left behind.\\" Furthermore, who are these people and how is it that our society puts certain people in these positions. With a comprehensive account of the event and the culmination of his own data, Klinenberg presents are very interesting view on social constructs in the context of natural, momentous events that are out of human control.
0930289455|5.0|This is only for true fans...... <br />It is a shocking graphic novel but it shows us the origins of the Joker and just how evil he is and has become.  This is my favorite of all the Joker stories.  I think the plot and the origins of the Joker are very clever and well done.  The Batman is just as intense.   <br />I think I will re-read it when I get home.  A great buy!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This album gave a new meaning to hair band rock/metal in 86'. It's probably the most recognizable rock album of the 80's and should definately be considered a \\"classic\\". From start to finish its filled with power,talent,and emotion. Every member gives their all to demonstrate what \\"hard rock\\" should sound like;and do it beautifully. Buy this one!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everyone who watches an episode of this series begs for more.  I will not summarize the plot or premise (plenty of others have already done so), but I will relate the impact that Firefly has.    A friend showed me the two-hour pilot in the middle of the night.  I immediately asked to see the next episode, staying up to the wee hours of the morn.  I bought the DVD and my wife and I watched all the episodes inside of a week.    My father visited for a week, and I introduced him to the pilot.  He immediately asked to watch the next installment.  Every night of his vacation he wanted more Firefly.  He had seen everything before returning home and buying the DVD for himself.    My father showed Firefly to my mother.  She stayed up all night with my young cousin and watched EVERY EPISODE back-to-back, finishing at 6:00am.    Friends, family, co-workers -- everyone I know who has given a chance to this show fell in love with it.  You should give it a shot as well.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Shania Twain has one of the best voices of any female singer today and this collection of Greatest Hits showcases it to the fullest.  Some of my personal favorites are on this collection, including \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\\", \\"Up!\\", \\"From This Moment\\", \\"You're Still The One\\", \\"Love Gets Me Every Time\\", \\"You Win My Love\\", and \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\".  The new songs are not anything spectacular but are still pretty good.  Although at first I didn't like it, the song \\"Party For Two\\" has grown on me and now it is one of my favorites.  The version with Billy Currington is way better than the version with Mark McGrath.  Not all of it is due to Mark's singing but Billy's singing plus the general sound of the \\"country\\" version make it a better version of the song.   <br /> <br />Generally speaking, this is a great collection of songs but I do have two minor criticism about the cd.  One, I can understand why the \\"single\\" versions of songs are usually the ones chosen to be put on hits collections and most of the ones on this cd are not too bad but the version of \\"(If Your're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here\\", one of my favorite songs of Shania in its original version, on this cd has to be the worst edit of a song I have ever heard.  It just sounds like nails on a blackboard to my ears every time I hear the abrupt edit at the end of of the song.  Also, another of my favorite Shania songs, \\"When You Kiss Me\\", did not even make this collection but I guess since it wasn't a major hit I can't complain too much.  Why it wasn't a major hit is a great mystery to me because I personally think it is the best song she's ever written but oh well.  Other than my two complaints, this is still a great collection that I would recommend to anyone who likes a good blend of country and pop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0596007124|5.0|So, you got your ideas about Java and basic OO programming fixed and want to go deeper? This is the perfect book to help you in your quest. It's an easy to read but still very technical and precise tutorial on design patterns and OO design strategies. It finally demistifies a central part of OO programming that was considered hard and very advanced just because there were no well done and accessible text describing it. And plus, you will get all this in a lively, varied, funny and attention-catching exposition. Superficially it appears just a book made by \\"unconventiional\\" authors who like to personalize their work, but behind it are important ideas about what makes learning, studying and paying attention hard and painful or easy and fun.<br />If you read the preface and pay attention to how the book is organized you will also get a lesson in learning theory and on how to make your teaching more effective and interesting and  your study hours more rewarding. So it is a very useful book both for the student and the teacher.<br />We need a translation in italian SOON! ;)<br />My only perplexity is this: Kathy I know your ideas about reviving the stagnant tech book market by making books more fun and passionating, but what's with the hot chick on the cover? OK, I agree it is way more interesting than the standard O'Reilly animals.. but still...that's exploiting hormons, not being interesting ;)<br />Anyhow.. number ONE book on design patterns, sorry GOF
B00005JMJG|5.0|this movie caught me by surprise..wasn't expecting much.. but it really did catch my attention, from start to finish.  highly recommend.  a lot of suttle things that you might miss if you don't pay attention
B00000AFGM|5.0|Great from start to finish.  A little more commercial or listener friendly than the rest, but still a must have.
B000001Y79|4.0|When I first heard this album, I gave it to my sister. I hated it. It's not that I was never into ska, but this album at first, did nothing for me, and for probably about two years, I did not think much of No Doubt, or give them much of a chance. My reasoning at the time, having only listened to \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" once, and burnt on the overplayed \\"Don't Speak\\", was that Gwen Stefani sounded a little whiny and annoying to me. <br /> <br />I don't know if I could ever pin point the day I started to unconsciously scheme to get the CD back from my sister. I am not a thief and would never steal from anyone, much less my baby sister, but I had heard a few tracks off of \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" at some point, and I felt this need to hear more. I did the right thing, and I bought the CD instead.  <br /> <br />\\"Just A Girl\\", despite intense airplay, is a song near and dear to my heart. I love this song, and count it as my favorite by this band because every girl has felt this way at one time or another.  In this song, Stefani lets loose that rage familiar to all women, and it feels good. The entire album is truly tragic. The themes of heartbreak reflect what Stefani was suffering at the time, adding a classic tortured air to this effort that I have seen in few albums to date, Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumors\\" being at the forefront of that short list.  <br /> <br />Gwen Stefani has a strange voice. On some songs, she sounds pretty darn good, while on others, she seems whiny or like she is trying to be some sort of Betty Boop character. On this album, the music and the lyrics transcend the whine to make for addictive listening.  <br /> <br />There are other ska acts out there that are more talented and more fun to listen to, but No Doubt is a solid, entertaining band, and this CD is an example of some of their best.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|An absolute gem.  Funniest movie of 2004 by far.
B0006284JQ|1.0|So this is what today's music has become?
068987474X|1.0|I have not read this book, but I have flipped through it at a bookstore and did see the Oprah episode.  I think that this book is far too simplistic and overlooks the fact that everyone is different and that it is impossible to see into someone's mind and know what he or she is thinking.  And how dull to constantly have to evaluate your relationships with other people and judge them against someone else's guidelines!   <br />The whole self-help trend, particularly in terms of dating books, just feels really creepy and controlling.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This was the last Manson cd I bought.  I really like it.  Very dark, and pushes the envelope.  I'd highly recommend it.
B00004Z459|5.0|I never thought I would see this on a mature site like this...All of these reviews saying \\"LP suxxx\\" and \\"they're not metal\\"; well, they're not metal, but they most certainly do not suck. Contrary to what some (ahem) people think, it does take a certain amount of skill to get to the top of a chart, and to have more than 10 number 1 songs. They sound like no one else, because, well, they are like no one else. You say that Chester sounds whiney, well I'm sure that half of you that say that haven't hitten puberty yet, so no judgement passed there. If you like the CD, get it. If you dont, then dont. It's not really like your opinion matters, because regardless of what you say, LP is still going to make money. Probably more than you ever will. I give it 5/5, only because that's all Amazon allows.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I hate buying the \\"director's cut\\" of a movie only to find out that they just added a few minutes of useless scenes. Daredevil the Director's Cut is NOT that type of director's cut. This is the cut they couldn't show on the big screen because the studio wanted a shorter movie that wasn't rated R and so major changes were made. This cut gives us more background on characters, more action, and more plot. You haven't really seen Daredevil until you have experienced this cut.
0062502182|5.0|A beautifully crafted story, well-worded and magical in its simplicity. I read it in a few hours.  <br /> <br />Some of the reviewers mentioned its poor and unevocative language, but I would caution that this book probably lost quite a bit in its translation into English. Knowing how to use simple language to maximum effect (like Hemingway) requires being not only a native speaker, but a talented writer. It is my suspicion that most translators are simply translators, not fiction writers themselves.  <br /> <br />That said, take the book as it is. As a treat for the spirit, it is a small treasure.
B000062XM3|5.0|Great great movie! THe rules of fight club, how the ending is a shock and the pixies' song in the movie. How great is that? Great acting from edward norton, scene fight, and the part where brad pitt just scared the hell out of that manager guy.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|For the first major motion picture of a Marvel Super Hero, the Comic book Enterprise chose Blade.  Surprisingly, he is a very low key, lesser-known `anti-hero' who never even had his own comic book.  Maybe that was the trick; use a hero that no one knew as a hero so the stigma of comic books wouldn't taint the popularity.  Let them find out he was born from the comic books AFTER they see the movie and like it.  Now, after several Marvel Character adaptations, including Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men and the soon be released Elektra and Fantastic Four, Blade has pulled through well with two movies and a third one just released.  He is the only character so far to get three movies.  But soon that will change when Spider-Man and X-Men get their third installments. <br /> <br />As for Blade's second movie he takes on a new breed of Vampires that are tougher to kill and even tougher to stomach when they are finally defeated.  An astute friend of mine made the comparison; `Blade 2 is to Blade what Aliens is to Alien...more of them and more dangerous', an accurate comparison.  There is even a Special Forces group of Vampires that Blade cautiously teams up with to take them on, because apparently, the current vampires don't want to be killed off by the next evolution of their own kind.  Recruiting the `Day Walker' seems to be their best choice.  If he gets killed in the process, so be it, one less problem for them to deal with. <br /> <br />If there was any hint of character development in the first movie, this one totally side steps it and goes straight for the adrenaline rush.  With scads of vampires to be killed in overblown spectacles of blood and illuminating effects, lots of ammunition and explosives to be set off and plenty of faces to be smacked around by Blade's wheel kicks, not to mention snide remarks made between Ron Perlman's character and Blade, we certainly get the sense that this movie was created to wow us, and wow us it does.  No shortage in action anda good plot make this a very worthy sequel that actually shows what could be done when comic book characters are developed to really show their ability.  <br />
B00005JN4O|5.0|Johnny does it again and Kate is perfect!  The Victorian Era is captured beautifully and the whole film was a feast for the eyes and imagination from beginning to end.  A wonderful film for the whole family (altho dad might think it a little corny)!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Everything about this is EXCELLENT! This has to be one of the most talented bunch of musicians I have seen together in a long time. I would have liked to seen more video of the bass guitar player. His work on the 6-string bass is out of this world. The video and audio quality of this DVD is second to none. I highly recommend this to any DT fan or anyone that enjoys talented musicians as I do. ENJOY!!!
0226443221|4.0|Klinenberg's investigation of the conditions and outcome of the 1995 tragedy deals with issues of human interdependence and examines the importance of local and regional communities in preventing future catastrophes of this kind.  Heat Wave takes a natural phenomenon and penetrates to issues of economic and social depravity, the echelon of neighborhood that one resides and the solitude that extends from those circumstances.

He is the only character so far to get three movies.  But soon that will change when Spider-Man and X-Men get their third installments. <br /> <br />As for Blade's first movie, it follows the basic good-guy-in-black, fight-monsters-with-a-monster scenario.  In this case, the good guy/monster is Wesley Snipes, who was most likely born to play the part.  He is a hybrid mutation of human and vampire, born to his nine-month pregnant mother who had just been bitten by a bloodsucker.  His only common weakness with them being his thirst for human blood; this brings a certain humanity to his role, displaying desires in himself for which he hates most in the Vampires.  It is never made clear what his true motivations are, or why he hates Vampires so much.  All we know is he loves hating them, and seems to love to killing them even more.  Although Snipes is an extremely competent actor, he doesn't delve much into the humanities and opts for the tough guy route most of the time. <br /> <br />For a comic book adaptation the movie is very violent, and the language is certainly nothing that would get past the comics code.  But it is an extremely entertaining action horror flick, and Snipes plays the roll with gut wrenching grittiness.  He doesn't seem to shy away from doing his own stunts and fight scenes either, displaying his athletic skills and martial arts prowess in almost every scene.  Another performance to be noted is Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost.  He eats up the scenes with scrappy ambition.  Frost represents a new order of Vampires who believe they should be out ruling society, instead of hiding in the shadows of it as the current generation does.         <br /> <br />The finale, which was completely re-shot for creative purposes and to maintain the humanity of the villain, is energetic and exciting.  The alternate ending can be found on the DVD, so you can see which is better in your own opinion.  <br />
B000056PWV|5.0|\\"Rear Window\\" is an extraordinarily clever movie. Though a thriller, it is fun to watch.  Alfred Hitchcock must have relished making it. RW is special in that there is only one location- Jimmy Stewart's rear-facing apartment. The ensuing claustrophobic effect only adds to the charm. Jimmy plays a big time \\"Life Magazine\\" photographer, laid up with a broken leg. With too much time on his hands, he spies on his neighbors in the building across the courtyard. What an assortment of cameras!  And what an assortment of characters! Each window holds a story. Just imagine the choreography the director had to manage. The \\"neighbors\\" include the struggling musician with strange friends and stranger parties, Miss Lonely Hearts, Miss Torso, the newlyweds, the couple with the little dog (!), and the man with the sickly wife. The husband, Raymond Burr, gives Stewart bad vibes right away. Some bizarre actions-and sounds (!)- emanating from that apartment leads Stewart to believe that Burr has killed the wife and disposed of her in a suitcase. In 1954, Burr still was cast as a bad guy. The problem is that no one listens to Jimmy. His ravishing girlfriend (Grace Kelly), his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) and his detective buddy, (Wendell Corey) all think Jimmy has gone stir crazy from inactivity. Suddenly, in a pivotal nighttime moment, Kelly believes him! Dressed to the nines, she actually breaks into Burr's apartment! This reviewer won't divulge the resolution but Hitchcock does a masterful job in resolving the kaleidoscopic sagas of the vanishing wife and those wonderful folks in the windows. How grateful we are that they kept their shades up.  (Most of the time) It's delightful to think about how many subplots this classic movie has. Many praise Stewart's work in RW but this reviewer would shed the spotlight on Kelly, the perfect uptown girl, icy and sexy all at the same time. Watch for that second story job in an expensive calf length dress! RW was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay but came away empty handed at Oscar time. Why it was not nominated for cinematography is a mystery- since RW is a photographic marvel Kelly did win the Oscar for her role in \\"The Country Girl\\".  The New York film Critics also bestowed on her their Best Actress Award for \\"Rear Window\\", \\"The Country Girl\\" and another Hitchcock classic-\\"Dial M for Murder\\". 1954 was quite a year for Grace.  The Academy Awards may have passed RW by but movie fans should not. This is one of those films that get better with time and are more appealing on the fifth viewing than the first. The sheer visual effects alone mark RW as a jewel.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|1.0|This movie so bad.  Will Ferrell should have stayed on SNL.  His decision to leave SNL to do movies was as wise as Shelley Long leaving Cheers to do movies. <br /> <br />'Anchorman' is almost totally void of any enertainment value for anyone with an IQ above 10.  It is a bad, worthless and inane movie.  I had to give it one star because Amazon does not allow zero or negative stars. <br /> <br />The movie has three very brief redeeming bits... the Indian food in a diaper comment, Christina Applegate in an apron, and the Avengers theme during a fight.  That is it. <br /> <br />Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson should fire their agents or leave Hollywood for good.  Until they learn how to pick a good movie, I will not see anymore movies with either of those three idiots. <br /> <br />For your own sake, do not waste any money by renting or buying this amazingly bad movie.  Look for this movie to sweep The Razzies.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely bones is not by any means a story for everyone. Right off the bat anyone who picks up this book will know whether or not it is for them. Sebold starts off with an eye-opening, and considerably disturbing portrayal of a young girl, Susie Salmon's, rape and murder by an older man from her own quiet suburban neighborhood. For some people this is where the story begins and ends, but if you continue to read past this opening scene, you will find an extremely well written story. <br />The story follows the struggles of Susie's parents and two younger siblings after her murder from just about every angle imaginable. It places the reader in the midst of this tragedy, and in the heart of the Salmons home. It describes Susie's experiences in heaven, as she watches her family grow up and grow apart. This book exposes all the things a family most often doesn't talk about, making it seem even more real to the reader. <br />Overall I thought that this was an excellent book. For anyone that can handle some of the more disturbing parts of the book, such as the opening chapter, or other details about Susie's murder I strongly recommend it The only complaint I have is I think that Sebold concludes the book with a very week ending. It is not consistent with the quality of the rest of the story. Still it was a very interesting book.
630460288X|4.0|Wes usually takes the hero role but maybe he should consider taking more villians. He makes Simon Phoenix a vibrant crackling character that really owns this movie. Everyone does a game job and seems to be having fun in this one. Even Sly is tolerable! <br /> <br />The film begins in present day and then catapults into futuristic LA after the world is nearly destroyed by our violent tendencies. As Phoenix opines \\"the world has turned into a bunch of robed sissies\\". How do our hero and villian get transported into time? Well it seems a mix up back in the day got our two leads locked in cryo-prison where they stayed frozen in their distinctive eras. At a parole hearing Phoenix escapes and the new world is needless to say ill equipped to handle a criminal as violent as he is. This leads to the reanimation of Stallone and the chase is on.  <br /> <br />They do a good job with the fish out of water element and as I said they have some good supporting work. Bullock, Leary, and Bratt do good jobs in their roles and the story while a little flat at times never bogs down too much. The movie knows it is here to entertain and it does that in spades.
B000002UR7|2.0|Agree with the guy who said a lot of people listened to this after hearing OK Computer.  That said - this album isn't much good.  But it if you really, really, really like \\"Creep\\" - otherwise, it's just really depressing guitar fuzz.  Couple of other good tracks - \\"Lurgee,\\" but otherwise... These guys got a lot better.
B000002MP2|5.0|Just as the Seattle wave was beginning the end out comes Green Day. Just great strait ahead punk rock, perfect for the anti social teenagers of the time. The cover art says it all, it was a crazy time then hard to belive it was 10 years ago. Even today this record holds it's own with the best of them. Around half this album is on Green Day's greatest hits, and the other half are just as good. 95/100

B000001FS3|5.0|The Joshua Tree came at a time when synth pop and hair metal ruled the charts granting the perfect opprutunity for change. This is the album that changed the face of music in that glamourous over the top decade. It was more sincere and honest in it's songwriting which was a breath of fresh air for many avid and fed up music enthusiasts. The album opens with the classic \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" which couldnt have been a more perfect choice to jumpstart this classic art piece. What follows is a string of heartfelt pop tunes with way more sophistication in the elements that would grant it that title. The Joshua Tree is an album that should be in any self respecting collection and that is not an opinion. Get this album if you do not have it already, you will be glad you did. Take care and enjoy the music
6304712944|5.0|I just don't even care what all these \\"Broadway Babies\\" think about the film version of \\"Camelot\\". I have seen this movie over and over and still love it. No printing presses in Medieval times? SO WHAT?! It's a movie. Get it? Movie- fantasy, fun, suspension of reality for a few precious hours.  <br /> <br />Richard Harris is great as Arthur, very excited and ready to do good, Ginny is s very lithe and young, and ready to get into trouble, and Lance ready for a fall.  <br /> <br />The costumes are SO cool. I didn't like them back in the 80's, but they wear well. The sets are pretty and the choreography is sweet.  <br /> <br />Don't listen to the whiners and moaners. This is a classic, beautiful film!
0765309408|5.0|If you are a fan of the Starship Troopers/Forever War/Armour gritty mano-a-alieno slug-it-out-between-infantry genre, a warning.  First, get all your work done for the day you are going to pick it up because you won't put it down till you are through.  Scalzi's characters and the violent, crowded universe they live in make for a great space opera. It's not totally new territory but that's fine; as one of the editorial reviewers said its great to see some new ingenuity brought to the fold.  <br /> <br />      It is very much in The Forever War vein, but actually has an even more interesting universe than Haldeman created, although just as incredibly lethal for the soldiers who fight in it. Like TFW, it uses hard science without ever being too incomprehensible to those of us who were liberal arts majors.  My only criticism is that it would have been even better if it was longer, but then I would have also gotten nothing done the second day I had it so its just as well. <br /> <br />        Gimme sequels.  Lots of sequels.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|The first Matrix was awsome but you get to the last to and something seemed to be seriously lacking.  The movies seemed very rushed together.  The fight scenes are cool but how many times do you need to see that damn stop motion that was supposedly made famous by the Matrix wich is a lie it was first in Blade.  The story of the last 2 movies sucked.  Now the box set of the DVDs comes out?  What excatly was wrong with having the DVD's the way they were?  Are you scared that Lord of the Rings and Star Wars DVD sales will blow your crappy movies out of the water?  At last those are good movies
6305910340|5.0|The reviewer who gave the movie a 1 star missed the point. Josh Waitzkin wasn't peddled as the next Bobby Fischer by the filmmaker. In the movie, Josh repeatedly said \\"but I'm not him\\" after his teacher (played by Ben Kingsley) forced Josh to be like Fischer. The most important point was the emphasis on the huge difference between Waitzkin and Fischer. Waitzkin led a balanced life, while Fischer disappeared several times to hide from public view.
B00005JMUL|1.0|I want to take my nearly 4 1/2 year old son to this movie but have found very little information on the childrens' perceptions. Would a sensitive child be upset by it?  Since most people are thinking of this movie for a child, it would be more helpful if we heard their opinions instead of the parents'.
1592400876|4.0|I bought this book after seeing a review.  I thought it would have great humor in every page.  I did find it entertaining; however, it was drier than I had anticipated it to be.  Having taught in a writing lab, I realize the importance of grammar.  For there are many people that do not understand the rules of grammar.  Many are too embarrassed to seek help. Therefore, this book will serve as a tool for them to grow.  For they can study it in the privacy of their own homes.
0792833236|5.0|This may owe a bit to On The Waterfront but not really, it just happens to use the best dialogue ever, now that's clever. The film is by a mile the best sports film EVER! Some say Rocky, but that is actually very superficial and unbelievable in every way, it's also predictable, some say Ali, but Will Smith cannot act and I think they just stole ideas from Raging Bull for that anyway, I am not kidding this film is one that will always be remembered for a superb story, magnificent fight scenes, including Joe Pesci's use of the car door to smash some poor sods skull in. DeNiro made an extreme effort  by putting on 60lbs for his role and won the Best Actor Oscar and deservedly so, he was unbeatable, and I thought Scorsese should've won director but that's a different matter. I think the DVD could be better, but I suppose the general content of the film is not ruined, the vivid portrayal is fantastic and DeNiro relates to the character very well, he proved in this that he is one of the best actors in the world and whether you know it or not, Jake La Motta himself said that DeNiro had done a better job at his character than he could have done himself. It gets five stars and no one can deny it this prestige.

B0002NRQTI|5.0|Rush has done it again!  'Counterparts' is a great, masterful, quality rock release with killer, clockwork songs.  Rush always seems to nail it perfectly with songs that meld artistic atmospheric, arpeggiated chording married with powerful, sweeping, heavy chords and technically and sonically pleasing lead guitar work.  The 'duality' of their approach works well in terms of coming up with very dynamic tunes that push the limits of well crafted rock.  Ear and mind candy to the max!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After watching a show like Firefly, it's harder to watch a show like the current Star Trek franchise. It's harder because the flaws are so much more notiable. Visually Star Trek is great but the writing is as dated as an ego driven Shatner monologue. <br /> <br />Firefly is great not because of it's niffty effects, or it cool western/sci-fi genre, it's great because the writing's great. The characters are familiar, yet fresh. The plots are simple, yet intriguing. We feel for this crew of outcasts as they take their beat up cargo ship from one port to another. They're small time criminals just trying to get a little more than what they have.   <br /> <br />The DVD does a few things that the FOX TV airings did not. It shows the episodes in order, which is amazingly important to this series which incorporates a broader story arc over it's brief run of 14 shows. It also includes several unaired epidoes which are wonderful fun, but don't give us all the answears to the questions fans crave of the series. The good news is that a movie of Firefly is scheduled for theatrical release sometime in 2005. Luckly for us this DVD series is here now for us to enjoy and savor until the movie hits the big screen.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|I didnt see Mystic River when it first came out in theaters. I wasn't a big fan of Sean Penn's and didn't particularly know much about Clint Eastwood's work as a director either. When I finally watched this movie on HBO, I was extremely impressed. A great story and an excellent cast. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are very deserving of their Oscars for Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor. This movie takes you on an emotional journey, and challenges your moral instincts. It is definitely a must see!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This film is special on so many fronts.  The way that the film is shot and how Mann makes nocturnal Los Angeles a living character is just outstanding.  Cruise and Foxx are at the top of their respective games, each going against type and performing close to flawlessly.  A nod should also go to Jada Pinkett Smith, one of the more underrated actresses at present; she maximizes her limited role into someone who you can actually care about. <br /> <br />I will say a word about the screenplay, which has been criticized.  Yes, the ending is a little formulaic as I also had this perverse interest in seeing Vincent finish the job.  But I also wound up really liking Max and hoped that he and Smith's character, whose name escapes me, would have a future.  But because the ending is formulaic does not mean it was not expertly crafted, which I think this ending is.  As for the believability of the plot itself, I doubt if there are many films out there that are believable or that don't take strong creative liberties with material that seems real.  Like most of the art out there, its whether the story and the characters intertwined have something to say, make to care about them or what they are doing, and whether there is a message you can get from what is being said.  I think this film does all three.  You hate it that you like Vincent, but there is something about his twisted sociopathic view of the world that you can emphasize this and almost understand.  You like the fact that Max becomes more brazen as the film progresses, realizing that sometimes you have to take a risk or two.  You care about Max and Vincent's relationship and you are interested to see what happens between the two of them.  Finally, the way that nocturnal L.A. is this breathing beast that is both beautiful and ugly, on the edge of being overrun by the coyotes and other more primitive elements. The film really reminds you of how anonymous most people are, despite the fact that the main three characters findthemselves intertwined.  But without those coincidences, there would be no story and while the story may stretch reality some, we don't ALWAYS go to the movies or read novels to not have SOME suspension of total reality (the coffee shop scene in Heat, however implausible, was one of the greatest scenes in the past 20 years). <br /> <br />I loved this film.  I'd rank it as high as Heat and it is easily one of my favorites of all time.  I recognize I probably liked it more than most, but I promise you that Collateral will linger in your mind far longer than the vast majority of films being made.
B00005JM0B|2.0|T2 Blown T3 away without any effort!<br /><br />Compare the CG, T2 has the state-of-the-art CG at that time! T3? Like any other scifi movies from the last few years, flooded with big s explosions and CG for NO REASON!! They put so much CG into the movie just because these days every scifi movie is like that.. By the way, what's with the fighting scene in the bathroom part?? The action is pointless and after all it's just like kids fighting with SUPERMAN power.<br /><br />T1 and T2 has a great story and T3 has none. The scripts in T3 are stupid, for some reason the scriptwriter kept using the lines from T2, he's probably trying to connect T2 and T3 together, but that's pathetic, it sounds so corny!<br />This movie is no different than AVP, Resident Evil, Aliens 4, horrible movies, these movies spoiled the legend!<br /><br />Like the others said, don't waste your time if you think you really liked T1 and T2, this is not the movie for you. For the rest who are satisfied with the CG-flooding, weak plot, lame scripts movie, you can go for it.<br /><br />I am sorry for Arnold...
1573226521|3.0|As a international student, I read this novel to acquire more vocabulary .    It was intresting and relatively easy to read.  The writer described the X generation well, however, I felt unpleasant that there were cruel expressions.  It was too much for me.  I could understand the theme of this novel, describing human nature, but I disagree the sense of value in this novel.  It seemed that the writer agreed with euthanasia and drug abuse.  During reading this novel, I felt somber and cold.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Don't get me wrong I love Titanic, but come on where are all the special features? I feel that with all the specials James Cameron did on tv he could have thrown in a couple, this movie made tons of money in the box office the least James could have done was thrown in some behind the scenes footage for his fans. So the DVD gets a one star while the movie itself gets four stars.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I snapped up this item as soon as I saw it on sale!  This was, and is, the concert event of a lifetime.  There have been a few attempts to do something similar to this over the years, but none have reached the scale or success as Live Aid. <br /> <br />When I observed that the length was 10 hours, I knew that some compromises had to be made as to who to include, and who to ignore.  I had just graduated from high school in 1985 and remember running VHS tapes from 6 in the morning (to catch the Australia footage) to well past 10 that night...almost 17 hours' worth of footage.  I still have those tapes and can shed some light on the Zep story. <br /> <br />True that the Zep set is missing; true that Plant and Page refused to let it be included; also true is that it was not a quality performance by any objective measure.  Jimmy Page was obviously well-stoned by the time he got out there, and the interaction between Phil Collins and ex-Chic drummer Tony Thompson (NOT Jason Bohnam as an earlier viewer implied) was sporadic at best. <br /> <br />Others key moments were left out as well.  The Thompson Twins' \\"Hold Me Now\\" and \\"Doctor Doctor\\" was left off, as was Duran Duran's \\"View To a Kill.  However, it would have required another 2 discs to do the whole program, and the sheer amout of stuff that is there is more than worth the price of the package! <br /> <br />As to why it took this long to get this in some format or another, Bob Geldof opposed releasing it until now saying that the show was best left in people's memory.  I vehemently disagree!  This was well overdue, and hopefully the $ raised will be put to good use. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, much of the original funds from the concerts bought aid that ended up being diverted by corrupt African regimes to their own pockets.  We can only hope that won't happen this time around <br />
0156027321|3.0|It's a fun book, telling an imaginative adventure story. Perhaps winning the booker prize raised expectations a little beyond what is fair. Approach it with the right mindset, and I think you'll like it. If you expect it to trigger some deep, contemplative musings, you'll be disappointed.
B0002Y69NG|3.0|The first Matrix film is a must own title. And if you must own it, go for this set, since it contains the DEFINATIVE version of the DVD. The superior remastered picture quality on disc 1 will be enough to get me to buy this massive set.    As a series, the Matrix has kind of weak legs. The sequels offer some truly amazing images and action sequences, but the story is no-where near as good as the first one, and the overall quality is alot lower, production values aside. The big reason for this would be the fact that the first movie was an un-authorized adaptation of a story called \\"The Third Eye\\", which the Wachowski Bros. stole from another writer, who is only just now finally recieving a financial settlement from Warner Bros. Even though they stole the story for the first film, it was still good. But the second two movies were pretty much them working by themselves, and it's not hard to tell once you watch them. It was very dissapointing to see the series take such a sharp turn from cinematic gold to sci-fi obscurity, but at least we got some great action scenes out of it, even if the stuff between is poorly thought out. And the series ends with more of a whimper than a bang. You'll be very dissapointed with the way the series wraps things up, I'm afraid.    Still, I consider myself to be a moderate fan of the series. I can forgive things like obnoxiouse and distastful rave sequences and a 5 minute long sex scene with strands of drool that take up half the screen because there's some good to be found withing the latter two films. And maybe, just maybe you'll almost be able to make sense of the series with this boxed set, since it contains almost all the Matrix lore that's ever been put on film, including The Animatrix disc and all the live-action footage from the game Enter The Matrix. So while no movie can justify the requirement of knowledge outside the films to make sense (or even come close to making sense), at least you can get it all in one purchase, in one box on your DVD shelf. Think of it as a visual encyclopedia of the Matrix world. I only bought the DVD for the first movie, so this set should be satasfying, other than that the movies themselves aren't particularly (with the exception of the first one). It's still a dissapointing movie series, but it's one that you might find worth owning.

Current President Zach Herney also gets a political boost for his pro-NASA campaign but he is waiting for the results to be verified by many sources before he goes public with the information.  Meanwhile, Sedgwick Sexton's rolling campaign keeps on attacking NASA and their spending and they appear to be headed on a one way road to the White House.  He deals with personal scandals while trying to help his ailing campaign.

B00009P1O2|5.0|I heard one of the songs from this recording over the radio, and knew I needed to own it.  You can hear the audience sings along <br />the whole time.  So I bought the recording (not DVD).  Listened to the whole thing last night.  A truely amazing band. <br />So, I then wondered if there was a DVD video version.  Indeed there is.  I'll be ordering it directly!!!!!
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|I finally saw this movie for the first time the other day, more than a year after its theatrical release to overwhelming critical acclaim, including a few Academy Awards. But I was very disappointed with it. What I saw was little more than a sappy melodrama, laced with superb acting performances but badly flawed by a hokey and unoriginal script. This movie is so uninspiringly melodramatic and predictable that it could have been made for TV instead of for the big screen. In fact, they make movies just like this one for Lifetime every week. <br /> <br />
068484267X|5.0|I'm Irish and I loved it!! - If you don't buy, read and enjoy this book then you must have been \\"dropped on your head as a child.\\"  This reference is just one of Mr McCourt's MANY unique and original one-liners throughout the book.    Hard to believe he lived long enough to tell his story AND that he can tell his story in such a way that will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  I think it is fair to say he hasn't lived a perfect life - but he sure has lived an interesting one!!    I listened to the book on CD, which is aprox. 14 hours total in length and it was worth every minute!!  The time flew by, it was as if I was sitting and listening to my grandfather tell a story.    Despite the bleak backdrop and the dreary storyline - ironically I REALLY enjoyed this book!!!  Mr. McCourt did a beautiful job with the narration as well.    As a side note:  Everyone should have been so lucky to have had just one teacher like Frank McCourt in school.  What a storyteller!!     I think you will enjoy it too! I suggest you buy the audio version to get the full effect.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Fourth album from Iron Maiden, released in 1983. Drummer Nicko McBrain debuted on this album. Although the album was released more than 2 decades ago, I still think it is one of the best sounding Iron Maiden records. Where most other Maiden albums have a rather thin guitar sound, Piece Of Mind has got a heavy guitar sound. Also the overall sound, sounds less \\"dated\\" than earlier albums like The Number Of The Beast. The album still sounds fresh. On this album the heavy and melodic riffs are in perfect balance. The album starts with the up tempo song \\"Where Eagles Dare\\". The song is mainly based around a couple of interesting riffs. Compared to the other tracks, there are not many vocals on this song. Halfway through the song you can hear cool gun firing sounds. Revelations is one of the best tracks on the album. It is a mainly slow song, with some heavy guitar playing. The song has got a biblical context.  There is only one track that is still often played by the band and that is \\"The Trooper\\". The song is a typical melodic up tempo Maiden song, with great solos.     \\"Sun And Steel\\" and `Quest For Fire\\" are the least interesting tracks, but they are better than most people think. Especially musically these song are great, only the lyrics could have been better. The album closes with the epic song \\"To Tame A Land\\". The song is based on a book about the planet Dune. The cold and desolate atmosphere on this song really reflects the lyrical context of the song. \\"To Tame A Land\\" even sounds rather doomy. No wander Doom Metal band Morgion covered the song.      Although \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is not my favourite Maiden album, any Metal fan should have listened to this album at least once.
014028009X|5.0|I am an avid fan of the movie, and after seeing The Edge of Reason, I decided to read the books as well. The book is similar to the movie, but not all that much.  The plot of the book is much more in depth, which I loved. I found myself laughing out loud over and over again.  This book is great...bloody hilarious, and a great ending. If you've seen and liked the movie, I suggest reading the book.  It is wonderful.

Thelma meets the wrong man while intoxicated on the first day of the weekend gateaway and everything spins out of control for her and her friend, Louise. The movie is full of adventure as the two women try to escape the fast-moving events that surround them.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is not your typical fairytale love story. Rather, it is a substantially more complex story that deals with issues of prejudice, xenophobia and equality. To some extent this is one of the main reasons for its phenomenal success over the years and why it truly deserves the title \\"story as old as time\\". It not only manages to appeal to children, effectively teaching them some important life morals, but it also manages to touch a deeper level with adults, highlighting issues that as a society we would prefer to pretend do not exist. The main characters portrayed here of Belle (Paige O'Hara), the Beast (Robby Benson) and Gaston (Richard White) are quite complex when compared to the fairytale characters one typically encounters; and in many respects they are even the polar opposites. Belle for instance, is immediately distinguished from the other villagers as being \\"quite odd\\" due to her interest in reading and adventure. Likewise as the story unfolds, Gaston progressively shifts from being the epitome of man to becoming the monster as the Beast slowly becomes more human.  <br />This presentation is also perfectly suitable for children and several amusing characters are available to provide comic relief throughout the feature. These include such wonderful characters as Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) the French candlestick, Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers) the pompous clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) the very personable teapot and Chip (Bradley Pierce) the little boy as a teacup. In addition there are several others including Belle's father Maurice (Rex Everhart), her horse Philippe (Hal Smith) and the ever-lovable ottoman dog (Frank Welker). These are wonderful characters that never overly distract from the main story, as so many useless animated characters have a tendency to do in other animated features.  <br />In closing, this adaptation of the ageless story of Beauty and the Beast is a magnificent effort, by a magnificent team, and it definitely deservesthe fine reputation it has as one of the best animated films of all time. The presentation on DVD is also amongst the very best available and is certainly worth adding to any collection! <br /> <br />
B00006M183|5.0|Rather than focus on the face value of actual songs,  <br /> <br />Pearl Jam with \\"Riot Act\\" have moved away from their previous style of writing and made an album that does'nt focus on the songs it focusses on the music and actual quality of a whole album. <br /> <br />If you have'nt heard this, don't expect it to hit you in the face like their other albums. Especially the awful \\"Ten\\". <br /> <br />It may for some, take some time to get used to their new sound (as, as its compeletley different from the catchy upbeat riffs of many of their other songs.) <br /> <br />The reason its so good is because its not a simple straight forward record. Its not meant to be memorable, just a really great listen. <br /> <br />This album shows that Pearl Jam are taking a new and different direction in the style of music they are making. <br /> <br />A really great listen - A different band. <br /> <br />
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Can there be any other director who has carved such a perfect niche for himself as Tim Burton? The undoubted master of the \\"adult fairytale\\" tackles the issue of the relationship between Father and Son in the film 'Big Fish'. With an impressive cast including Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup and Jessica Lange - oh, and not forgetting \\"Mrs Burton\\" (Helena Bonham Carter) - 'Big Fish' is set up to succeed from the get-go. What Burton has created is a humorous and yet moving journey through the fantastic life of one Edward Bloom as retold through a series of flashbacks. The film strongly evokes memories of the equally surreal 'Edward Scissorhands' and the gently comedic fictional biopic 'Forrest Gump'.  This film is a heart-warming, funny and quite mesmerising tale. There is something strangely homely about Burton's 'Big Fish' - it is one of those films that makes you reassess some of your own relationships. The acting is of a high calibre throughout - I thought Lange's performance as the loving wife of Bloom was wonderfully understated in particular. The supporting actors include the superb Steve Buscemi and Burton's old mate Danny De Vito. I did have a couple of minor gripes in this regard however - Finney's delivery is sometimes mumbled or slurred to an extent that I could not make out what he was saying (this could have been intentional, but was irritating nonetheless) and McGregor's Alabama accent was jarring. It's not that he didn't carry it off, but for an actor who has such a characteristic accent of his own (Sean Connery anyone?), the fake southern drawl did take a little while for me to feel comfortable with it.  This story will make you laugh and will warm the cockles of all but the most hard-hearted viewer. Highly recommended as a film for those prepared to sit back, suspend disbelief, relax and enjoy the ride. If you have seen some of Burton's other work ('Sleepy Hollow', 'Beetlejuice' or 'Edward Scissorhands' for instance), you may be one of those people who feel they are just a little too weird...possibly a little too contrived. Have no fear if that is the case. Whilst this bears the undeniable Burton stamp, it is probably his most accessible - dare I say mainstream - film. Very nice work indeed.
B00006LIRI|3.0|U2 - Best of 1990 -2000 <br />During the 90s they reinevnted themselves each time they released an album, and rather brilliantly too. <br /> <br />But as for this album, well alot of unesseccary tracks and many important tracks are missed out as well. <br /> <br />The new versions of songs such as \\"Discotheque\\" and \\"Numb\\" are completely uneccessary. Apart from \\"Gone\\" which sounds alot more upbeat and rockier than the original of the \\"POP\\" album. <br /> <br /> It takes away some of the chracter of the songs as well, only to a small extent though. <br />Heres how it should of been. <br /> <br />1. Even Better than the real thing........(from Actung Baby) <br />2. Mysterious Ways <br />3. One <br />4. The Fly <br />5. Until the End Of The World <br />6. Stay Faraway (So Close)..........(from Zoopropa) <br />7. Lemon <br />8. Numb <br />9. Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me.....(From \\"Batman Forever\\") <br />9. Discotheque............(from Pop) <br />10.Staring At The Sun <br />11.Last Night On earth <br />12. Please <br />13.Beautiful Day..........(From all that you can't leave behind) <br />14. Walk On <br />15. When I Look At The World (very underated and unkown song) <br />16. Kite <br />17.The Hands That Built America (new song) <br /> <br />Now what actual U2 fan could complain about that tracklist, its brilliant, and shows the best tracks from each album, and the actual best tracks. NBot stuff that was just popular to the masses....\\"stuck in a moment\\"????....its just awful. <br /> <br />I think U2 fans would of appreciated a more well rounded and more of a quality record than putting out a best of album suited to only \\"mainstream\\" tastes. <br /> <br />As for Electrical Storm, its just plain awful. Can I say much more?
B00003CWTI|5.0|There are scenes, and lines, in Magnolia that will stay with me for the rest of my life.  The narrator saying periodically \\"And the book says, we may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us.\\"  Aimee Mann singing \\"Wise Up\\" and \\"Save Me\\". Policeman Jim Kurring saying \\"Sometimes people need a little help.  Sometimes people need to be forgiven. And sometimes they need to go to jail.  But if you can forgive someone, well, that's the tough part. What can we forgive?  Tough part of the job.  Tough part of walking down the street.\\"  This is the most deeply human movie I have ever experienced.      If you can appreciate that a movie can touch your heart, can be something more than just simple entertainment, and can actually say something both simple and profound about the human condition, then you will love Magnolia.  It is not easy watching.  It is at turns foul-mouthed, confused, chaotic, irrational, depressing, uplifting, unrealistic, too realistic, unpredictable, heavily symbolic, violent, and unflinchingly, gut-wrenchingly honest in its portrayal of damaged characters trying to make sense of the wreckage of their lives.  And yet, through all of this there is a beacon of hope and redemption that shines through, and most of the characters do find the strength to carry on.  Watching Magnolia is like having an entire lifetime's worth of powerful emotions crammed into a three hour movie.  If you have an open mind, and an open heart, you must see this movie. I have a hard time imagining how anyone will ever be able to make a better one.
B0002Y4TZG|4.0|The world has spun a few times since \\"London Calling\\" was released back in very late 1979 (on vinyl, natch!), but the love fest that has sprung up in its wake continues to gather steam.  For my money, it's always been a great (if somewhat slightly overrated) album, as well as the album on which The Clash began to squander their greatness.  From here, it would be a long, sad downward spiral through \\"Sandanista\\" and into the abyss with \\"Combat Rock.\\" As someone who prefers the friendly and comfortable confines of a rut, I'd have been perfectly happy if the band had continued on in the same vein of out-and-out brilliance demonstrated on \\"The Clash\\" (both UK and US versions), the vastly underrated \\"Give `Em Enough Rope,\\" and non-LP singles and B-sides of that era like \\"Capital Radio,\\" \\"Pressure Drop,\\" and \\"1977.\\"   On the other hand, by my count, this is the fourth time I've bought \\"London Calling\\" and as far as re-issues go, they remain the only band I would cross the road for. <br /> <br />It would be pointless, repetitive, and tiresome to go into too much depth recounting the original album's highs and lows - chances are if you're reading this, all 19 tracks are probably burned onto your frontal lobe.  Topper Headon's performance behind the drum kit is worth the price of admission alone, tight, compact, and propulsive.  The title track (as someone who abhors the Beatles, I love to rub the phrase \\"Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust\\" in the faces of friends who think the Fab 4 hung the moon), \\"Brand New Cadillac,\\" \\"Clampdown,\\" \\"The Guns of Brixton,\\" and \\"Death or Glory\\" all bristle with old-style Clash aggression, anger and energy, while \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" \\"Lost In The Supermarket,\\" \\"Lover's Rock,\\" \\"4 Horsemen,\\" \\"I'm Not Down,\\" and (whew!) \\"Revolution Rock\\" may leave you scratching your head and wondering just what it was about this band that made you think they could change the world. <br /> <br />So let's cut to the chase - the Vanilla tapes, 21 tracks recorded at the titular studio in Pimlico which eavesdrops on The Clash working the kinks out of most of the songs which made the final \\"London Calling\\" cut.  As someone who never loses sight of the fact that most, if not all, major label album releases are cloaked in a thick smokescreen of studio wizardry, bells, and whistles, I found most (hell, all!) of the Vanilla tapes' charm to be in their unsanded veneer and by-design demo quality.  Of course, I'd rather pay money to watch a rough-and-ragged rehearsal or sound check by my favorite bands than a slick, professional performance.  I'm funny like that, so proceed with caution.  Uncovered in an old cardboard box by Mick Jones when he was preparing to move, these songs were never intended as some kind of audiophile experience.  Complaints lodged in this forum about their lack of high fidelity are puzzling and, quite frankly, completely devoid of anything resembling a clue. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, if you already own \\"Westway To The World,\\" most of it will look familiar, but how can you go wrong with all of the crystal clear live footage, interviews with band members (the late Joe Strummer's segments are especially poignant) and their associates, and a peek into the studio at nutjob producer Guy Stevens' shenanigans during the recording of this album? <br /> <br />\\"London Calling\\" was the last stand of four guys for whom the term \\"electrifying\\" was woefully inadequate.  On any given night, The Clash were capable of blasting you outside of yourself, making you feel super-alive, and able to pretend that night was the rest of your life.  What else in the realm of the living or dead really matters? <br />
B00005JMUA|1.0|This applies to Kill Bill 1&2.  Purveyors of ketchup and fake body parts are exstatic. The fight scenes are just as unrealistic as those of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but entirely lack their grace and elegance, with one exception. The exception being Lucy Liu's excellent performance.  One scene has fastened in my mind's eye: Lucy Liu at the head of her warriors, seen from the side and in silhouette. She, in a white long kimono, holding her black sheathed sword at her side, striding/gliding in a manner conditioned by her Japanese sandals; they, all in black.  I don't know how it all ended - I ran out of patience partway thru the second part!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I originally saw a couple of episodes of Firefly on TV when it first aired (out of sequence) and couldn't really get into it. <br />Now that I have seen it all on DVD in the proper order, I LOVE IT and can't believe I almost let this one slip by.  What a wonderful cast of characters and terrific writing. This is a must for Joss Whedon fans or anyone who likes Sci Fi.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Arcade Fire may turn out to be the \\"next big thing\\"- though not in the Nelly or  Tim McGraw kind of big thing way, more like Franz Ferdinand big. This Montreal band has a fascinating mix of instrumentation, quirky, poetic lyrics, and an offbeat sensibility that keeps the listener both guessing and engaged. Despite the preponderance of songs titled \\"Neighborhood\\" (1-4) the music is diverse throughout. It reminds me of the uniqueness of Talking Heads or early Roxy Music, signaling a band to watch in the future. Can't wait to see them live!
0609610570|1.0|What a miserable, empty tome.<br /><br />Could be expressed in a minor size Inc article.<br /><br />Repetitive and full of filler, throwing around sweeping generalizations with little of practical value that will change the reader's approach to management.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend.<br /><br />PS---Many favorable reviews of business books are written on request of the authors by other cronies in the business of writing business books.

B00012FXAE|5.0|Make no mistake; this movie is intense when you focus on the movie, and not on trimming your toenails.  This movie is best watched in a darkened room with theater sound, and lots of bass.  Best not watch it late at night because you will keep the neighbors awake.<br /><br />Apparently there is a running debate as to whether \\"Alien\\" or \\"Aliens\\" is the better movie.  If you are looking for the intensity of a horror movie, \\"Alien\\" is a better bet.  If you are looking for unadulterated over-the-top action, \\"Aliens\\" is it.  Both movies helped to create a new science fiction monster genre; monsters that well-surpass man in their cold-blooded will to survive and dominate.<br /><br />This movie picks up where \\"Alien\\" left off.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been picked up in the small spaceship in which she escaped from the Nostromo.  There are a lot of questions as to what happened to the ship and whether Ripley had any responsibility.  Eventually Ripley is let go and, unable to work on spaceships any longer, takes a job as a material handler.  Eventually Carter Burke (Paul Reiser as an obnoxious jerk) comes to her and tells her that the colonists on the planet where she and her shipmates encountered the alien have stopped communicating, and Marines are being sent to find out what happened.  Burke wants Ripley to go since she has the most knowledge regarding the aliens, if they exist.<br /><br />The Marines appear to be well equipped to deal with the alien creature.  However, I believed there were several mistakes made in the plotting of the movie.  While the way the movie was scripted made for lots of action and great intensity, militarily it made no sense.  First, why was only one squad of Marines sent with no back up in the ship?  Second, once the Marines landed and their landing ship dusted off, why did it wait on a hostile planet with the back door open?  Lastly, we have to assume that Marines have quite a lot of training, and it would seem unusual for Marines to not know that they were entering the cooling tower of a reactor, and once they did enter, rather than giving up their ammunition they should have retreated.  Further, once they realized the possibility of something outside their realm of experience, they should have retreated, exited the planet, and called for backup.  Silly, silly.<br /><br />Beyond my complaints, this movie is one continuous and excellent roller-coaster ride.  With the proper display and sound, you can duplicate seeing this movie in a theater.  The Marine landing looks realistic.  The Marine landing craft is amazing.  The Marine squad appears generally competent and they do their jobs well (excluding the possible errors previously noted).  The attempts Paul Reiser makes to try and capture an alien specimen to support making some sort of military weapon expands upon the subplot introduced in \\"Alien,\\" only in this movie the plot is much more significant.<br /><br />After the initial attempt to find the colonists determine that there probably are no colonists remaining alive, it seems that one mishap after another befalls the Marines.  Because they lose their landing craft the survivors are forced to survive in the colony, hoping to defend it from the soon to be marauding aliens.  Once the aliens attack, the movie continues on a feverish pace to the end, and all along the way you wonder whether anyone is going to survive.  The surprise after the second landing craft returns to the orbiting spaceship was good and gives a viewer one last high before the movie ends.<br /><br />Few movies can match the intensity of \\"Aliens.\\"  The pace of the movie is such that once the ride stops, you are unable to get off.  This movie is required watching for anyone who is a fan of either action movies or horror movies.o not know that they were entering the cooling tower of a reactor, and once they did enter, rather than giving up their ammunition they should have retreated.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|not to say tom's performance isnt good, but he was better in last samurai, why do people love him in this, and not Samurai, that was an oscar caliber performance, this is a golden globe.  Foxx was good too, but i dont think he'll get a oscar nod either, the rest of the cast does well too.  The story is interesting and has many meanings, its well shot and realistic, its intense on the mind and heart (not heartwrenchingly dramatic like Passion of the christ, but still sad), the action is realistic but nothing new, its more of a charater movie (not a bad thing when you make them correctly like this, but the performances could have been just a smidge better),  the music is also very good esspecially the audioslave song and the one techno song during the club scene, and the score.  Overall a well crafted entertaining film, i recommend heat if you like this, its manns only other good film, ali was dissapointing excepts for wills performance, i hope mann stays with crime dramas that is what he is good at.  9 out of a 10.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon is always voted SECOND best album on rock radio after The Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The truth of the matter is that Dark Side is still on the charts in 2004 after its March, 1973 release date. The album is 15 times Platinum(with an additional 20 million sold outside America as it sells another million worldwide year after year) and is long overdue for a re-certification as it has sold more then 15 million in America. David Gilmour and Roger Waters got along between 1968 and 1974 and their working relationship was at its arguable peak here thanks to classics like Breathe, Time, the band's first of only Two Top 20 hits Money, Us and Them and Brain Damage/Eclipse are alll still played on the radio today. Carson Daly is no longer on TRL anymore! Buy NOW!

0316921173|3.0|...on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually spell out... <br />    By turns brilliant, exuberating, exhausting, thought-provoking, trying, and hysterical, IJ was for me, in the final analysis, an exercise in forebearance.  I have nothing substantial to add to the numerous reviews on this page.  It seems that most readers either love or hate this novel.  I would only add that I too loved parts of it, that I relished Wallace's twisted perspective on even the most mundane subjects, admired his command of the language (and frequently extraordinary turns of phrase), and was -- how can you not be? -- pretty awed by the breadth of his learning.  Was IJ really (as a reviewer notes below) his senior thesis in college?  Pretty mind-blowing if so.  Did it really (as another reviewer mentions) exceed 1700 pages in length before it was edited?  What remained could have used some robust editing, too, to say the least. <br />    Having just finished IJ last evening, I cannot speak to its lasting effect on me (as a reader, a thinker, etc.).  In all of the ways that reviewers below say their patience was tried by IJ, mine was too.  In many of the ways that reviewers say their imaginations were fired by IJ, mine was too.   <br />    In the final analysis, I'm glad I read IJ, if for no other reason than it taught me much about the writer's craft (for better and worse).  However, my overwhelming feeling, the morning after, is one of relief.  I'm done with it.  In order to understand the novel's (non-)ending, I need -- so others suggest -- to reread the beginning, substantial parts, or the entirety of IJ again.  I herein join the ranks of those who couldn't care less what the ending means. <br />    As an extended creative writing exercise, I thought IJ was brilliant.  As novel, I found it a bore. <br />
B0000549B0|4.0|\\"I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, Doctor, and I'm happy to state I finally won out over it.\\"<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart, in one of his personal favorite film and stage roles, portrays Elwood P. Dowd, a gentle philosopher and harmless alcoholic who, after his mother's death, befriends an imaginary - or is he? - 6'3.5\\" white rabbit; a \\"Pooka\\" who goes by the name of Harvey. Unfortunately, it seems that Harvey is invisible to everyone but Elwood. Elwood wanders through life perfectly happy, harming no one, but alienating his family and many of the townspeople with his \\"friend\\".<br /><br />Josephine Hull, (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in the film; she also played the part on stage) portrays his sister Veta Louise Simmons, and she steals the film, IMO; her facial expressions and gestures are priceless (she also played one of the aunts in \\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\", 1944).<br /><br />The pacing is fast and furious, and the dialogue alternately hilarious and touching in this whimsical, bittersweet tale of illusions and realities. Jimmy Stewart found himself personally identified with the role for many years, much to his delight, remarking in interviews how strangers would sometimes stop him in the street and seriously ask him if Harvey were with him, only to be kindly told, \\"No, he's at home today, with a slight cold\\" or some other humoring excuse for the lack of his invisible friend.<br /><br />Of course the movie is dated and implausible today in several respects; however it still holds a gentle, childlike appeal that transcends time. It's a great, simply-told \\"feel-good\\" movie to start off the holiday season.
B000001Y2U|4.0|Wow, i read a few of these reviews, and they are pretty bad. I listen to Marilyn Manson, and im not a so called \\"Freak\\" or \\"Disturbed\\", I'm pretty normal. By the way you people talk, it sounds like everyone who listens to Marilyn is a complete freak. Calm down, its just music, i like it cause i like the beat, and im not gonna go out and do something crazy after i listen to it, because I can separate reality from a CD. I know some people will listen to this cd, and then go out and do something crazy, but you gotta think that if a cd can make that person do something, then they wouldnt have lasted long before something else pushed him/her over the edge. As for the cd, it was good, i thought \\"The Beautiful People\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" were real stand outs, this cd isnt for everyone, but i would say its one of Marilyns best.
6302662648|5.0|Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier head a fine cast in SNEAKERS, a solid 1992 thriller with a robust sense of humor directed and co-written with good skill by Phil Alden Robinson (FIELD OF DREAMS).  In it, Redford, who has been on the run since 1969 for computer hacking in that politically turbulent time, heads up a team of security experts known as \\"sneakers\\", whose job it is to penetrate the security set-ups of their respective clients to give them tips whenever those companies' security systems are lacking.  Then two guys (Timothy Busfield; Eddie Jones) claiming to be from the National Security Agency give Redford the biggest task of all: to recover a \\"little black box\\" from a Czech scientist visiting in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br /> <br />But when they find out what this little black box does, they realize that they could be marked for death.  For this box is actually a machine that can break any security codes to every single system on the planet.  And when Busfield and Jones turn out NOT to be NSA representatives and renege on the arrangement they made with him, Redford is forced to confront an old friend (Ben Kingsley) from his past who is now out to take revenge. <br /> <br />Structured with elements of techno-thrillers, spy thrillers, and fears of Big Brother, and combined with goodly amounts of humor, SNEAKERS moves quite briskly through its 125-minute running time.  Suspenseful moments, including Redford having to move ultra-slowly through a highly secured area to recover the box in Kingsley's complex, are juxtaposed with moments of political humor, including Dan Aykroyd's conspiracy-obsessed technician, and in the film's introductory scene, in which the younger versions of Redford and Kingsley think of transfering the money in Richard Nixon's personal checking account to the National Association to Legalize Marijuana.  As rightly mentioned in Amazon's review of the film, that little black box that can break every code functions as what Hitchcock calls a \\"McGuffin\\", a plot device that may not mean much to us until we realize why people want it so badly they'd kill for it.  This, combined with fears of the government functioning as \\"Big Brother\\", make SNEAKERS every bit as relevant today as when it was released in 1992, perhaps even more so.
076790382X|4.0|The cover of this book and the title caught my eye at book store over a period of several months.  Seeing it in paperback, I finally decided to purchase it, even though it is not something I would normally read.  This book was an nice, easy, enjoyable read.  The commentary is witty and clever, but not intellectual by any means.  It is a series of observations.  Most chapters represent articles written on different topics in a magazine to which this author contributed.  Most (maybe all) of the articles were directed at a Brittish audience, so it was interesting to view America from the perspective of a Brit reading an American's observations.  Because each article/chapter is so unrelated to the other, it was a bit disjointed.  I never really felt like I could not put the book down.  I was comfortable reading a couple of pages and starting up the next night, so it took a while to get through it.  But, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a light and easy read.
B00005QAPH|5.0|hello people of amazon, <br /> <br />this will be maybe too personal what i will write. <br /> <br />this movie is an absolutely transcendental meditation, like a dream, a unique masterpiece, one needs to see it a few times at least to be able to capture the deepness there. like a very nice song you want to listen many times again and again, this movie is something like this. each time you see it you realize a new point, you recognize a new detail in it. you discover that some camera movements, some details you had skipped and did not even recognize previously gain importance when you see the movie again and again. <br /> <br />this is in one hand a disadvantage for the spectator beacuse one needs to have a deep concentration on the movie while watching it which is not easy always. i guess in general there are some prequisites -should i say unfortunately maybe- for the spectators to sit down to watch some of the Fellini, Visconti,  Antonioni, Bergman, Pasolini movies (we might name many great art cinema directors as well). 8 1/2 is without any doubt a very good exaple in this context. <br /> <br />the dream scene in the beginning was so nice and impressive but still personally i found the \\"asa nisi masa\\" scene absolutely fantastic. some people associate this scene with Jung's \\"anima\\" (a-sa ni-si ma-sa) theory thinking that Fellini in fact did mean something really beyond. again more personally for me, the camera movements, the zooming into the picture on the wall and zooming out into the face of the little girl, the absolutely great music chosen there, the old lady and her conversations with the children, the discrete images of the burning fire, the woman entering a door all seem irrelevant, however in fact put-together as a whole they serve to complete the plot(s) of the movie. Fellini invites you into his dreams, shares them with you and makes you dream wtih him together.  <br /> <br />a great movie, a must see for the people who love cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br />

B000002I8H|5.0|This was recorded & produced in 77 &  Atlantic sat on it until 81. Sarah figured why doesn't the greatest jazz voice in the world perform the most famed group's (Beatles)material in the world.For Sarah to get on Atlantic she had to sound commercial the way Atlantic wanted Sarah to sound.Atlantic did it with Ella,Peggy & exceptionally with Esther Phillips.Atlantic makes Anita Baker sound pop & one way because now days jazz is not all that marketable.I am a Vaughan fanatic & it is fun to hear Sass do rock & roll which she seldom does and her latin rythms on \\"I Love Her & Something\\".The songs are famous & they are fantastically revamped.Atlantic let Sarah do her own inimitatable standard way of singing the last three songs \\"Here There & Everywhere,Long & Winding Road,& Yesterday\\" in ballad form making beautiful voice exercises & interpretations hitting those soprano notes of these famous songs.One could consider this another one Sarah's songbook albums showing her absolute versatility.It's different & I love it.

B0006399FS|3.0|Its hard to be hard on U2 for anything these days as they have perservered over the years. I have to say that this albumn appears to be a culmination of increasing christian influence on Bono's life in his later years. I think he is coming to terms with his success, and wonders why out of all the people in the world he ended up so well off. I like they albumn but I am having difficulty finding a song on there that truly moves me like \\"One\\" or \\"Kite\\". In those songs the lyrics expressed themselves naturally. In these songs, they feel forced on you. Like the emphasis was on the lyrics and message and not on the music. I kind of get the feeling that the rest of the band kind of hung back in the shadows when this was being made, and basically its Bono's and Edges albumn. Listen to it and make up your own mind. I like it, but I pray they haven't jumped the shark.

0802130208|5.0|I loved it! There's really nothing more I can say.
0316168815|5.0|<br /> \\"My name was Salmon, like the fish, first name Susie.\\"  This line opens up the world of Susie, a character who \\"has a lot of spunk.\\"  \\"I was 14 when I was murdered on December 6th, 1973.\\"  Ray Singh is her first love and can't wait for that tantalizing first kiss.  She has two younger siblings, Lindsey and Buckley.  Her father and mother have an \\"all right\\" marriage.  And there is a man that lives down the block named Mr. Harvey.  There is also a weird girl from her school named Ruth.  Susie finds herself stuck in the cornfield with her killer.  As Susie watches from heaven her sister begins to grow up without her.  Lindsey falls in love with Samuel, a boy from their school.  Her mother and father begin to disintegrate mentally, emotionally, and physically.  Her father is admitted to the hospital twice.  The detective assigned to Susie's case may have special interests with Mrs. Salmon.  Her mother abandons the family.  And Ray and Ruth seem to be \\"getting together\\".  All Susie can do is watch from above helplessly. <br /> <br />    I loved reading this book; you couldn't really make predictions with it.  Alice Sebold, the author, wrote a similar book to this about her own experience, Lucky.  The type of people that would enjoy this book are people who like fiction mixed with nonfiction and those that like a dramatic novel.  I recommend this book to anyone that's heard about it.  <br />
B000002C25|4.0|I am a huge Oasis fan, yet this is my least favorite Oasis album. I like most of the songs on it except \\"Girl in the Dirty Shirt\\" and I absolutely hate \\"All Around the World\\". But, though I do like most of the songs, I think the mood of the album is rubbish. It's very depressing and not upbeat at all like the other albums of theirs. I think if they would have distributed the songs on different albums, it would have been that much better. You know, come on, this isn't Morning Glory! All of their albums are wonderful, but I really think this one pales in comparison to the other 5. At least it's not Definitely Maybe.
B000002HMH|5.0|I think the problem with this album was that Metallica changed their logo, hair and sound all at the same time, and some people were too shocked to give this album a chance.  If the metal guitar sound were the same here as it was on the black album, maybe people wouldn't be so upset. <br /> <br />1 - Ain't my Bitch:  Except for the guitar sound, this song is very old school.  Fast and aggressive in both its music and lyrics.  The title says it all about the subject matter. <br /> <br />2 - 2 X 4:  A simpler song.  Very blues based.  They could've used power chords instead of single notes to get a harder sound out of this.  Still, the lyrics read like a first-person version of \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\".  So much for going 'soft'. <br /> <br />3 - The House that Jack Built:  You can hear some Alice in Chains influence here.  \\"Jack\\" is a pounding, eerie song with a weird vocal solo using a talk box.  I would say this song deals with James' bad experiences with drinking.  \\"Jack\\" could be a reference to Jack Daniels whiskey. <br /> <br />4 - Until it Sleeps:  The opening clean riff has a sort of surfer tone to it, but this is as far from a surfing song as you can get.  The pain that James is talking about is losing his father to cancer and dealing with his Christian-science upbringing.  He had also lost his mother the same way when he was a teen. <br /> <br />5 - King Nothing:  This is the one song on this album that most purists will say is pretty good.  The song talks about people who always want more and then have to deal with suddenly losing it all.  Killer solo by Kirk. <br /> <br />6 - Hero of the Day:  If this song sounds a little too upbeat, its because the intro is based on a major scale rather than a minor.  James wrote this to tell people that your \\"heroes\\" are not in the media or music, they're the people in your lives.  Listen for the hard-hitting time change, and note the double bass. <br /> <br />7 - Bleeding Me:  This 8 minute epic seems to be about the desire to change for a better purpose, like struggling to reach sobriety.  Listen for when a cool riff kicks in somewhere in the middle of the song. <br /> <br />8 - Cure:  Hard hitting song.  Could be either about how some people think suicide by gun is the 'cure', or it could be another attack on televangelists, like in \\"Leper Messiah\\". <br /> <br />9 - Poor Twisted Me:  Not the most popular song in Metallica's catalog.  Very gut wrenching and somewhat blues based.  Seems to talk about people who are gluttons for punishment or pain because they like sympathetic attention. <br /> <br />10 - Wasting my Hate:  Fast and hard hitting song.  Ironic because the subject matter is about not wasting time on someone else who doesn't like you.  The inspiration comes from a friend of James, Waylon Jennings, who told him that he was sitting in a diner and noticed someone outside in a truck staring at him.  Turned out the guy was actually sleeping. <br /> <br />11 - Mama Said:  The country style guitar in the chorus is definitely a departure from the norm.  Whereas \\"Sleeps\\" was written about James' dad, this one is about his mother.  This really couldn't qualify as a country song anyway.  First, the song title isn't ridiculously long, and second, James isn't singing in a nasal voice about a girl he lost. <br /> <br />12 - Thorn Within:  Another ugly, pounding song, similar to \\"Cure\\".  Jason said this is his favorite song on Load, and also said the song is about person who admits his guilt, but still, no one forgives him. <br /> <br />13 - Ronnie:  Twangy, bluesy song with subject matter that reminds one of Pearl Jam's \\"Jeremy\\", but with a little more graphic description. <br /> <br />14 - Outlaw Torn:  Had today's technology been around in 1996, \\"Outlaw\\" would've had over a minute of an extended jam at the end.  This is another great, long song.  James once said it's about \\"losing someone to death, and waiting for a replacement that never comes\\".

B00005JNNL|5.0|I'm very interesting in this specific movie due to the fact that my father a Doctor( emergency room Physician) after a cervical laminectomy became quadripligic and his life and the entire family life is been a disaster emotionally. he is mentally fine know hi's 76 this happened at his age of 61. my mother and I were are both suffering very much because all he says is that he wants to died. for over this 15 years . the three of us are on physiatric treatment. So i think I will identified myself with this situation . unfortunatly my father never recuperated not even a minimun of movement . know he is getting worth day by day. and his mine still clear . Please notified me as soon as the movie will be available to purchase. thanks. my name is BETTY MENDEZ , FROM MIAMI FLORIDA
B00005JKO3|4.0|The epic movie with big budgets and big actors, seems to have gone the way of the musical. You know, Mickey Rooney and Ginger Rodgers as 30 year old Freshmen at near bankrupt State U saying . . . . \\"let's put on a show and save the college!\\"<br /><br />But there were some truly excellent \\"big\\" epics made in the fifties and the early sixties. Knights of the Round Table, Bridge over the Kwai, Lawrence, Ivanhoe, Quo Vadis to name but a few. And to that list you should add \\"El Cid,\\" the mythic story of the hero of 11th century Spain, trying to unite the cities of Toledo and Madrid and Seville, keep peace between the Spanish Christians and Spanish Moors, keep the sons of King Ferdinand from slicing and dicing eachother, and try, like any husband, to stay in the good graces of his wife, Sophia, rarely looking as beautiful.<br /><br />So it's big actors acting on a grand scale. I didn't care for some of the camera angles, but overall, the picture packs a wallop. It should be on your list of \\"larger than life\\" movies. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000001ELR|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best KISS album of the '80s, if not THE best KISS album ever. This album shows what a rock group should really be about. As usual, Paul and Gene jam with their outstanding, unique voices and instrument-playing. Not quite sure who did guitar here, Ace or Vinnie, but whoever it was, they did a very good job. Eric Carr, God rest his soul, did not surprise me here when I heard his knock-out drumming. I personally think he was and always will be the best drummer to walk this planet. DANGER is my favorite here, with the awesome guitars, Stanley's wonderful singing, and Carr's hard-hitting drumming. The rest of the songs are just as noteworthy, and if you're just a rock fan in general, I think you just might take a liking to this outstanding album.
B000001ELD|1.0|I have been a kiss fan for 30 years. I love kiss but I hate this cd. I hated it when it came out and I hate it now.<br /><br />how Gene Simmons could make such an awfull excuse for a record I just don't know. even hard core fans I no agree stay away.<br /><br />only worth buying to complete a collection,not for listening pleasure. my advise STAY AWAY IT SUCKS!<br /><br />the other 3 our pretty good , Ace is the best in my view of the solos.not one of the solo albums is a lovegun album so keep that in mind.
B00063MBU8|4.0|I grew up when punk rock was invented.  Good punk bands always had a certain edginess to their sound.  This CD is good and fun to listen to, but I can't help but think that it sounds as much like bubble gum music as it does good punk rock.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the music, but I am guessing that I will tire of it in a few weeks.
B000002UAU|5.0|I love every song on this album.  From beginning to end I'm kept enthralled by every word that's sung and every note that's played.  Some are instant classics, such as Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and A Day in the Life, but many of the songs that have been classified as filler by many people need to grow on you.  Mr. Kite, She's Leaving Home, Fixing a Hole, and Lovely Rita are all awesome songs, but they are an acquired taste.  Some of them sound better after you know the meaning, and some of them are just so orchestrated that it takes a while to get used to.  Overall though, I wouldn't trade this album for anything, as it's in my top five.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|I approached this film with high expectations, which faded fairly quickly once I realized it had that phony hollywood-hyperrealism that one associates with certain Steven Speilberg movies. The supposedly lower middle class neighborhood looked terrific! (I wish my town had such a prosperous underclass.) From the very start, it was clear that a viewer was required to suspend all logic and judgment as we watch a child docily get in a car with a stranger, while his two passive playmates look on, and the crowded neighborhood is suddenly bereft of even casual onlookers. No child I know would do that without putting up a fight, kicking, screaming, running away....anything!  <br /> <br />The film unfolds with layer upon layer of suspended disbelief required. The Savage brothers are absurdities -- I felt like they had been dropped in from another movie like the cast of Who Killed Roger Rabbit.  Stereotypes abounded, from the evil, beanie-wearing skateboarders to the inexplicable match between the murdered girl and her boyfriend, who looked about 6 years younger and 50 IQ points stupider than she. <br /> <br />I agree with reviewers who praised some of the acting. There were indeed some masterful performances, although character development was virtually nil. Even given my rolling eyes, I stayed with the movie until the end, when all pretense of plausibiliy was dropped. I absolutely fault the direction, if not the screen-writers. How did Sean Penn's wife become such a depraved human being? From whence comes the black hole that is Sean Penn's character himself? We are bludgeoned with the molested-child theme until Tim Robbins' character is ground to a pulp and yet have no insight into Penn's character or motivations. The end of the film drops like an overripe fruit, revealing a sickly sweet rot. My entire family was appalled by the totally amoral tone (including a cynical teenager). I felt disturbed and sullied just for having watched this film, because it seemed to imply thatevil -- not good -- is lighter than air. <br /> <br />What redemption -- the scrim against which all good tragedies are projected -- are we to conclude occurs? The idiotic reunion of Kevin Bacon and his estranged wife (who had his baby while she was away, and would repeatedly call him without being able to say a word until -- voila! -- he admitted he had been sort of withholding and she came flying back) doesn't qualify; sorry. The completely confusing and senseless disintegration of the inexplicably pathetic young perp and his friend? The overwrought pathos of another young boy (Robbins' son) being robbed of happiness? What happens to Penn, ye olde double murderer? Anything at all? Isn't the police department remotely concerened about who has murdered the second victim in this movie?  <br /> <br />Gaaaaaak! Morally bankrupt, facile and gratuitous premises, shallow direction, some fine performances. Leave it .
B0001LJC2K|3.0|Wanted to like this album.  Had heard them compared to radiohead.  Heard a few of their songs from previous records and liked not loved them.  I just find though I like the singer's voice, I'm not as excited about the music or production.   <br /> <br />Some good songs like \\"Time is Running out\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" but also several not so exciting songs.  Decent but I think maybe I'll have to go back and check out earlier stuff.
B00005JMAH|5.0|All this video is about is how to get over creature fright, like Boggarts. Harry Potter uses Expecto Patronum to challenge the boggart. It doesn't even have any education in this dumb video. I do like it when Malfoy says filthy little mudblood at Hermione, though. That part tears me up! Don't even get this video with violence because this stinken movie has no educational skills... <br /> <br />Just kidding! This is the best Harry Potter movie anyways.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|It's sad to say, but the greatest western movie ever made was this Leone masterpiece.  It had everything one could want, but it's main strengths were obviously its unique style and its humor.  I would rank it slightly ahead of other great westerns like Shane, Magnificent Seven and Tombstone.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Theres not much you could tell anyone that would help them understand this weird CD.  Punk, hard rock, rap, dance, shoegazer, and even spanish are all the different kind of songs on here.  Some tracks are boring and i cant stand to listen to, like the unmixed version of 19-2000, the remixed version of clint eastwood, or Rock the House.  But i will not discredit the rest of this accomplishing music based on a few crappy lines. Ill just refrain from complaing about the ones i dont like and talk about some of the ones i do. M1 A1 has a very long intro that is kind of annoying, but once it gets to the song, its an intoxicating punk rock song that makes it worth the wait.  'Tomorow Comes today' is a slow sad song that makes you sit down and just think, and 'Gravity' is a strange song that begins with a man singing in a peircingly loud voice with a guitar.  Punk is another stomping song that is sadly too short, can get you throwing things and stomping and no time.  And my last favorite 5/4 is a sad, strange song that reminds me of 'tomorow comes today'
6305428352|1.0|This movie is just like To Sir With Love except they added an orchestra and took away characters or a story you could care about.  It espoused a rather elitist view of the importance of music vis a vis other high school curriculum.  A previous reviewer who described it as maudlin got it right on the nose.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I'm sorry I missed this film in theaters.  To use a clich, I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I thought I had it pegged from the commercials - that Tom Cruise is a hit man, and that Jamie Foxx finally outsmarts him.  Not quite.  Nothing that predictable happens in the movie.  Tom Cruise gives a terrific performance in his first, all-out villain role (not counting the anti-hero, Lestat), with a head of prematurely gray hair.  He attacks the part with his trademark enthusiasm, and is truly breathtaking when he is called upon to use violence.  Jamie Foxx is proving that he is quite an actor in development.  Michael Mann, one of our best directors, wisely avoids the stereotype of making the race-card a factor between these two opponents: Cruise likes and respects Foxx, and thinks he is helping him out. <br /> <br />Michael Mann's masterpiece is Heat - another film about Los Angeles by night.  This one is not as epic in scope - in fact, it all takes place in one night - but it still inhabits the same world of shadow-people.  One thing that nobody seems to be talking about - this movie LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SHOT ON DIGITAL.  Video has a different look than film, and I'm surprised to see Michael Mann go for it.  It still looks impressive, but it has a different feel to it.  <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliot Smith albums have always taken a while to grow on me.  And usually once they take hold, I cannot stop listening to them.  From a basement is no exception to this.  At first listen, his raw pain and emotion are too much to handle.  But after letting the feelings sink in a few times, it has shown itself to be an incredibly vital recording, equal at most moments to his very best.  Pretty (Ugly Before) swings from happy highs to frightening lows on the self-esteem rollercoaster of the singer.  Fond Farewell is bitter-sweet, of course, yet just like a moth to a flame you return to it again and again.  Twilight is the emotional apex of the album for me.  The images his words paint take on a personal context, yet also makes you feel like you are there with Elliot at his most intimate and desperate. <br /> <br />Not for the weak hearted, From a basement is an inspiring and depressing work.  Smith's death is a terrible price to pay for such a gift.
B000063S6Z|4.0|a balanced work by a visionary artist: balanced in the sense of delivering the delightful pop, gospel and jazzy electronica elements without going \\"over-bored\\" with politico musings or hyperkinetic metal wanderings.<br /><br />Overall a very enjoyable album.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I really do like this album, it's a very lyrical peice that also has its rock moments. It is, however, not for all pink floyd fans. If you perfer the guitar solos and stuff from previous peices you'll probably not like this album. If you like Water's lyricals and stuff you'll LOVE this album. But if your like me and love both this album will please mostly. I liked every part of it(especially Post War Dream,Get your filthy hands off my dessert, and not now john) except one song, Paranoid eyes, i find this track boring and monotonous. other than that I rank this album only slightly lower than the greats (Wall, WYWH, DSOTM, animals)

What a happy coincidence! <br /> <br />Perhaps if a few more people read this book, we can eventually end this tribal silliness.
B00005U8EM|5.0|When I want to feel better about life, I pop in this DVD -- it's a real mood-booster. If only we all could repeat a day until we got it perfect. The underlying philosophy I take away from this film is that we need to live life to its fullest and love one another. That might sound corny, but isn't it the truth?
B0002EXH40|3.0|After the commercial success of \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", it became apparent that Megadeth was going to go for the kind of mainstream popularity that Dave Mustaine's former band, Metallica, had achieved.  \\"Youthanasia\\" found Dave and co. evolving (more or less) their sound which said farewell to the thrash sound that made them known.  Make no mistake that \\"Youthanasia\\" is a fine album, but compared to the masterpieces that came before it with \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" and \\"Rust in Peace\\", \\"Youthanasia\\" is a let down.  Singles \\"Train of Consequences\\" and especially \\"A Tout le Monde\\" are superb tracks with some awesome guitar work, but other than those tracks and \\"Reckoning Day\\" and \\"I Thought I Knew it All\\" there isn't really anything special.  \\"The Killing Road\\" and \\"Black Curtains\\" are solid tracks, but they lack the punch and Dave's sneery-esque lyrics that made his previous works so great.  Following albums, \\"Cryptic Writings\\" and \\"Risk\\" kept the same formula of \\"Youthanasia\\", and were still as nothing as influential as their previous material.  This remixed and remastered edition sounds almost identical to the original version, and as a bonus there is a demo of \\"A Tout le Monde\\", the previously available \\"New World Order\\" (which was available on a Duke Nukem' compilation), and previously unreleased tracks \\"Absolution\\" and \\"Milennium of the Blind\\".  While these are nice little bonuses, this new edition isn't worth shelling out the cash for if you already own the original.
B0000028UK|3.0|This is'nt really an album thats really great, its more of a an album with a handful really good songs. <br /> <br />\\"Animal\\" \\"Rearview Mirror\\" \\"Daughter\\" \\"Small Town\\" \\"indifference\\" an underated song, some of Pearl Jams most outstanding music. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is pretty raw and unfocussed - not that thats bad, if you like that sort of thing. <br /> <br />But its a record that is defintitley Pearl jams most rawest and in your face.
B0002EXH5E|2.0|Megadeth's final album on Capitol Records, 1999's \\"Risk\\" is by far Megadeth's worst album, and the last to feature guitarist Marty Friedman, and the first album without drummer Nick Menza.  It starts out catchy though with \\"Insomnia\\" and what appears to be the surprisingly solid \\"Prince of Darkness\\" which ends up becoming cheesy.  The first single from the album, \\"Crush 'Em\\" is plain 'ol ridiculous, while \\"Breadline\\" just sounds way too made for radio.  \\"The Doctor is Calling\\" and \\"Wanderlust\\" are solid tracks that find the band's experimental turn beginning to pay off, but the rest of \\"Risk\\" from there on is severely lacking.  This new remixed and remastered edition includes some remixes of \\"Insomnia\\", \\"Crush 'Em\\", and \\"Breadline\\", but what makes it worth checking out are Dave Mustaine's linear notes on the inside of the booklet as he reveals just how the album took shape.  This was followed by 2001's \\"The World Needs a Hero\\" and the recently released \\"System Has Failed\\"; both of which thankfully find Dave and co. reverting back to their old ways and ditching (more or less) their mainstream angle.
B0000027RL|3.0|\\"Once\\" \\"Even Flow\\" \\"Alive\\" and \\"Black\\" well they're the best parts of Pearl Jams debut album \\"TEN\\" but at times this album is overated and down right boring!!! And it extremely mainstream which of course is bad. <br /> <br />The radio really killed this album, especially \\"Jeremy\\". <br />Only cause its easy for mainstream audiences to accept it. <br /> <br />\\"vs\\" is also not their best. <br /> <br />The real Pearl Jam began with Vitolagy (although a bit of a dicey album) and the following albums. So maybe even No Code was the start of them. <br /> <br />The first two Pearl Jam albums are overated and unpleasant and downright annoying at times. Pearl Jam have really progressed since their debut album.

B00028HBKC|1.0|Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", is the epitome of pretentious filmmaking. From the start the film screams pretentious, with the use of a [...] and the overly artistic cinematography. After the thirty or so minutes of mellodrama, Mel jumps straight to the gore. Now I'm not about to [...] about the films' content, because frankly I was not at all disturbed. But I did find it to be extremly dull and after the fifth-teenth time Jesus fell down under the weight of the cross, I began getting [...] off. Hell, I'm sure the film would have been half the lenght had Gibson not opted to present every seen of bloodshed in super-slow-motion. Mel Gibson cannot direct, we have seen so with \\"braveheart\\", he is merely capable of producing mawkish [...] like this.

B0002VEPRQ|1.0|This is for the 2013 release edition of Mary Poppins.The first thing you will have noticed is the one star rating.The film itself is five stars all the way.This is a classic,through and through.The one star is for the terrible transfer.<br />I bought and reviewed the 40th anniversary edition(I did not buy the 45th)and had a disc from a few years prior also.The 40th was the best print to that time, and is strangely FAR superior to this 50th anniversary edition.The 40th was mastered in THX for better sound and picture,and it really made a BIG difference.There is no such reference here and again,the lack thereof certainly shows.It looks no better than the disc I first bought years ago.Just the opening credits tell the tale as the camera pans the skyline of London,the graininess is evident throughout.Shortly after when we visit the Admiral, that scene is grainy.Later the skyline where Mary,Bert and the kids climb into the London sky on a soot staircase...terrible.In the 40th the entire film is without grain at all...crystal clear.<br />I have to shake my head when I wonder why Disney would use an inferior print for a 50th edition,which to me would seem to be a little bit more significant than a 40th or 45th.And only one disc at that.This edition,to my way of thinking, should have replicated the 40th with the same two discs or maybe three.In the very least the picture should have equaled or surpassed the 40th.Considering 10 years have passed, and the technological advances we have made in just that short time,to me it would be a no brainer.<br />If you are in anyway thinking of getting this 50th edition,forget it.I see the 40th is still available.Grab that instead.to a Dolby 5.1 \\"Theatre Mix\\"(the original 2.0 theatrical mix is also included).<BR>Translation:\\"Fantastic\\".<BR>The movie never sounded as clean or as good.I couldn't help but to sing and tap my feet to all the numbers.<BR>The set is loaded with a surfeit of extras that will satisfy even the most picky of movie buffs from footage of its' opening premiere in L.A. to a making-of special.<BR>So grab the popcorn,get yourself seated comfortably on the sofa,turn down the lights and slip into the magical world of Mary Poppins like you've never experienced before.<BR>Oh yes a heads up, grab the hankies for the \\"Feed the Birds\\" scene/number....you'll need it.

B00003CXDD|4.0|This is one of my favorite adventure films of all time. The movie \\"Willow\\" is a great adventure movie about small Willow is who is an \\"Elwin\\" (a race of small dwarf-like people who live in a village). When Willow's children find a \\"Dykini\\"(Bigger people like you and me)child on the side of a river, he decides to take her to the village council. When the High Elwin(leader of the village) tells him to take a journey to bring the child back to the Dykinies, he soon finds out that the evil Queen Bav Morda wants to destroy her and finds himself in the middle of a great adventure that leads him through encounters facing the great swordsman Mad Mardigan(Val Kilmer), knights, dragons, trolls, fairys, and evil sorcereses.Highly recomended film. <br /> <br />-Watch for the cool scene with the two headed dragon(Eborsisk) done by using dazling special effects a stop-motion animation.
B00003CXA2|5.0|How does an actor like this ever get a job. The man is just stunning in his perfomance in this movie. The epitome of this movie is just outlined in the back don't let the cover decieve you. This is just another pathetic excuse for a movie that tried to become something big overnight but failed. I seriously don't know of anyone who found this movie even close to amusing I mean common it's just another movie with a guy who has no idea in what era he's living in not to mention the history of his own country. probably the only thing that was somewhat alright was the thought of Gump's father being the creator of the KKK nice little touch up but whatever this movie was terrible in the making
5550155184|4.0|Robert Langdon, a renowned expert on codes and arcane symbiology, finds himself enmeshed in a conspiracy involving the Vatican, a far-right-wing Roman-Catholic sect, an over-zealous Parisianne detective, the Louvre's curator, his beautiful and brilliant cryptologist granddaughter, a secret and centuries-old society and the works of aLeonard Da Vinci.  On a working vacation in the city of lights, Langdon is called to the Louvre to comment on the murder of Monsieur Sauniere, its curator, whose body has been found amid the Western world's greatest collection of art.  At first, Langdon is told that he's needed to explain the mysterious condition of the victim - splayed to resemble Da Vinci's \\"Vitruvian Man\\", and covered with symbols hinting at a deeper-then-average understanding of codes by the victim or the killer.  The action ratchets up a notch when Langdon is warned by Sophie - Sauniere's estranged granddaughter -  that the police's interest is not quite academic: when first arriving on the scene, one of Sauniere's mysterious messages found by the police was Langdon's own name - making him the obvious suspect.  Skeptical, Sophie urges Langdon to run, knowing that this will only cement suspicions against him.  On the run, Langdon and Sophie - herself a police cryptologist - piece together clues left behind by her grandfather.  It soon becomes clear that the elder Sauniere was the grand master of a known yet still impenetrable secret society, one possessing knowledge that may shake the foundations of the western world.  Unfortunately, the order was not secret enough, and a mysterious assassin has managed to identify its key leaders and murder them.  Now only Langdon and Sophie remain to find and save the secret, pursued by the police and by the assassin himself.  Can they find the secret - and if they do, will it be enough to save them.  Should the secret be found at all?<br /><br />I admit I was prepared to hate \\"Code\\", partly because of the hype, but mostly because it seldom stopped hinting at an earlier Brown book, the horrible \\"Digital Fortress\\" - which also involved codes, code-breaking by unusually intelligent individuals, and a psychotic assassin.  That said, \\"Code\\" was at least satisfying in its first half and came alive in its second as a well-paced thriller that easily compensates for its weaknesses.  Unlike \\"Fortress\\", \\"Code\\" is more of an ensemble piece - Brown wisely hooks the hero up with other characters: besides Sophie, there's a wealthy and franco-phobic British ex-pat who knows so much, you're wondering if he's broken the code himself.  While Brown sets up the Church to take the fall as the novel's heavies (the ancient secret, from early on in the story, is one long suppressed by the church; also, Langdon's French pursuer is both politically ambitious and a loyal Catholic), a more threatening and mysterious character is soon made the story's true villain.<br /><br />\\"Code\\" is fun, though it pays to know when the story should and must not be taken seriously.  The novel has taken pot-shots for its bleak light on the Church, though its punches are light - signaling that it takes little in this day and age to establish a dim view of organized religion, and also that Brown doesn't so much as undermine traditional religious teachings as he does just present alternative theories accepted as true by his heroes.  The real villains of course are us - the ignorant masses who blithely weave ancient and highly spiritual symbols and ideas into our daily lives without making the slightest attempt to understand or appreciate them (yet unsurprisingly buy Brown's books).  All religions seem to thrive on this ignorance, in Brown's estimation, with Catholicism falling victim to Brown likely due to its longetivity - it's been exploiting that ignorance of the \\"deeper secret\\" longer than most faiths.  (New-ageism rates hardly a mention, and Brown never explains how the secret's revelation will have any effect on those who simply don't care that much about religion in general.  Brown hints at a shallow knowledge of Judaism likely confused with the Hellenized brand of the latter second-Temple era.)  The pacing so smoothly ramps up the suspense in the second half, that by then, you've forgotten how much of the first half involved Langdon simply telling Sophie various bits of arcane knowledge, essentially reminding you how smart he is.  The protagonists know so much, you begin to wonder if the story will leave enough of a secret for them to find, or if the secret really is secret at all.  You also forget how shamelessly the story trades on your willingness to presume that some characters may turn out for the worse based simply on their being Catholic prelates or simply loyal Catholics at all.  And you don't really mind how Brown's heroes rely less on common sense for the most part then on some obscure knowledge that just happens to come to mind when it comes in handy.  Nothing in \\"Code\\" is likely to change anybody's mind about.  It's a fun read when you remember that it's mostly a well-written chunk of pop-suspense - one most enjoyable when you don't try to imagine its based on the so-called kernel-of-truth.don't care that much about religion in general.

0312997221|5.0|This author's method is to lead you into the story small detail by small detail, revealing characters' personalities and histories as needed, and -- in this case -- giving the reader a short course in the appalling history of the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the mutual genocidal efforts of most of its ethnic groups. Ricky Colenso is an teenage idealist, scion of a wealthy U.S./Canadian family, and his desire to make a difference leads him to volunteer as an aid worker in Bosnia over the summer. Then he disappears (though the reader knows what happened to him before the other characters do) and his wealthy grandfather, a veteran of the Battle of Britain, pays a man known as the \\"Tracker\\" to uncover his fate. Later, he will also pay another specialist, the \\"Avenger\\" to bring Ricky's killer to justice. That would be the formula for a harrowing tale of revenge all by itself, but there's more: The targeted killer is being assisted by someone high up in the CIA as a matter of \\"the lesser evil for the greater good.\\" And all this is taking place in the summer and early fall of 2001. Forsyth leaves you to wonder whether a righteous attitude toward justice is necessarily the best way to go, knowing what we now know. This has the potential to make a terrific film.
B0002S947K|5.0|I'm not very good at articulating why I like or don't like a particular piece of music, but I bought this CD because a.) I heard the song \\"How Come\\" being played on local radio and I really liked it, and b.) because it was recommended by one of my favorite music stores in Austin. So I went out and plucked down 10.99 not exactly sure what to expect. <br /> <br />All I can say is it was money well spent. This is one of the few cds that grabbed me from the first moment I played it. Two months later I still play it on a regular basis. From the first song through the last there isn't a weak song to be found, but to me a couple of songs stand out including; Trouble, Hold You in my Arms, and Forever My Friend.  <br /> <br />There are some who might want to compare him to Bob Dylan when he was starting out, but only time will tell if he stands the test of greatness. But he is surely one of the best song writers of today. <br /> <br />I'm not good at explaining why, but this is without question my favorite CD of 2004. And although it will never get the airplay it deserves, it is a cd that should be heard by all. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
0312995423|2.0|\\"Digital Fortress\\" should more properly have been named \\"Implausible Sandcastle.\\"  In skimming over the more recent Amazon reviews, it became clear that many people are buying into some of the underlying factoids in this book.  Coleridge wrote of \\"a willing suspension of disbelief.\\"  Well, I am certainly willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of an amusing thriller, but I am not willing to suspend it as much as this book requires.<br /><br />At the heart of the story is a handy-dandy superdupercomputer.  Dan Brown, in a single brief passage, casually explains why this computer is so special.  Special?  Why, it is the Holy Grail of computer breakthroughs.  If such a computer existed, breaking codes would be one of its most trivial functions, about on a par with addressing envelopes with a current top-of-the-line supercomputer.  If such a machine existed, the world would be changing in as radical a way as the change from isolated mainframes to ubiquitous PCs.  Codebreaking?  Who cares?  Important things would be happening!<br /><br />Even more implausible is the book's administrative and bureaucratic environment.  I flat out do not believe that a code breaking establishment with a $2 billion tinkertoy at the heart of the intelligence apparatus of the nation would, for all intents and purposes, routinely shut down and be left unmanned (or unpersoned, if you will) for the weekend.<br /><br />Then there is the gentle art of code breaking and decipherment.  It is clear (from his erroneous description of Julius Caesar's ciphering techniques, from the peculiar notion that four-letter code groups specifically relate to Enigma machines, from the emphasis on brute force methods) that Dan doesn't know Jack about it.<br /><br />Wrap all this in a plot in which every character consistently acts more idiotically than the next at every possible opportunity, and a killer who is so deadly that he might be taken for the second cousin of a upas tree except when he tries to bump off the hero (again and again and again)--and one might almost conclude that the author had intentionally written a shaggy dog story.<br /><br />Dan Brown?  With a sense of humor?<br /><br />Nah!again)--and one might almost conclude that the author had intentionally written a shaggy dog story.      Dan Brown?  With a sense of humor?     Nah!
B0006399FS|3.0|First off, this is a good cd and is well worth the money to add to your collection, especially if you are a U2 fan such as myself. <br /> <br />With that being said, I wanted to like this cd more than I actually did. I've been listening to it for 3 weeks now and I still find myself wanting to like it more than i actually do. It's not that it isn't a good cd, it's better than most of the stuff that came out this year. The problem I have, the same problem I had with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", is I wanted it to live up to the greatness of \\"the Joshua Tree\\", Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\", which is unfair because those cds set such high standards for the band that it would be almost impossible for them to top those cds. I had the same problem with last years \\"Hail to the Theif\\" CD by Radiohead, as good as it was, I wanted it to be as great as \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"The Bends\\", but again it would be almost impossible for them to top the greatness of those cds. <br /> <br />But in the end I would recommend this cd to any U2 fan. It's got your typical mix of U2 rockers and rock ballads, and like I said, is much better than most of the cds that came out this year. <br /> <br />
B000059TFO|5.0|I briefly saw this movie several years ago, it depicts very well the way things were. I met the brother of one of the men who got caught up in the ones who were guilty. He did prison time, even tho he allegedly did not do anything. I am proud to have this in my collection, i want my children/grandchildren to see what it was like when the world was so cold, hatred was rampant towards the blacks. I was glad to have someone so close to the story tell me all the details that I have remembered. It is a very good movie, it was well worth any price I might have paid for it. The fact that it was not computer generated made it even better, as I see it.
B0000019HU|5.0|What? Slint reunited? Whoa, time for a look back on Spiderland. <br /> <br />Tweez was decent, but damn, Spiderland was a revelation, a beautiful, disturbing, involving masterpiece of six epics. This record, for better or for worse, started the entire math rock movement and to this day, the record destroys all of the Slint Jr.'s the appeared after their demise. <br /> <br />It's a shame Slint broke up when they did. Spiderland leaves one wanting more, something which the self-titled EP sort-of did. \\"Breadcrumb Trail\\" utilizes a loud mid-section that's angry and carefully calculated. \\"Nosferatu Man\\" set the template for everything June Of 44 and the like have done since. \\"Washer\\" is a darkly gorgeous epic with an incredible climax. And \\"Good Morning Captain\\"? Do I even need to explain. One of the best indie rock songs ever composed. <br /> <br />The record is mixed low on CD, and it's short, but that's no excuse for not owning this. Spiderland deserves all of the heaps of praise it's amased over the years, if you give the record a chance.

You won't feel like you've seen it before, or think it resembles any other film you've ever watched - definitely one of a kind.  It's a very imaginative story.

B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Dear Franz Ferdinand, <br /> <br />Everyone thinks you're a gift from the gods, but I don't see it. Can you proove otherwise? I mean, you guys have the talent and the catchy tunes. But I feel like I've heard it all before. I assume you guys listened to lots of The Cure, Gang Of Four, and Joy Division back in the day. Have you heard a record called Turn On The Bright Lights by Interpol? Yeah, your album kinda reminds me of that, only sleazier and more rocking. Hey, I think you guys have talent, but I'm wondering why every rock critic in the world treated your first record like a classic. See, I just don't see it. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but I'm not hearing the personality. Oh well, you're still better than Jet and The Killers. But I have a feeling you'll be the next Strokes. Remember when everyone said Is This It? was a piece of brilliance? Yeah, I do too. I think they went a little overboard then. Anyway, best of luck, and here's wishing maybe next time around you'll have a distinct persona to display. <br /> <br />Love, <br />Paul
B0001MDP3G|4.0|At first I could not see how anyone could turn a deserter into a hero.  Then I realized that most of the time you don't get to be a hero until you're dead.  So Jude Law chooses Nicole Kidman over heroism and you can't blame him one bit unless you're the type that thinks everybody ought to live by the sword and die by the sword.  No, my only real problem with Cold Mountain is the nearly obligatory sex scene.  Sure, most would say its natural and beautiful etc.  But if watching other people make love in real life is considered a perversion, why is it \\"beautiful\\" to watch simulated sex on the big screen? It just takes an otherwise intelligent and thoughtful drama into the temporary realm of porn. I think what it really comes down to is a lot of directors just really want to see their leading ladies get naked.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This film is not for people with short attention spans, nor is it for people that do not understand what it is like to feel out of place, to feel lonely.  If you can relate, the film is like deja vu...lost in a world that you don't feel a connection to, knowing no one and feeling nothing.  The disconnect is depressing for some but, for others, it is a common occourence.  This film is about adjusting to this unknown world, finding comfort in meeting someone that feels the same way you do, and those people and events that you only encounter for a short amount of time but never forget.  Visually, it is beautiful, and the actors give wonderful performances.  I am very glad I bought this film.
B0000042H4|5.0|As a consumer with limited resources, I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring and state my case for Solti's RING series.  I bought the 1984 CD set piecemeal (one every couple of months) in 1996.  Then in 1997 Decca came out with this \\"remastered\\" version.  Fie!  With my limited resources, I naturally shunned it.  Nor have I heard many other versions, apart from the Levine/Met GOTTERDAMMERUNG and several CDs of RING \\"highlights\\" (most of which are worthless - George Szell's purely orchestral disc is the best).    The Solti series has never let me down, although it is not perfect.  WALKURE is patchy, due to the erratic singing of Hans Hotter (Wotan).  Otherwise, no complaints that don't go to the essence of the thing itself, i.e. Wagner's occasional turgidity and the language barrier that makes me have to sit with a libretto to really understand what I'm hearing.      The Decca set is still ahead of its time, in the way it approached the task of creating a \\"living\\" performance that could be bottled and sold without losing any flavor or fizz along the way.  It's fundamentally different from \\"live\\" performances recorded at Bayreuth or the Met, because here is a RING conceived for your record player!  In that respect, the Decca RING is uniquely spectacular.  Solti and the engineer, J. Culshaw, worked hand in hand to bring this off, and the performers gave their very best as well.      This is the SGT. PEPPER of opera recordings - maybe not for every taste, but admirably progressive and impossible to ignore.  Too bad so few record companies followed Decca's lead - one reason there are so many \\"live\\" recordings is that they are less expensive and less troublesome to record.  Despite its claim to greater authenticity, a \\"live\\" performance that you can put on a shelf is a fossil, pure and simple.  An artful studio recording will nearly always trump a good live recording, if you accept that both are unreal representations of a work that truly \\"lives\\" only on stage or in themind.  So, if you can't attend a certain performance of RHEINGOLD, I believe you'd be better served by Solti's highly artificial studio version than by a \\"live\\" recording of that performance you missed, unless it was utterly brilliant or you're some kind of \\"collector.\\"         The bottom line:  even with the crude 1984 CD set, even with Hans Hotter hitting notes that do not exist in Western music, I am perfectly satisfied and have no interest in buying another version of the RING.  If I want to hear a good Wotan, I will buy a ticket when he comes to town.
B00003CX95|5.0|\\"Every man dies, not every man really lives.\\"    The Paramount-produced, Mel Gibson-directed BRAVEHEART retells the story of William Wallace, the medieval warrior who battled for Scotland's freedom from oppressive English rule. What makes this film timeless is a dominant thematic strand that weaves its way through a multi-colored tapestry: the struggle for freedom.    William Wallace was born around 1270 to Sir Malcolm Wallace, a landowner in Scotland's Renfrew 'district'. Wallace joined a resistance movement - of which he soon became the leader - in the mid-1290s. Skirmishes and minor offensives led to larger-scale engagements. Contrary to the insistence of some, the confrontations at Stirling and Falkirk were real historical battles (11 Sept. 1297 and 22 July 1298, respectively), as was Bannockburne, in 1314, the decisive victory that spearheaded Scotland's freedom. Stirling proved a strong victory for Wallace, three months after which he was knighted; at Falkirk, however, he met with disaster. Years later, in August 1305, English troops seized him in Glasgow, from which place he was transported to London to face charges of treason, even though he insisted he never did homage to the English crown. He was shortly executed in much the same way we see in the film (hanging, beheading, dismemberment), only to have Robert the Bruce, the up-and-coming heir to the Scottish throne, take up the torch one year later, much (no doubt) to Edward I's dismay.    Edward I (Edward the Longshanks) had a preference for efficiency and practicality in his push for political reforms, for which he was known through the mid- and late-thirteenth century. Possessing good leadership skills, he could display courage, loyalty, and even affection, in his closer circles (familial and administrative). When near the end of the century his moral psycology degenerated, his reign became increasingly characteristically autocratic. BRAVEHEART captures his traits after this change (occurring about 1294), dishing out tasteless porcels of his arrogance, lawlessness, vengefulness, and cruelty. He died two years after the martyrdom of William Wallace. His initiation of a quarter-millenium of unremmitting hostility between English and Scots probably ranks as his most far-reaching damaging accomplishment.    BRAVEHEART occasionally swerves off the historical path on its journey to recapture Wallace's life and the larger national fight. We know little, if anything, about Wallace's romantic life. It seems improbable that 'Longshanks' would have reinitiated \\"prima nocte\\" (first night). Most outrageous is Wallace's impregnation of England's queen-to-be. On the other hand, the movie contains several points of correspondence with history. We do know that Edward I did undertake considerable campaigning in France at the time, at least early on. Wallace's revenge on the man who murdered his wife, and the events immediately following, seems to have been based off an incident in May 1297, in which Wallace set fire to the fortress of Lanark and killed its sherriff. Edward I may have bought over most of the Scottish nobles (by 1304), in order to \\"quell the rebellion.\\" And, as previously mentioned, there are the film's major battles.    The movie gives us a taste of Scottish culture (bagpipes at a funeral, a post-matrimonial dance), opening rich, poignant windows into its distant heritage. We see and feel the Scots struggle to maintain their autonomy as a people. Wallace is a very believable, passionate fighter with wits and a fierceness to match the situation - and the enemy ... and is a selfless example devoted to a noble cause. In one place, he gives an inspiring speech, quite possibly the most truly rousing of any call-to-arms speech in recent war movie memory. We also see the resistance' internal challenges: bickering over tactics and 'approach,' issues of trust, loyalty and disloyalty, betrayal; we see challenges within the English camp as well: the regime's difficulty in baiting Wallace, a prince too weak to carry on the fight against Wallace, an unloved arranged wife who demonstrates more acting allegiance to the opposing side.    BRAVEHEART, by its vividness and strength, does better than so many movies to remind us, loud and clear, of the dearness and price of freedom. For as long as there is oppression - wherever it is unanswered by justice - that theme will not run forgotten.
B000002IGV|5.0|What can possibly be said about this album that hasn't already been said? With their third release, Twisted Sister blasted into the spotlight of the largely ignorant public. Twisted Sister had been together since the 70's, but unless you were from New York, you probably never heard of them. SO the boys went off to England to record two albums before conquering America with Stay Hungry.<br /><br />Right from the beginning with the galloping guitar riff of the title track, the 'Bad Boys of Rock n Roll' take you on a pleasurable journey of rock n roll, personal freedom, striving for your goals, and a few words of warning.<br /><br />\\"I Wanna Rock\\" and the runaway hit \\"We're not Gonna Take it\\" are here with other great tunes including my favorite \\"Captain Howdy\\".<br /><br />Dee Snider was a great entertainer who screamed his way through his sets with foul language and gutter talk. He was great. WIth his pink and black costume and shoulder pads, he was an 80's icon. I was so glad to see them get back together for a reunion tour a little while ago. Dee Snider, Mark 'the Animal' Mendoza, Jay Jay French, Eddie Ojeda, and A.J. Pero can still rock and can show the bands today a thing or too.<br /><br />This was their biggest selling album, but if you need more Sister, I highly recommend \\"You Can't Stop Rock N Roll\\".
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'll admit it -- I'm not a fan of the Special Editions.  They're just don't do anything for me, and I don't like the idea of adding footage for adding's sake.  That's what it really seems like George Lucas has done here.  I really wish that Lucasfilm would've released the original versions of these films along with the SE.<br /><br />However, something is better than nothing, and since we're not going to get the Original Versions on DVD...it's better to have something.<br /><br />The transfers are beautiful.  The colors pop, the sound is awesome.  I'll admit I still get a little bit of drool on the corner of my mouth watching them.<br /><br />I found the commentary tracks to be entertaining for the most part, although the director of ESB is a little obnoxious.  I could have not listened to him more.<br /><br />Finally, the extra stuff on the 4th disc is full of interesting material.  It's worth getting the set for that disc.<br /><br />I'm sorry for whining just a bit about the Original versions...I'll try to relax and not let it get to me too much.
0380778556|5.0|My family read this book for our Family Book Club.  I must confess that we picked it without knowing anything about the book, other than what the back cover said.  We didn't even know that there was an Oscar-award winning movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on the book.<br /><br />This haunting, gothic novel kept us on the edges of our seats.  There were two points of the novel that took us completely by surprise...but looking back, it all adds up.  This book was masterfully written; it is the type you might wish to read again and again.<br /><br />Comments from our book club:<br /><br />Mom:  Didn't fall asleep once (a feat!).  Thought there were a couple of parts that didn't make sense, but after discussion thought it was a good ending (great book to discuss in a book club for that reason).<br /><br />Dad:  Thought Du Maurier's greateset talent was in character development; thoroughly enjoyed watching the heroine of the story as the plot developed.<br /><br />Me:  Definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  The plot twists were great.  Imagery fantastic.  The kind of book that I can't stop thinking about it.  Immense fun.<br /><br />We will definitely get the movie to see what Hitchcock has done with this book.
0064471837|5.0|I don't know why it took me nine years to discover this amazing novel written by the absolutely brilliant Garth Nix!  From the first page, I was joyfully absorbed in the world of the Old Kingdom, necromancy, and the dead.  Garth NIx has truly created an unforgettable world full of believable characters, situations, and an interesting form of magic called charter magic.  The writing has it's own subtle touch of origionality, and Garth Nix gives you the feeling that your in good hands and are in for a good read.  The plot was superb, amazingly constructed, and I can say with authority that is one of the finest YA novels out there to this date. I must now eagerly wait for my copy of Lirael to arrive!
B000007T1M|5.0|OK, first off i agree with \\"phaylon\\" (NY). Sugar is a great song, but my personal favorite, is suite-pee. And to add on to that , sugar is a excuse for people to tell there friends that they like SOAD. Other great songs are Spiders, a great easy to listen to song, Peephole, a carnival type sounding song about drugs, ofcourse suite-pee, about the people who belive in religon, suggestions, one of my personal favorites, a very easy to listen to song and upbeat, war?, a great song all together. Anyways, this is a great album, even though they really broke through with Toxicity, this is in my opinion, better. Serj's, the lead singer, has a excellent way of explaining how he fells about the problems that are not taken care of so that makes him in my opnion, frustrated, so he takes it out on song. But think what you want, but this is a really great album that never gets boring and I have had it for about a month, and it still hasnt left my CD player
B00005JLCI|5.0|There are those who would say <br />That Hamlet is a play <br />About a man who could not make up his mind. <br />But if you look well to the tale I will tell <br />You will see that it is nothing of the kind. <br /> <br />The words you see written above actually came to me in a dream. <br />Having read quite a number of the excellent reviews of this film, I only want to add to what has been said. <br /> <br />Many attempts to bring Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" to the stage or screen possess considerable virtuousity but little virtue.  If all it was was a revenge play, a la Marlowe's, it would not be the haunting, irresistible work of genius that it has been for centuries.  Any interpretation/performance of the play that cannot get beyond the revenge element never rises above the dumb show level and therefore cannot be justly praised.  Branagh's effort, in contrast, allows the genius of Shakespeare greatest play to be seen by all. <br /> <br />For \\"Hamlet\\" has always been a 'might have been' revenge play.  The principal character, Hamlet, does battle both within himself and without because he is both heir to a Classical, Hellenic heritage as well as to a Christian one.  To act according to the former impulse might not betoken sufficient obeisance to the latter.  What to do?  Does his father's ghost show him the way or is that the work of the devil?   And so Hamlet the Detective emerges, resisting any simplistic solution to the predicament which the play presents to him.  He wants to put things right but how?  The magic of what happens to his personality is fully realized in Act V by Branagh.  Who is this guy who becomes the non-instrumental instrumentality and who quotes both Matthew and Socrates in the same dialogue not long before his dying breath?  It is, as Professor Harold Bloom has indicated, the Poem Unlimited, par excellance, and Kenneth Branagh has allowed us to experience it. <br />For me, it was the first and only time I ever felt that anyone had ever capturedthe essence of what Shakespeare had accomplished.  I am grateful for the experience.

B0000C9JFO|4.0|L'Auberge Espagnole has a double meaning.  The literal translation, \\"the Spanish Apartment\\" can be interpreted as the place where Xavier, the protagonist played by the Frenchman Romain Duris, finds himself during his stay in Barcelona.  The other meaning refers to a type of pudding whereby people bring their own ingredients and mix them together to form the main dish, which is particularly applicable in this movie, which details the lives of international students living in Spain for a year. <br /> <br />Xavier is the son of divorced parents, his father is a person with connects with French bureaucracy, and his mother is a hippie.  Xavier is dating Martine, played by the luminous Audrey Tautou of Amelie and Dirty Pretty Things.  Contrary to the DVD cover, Ms. Tautou only plays a minor role, with less than 15 minutes total screen time.  Xavier feels trapped by his current condition, his love for Martine slowly fading away and without many prospects for a career after school.  His father pulls some strings and finds a job for Xavier in the bureaucracy, but they require that he study Spanish and economy.  Xavier decides to enroll in the Erasmus program, which is a foreign student exchange system whereby students in the European Union  can go to member countries and learn the local language and take classes as well. <br /> <br />He finds himself in Barcelona, temporarily living with a young French doctor and his wife, whom he met on the trip.  After some mishaps, Xavier moves to the titular Spanish apartment, where he rooms with an eclectic mix of students, British, German, Dutch, and Italian.  With these fellow strangers in a strange land, Xavier will learn much about life, love, and himself. <br /> <br />L'Auberge Espagnole is hard to categorize, and much like its title, it has layers of meaning.  On one hand it is a comedy, with many funny situations taking place, including fun with words, situational comedy and even broad slapstick; particularly memorable is a desperate dash that occurs when the boyfriend of the one of the roommates decides to make an unannounced visit at the precise moment that she is occupied with another man.  On the other, it is a drama, touching on issues of meaning, the pursuit of happiness and the crossroads that we all find ourselves as we finish college and must embark on \\"adult\\" pursuits of job and family.  It seems surprisingly real in many levels, especially in relation to the feeling of alienation that we all feel when we find ourselves in a new environment.  The acting is natural and unforced; the characters themselves have layers of personality; no one is simply the hero or the antagonist, the characters have conflicts and flaws within themselves, and that makes them that much more real.  As a matter of fact, possibly because I'm not familiar with this particular cast, I was drawn into their lives that much more, so much so that when Ms. Tautou is onscreen, it jarred me a bit, seeing her famous face in this mundane environment, taking me out for brief moments from the immersion of the movie. <br /> <br />The movie starts mainly in French, but switches over to English, French and Spanish in Barcelona, as Xavier gains fluency in the local language.  Subtitles might turn off some viewers, but highly recommended to everyone else.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This is just great movie, maybe best of the year, which is interesting, since the plot, when I heard about it, didn't strike me as particulary original (boy was I wrong).  It's also Mann's best since \\"Heat,\\" and to some extent even better than that also-great movie. In \\"Collateral\\" Mann shrinks the scope considerably, stripping it down to the bare essentials. Oh, there's a wider cast, a plot, and those wonderful camera shots of the city, but what's happening, always, is in the cab, with killer and cabbie. Cruise is a killing machine, but unlike Arnold, he actually acts. The little tics, those eyes, the clipped delivery of lines, Mann burns the reality of the killer right into you. You believe, without doubt, that Cruise -- so often a hero in other flicks -- is a very bad man. Fox is also a good, understated, foil, with his dreams and hopes, colliding with a nightmare (and noirish) journey into the American night. What chance does he have? Watch and see.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Wow, what can I say.  This movie is part Rock Video, Part Art, Part Social Commentary.  This is my first induction to silent films and I think I'm hooked. Silent cinnema forces you to concentrate on the images, and what images.  Unforgettable scenes that have a unique beauty rivaling many of todays movies.  The music for this release was made from the original musical score, but performed by a modern orchestra.  POWERFUL!!  Music is such an important part of silent cinnema and this music delivers. The story is billed as being difficult to understand, It was basically a story about the oppresion of the worker by the rich and lazy.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0006419J6|3.0|Race Plagarism Revisited: \\"I, Robot\\" <br /> <br />Reviewed by: Matthew C. Stelly <br /> <br /> In 1993, I came up with a concept called \\"race plagiarism\\" to describe the lack of creativity of today's crop of novelists, as well as TV and movie scriptwriters. In a nutshell, I see in recent movies the lack of true creativity and instead, the borrowing from African American history. These people take actual events and then change the color, the species and the setting of a \\"story\\" and attempt to pawn it off as original thought. Recent examples include \\"The Planet of the Apes,\\" \\"Alien Nation,\\" \\"Star-Gate,\\" and \\"Alien vs. Predator. <br /> Joining this list is a new member of the \\"Race Plagiarism Model,\\" Will Smith's recently released, \\"I, Robot.\\"   <br /> This movie attempts to conceal (and as a result, reveals) the underlying plot and insinuations regarding American race relations. Take Uncle Tom's Cabinet, mix in a little of Sam Greenlee's \\"Spook Who Sat by the Door\\" and add a little bit of the historical realities of Nat Turner's slave rebellion and a pinch of John Brown's logic (just before his raid on Harper's Ferry) and you've got the essential recipe for this movie. <br /> The movie reminds one of the days of slavery where there was an over-dependency on the enslaved by those in power. In this movie, the \\"slave\\" is the robot, who is trained to obey three commands: These commands, similar to the \\"Black Codes\\" that were passed to control black people are, as follows: <br /> 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  <br /> 2. A robot must obey orders given it by man beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. <br /> 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. <br /> As was the case during slavery, the enslaved began to outnumber the \\"master\\" (remember: the \\"negro\\" was made and manufactured in America), and the peoplein control grew wary. If the robots did not do their job, they were summarily destroyed. Not with lynch ropes, but by being decommissioned. <br /> Those robots who were banned (put out of commission) began to come together and as such, planned to rebel against the system. The result, as in any instance where large groups of entities are systematically exploited: a well-planned revolution. <br /> One robot tells humans, during the bloody revolt, \\"You cannot be trusted with your own survival. To ensure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered.\\" Aren't these nearly the exact words of your current President? And in a nation where the people are supposed to be in power, does this statement by a robot ring a bell: \\"The created must sometimes protect the creator, sometimes against his will.\\" Are we, the people, even now, being \\"protected against our will\\" even though it's supposed to be OUR government?  <br /> And earlier, when one of the `overseers' is chastising a robot, he utters, \\"You are so like children. We must protect you from yourselves.\\" This is exactly what our ancestors were told on the plantation even as those in power built the most powerful economy in the world - on our backs. <br /> The racism historically heaped upon the backs of blacks was personified in Smith's character. HE was the one made to look \\"prejudiced against Robots.\\" In fact, the robots protecting the system, along with Smith and an Uncle Tom robot named \\"Sonny,\\" defeat the resistance - as was the case with Denmark Vesey and Gabriel Prosser revolts in 18th century America. If you don't recognize these names, look them up. <br /> The fact is, even though the movie is set in 2035, the creators of the robots see an need for these robots to have human faces, and yet the robots are white. And speaking of color, note that Smith, being black and the police chief, also being black, never mention race a single time? We can deduce, from this, that the scriptwriter was white (they are ones of wantto depict th future as being one of \\"colorblindness\\" although their race has always been color-CONSCIOUS). <br /> Another piece of evidence indicating the race  (or consciousness) of the writer? Not a single sister. Not one black woman. Smith's female colleague is a white woman. But, true to form she helped \\"the man\\" to create these robots, but then turns on him when she finds out that several of the robots have `revolted.' Check out corporate America and who does the bidding for that Old Boys Network at the top. And since there is no black wife physically in this movie, no girlfriend of color, this means that all of Smith's heroics are aimed at saving who? The white girl.  <br /> Just as assimilationist blacks are marched out and made \\"leaders\\" by the white media, this robot \\"Sonny\\" becomes the leader of the resistance. At the movie's end he stands atop a hill looking down at them. He (having sold out and who has human characteristics) will define their future and direct their lives for them. Look around Omaha; doesn't this sound familiar? <br /> Finally at the end of the movie, Sonny, the robot makes a statement that represents the epitome of the true slave: \\"Now that I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do.\\" Smith tells him, \\"I guess you'll have to find your way like the rest of us, Sonny ... I guess that's what it means to be free.\\"  <br /> The question is, will black folks, not just robots, be FREE in the year 2035?  <br />  <br />   <br /> <br />
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead's Dummy was the first cd i ever bought from the \\"trip-hop\\" genre and after listening and learning so much more about this style of music i still haven't found a cd as brooding and dark with such creativity, sound and vocal-wise, as this cd.  <br />Granted some tracks stand out more then others its still one i can throw in the cd player and play through without giving it a second thought.
B000002H4Q|3.0|I'd really give this album 3 1/2 stars. First off, I'm an avid Cure fan. They are my favorite band and their live show was amazing. That being said, I feel this is one of their weakest albums. There. I said it. However, there are defintate bright spots. First off, \\"The Kiss\\" is one of the most intense, chilling, and electrifying songs they've ever done, and sets incredibly high expectations for the rest of the album, which are never quite met. Then you have \\"Just Like Heaven\\" - a Cure staple. And after seeing the live version of \\"If only we could sleep tonight\\" on \\"Trilogy\\", I can say it's a definate highlight. However, songs like \\"Snakepit\\", \\"One More Time\\", \\"Icing Sugar\\", and \\"The Perfect Girl\\" drag the album down. Overall, the biggest problem is that this album has aged the worst out of the Cure's discography. In some respects (don't hunt me down and shoot me for what I'm about to say...) I feel that Wild Mood Swings does a better job of accomplishing what Kiss Me(3x's) tried to.  <br /> <br />All of that being said, this album is a worthy addition to anyone's collection. The album is worth owning for \\"The Kiss\\" and \\"Just Like Heaven\\" alone. It was an important step for the Cure and led to the grandaddy of them all, \\"Disintigration.\\"
B00008PRR9|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Who, and I purchased this album recently.  It is filled with great music, and the bonus tracks include the six-song EP \\"Ready Steady Who\\" which features a great rendition of The Beach Boys \\"Barbara Ann\\", very cool.  However, I was rather disappointed, angry really, that the crew that worked on releasing this rendition of A Quick One decided to exclude \\"Happy Jack\\" from it's place on the original album. I found this to be all the more odd, because it's such a famous Who tune.  Not only that, but in the title of the LP.  It was replaced by a song called \\"Heat Wave\\", which is indeed a fine song, but it isn't \\"Happy Jack\\".  I would really like to know who made the executive decision to cut this song, and would also like to know, if they wanted to put \\"Heat Wave\\" on there so bad, why didn't they just go ahead and do that, but leave \\"Happy Jack\\" alone.  There's plenty of room for both.  I will note that there is a \\"Happy Jack\\" acoustic bonus track on this album, but it hardly lives up to the electric studio version.  Although this fact disappointed we rather greatly, I still enjoy this cd and would recommend it, but make sure you have \\"Happy Jack\\" on some other album also, because otherwise you'd really be left on a great song.
B000002HH9|4.0|I've always liked the Cure, and have slowly acquired each of their albums (except Seventeen Seconds because I heard about the remasters coming out before I went and got it....still waiting???). I saw them live on their Curiosa tour and it was in the top two concerts I've ever attended (along with Sonic Youth). Why do I mention all of this? Because it took a year of listening to the Cure before I purchased Wild Mood Swings. I was like everybody else, just reading the reviews and not urgent to find out what was on this supposedly crappy album. Then I bought it and thought I'd figure it out for myself. All I can say is any true Cure fan would love this album. I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned there is a \\"learning curve\\" for getting into the Cure. If you start with this album you're bound to think it's not worth the price of the plastic it was burned on. I did the right thing by getting this last, but it doesn't make it any less of an album. <br /> <br />One key point that needs to be made is that some albums, i.e. \\"Pornography\\", \\"Faith\\", and \\"Disintigration\\", are deep, pesonal, and emotionally draining listens. Not every album needs to be this emotional and deep. As much as I love those albums, I'd go crazy listening to then day after day. They need to be treated like a fine wine, only to be enjoyed on certain occasions. Otherwise you'll loose all sense of feeling for those songs. Albums like WMS are needed to balance out the equation. In fact, they make the darker albums all the more dark. <br /> <br />About the album: the Cure has always been known for amazing album openers, and this is no different. \\"Want\\" is a brooding classic that rivals \\"Open\\" from \\"Wish\\". People have mentioned the songs are too sweet and sugary. My question is, what's different between, say, \\"Mint Car\\" & \\"Strange Attraction\\" from WMS, and \\"Why Can't I Be You\\", \\"Hot, Hot, Hot\\", \\"Just Like Heaven\\", or \\"Catch\\"? WMS is not any more happy or schizophrenic than Kiss Me(3x). Besides, onlyabout half the songs on this album reach \\"happy\\" status if that's what you're worried about (and why would you be anyway?). My personal favorite song is \\"Numb\\" with its carefully selected string parts. Other standouts include \\"Jupiter Crash\\" and \\"Bare\\". Best thing though? Thanks to people like the ones who write 1 star reviews for this album, I bought it for $2!!!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise has gotten a bad rap when it comes to dramatic roles. I for one think he is underrated. If this role doesn't convince you of his great skills, I don't know what will. He plays a hired killer named Vincent, with 6 hits to carry out. When he first hires a cab driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx we think he seems like an average man. As the story unfolds and Foxx and us realize what he is capable of doing, we are in shock and awe. Foxx is excellent in this role. Typically he has been type cast in comedies, but he shows he is quite capable of dramatic roles as well. He does a great job of playing an average man that is caught up in something he can't escape without taking drastic measures.<br /><br />I am a fan of Michael Mann and I am glad to see him direct another great movie. Scenes such as Max stopping for a Coyote, show how he is humane. While Vincent shows us how cold blooded he can be killing a Jazz club owner after talking to him about jazz. Any fan of movies like \\"Manhunter\\", \\"Heat\\", or Tarantino movies will definitely want to buy it. The style that Mann uses to show the dark side of the city and human nature is excellent. The quality of the DVD is first class and the extras include documentary, deleted scenes, cast, filmakers, and production notes, and more. Well worth getting for yourself or a friend that like crime dramas.

B000002AD0|5.0|If you are a Santana nut like I am, then just buy this now!  <br />  <br />Santana is one band that really performs well live!  This CD is not perfect, but it really is a masterpiece of their early work.  Considering that the recordings from Woodstock are not all that great, this CD was a wonderful find for me! I have seen Santana in concert many times over the years and here is an excellent example of the high energy early Santana crew at their very best! <br /> <br />This is one of the 20 or so CDs that I keep in my car at all times (and I have over 2000 to choose from!)
0380789035|4.0|This novel is a fine example of murky humor that grips and pulls in the reader, even while straining his or her suspension of disbelief to the limit.  The story unfolds nearly but with unexpected turns, taking the reader into a strange alternate reality.  Shadow, the main character, is vividly depicted as a solid yet somewhat troubled individual.  Although the author presents shadow's perspective throughout the book, something about his personality remains pleasantly enigmatic.  While the depiction of the gods of various pantheons as figments of human imagination come to life is difficult to accept at points, it works when taken in light of the exaggerated mythological accouts of many ancient and modern religions.  If you enjoy science fiction, fantasy and/or speculative fiction, get a copy of this book and enjoy.<br /><br />Some stories make great novels but terrible movies.  I hope that this wonderful work never makes it off the page and onto the silver screen.
B00000J7J4|2.0|I love the first three Santana albums to death, Carlos Santana is one of my favorite guitarists of all time, and I've always enjoyed reading interviews with him, as his thoughts are insightful and refreshing. However, Santana's big-selling comeback, Supernatural is a big disappointment. Instead of fiery hot instrumentals and jazzy piano-led songs that Santana did so well back in the early days, there's an abundance of annoying pop songs with appearances by one hit wonder musicians. The only song on Supernatural that features a worthwhile musician is Santana's duet with Eric Clapton, which is actually a memorable jam. Basically all the other duets are with untalented, one hit wonder singers/songwriters like Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 (\\"Smooth\\") or even more forgettably, some guy from the band Eagle Eye Cherry. Supernatural could have been a good album if Santana had jammed with timeless, talented musicians like B.B. King or Ray Charles (RIP) or Stevie Wonder. Unfortunately, he let the greedy dudes at the record company make the choices, something that, though made him a lot richer, possibly sacrificed his integrity.
0800177177|1.0|Not only does this film bear only a slight resemblance to the novel of the same name, the movie is a terrible boor in and of itself. One wouldn't imagine a novel which has close to half a thousand pages and is a very satisfying read could be reduced to two hours and eight minutes of nothing. For the sake of those who may, to my dismay, desire to watch this movie I will not go into any great detail. However, turning each character into someone else on almost every occasion, as well as making some of them (perhaps unintentionally) sickly comedic was almost too much for me. I read the novel due to my love of vampiric lore, and forgetting about Dracula simply is not permissible. I was incredibly surprised by the power and wonder it held, as well as being extremely well written. I was very eager to watch this movie due to the fact that people have gone on and on about how it is the most faithful adaptation. I suppose if you compare it to the other movies which bear the name Dracula but have no resemblance, with the exception of a Romanian accent and blood sucking, that statement would be true, if not wildly inaccurate. I'm keeping this short so people will read it and not waste their time on this sad B-movie like interpretation of a wonderful novel. And if you have yet to, read the novel it is very good.  <br /> <br />
B0000DJZA5|2.0|My title speaks for itself. This CD sounds pretty crappy. Great songs to be redone by basement bands of today, which was my purpose in buying it. But it's obvious the Fabs were on the way out. It really blows if you're looking for great listening of the band.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, outdid himself when he came up with \\"Once More With Feeling. For those who don't know, this episode came in the middle of the dark sixth season. Her friends, thinking they were saving her from eternity in hell, resurrected Buffy, leaving her feeling torn out of the heavenly dimension she was really in. Buffy turns to Spike (James Marsters), who was in love with her (much to Buffy's disgust) for comfort and in attempt to feel something real. Meanwhile, Xander (Nichloas Brendon) and former-vengence-demon Anya (Emma Caulfield) face fears about their upcoming wedding and Giles (Anthony Head), Buffy's Watcher, feels he is no longer needed to help Buffy. Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's sister suffers from feeling neglected but the main relationship focused upon is Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara (Amber Benson), who dealing with Willow's magic addiction. After an argument in the previous episode, in which Tara confronted her girlfriend about using too much magic, Willow cast a spell to make Tara forget their fight. Also, Xander accidentally summons a demon called Sweet (Hinton Battle) to get everyone's feelings out in the open but ends up putting Dawn in danger when Sweet claims her as his bride.  <br /> <br />\\"Overture/Going Through The Motions\\" starts things off with the wonderful instrumental featured in the very beginning of the episode followed by Buffy's first song, \\"Going Through The Motions\\". This song talks about Buffy's feelings about life after she's been resurrected. It establishes that she does not think she feels anything real. Sarah Michelle Geller does not have the best  voice, but she remains in character so it fits. \\"I've Got A Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together\\" is basically three songs in one. The first part, \\"I've Got A Theory\\", discusses the group's theories about what's causing the spontaneous singing. \\"Bunnies\\" is sung only by Anya, who is terrified of rabbits. The part is probably not necessary but is a nice touch. \\"If We're Together\\" has excellent harmonies from the group, though it mostly focuses on Buffy, who states that it doesn't matter what happens because they will find a solution. \\"The Mustard\\" is a quick  song that really does not make sense without the episode. <br /> <br />\\"Under Your Spell\\" is a stunning, lyrical ballad sung by Tara to Willow. Amber Benson has an incredibly beautiful voice that fits perfectly with the song. Unfortunately, the lyrics serve a double meaning because in this episode, Tara literally was under one of Willow's spells. Nonetheless, it is a stunning song heightened even further by Amber's performance. \\"I'll Never Tell\\" is a funny duet sung by Xander and Anya. In it, the two list all of their fears about getting married. Nicholas Brendon is not really a good singer, but like Sarah Michelle Geller, he completely remains in character. Emma Caulfield on the other hand has a great voice. \\"The Parking Ticket\\" is similar to \\"The Mustard\\", as it also makes little sense without watching the episode. \\"Rest In Peace\\" is Spike's main song in the episode, in which he tells Buffy that he loves her, but if she won't love him back, she should leave him alone. James Marsters sounds incredible and expresses the emotions behind the song impeccably.  <br /> <br /> \\"Dawn's Lament\\" has great music, but only really has two lines in the end, which shows Michelle Trachtenberg's extremely underdeveloped voice, although that may be because of her age. \\"Dawn's Ballet\\" is a wonderful instrumental track that fits a little better with the episode than the CD, but is good nonetheless. \\"What You Feel\\" is sung by Sweet after kidnapping Dawn, The lyrics are slightly incoherent, but Hinton Battle has a great voice that fits wonderfully with the jazzy-style. \\"Standing\\" is another major song in the episode, and is sung by Giles. This song expresses exactly how he feels unneeded and how Buffy would be better off if he left. Anthony Head is also one ofthe better singers on the cast so the song is extremely well-done. \\"Under Your Spell/ Standing Reprise\\" is sung after Tara discovers Willow's spell on her. In this song, both Tara and Giles decide to leave even though they wish they could stay. The two singers sound absolutely stunning together.  <br /> <br />\\"Walk Through The Fire\\" is somewhat confusing, because the characters often sing over each other but it does emphasize the whirlwind of emotions expressed in the episode. Almost every character sings in this track, and they all bring ideas from their solo (or at least previous) songs, making an overall great track. \\"Something To Sing About\\" is a real turn-point-song because it is in this one that Buffy's friends discover that they have taken her out of Heaven. Buffy sounds weak on the bridge, but otherwise sounds great. \\"What You Feel\\" ties up Sweet's character, exiting him from the episode. \\"Where Do We Go From Here\\" sets the group up nicely (from an emotional perspective) for the rest of the season as it shows they're confusion at their situation. \\"Coda\\" brings the episode to a close, with Buffy and Spike sharing their first kiss. As additions to this album, there is the Main Title/End Credit song from the episode, which is not really necessary but a nice addition. The three instrumental tracks from different episodes are all stunning and extremely emotive. Lastly, there is a demo version of \\"Something To Sing About\\" which is just as good as Buffy's version.  <br /> <br />Overall Mark: 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall, this album is stunning even with the actor's varying degrees of vocal talent. Obvious standouts are Amber Benson, Anthony Head and James Marsters. Sarah Michelle Geller and Emma Caulfield are pretty good as well however Nicholas Brendon and Michelle Trachtenberg are pretty weak. Alyson Hannigan cannot really carry a tune, thus she has about five lines on the entire album. Despite all this, all actors manage to stay in character while singing. The songsthemselves were incredibly written and suited the actors and characters perfectly.  Joss truly outdid himself.
078062999X|4.0|As an amateur scholar of William Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet,\\" and having seen almost every film version that's currently available, I would have to say that this is probably the best that has ever been made. Why? For one thing, it's the whole play, running four hours. Secondly, it is gorgeously filmed, with amazing sets and costumes in 70mm. And lastly, the cast is mostly dead-on in their performances, although there are a few notable exceptions.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's dream of bringing and uncut \\"Hamlet\\" to the screen is almost entirely successful. For a film that runs four hours, the pace never wavers, and not for a minute does the viewer get bored. Seeing the whole play also enables you to the various themes, such as the disintegration of family, the political and social world of Denmark, and the full motives of the characters. Because you spend more time with them, the characters seem more real, and the tragedy is enhanced.<br /><br />As Hamlet, Branagh has moments where he is positively brilliant. He also has many moments where he is obscenely over the top. This is a trademark of his acting and not limited to Hamlet, but I feel that he should have known better. However, when I think of Hamlet, it's the image of Kenneth Branagh that pops into my head, and that's what counts. Julie Christie does a wonderful job of making Gertrude a complex woman, torn between her duty as queen and mother and her lust for Claudius. As Claudius, Derek Jacobi does the best acting in the film, turning a character that is usually played as a villain into a vulnerable, guilt-ridden, human being. It's a crime that Jacobi didn't receive awards for his astonishing performance. Kate Winslet is well-cast as Ophelia, and gives a typically good performance, although I feel that her mad scenes didn't quite hit the mark. Richard Briers makes Polonius a shrewd and cruel politician, a far cry from the silly old man he's usually played as. Michael Moriarty is also wonderful as the doomed Laertes. The rest of the cast is uniformly great, Charlton Heston as the First Player and Brian Blessed as the Ghost in particular. The one actor that seems terribly out of place is Robin Williams as Osric, which is disappointing. Even Billy Crystal works as the Gravedigger.<br /><br />See this version of \\"Hamlet,\\" if you can get your hands on it. It's the best that's been made, and I don't see it being topped anytime soon.tes.

B0002XVQNU|1.0|I dont care if it was the Director's cut, producer's cut, affleck cut, diamond cut or whatever, this movie was garbage.  The character portrayed by Affleck, Daredevil, did some of the fakest things I have ever seen in a superhero movie.  I loved daredevil. i used to have the toy long ago, used to watch his chararcter on X-men that time he starred in an episode, i even read many of his comic books.  But this man was virtually flying in the movie.  He's jumping off of tall buldings and not breaking any legs.  I understand he got ultrasonic hearing but from that accident, but the other things were just unbelievably fake.  The worst part in the movie, was when he met the female character in the movie and out of nowhere they just start arguing  and then fighting each other in business-casual clothes. they didn't even know each other. Then if I can remember, I think they kissed, or were about to kiss. U can't introduce a superhero in his first movie and have another superhero in it with him. The movie was terrible. I can't believe my roomate bought it. It was as bad and as fake as The Hulk.
0784011710|5.0|\\"There are so many things you do not understand. There are so many things I cannot tell you. And the truth does not make it easier to understand.\\"<br /><br />So says Sophie Zawistowski, the tormented woman at the center of \\"Sophie's Choice.\\" Alan J. Pakula's film of William Styron's novel stands proudly alongside \\"Schindler's List\\" as a document of the Holocaust, but while the latter film tells the story of a people, this movie chooses to tell one woman's unspeakable story. Everything about \\"Sophie's Choice\\" is right. Pakula's direction and screenplay are superb, and the cinematography by Nestor Almendros is breathtakingly beautiful. The centerpiece of the film, however, is Meryl Streep's Oscar-winning performance as Sophie (probably the most deserved win in history) and the equally brilliant turns by Kevin Kline (in his first film role) and a very young Peter MacNicol.<br /><br />A young writer named Stingo (MacNicol) comes to Brooklyn \\"on a voyage of discovery,\\" and while living there meets Sophie and Nathan (Streep and Kline), two lovers who quickly befriend him. Stingo soon developes a crush on Sophie, and learns that she is a survivor of Auschwitz. While the seductive Nathan becomes ever more dangerous, Stingo gradually learns the secrets of Sophie's past, a past filled with terrible secrets and unbearable pain and guilt.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gives possibly the best film performance ever as Sophie, completely becoming the Polish Holocaust survivor. The range and complexity of her performance is astonishing. Streep has many monologues as Sophie where she reveals more an more of the horrors she witnessed in the concentration camps, and these are all filmed in close up on Streep's face. It's riveting. As played by Streep, Sophie is a woman filled with immense hope, but also haunted by suffering, her eyes almost always close to tears. The final scene of \\"the choice\\" is almost unbearable in its intensity and will disturb you for days. A monumental performance that never seems like acting.<br /><br />As an actor, Kevin Kline tends to go over the top, but he does some of his best work ever in \\"Sophie's Choice\\" as the demented Nathan. His mood swings from lovable to terrifying are completely believable, and quite scary. Peter MacNicol also makes the most of Stingo, probably the least interesting character. As the film's narrator, his subtle and honest work holds the movie together. Without him, it wouldn't work.<br /><br />At 150 minutes, \\"Sophie's Choice\\" is a little overlong. Alan J. Pakula was so concerned about being faith to the book that there are several scenes that probably should have been left on the cutting room floor. However, the movie is a remarkable achievement, one that will make you cry and leave you completely absorbed the entire time. \\"Sophie's Choice\\" plays like a mystery. You can't look away until you find out the terrible secret of her past.

B000006OAM|3.0|\\"When They Ring the Golden Bells\\" is, in my opinion, the best song on the album.  It's one of the few where you can understand most of the lyrics.  My main criticism of this album is that like so many recent popular music albums, you can't understand most of the lyrics.  This whole album has a very murky sound and is in fact worse than many. Due to Merchant's beautiful voice, the album is not a total loss and hardcore fans might want to include it in their collections.  For anyone buying Merchant the first time, Tigerlily is a much better choice.  The album sounds a lot like funeral music, but very good funeral music!  That's not saying much.  I hope Merchant comes out with some better albums; something a little more upbeat next time would be nice. <br />She had too wonderful of a voice to waste on a poor album like this.  If you are into funeral music and depression, by all means, get this album.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Finding Neverland put a perspective of the book, I'd not seen.  I am 66 and STILL wish I could fly like the birds and swim under water without the aid of aparatus.  I still wish there were fairies and mermaids and think this an awesome thought.  Finding Neverland tells me there was once a \\"kindred spirit\\".  Mr. Barrie...  I loved the blend of reality and the formation of his famous play, loved witnessing how life bled into his story, loved seeing the impact on the children about whom he wrote.  For me, the film is a must see, again, and again, and I'm already wishing the DVD was released.  For the young and the young at heart, it's a satisfying film.
B000063UR1|1.0|I'm truly amazed by the positive reviews this sorry excuse of a movie seems to get from some people. Guys, have we seen the same movie ? <br /> <br /> <br />The storyline jumps from one implausible turn to another. Some details beat world records of utter stupidity. The acting is lame (though you really can't blame actors when they are provided with such substandard material to work with). The whole thing is incredibly corny and ludicrous.  <br /> <br />And incredibly boring.. unless you decide to \\"make fun\\" of it in which case I admit this movie offers almost endless possibilities <br /> <br />But seriously, don't waste your money on that movie, you'll only regret it. <br /> <br />Trust me on this one. <br /> <br />Frenchval <br /> <br />P.S. : one detail I cannot resist to tell :  <br />when ordering to jettison the greenhouses, the higher authority insists that once this is done, the greenhouses must be destroyed with..atomic bombs ! <br />(which, of course, are provided in vast quantities in the standard ordnance of \\"greenhouse spaceship\\"..) <br />Just in case plants, trees, flowers and cute little rabbits might survive on their own in deep space, I suppose.. <br />This, I hope, will give you an idea of how grotesque this movie can be, and I guarantee you, there are loads of things just as incredibly ridiculous all along the storyline.
B000002IGP|5.0|\\"Hair Metal\\" could be perceived as a derogatory term.  The present media all use it as a derogatory term....All those VH1 (and in Canada, Much More Music), VJs try to tell those of us who grew up with bands like Ratt, that somehow it's not good music because it was \\"hair metal\\".  Clearly, Ratt was more than that.  Out of the Cellar is simply the best 80's metal album there was.  To clarify, AC/DC is not 80's Metal.  AC/DC is simply great hard rock!  That's why Ratt's first major label effort gets my nod as best metal album.  It fits alongside other same-era disks as Quiet Riot's, Metal Health; Motley Crue's, Shout at the Devil; & WASP's debut.  Those bands were in a class by themselves.  They weren't classic rock or classic metal.  They were the new breed of L.A. glam-rock-metal that would take over the charts for a very short, glorious time! <br /> <br />This album starts with \\"Wanted Man\\"  which is a strong opener.  It eventually became a single and sported a video featuring the Ratts in cowboy gear, riding horses.  It's with the second tune, \\"You're in Trouble\\" that you realize that this album is special.  A heavy bassline that erupts into a killer chorus.  Then, the definitive Ratt tune, \\"Round and Round\\".  Now a classic rock staple, this song was obviously aided by one of the best videos in music history.  Featuring the late Milton Berle (a relative of manager Marshall Berle) it propelled the catchy tune into heavy rotation on MTV, and that was all she wrote!  Ratt were now household names.  You have nothing but strong songs that follow....\\"In Your Direction\\",  \\"She Wants Money\\", the rocking, \\"Lack of Communication\\".  Then another single, \\"Back for More\\".  A slow-tempo song, it shows off the strength of this band.  \\"The Morning After\\" and the speedy \\"I'm Insane\\" lead up to perfect closer, \\"Scene of the Crime\\", which has as catchy a chorus as any Ratt song.   <br /> <br />Ratt featured the unique vocals of Stephen Pearcy and one of the greatest guitarists in modern rock, Warren DiMartini.  When you think of 80's guitarists, he's right there with the George Lynch's and Angus Young's of the world.  To quote Sherman T. Potter of MASH, \\"not enough o's in Smoooooooth\\" to describe DiMartini's playing. <br /> <br />This is a true hard rock-metal classic, and fits into my top ten albums of all time.  A bargain at any price.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's sophomore album \\"Stripped\\" is completely different from her debut self titled album.  Her debut self titled album was very reserved, and pretty much just like any other up and coming teen pop princess's album.  After her album was released she was compared to Britney Spears, Mandy Moore and even Jessica Simpson.  The first two singles off her debut album \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" and \\"What A Girl Wants\\" were catchy, upbeat, and directed to a younger audience.  Christina broke out onto the music seen, followed the teen pop princess mold, and held back on her true vocal talents.  But with her sophomore album \\"Stripped\\" she didn't want to suppress her vocal abilities anymore.  Her first two singles off her sophomore album \\"Dirty\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" let you see a new mature Christina.  She was no longer the little girl we remembered.  Christina fused rhythm and blues in \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", hip-hop in \\"Dirty,\\" rap in \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" and gospel in \\"Soar\\" creating an extremely diverse album.  She even did a duet with R&B favorite Alicia Keys and also rap artist Redman.  My favorite song on this album happens to be \\"Infatuation\\" which has a Latin flavor to it. In that song she talks about giving into the passions of love and the consequences you may have to face.  Christina gets even more in touch with her Latin roots when she speaks Spanish in one of her songs.  But this is not the first time for her, since she re-released her first album all in Spanish.   <br />Christina put her soul into her sophomore album with a \\"love me or leave me attitude,\\" which drew me into her music.  This album painted an intimate portrait of her life, and all she has had to endure to be where she is today.  There is no other singer in the music industry quite like her.  She has a style and voice that is noticeably her own.  However after the American Idol Kelly Clarkson came out, many compared Kelly's voice to Christina's but I see no comparison.  Christina has an octave range that is amazing and definitely pleasing to hear.  There is no doubt that this album is one of the best albums you can buy.  I guarantee once you have this album you will play it over and over again from beginning to end.              <br />

Those escape to Earth, where it is Deckard's job to \\"retire\\" them. <br />In this story there is a main and a subplot, which later flow together. The main characters of these two plots have to be looked at.  <br />It is not obvious, if Deckard himself is a replicant or not. there are many clues which speak for and against this suggestion. That is one aspect which makes the book so interesting.  <br />Trough Isidore, as a \\"Special\\" classified and for this reason not allowed to leave earth, one can clearly see that a human being cannot have a relationship with an android. He is very lonely and therefore starts a relationsship with a group of androids, which increasingly exploit him. Later, he, even as a \\"chickenhead\\" realizes this fact.  <br />Even if the book was published in 1968, the treated subject is still up to date. It shows that technical development, which seems to be very useful, can one day become very dangerous.
B00005JLXE|5.0|The previous reviewer, who has a foggy memory and admits to not remembering various scenes of the film at all, insists that Daredevil is a bad film. It's filled with moments that could never happen in reality so it's not a good film. I don't agree. It's a superhero movie and super-hero movies are never strictly realistic. Don't watch this type of movie if you want strict realism. You'd be better off not watching movies at all. Superman has been fooling people with a pair glasses for 70 years. It's classic stuff, and entertaining, but it doesn't make any sense from a strictly realistic perspective. And what about that scene in Batman Returns when Batman punches a hole in the floor of his armored Batmobile with his fist? He's just got human strength! Spiderman has super strength and yet Doc Ock has no problem taking his punches? And there's just no way MJ's hair would blow like that when the taxi cab crashes through the window but IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE not a physics class. Comic book movies are filled with this sort of stuff. Trashing Daredevil, a comic book movie, for not being realistic is just plain foolish. Daredevil if an entertaining superhero movie and the director's cut is an even better version for fans of the film. As for the claims that you can't introduce a superhero with other superheroes: The Punisher first appeared in an issue of Spiderman. Wolverine was introduced in an issue of the Hulk. His introduction to the silver screen was with the X Men. Elektra was introduced in the pages of Daredevil, appeared in the Daredevil film, and now has her own movie. It can be done.
067940581X|5.0|All through high school I stayed as far from the British female authors (of classical literature) as I could...and now I have to wonder why.  I figured them to be drab, sappy, overly sentimental and trite.  How wrong I was!  Upon urging of friends, I picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and enjoyed it immensely (though I disagree with another poster that it was faster paced than Emma).  I immediately purchased \\"Emma\\" and was delighted.  The character, as is mentioned, is flawed...but charming BECAUSE of these flaws.  Emma is a wonderful character and the book is a joy to read.  I will continue my journey through the books of Jane Austen--and I can't wait to continue!
0156027321|5.0|Probably in my top ten favorites because it is so original.  From beginning to end, the writing, characters and story are so vivid and unique to anything I've ever read before.  This is such a journey of the soul you don't even have time to cheer and you definately don't want it to end.

B00026YO36|5.0|I bought this album on the strength of the two singles - Sideways in Reverse + Hit the City. As such, I was expecting a bluesy, fuzzy, rocky ride through the underground. <br /> <br />It isn't quite what I expected. Every song has its own unique sound, no two songs sound alike, and each one has its own story to tell. <br /> <br />The two singles are brilliant, fuzzed-up blues underground glam rock, if that makes any sense whatsoever. Imagine the Velvet Underground on even more chemicals, and you've got Hit The City. <br /> <br />Immediate highlight is Methamphetamine Blues, just for the driving, shipyard drumbeat, and the drawling lyrics. <br />\\"Keep a lock on the kitchen / Do this for your daddy / <br />I'll do it daddy / Eyes wide open, keep my shotgun loaded\\" <br /> <br />Another highlight is Strange Religion, featuring Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan. This is a tender, touching moment, full of introspective lyrics and gentle arrangements. <br /> <br />One of my favourite parts of the album is Out of Nowhere, specifically, the piano break. On a fairly downbeat song, the piano plays a lovely, uplifting melody, which pleased me immensely. <br /> <br />Don't expect a straightforward rock record - don't expect anything straightforward. This is a unique CD, with great songwriting, singing and most importantly, a tangible atmosphere. <br />Lanegan proves his genius many times over on this album, and you'd be remiss to ignore it.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|After the dance pop of Black Tie White Noise, David Bowie decided to return to darker territory. Bowie had become fascinated with the Industrial genre, which was mostly underground before Nine Inch Nails made it big, and noted that it was not too far removed from his Berlin-era recordings with Brian Eno. He decided to reteam with Eno to put together what the liner-notes describe as a \\"Non-linear Gothic Drama Hyper-cycle.\\"    Translated into layman's terms, that means it's a concept album. It's better than any Roger Waters concept album because Bowie remembers that musicianship is most important, while Waters doesn't. But the album's concept is a bit confusing. They were going for something akin to Blade Runner, with a murder mystery that takes our narrator into a world of Art Clubs, Raves, and futuristic technology. The non-linear nature of the story makes it hard to follow(even in the liner notes) and it sometimes seem like you're listening to the soundtrack of a movie that was never made.    The musicianship is thankfully stronger. There is a mixture of Industrial, Art-Rock, and piano balladry with some slight Gothic tinges here and there. Unfortunatly, there are also some segues that are intended to remind us what the concept is(isn't that what liner notes are for?). Segues are annoying when Roger Waters does them, and they're annoying here too. Given the concerns about the album's length, they could've ditched the segues and left us with a leaner 15 tracks.     Standout tracks:    \\"The Heart's Filthy Lesson\\": Melodic number with some NIN style guitar work.       \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\": Hard rocking, straight ahead NIN style tune. Still a staple on Bowie's live setlist.      \\"The Motel\\": Dark, moody piano ballad.      \\"No Control\\": Up tempo number with Front 242 style keyboard work.      \\"I'm Deranged\\": About going insane, with Bowie's vocals driving home the desperation. Soundwise it could've fit right in on Bowie's 2002 album, Heathen.      \\"Strangers When We Meet\\":Melodic quasi ballad, which sounds like a cross between \\"Because You're Young\\" and \\"Heathen(The Rays)\\".        Bowie's late 90s return to form begins here, and if you like Industrial or Experimental Pop/Rock you'll find much to like here too.      Note: \\"I'm Afraid Of Americans\\" generally regarded as Bowie's best Industrial song, is not on this album.
069111966X|5.0|Are you like a dog with a bone when you're working on a brain teaser? After pages of scribbles, do you get a big grin on your face when you turn to the answers and say: \\"I'm right!\\" Then this book is for you. <br /> <br />And if you're not yet a die-hard problem-solver? You should step right up, too. You may get hooked. <br /> <br />G. Polya's book is based on the fact that, if we study how someone does something successfully, we can learn to do it successfully as well. How To Solve It is an application of 'heuristics' to solving problems. <br /> <br />There are certain mental operations useful in solving problems, any sorts of problems. Polya (who was an eminent mathematician and former Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University) describes and illustrates the most usual and useful of these operations, in a way that is irresistible and eye-opening. <br /> <br />These useful mental operations are organized according to when they come into play during the four steps to solving a problem. 1. You have to understand the problem. (Not as easy as it sounds.) 2. Find the connection between the data given and the unknown. Conceive the idea of a plan for the solution. 3. Carry out the plan. 4. Examine the solution obtained. <br /> <br />If you take some time and try to solve the problems selected to illustrate each mental operation, you will be well-rewarded. You will likely discover something surprising about your own problem-solving methods, and improve them in the process. You will definitely discover many new ideas and techniques to add to your arsenal. <br /> <br />For example, a first impulse when confronted with a problem is often to try to 'swallow it whole' -- to try to meet all of the conditions of the problem at once. G. Polya suggests keeping only part of the condition, and dropping the other part. This can lead you straight to a solution you might otherwise have completely missed.  <br /> <br />His techniques help you to stand back and get to the heart of the problem, rather than getting lost in it. <br /> <br />Something else I liked very much about his book is his encouragement to guess, or to reason 'plausibly.' While the final proof must be strictly logical, \\"Anything is right that leads to the right idea.\\" Problem-solving has every right to be fun, as well as purposeful.

B00006JDVV|2.0|Need a plot? There really is no need for you to watch this film. \\"Reign of Fire\\" cashes in on the type of audience that measures film satisfaction in number of explosions per minute and that oh so hip post-apocalyptic feel.  <br /> <br />The movie has some great special effects and some interesting camera angles. That's about the best that can be said for it. If one begins watching the film with that sort of thing in mind, there will be no disappointment. The script? Minimal at best. The acting? Feh. Matthew McConaughey is the absolute worst. Horrible. One can't possibly say enough how annoying his character is, and his over-acting makes Mel Gibson's efforts in other films seem subtle and understated by comparison. Christian Bale is just not quite there. <br /> <br />Still, \\"Reign of Fire\\" can be a fun film, as long as one expects nothing more than lots of mindless action with little to no point.
B000002H33|1.0|Than this album is for you!    I hate this album with an extreme passion.  My hatred for this album can't be expressed with words.  I hate it when people call this abomination \\"complex\\" and \\"intellegent\\".  What's so \\"complex\\" and \\"intellegent\\" about four greasy dirtballs with huge mullets singing 8 minute songs  about death and destruction and darkness?    This music is so grim and morbid it must be heard to believed.  Every song is about the same thing--death, suicide, the horrors of war, and so on.  Would it kill these guys to lighten up a little?  Isn't life to short to obcess over such depressing things?  I'd rather enjoy life and have fun than be gloomy and sad all the time.    And nothing will make you gloomy and sad than listening to Metallica's music.  It is such a bad influence on their fans.  Millions of bored suburban teenages have poisoned their minds with this garbage, and society has paid dearly for it.  Remember the Columbine massacre in 1999?  It is well known that the killers were huge fans of this type of music.  Also, this music encourages depression and suicide.  Anybody that is already depressed will only make it worse by listening to this.    I know all you Metallica nerds will label me a [...] because I don't share your obcession with this suicidal angst music.  But I don't care what you think.  I don't like being miserable.  I like music to be entertaining.  Does this album entertain you?  No, it makes you want to kill yourself.  Its very depressing to hear.  Its suicide music.
0689835604|5.0|I bought countless books before my baby was born, including most of  the classics, and from about 6 months on, tried to get him interested in any and all of them with no success.  Eventually between 7-9 months, after reading the reviews here, I ordered this. And voila! He seemed to like it -- well, he would at least sit still on my lap long enough to turn the pages and lift the flaps!  Three months later, it is definitely his favorite book -- he giggles when I pull it out, and loves to lift the flaps up and down, and up and down, and up and down.  After three months of all that upping and downing the flaps ARE raggedy and curled up, but he doesn't seem to mind. I figure on buying it again when it really gets worn.  I would definitely recommend this if you are trying to get a younger, active baby interested in books.
B000002HRE|4.0|From all of these reviews, its obvious you have to listen and make your own opinion. I think it is a solid album, even though it is a bit softer than the previous ones. <br /> <br />Fuel - 10/10 - They kick it into overdrive right away <br />The Memory Remains - 8/10 - Great song, just not really my fav. <br />Devil's Dance - 10/10 - Hardcore, very sick song <br />The Unforgiven II - 9/10 - Awesome, in my opinion it's better than the first <br />Better than you - 7/10 - Good background music, it adds a lot of mood to whatever you are doing. <br />Slither - 10/10 - This song is sweet. Easy favorite <br />Carpe Diem Baby - 6/10 - Gets a bit old, but not bad at first <br />Bad Seed - 9/10 - Love it <br />Where the Wild Things Are - 11/10 - In my opinion, by far the best song on the album. One of my favorite Metallica songs, period. <br />Prince Charming - 10/10 - Can't never get tired of this <br />Low Man's Lyric - 6/10 - Good song if you aren't looking for a dark edge, but a bit boring <br />Attitude - 4/10 - Annoying after the first 10 times <br />Fixxxer - 8/10 - A bit long, but really good ender <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of my favorites. It's got a dark edge to it, like most Metallica albums. Not as high speed as 'And Justice for All' or 'Master of Puppets', but the content makes up for that.  I say buy.
185459768X|5.0|This particular book is an adaptation of the HDM trilogy for the stage...something I'd have bet money couldn't be done.  It would be a bear (armored bear? ;} ) to stage, but I'd love to see it that way.  Some things got elided, but the main points remain.  A real tour-de-force.
0440237688|5.0|I had to read this for a college class last summer. I think it's one of the best books I've read. I'm not a sci-fi fan, so I wasn't looking forward to it at all. A very thought provoking book. I can't wait to use it in the classroom.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|While preparing for work one morning, I heard Madeleine Peyroux singing the title track, \\"Careless Love\\" on my favorite jazz radio station. I thought to myself: \\"I don't remember this Billie Holiday\\" song... <br />To my delighted surprise, the announcer introduced me that morning to the music of Madeleine Peyroux. The comparison to Lady Day is automatic and apparent, but what I enjoy most about this CD is that the nuance of Peyroux's voice appears to be natural and not contrived; and if it were, so what? I think this particular CD does nothing but respectfully flatter the memory of Lady Day. <br />The CD successfully amalgamates the spirit of the 1940's with contemporary modality. I particularly enjoyed \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome when You Go\\" and Dance Me To The End of Love. <br />Keeping in mind that there IS only ONE Billie Holiday, go ahead and enjoy Madeleine Peyroux's \\"Careless Love.\\"
B0006AZMFM|4.0|If you liked the first album, Innocent Eyes, you will be equally impressed with Mistaken Identity.  She sings with such passion in each song, especially Be Strong, Last Night on Earth and Fragile.  With all her ups (the Aria awards) and downs (being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and then succesfully completing treatment), these songs reflect all her emotions from the past year and a half.  You will notice that these songs are a bit darker, lyrically, then the first album, but just as moving.  Her style is a bit different as well, showing a more mature sound, but the songs still captivate your senses when you listen.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Simply put, this CD was the best \\"I might like this\\" buy I've ever made.  I'd purchased their first recording and liked it, but immediately allowed someone to borrow (and eventually keep) it and didn't really connect with them.  Well, having become re-aquainted with this band I was surprised at how much they'd advanced.  I mean, they even got me to quit listening to Lateralus (Tool's kick arse last album) almost every hour I'm in my car (at least for awhile, which is an impressive feat considering how big a Tool junkie I am).  Also, I just wanted to point out that people who bought this album DID NOT also buy any of Radiohead's latest crap, completely throwing out the idea that these two bands are walking hand-in-hand.  Just because a band WAS amazing doesn't mean everything they put out will continue to be amazing (see Pearl Jam).  So, for all those upset that a band came along and kicked Radiohead in the teeth, quit whining and just enjoy the fresh and amazing sound of Muse...OK?? <br /> <br />
B00000JCB2|1.0|At least HE had the sense I didn't when this mistake of a band exploded onto the mainstream market. They truly do suck terribly, I was only a kid when I first heard of Limp Bizkit back in '97 and didn't realise how bad thier music was. Well now I know, they try so hard to be metal, but fail on SOOOO many levels, and just ends up being pop music for idiots who think they're 'trendy' or 'hip' by purchasing this crap! <br />Do yourself a favour fellow CD buyer reading this, get 'Hangover Music' by the legendary Zakk Wylde instead, at least that is an album that DOESN'T suck!
B000084T18|1.0|this album is wannabe gangsta rap garbage.  i don't understand why people say 50 cent brought back gangsta rap, the only he brought back was crap.  this album isn't even worth 50 cents.  the only thing good about this album is eminems verses.  don't buy this album, it's absolutely the worst album of 2003.
B00005JL3A|2.0|I'm reviewing this movie because after renting it (thank god!), I had a very good mental vision of how cool this action/horror slasher flick would be, little did I know that dissapointment was just around the corner...I mean, wow, they really screwed up here with one of Playstation's most popular video games in history. <br />I wanted blood, but there was barely ANY, what were they thinking? Resident Evil is all about the blood 'n the zombies, which mind you, not EVEN ONE get's it's head blown off, which is how you kill them idiots! No wonder Alice's team suffered so much! The most redeeming, interesting part of the movie is the way it tries to give suspense and surprise, it fails on some levels to say the least but it is the best feature. <br />The way the movie ends is stupid too, it basically ENDS where it should've BEGUN, thus resulting to a tiresome sequel that may I say was a total flop! <br /> <br />Might be pleasing to some, but I've seen better...
B0001AP12G|1.0|kanye is a good producer, not a good rapper.  the only good about this album was that it had some decent beats but the rappin was horrible.  kanye can not rap at all, the only reason he has so much hype is b/c jay-z signed him.  kanye needs to stick to producin and give up his career in rap.  don't waste your money on this album it's not worth it.
B000001G5H|5.0|Perhaps the most exquisite execution of Chopin's etudes I have ever heard. If you enjoy piano music that really moves then you'll enjoy this CD regardless of you familiarity with Chopin.
B0000VD04M|5.0|&quot;Ed Wood,&quot; with the possible exception of &quot;Batman,&quot; is Tim Burton's best film. It's a very funny chronicle of the life of the titular transvestite Z-grade film director, focusing on his films with Bela Lugosi (&quot;Plan 9,&quot; &quot;Bride of the Monster,&quot; &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot;). Johnny Depp is hilarious as Wood, and Martin Landau is absolutely astonishing as Bela Lugosi, who provides the emotional core that seperates this from most of Burton's work. In addition, the black and white photography is beautiful, and evokes the essence of the period in which Wood's awful movies were made.<BR>This long-delayed DVD from Touchstone is in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The image is sharp with hardly any scratches. Sound is equally stellar, particularly in the opening credits.<BR>Luckily, the disc is packed with extras. Most notable is a group commentary, in which Tim Burton and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Kareszewski (sic?) do most of the talking. Fans will also appreciate &quot;Let's Shoot this F&amp;%^&amp;,&quot; a collection of behind-the-scenes footage hosted (rather campily) by Johnny Depp. Other featurettes are about the music, the production design, and the creation of Bela Lugosi (both with acting in makeup). There are five deleted scenes (and a hidden sixth one), one of which includes a cameo by longtime Ed Wood regular Paul Marco. A theatrical trailer and a memorable music video round out the extras.
B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth is an incredible band.  They are practically the only American power metal band in the market.  They are cool, profound and talented.  Matthew Barlow, can sing really great.  I might like him better than Ripper.  Nonetheless, it's my opinion as of this moment.  If you don't own this album then you don't know what American power metal is.  Listen to it and understand it.  The lyrics are awesome and they will touch your heart.   <br /> <br />Enjoy
B00062RCBW|5.0|When TNG first premeired eighteen year ago,many veiwers were still spoiled by the original series. It soon surpassed the original series in quality and longeviety.  Worse was fact that the second episode was the Naked Now,a knock-off of TOS' The Naked Time.The first season was the shakedown.The cast still finding their characters,as well as a handful of okay to bad episodes(The Big Goodbye,11001001,Heart Of Glory were the classic episodes of the season).   Aside fom the drastic changes that happened between seasons(casting and character promotions),The second season of TNG was a big improvement over the first.Yet it was still far from the great show it would later become.   The introduction of Guinan(as well as Ten-Forward)and the temporary residence of Dr Kathrine Pulaski in The Child,added a new dimension to the show.The best episodes include The Measure Of A Man,The Emissary,A Matter Of honor,and of course Q Who,which not only brought back Q,but introduced The Borg.   From the beginning of season three of ST:TNG,it's obvious that the show was coming from under it's spin-off banner and became its own show.   With excellent writing,the characters were more fleshed out, with room for growth.Gates McFadden returned as Dr Beverly Crusher,finally restoring the magic chemestry between the cast.  The best episodes included The Survivors,Who Watches The Watchers,The Bonding,Booby Trap,The Enemy,Yesterdays Enterprise,The Offspring,Sins Of The Father,Sarek,and of course,The Best Of Both Worlds pt 1,regarded as TNG's finest moment..Although Pt II was somewhat of a letdown,the fourth season was no less than a success(As well as Wil Wheaton's last season as a full time cast member). Classic episodes,including Family,The Drumhead,Reunion,Data's Day,Q-pid,The Host,and the season finale,Redemption ,measured up easily with the best of the original series.  The high quality of the 4th season episodes continues during the 5th.Despite such clinkers as Imaginary Friend, and the over hyped yet warmly welcomed appearence of Spock in Unification, as well as The First Duty,Darmok,and The Inner Light along with many great episodes. The season also saw the passing of Gene Roddenberry,and Rick Berman finally in place of the heir apperent,which metephorically was seen in the final scene of Unification as Spock mind-melded with Picard,finally closing the \\"Generational Gap\\".  While many took note that the spin-off Deep Space Nine's premire took a little wind out of the sixth season,TNG juggled with stories that ranged from Playful(Rascals,A Fist Full Of Datas),introspective(Tapestry,Lessons),suspenseful(Face Of The Enemy) to eerie (Man Of The People,Schisms).  The highlight of the season was Relics,which James Doohan's Scotty returns after being in a transporter stream for 75 years.The best episode of the season is the two part Chain Of Command which has Picard re-assigned,then taken prisoners & tortured by the Cardassians.  The season finale Descent, returning with a new Borg threat ends on a limp note(especially after Best Of Both Worlds Pt 1),but season six was definately an interesting experience.  In what seems a trend in the Star Trek series,the final season, after previous ones had quality episodes,produce some of the worst ever episodes.  A majority of the episodes ranged from mediocre(Liasons,Bloodlines,Journey's End,Homeward,Interface) to just plain terrible(Masks,Emergence,the season premire Descent Pt II).There was even an episode that was the ultimate guilty pleasure(Sub Rosa).  But season seven included classic episodes(Phantasms,Attatched,Parallels,The Pegasus,The Lower Decks,Pre-emptive Strike) and of course the memorable series finale All Good Things which would've made a better movie than Star Trek Generations.  Nearly ten years after the last episode,and four movies that seemed like big screen TV movies,it really was the end as the movies shifted it's focus solely on Picard and Data,leaving the other characters in the background(excluding Worf who starred in the latter four seasons of Deep Space Nine).But even a flawed final season is a safer bet than it's big screen offspring.   Despite having to follow in the footsteps of a phenomenon as big as the original series ,The Next Generation proved that Star Trek influence was nowhere near dissipating, and would be around for the long run.    Ten Favorite TNG Episodes    1.Chain of Command  2.The Drumhead   3.The Offspring   4.The First Duty   5.Relics  6.Schisms  7.Tapestry   8.The Emissary   9.Family   10.The Best of Both Worlds

Despite the cheap looking special effects and set pieces,ST was a mixture of action,humor,drama and morality tales.A far cry from other science fiction shows airing at the time such as Lost In Space.Classic first season episodes includes The Naked Time,The Enemy Within, The Menagerie ,The Conscience of the King, Balance of Terror(the Romulan's debut), Space Seed(KHAN!!!), Arena,This Side of Paradise,The Devil in the Dark, and the greatest Trek episode of all time, The City on the Edge of Forever.  After barely getting renewed for a second season, ST came back the next year in full force.The biggest hero was not Captain Kirk himself,but Gene Coon.The executive producer who contributed some of the best episodes, as well as set the tone for the show which inspired future Trek's as well.  One of the prime factors for the second season's brilliance was the actors fleshing out their characters.The famous trio of Kirk-Spock -McCoy were finally established at the focal point of the show.The remaining supporting characters performed admirably , along with the introduction of Ensign Paval Chekov (Walter Keonig). Many classic episodes came from season two(Mirror,Mirror, Amok Time, Doomsday Machine, Deadly Years,Trouble With Tribbles, A PieceOf The Action, Journey to Babel).  As brilliant as season two was, it was not enough to get high numbers in the Neilsons.Thanks to a letter campaign by fans led by Bjo Trimble, ST was renewed for a third season. But with Coon's departure from the show after the second season, the third season suffered and even the fans couldn't save it.   The third season had two disadvantages when it returned. Along with Coon's departure from the series, Gene Roddenberry's involvement with the show decreased, frustrated with NBC lack of interest of the low rated show  along with the new timeslot on Friday at 10:00 PM, a slot known to bury flagging shows by the networks.  Over the years, many blamed the new producer Fred Frieberg for the lacking quality of the show. Freiberg's only sin was coming aboard a sinking ship which was suffering budget cuts as well as weak stories and it's creator's lack of interest due to the networks total disregard of the show.  Even with the few brilliant episodes (Empath, Paradise Syndrome,Enterprise Incident, Tholian Web, Requium Of Methuselah,All Our Yesterdays), season three is notorious with two of the worst ever in the history of Trek (The Way To Eden<space hippies>, and Spock's Brain).  By the end of season three,ST was finally cancelled after 78 aired episodes in 1969.Even fans couldn't save it, as NBC buried the show.But thanks to syndication, ST became even more popular than when it originally aired and build upon a growing franchise (Conventions, Saturday Morning cartoons,toys, etc,).The ten years after the end of the series,Star Trek The Motion Picture premired.And that was just the beginning.     Five Favorite Episodes  1.This Side Of Paradise (first season)  2.The Doomsday Machine (second season)  3.The Conscience Of The King (first season)  4.The City On The Edge Of Forever (first season)  5.Piece Of The Action (fifth season)
0767847431|5.0|This movie along with 7th Voyage of Sinbad are by far excellent, its a shame eye of the tiger had such a terrable plot or all 3 could go hand in hand. <br /> <br />2 out of 3 isnt bad though. Golden Voyage is well worth watching, the animations and effects, the plot to even the acting. <br /> <br />Love the part when the evil magician Kura makes the statue of kali the hindu goddess with 6 arms first dance then fight Sinbad and His men =) <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I actully heard, \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" on kind of a fluke- I was flipping through the channels and I saw a guy who looked a LOT like a guy I knew in highschool, so I stopped. Needless to say, it wasn't the guy I knew, but I listened. And it was AWESOME. So I bought the CD. <br />I was totally blown away, esp. by the stripped CD. OKay, so maybe \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" and \\"Chemical Party\\" are better on the original, but \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Belief\\" are SO AMAZING on the stripped CD, that I think I may just like that one better. Either way, you can find something you like on one of these CDs. If you want to just relax or scream the song at the top of your lungs, driving down the road, or even just cry your eyes out, it's all here.
B00004RJ74|5.0|This was differant, yet was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie where you can relate somewhat with alot of the actors parts at times. <br /> <br />Its really a good solid fun movie and definatly worth to own as youll most likely care to watch it again on a rainy day =) <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00065JTBA|5.0|This box set is any real Bon Jovi fan's dream come true!  It drives home just how talented these guys really are. Is every song on the set a winner? No, but a lot of them could easily have been included on any CD, and in fact, I would have liked to have seen some of these songs rather than some of the ones they DID put on the CD's. (\\"Fear\\" from Keep the Faith and \\"I Got the Girl\\" from Crush come to mind...) <br /> <br />I absolutely LOVE the first CD...I think I've listened to it almost continuously for two weeks straight.  I love \\"The Radio Saved My Life Tonight\\", \\"Miss Fourth of July\\", \\"Open All Night\\" (one that I liked better than the song of the same name on Bounce) and I can't stress how much I adore \\"Last Man Standing\\".  That could well become one of my favorite songs of all time. <br /> <br />Some various favorites from the other 3 discs include \\"The Fire Inside\\", \\"Crazy Love\\", \\"Real Life\\", \\"Lonely at the Top\\" and I think Tico singing on \\"Only in My Dreams\\" is just awesome.   <br /> <br />I like the little bits of studio talk in between some of the tracks, especially the bit with Richie and Jon teasing Tico before his song.  In fact, after one song (can't remember which one at the moment) Jon announces to the world that he has to go pee! <br /> <br />The fourth disc to me seems to be the weakest, with none of those songs particularly standing out to me, not even \\"Always\\" which has never been one of my absolute favorites.  If I have any other complaints, it's the way the booklet was packaged with the set...mine is already tearing up!   <br /> <br />As for the person who wondered about the marking of the CD's with the dice...well, they DID! CD 1 is showing 1, CD 2 is showing 2, CD 3 is showing 3, etc. <br /> <br />I also very much enjoyed the DVD showing some of what they were thinking when they decided to not include these on the albums, although I thought it was cheesy that some of the footage from their special \\"thank-you's\\" was included in the main part ofthe DVD...why do we need to see the same thing twice? <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of the best collections of music from one band that I've ever seen, wonderfully showing their growth and ability as musicians.  And it was a birthday present so I got it for free!!
B00005K9LK|5.0|One of the last greatest projects/tours from Judas Priest untill they 'changed' with a typical metal sound which was one reason I belive Halford left. But Screaming for Vengance is a welcomed addition to any collection.  <br /> <br />Also love how they have Devils Child live on this new release, that was a nice touch being such a good song but very over looked!
B000006TRV|2.0|Many people love this album, so the consumer warning on my own review is that I'm expressing a minority view. But the other consumer warning is this: buy Pink Floyd, but don't spend your hard-earned on this double album. It offers a lot of lyrics but not much music, and even the best of that music doesn't have the unique brilliance that the best Pink Floyd offers.  <br /> <br />It's reasonable to make this consumer warning while acknowledging that there are a few good tracks amongst the dross, because you can get the best tracks elsewhere. The live _In the Flesh_ by Roger Waters, and the live _Pulse_, by The Other Three, offer the good tracks from _The Wall_ together with (mostly) good tracks from other albums. But _The Wall_ offers its best tracks along with long expanses of filler, plus abominations like \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" and \\"The Trial\\".  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd were a great band who made genuinely brilliant, strange-but-exhilarating, trail-blazing music. But while I play Pink Floyd quite often, _The Wall_ is one of the albums I hardly ever take off the shelves: along with _The Final Cut_, _Momentary Lapse of Reason_, and _The Division Bell_. And although _The Wall_ sold millions upon millions of copies, I know I'm not the only Pink Floyd fan who's remained sceptical about its merits. So why are so many Floyd fans _Wall_ sceptics? I think it comes down to three reasons.  <br /> <br />The first problem is that _The Wall_is musically very ordinary. That is, there was a time when Pink Floyd sounded like no-one else on earth: the sounds they got from their relatively primitive technology (by today's standards) still seem unearthly, beautiful, new, strange, sometimes scary. And the compositions, especially the longer tracks, were as far from verse-chorus-verse-chorus-repeat-chorus rock as it's possible to go: weird, creative, mind-enhancing stuff. But in _The Wall_ Pink Floyd just sound like a rock band: a good one, but good in a workmanlike, ordinary way. Toput this in perspective, let's take the band Queen. I don't mind Queen, but I don't care about them, either. I can't imagine Queen being capable of any of Pink Floyd's music up until _Animals_, but I could quite easily imagine them coming up with something a bit like _The Wall_. (Queen, to give them their due, would have offered less self-pity and more humour; that might not be enough to rescue _The Wall_, but it probably would have helped.)  <br /> <br />The second problem is that _The Wall_ is musically very ordinary. The first time I was talking about their loss of a unique sound; this time I'm talking about the very ordinary quality of most of the music here. That is, \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" is an okay song/chant lifted into something genuinely interesting by a great bassline; and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are two okay songs that get promoted to good-ness by Gilmour's guitar. \\"Mother\\" and \\"Hey You\\" are kind of okay, but aren't lifted higher than \\"kind of okay\\". But the rest falls into two categories: endless recitative with Waters' voice whining and mumbling over mediocre playing by The Other Three, and \\"The Trial\\".  <br /> <br />As for \\"The Trial\\", I once read that after releasing _The Final Cut_ (which was more like _The Last Straw_, for those of us who used to expect vital music from Pink Floyd), Roger Waters decided to sit down and listen to some Andrew Lloyd-Webber, because _Final Cut_ includes an insulting reference to Lloyd-Webber. Waters was worried that it might turn out that _Cats_, or whatever it was, had even a shred of merit, in which case Waters would have to feel bad about the insult. So he was relieved to discover that Lloyd-Webber's music was, as he said, \\"utterly horrible in every way.\\" The trouble is, Roger, I can't imagine Queen coming up with something as utterly horrible in every way as \\"The Trial\\"; but I can imagine Lloyd-Webber writing something like that. And \\"The Trial\\" is not just a track, it's a category of awfulness: other tracks on _The Wall_, like \\"Vera\\" and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" fit into \\"The Trial\\"'s category of Utter Horribleness.  <br /> <br />The third problem is that _The Wall_'s concept and lyrics are very ordinary. The wall itself is a lazy metaphor, too obvious to have any real force. And a wall is, let's face it, not very interesting visually. Then there's Waters' self-pity, or that of his character \\"Pink\\". We're supposed to identify with his whining, but I ... don't. Pink doesn't really exist as a character, but the little we are told about him seems neither interesting nor likeable.  <br /> <br />Perhaps my problem is that I don't really give a toss about the problems of rich alienated rock stars. There are many things I care about, but not that. Nor do I like the sub-Freudian blame-the-mommies stick that Water's mother comes in for. (I think Julie Burchill once recommended that Mrs Waters give her boy a slap for all the horrid things he says about her on this album. But me, I think that Violence Never Solves Anything.)  <br /> <br />I've been hesitating between two or three stars. My decision to give it two is probably influenced by my feeling that this is Pink Floyd and so it ought to be better.   <br /> <br />But if you do start your acquaintance with Pink Floyd with this album, and find it mostly tedious, don't write off Pink Floyd. Start elsewhere. Try _Meddle_, probably their best album despite some filler, or the live disk of _Ummagumma_, _Dark Side of the Moon_, or even the stunning but atypical _Piper at the Gates of Dawn_.  <br /> <br />Cheers! <br /> <br /> <br />Laon <br />

He believes in unicorns and magic trees. He likes to play. Why do you hate him? He has done nothing wrong. He loves children. He knows they are the future. He knows their special-ness. He dances for them, for you, for me. He is precious. Everyone loves him. Why don't you? Be nice. Be nice to Michael. He is magic. He is special. He is like no other. When I see the bad people in the news attack him, I cry. I cry because I know he is innocent. Pure. Sweet. He wouldn't...he COULDN'T hurt anyone. Don't you know that? Can't you...won't you? Look inside him. His heart. His soul. And know. Don't judge. You can love him. He is magic. Tender. Love. Sweetness. Pretty. Can't you see his childhood? He cries. Because people say bad things about him. That's not nice. Why are you mean? (Crying) Leave him alone! He is magic! He is dreams! He is love!!!! (Bawling). I have to go now. You're mean! I am going to play this now. Michael is the greatest. Please love Michael. He needs your love. Michael is love. He is children. He would never put a boy's genitals in his mouth - he couldn't! Why does the media hate him? Why do they lie? It will be nice when Michael is free. He can have more children over to play. He will be free to make music again - happy joy music for all the children in the world!
B00005R62K|5.0|This album I belive marks when Judas Priest started finding 'Themsleves' and hammering on. This album introduces the world to some of the most feared metal to face this earth :P <br /> <br />Opening with Exciter, just blazing cross the heavens... to Stained Class 'King' with its powerful dominating vocals, to Saints in Hell with the spooky haunting vocals only Halford can do! <br /> <br />A must have to any collection!
B00009UW0N|5.0|I saw the original movie about 2 years ago.  This one is much better.
B00012FXB8|4.0|\\"Alien 3\\" has been attacked since it came out in 1992 for its downbeat mood and bleak plot twists. When I saw it in the theater I wasn't overwhelmed by it, but gave it 3 stars. Since then the film has grown in my estimation. <br />     I think the main reason many, if not most \\"Alien\\" fans hate this movie is that they are really \\"Aliens\\" fans; that is, fans of the second film, not the series as a whole. They went to the theater in 1992 looking for more of the same stuff they saw in \\"Aliens\\": more and bigger guns, even more Aliens, a bigger Alien infestation (Earth for example). They didn't want a new film, just a rerun of the last one. But they were biterly disappointed. Where \\"Aliens\\" is an action movie, \\"Alien 3\\" is a mood piece. Where \\"Aliens\\" had wall to wall blazing action, \\"Alien 3\\" was mostly one grim plot development after another, with the humans mostly helpless against the Alien threat. And where \\"Aliens\\" ended on an optimistic note, \\"Alien 3\\" ended with the death of the main character from the previous movies. Pretty big changes! <br />   I myself was happy to see something new, instead of just a tired rehash. Why should \\"Alien 3\\" have just been an \\"Aliens\\" clone? Sure, I loved \\"Aliens\\" too, but it's not the last word in sci-fi. When judged on its own merits, \\"Alien 3\\" is a very good film. Its mood is a return to that of the first film, with basically helpless characters just struggling to survive. The religious spin of the story makes it unique, with the themes of sacrifice and redemption running through the whole movie.  <br />    A common complaint is that no one in the movie besides Ripley is sympathetic since they are all convicted violent criminals or stupid, arrogant Company employees. But this complaint doesn't hold up. Many of the convicts end up showing real selflessness in their actions to destroy the Alien, illustrating the film's sacrifice/redemption theme. This is particularly true in the Special Edition of the film on this DVD, where one ofthe convicts who tried to rape Ripley deliberately sacrifices himself to trap the Alien in the vault.  And Aaron, the slow-witted Company man, sees the company's duplicity by the movie's end and tries to help Ripley. This is character development, folks. If you want cartoon characters, see a Superman movie. <br />    I highly recommend this DVD. The interface is superb, the commentary and special features are informative, but best of all, it containd the Special Edition of the film mentioned earlier. This is the 1991 first cut of \\"Alien 3\\" and is superior to the theatrical version, in my opinion, with much more character development. It makes a 3 star film into a 4 star one.  <br />    As for the complaints about how an Alien egg got on board the Sulaco, the answer is the Alien Queen, of course. Just because she lost her egg sac doesn't mean she couldn't lay eggs at all without it. Not mentioned in either version of the film is that early on in script development, the queen embryo-carrying facehugger is a \\"super facehugger\\" that contains both a Queen embryo and a Warrior to guard her; it has the unque ability to impregnate two hosts before dying. The concept was left unexplained in the final filmed version(s), but goes far to clearing up the plot holes.  <br />   Watch the film with an open mind and enjoy an unfashionably bleak sci-fi experience.

A good deal at twice the price.<br /><br />To be honest, I don't find it enjoyable to read SF much these days. This book has made me visit that part of the bookstore again.
6305428425|5.0|Being a male, I would file this as my favorite guilty pleasure movie. However, looking at the movie at what it is, a very funny movie, which I've seen over 10 times. Excellent performances by both of my favorite actress Mira Sorivno and Lisa Kudrow (duh- look at my screen name!). Kudrow's performance in this movie is why I became a big fan of hers and respect as an artist and person. (notice that I used those words instead of \\"actress\\"). Totally underrated performance by both, even though this movie has been panned over the years. Worth a look.
B00000JLWW|3.0|Although the last forty minutes of this film are a spectical of early CGI, minatures and blue-screen, the first two hours are salvaged only by the actors.<br /><br />What set Cameron's earlier films, Abyss, Terminator i & 2 from standard popcorn fair was the brilliant realism of story telling and emphisis on characters and empathy, here he didn't even bother.<br /><br />With a small towns worth of people on board the Titanic and a thousand true stories Cameron concocts a standard, tepid tale of rich-ass, poor lass and smart-ass love triangle which leads to peasent parting and borrowed-parked-car sex climaxing in a silly gun point chase.<br /><br />So little of the true stories of these long dead souls are told here that the blatent specticle of boat sinking is like a slap in the face of those who died. As living beings you didn't matter, but as dying victims you deserve $200 million in special effects to rivet audiences.<br /><br />Cameron fails miserably to bring us any closer to those who lost life needlessly, but instead tells us a borihly tripe tale revolving around three stereo-typed characters.<br /><br />The sinking ship, nearly 3 hours on it's own, is reserved and condensed into the last hour of the film. Why? A rivitying story could have begun with the ship striking the iceberg and taken us through the last hours of the ship in horrifing real time.<br /><br />Why reduce this to a soap opera with great special effects?
B000003TAW|2.0|Weezer is one of those bands that is good for making hit singles. Every song that Weezer has ever released as a single has been pretty good or at least decent. I know Im gonna get told off for this one but Weezer is the like 90's version of CCR. Rivers is a pretty decent guitar player, well when he tries anyways.<br /><br />This album has three songs that I like. I got this because of the song 'Buddy Holly' I love that song, and its a really good song, not a searous song by any means but a pretty good song. 'The Sweater song' is alright and 'Say It Aint So' is the best song on the album because it is the one with the most supstance to it.<br /><br />All the songs on the album have pretty good guitar work like I said but its nothing to listen to repeatedly or anything but its worth getting for 'Buddy Holly' and 'Say It Aint So' wait never mind I still wouldnt recomend getting this album I would just say wait for Weezer to come out with a greatest hits or a best of.
015603008X|5.0|I first read the novella version of \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" when I was in junior high school, and remember being profoundly moved by it. I recently decided to revisit the story in full-length form, and it's every bit as powerful as I had remembered, if not more so. Charlie Gordon suffers from phenylketonuria, a form of mental retardation. His IQ is only 68. He desperately wants to be smart, and when offered a chance to be the first human to undergo an experimental surgery that may increase his intelligence, Charlie is enthusiastic. The most recent test subject, a laboratory mouse named Algernon, underwent the surgery with tremendous success, and the researchers expect the same result with Charlie.<br /><br />The story is told by Charlie himself, in the form of written progress reports intended to serve as data for the research team. The early reports are primitive, with terrible, inconsistent spelling and almost no punctuation to speak of: \\"I tolld dr Strauss and perfesser Nemur I cant rite good but he says it dont matter he says I shud rite just like I talk and like I rite compushishens in Miss Kinnians class at the beekman collidge center for retarded adults\\" (pg. 1). Charlie, 32 years old, thinks and writes as a child of six would. After the surgery, Charlie is initially disappointed, having expected that the operation's effects would take place immediately. He grows frustrated, but at last we begin to see changes taking place. The progress reports steadily improve, not only in spelling and grammar, but in substance and comprehension.<br /><br />As Charlie reaches an average level of intelligence, he begins to realize that the world isn't as he originally perceived it. The other men at the bakery where he works, whom he thought were his friends, laughing and joking with him, have actually been laughing at him instead, making jokes at his expense. And as Charlie's IQ continues to climb, to 150, to 185, and onward, he finds himself just as alone and alienated on the other end of the spectrum as he had been with an IQ of 68. The tables are turned. Now it is the rest of the world that cannot understand him.<br /><br />Charlie's progress reports are touching and thought-provoking, revealing a wealth of personal discovery and growth. Keyes has managed not only to allow us to see the changes in Charlie himself, but also to see how Charlie's perception of those around him changes throughout his progression. It's absolutely fascinating. But the story doesn't end there. The researchers' hopes that the experimental results will be permanent are called into question when the mouse Algernon begins to display strange, erratic behavior, an ominous foreshadowing of Charlie's own fate.<br /><br />\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is heartbreaking, but it is also beautiful, profound, and well worth anybody's time to read. Though successful ways to limit the effects of phenylketonuria, if begun early enough, have been developed since the story was written in 1959, the issues the book raises and the messages it carries are still as compelling as ever. Charlie's story is a stark reminder that all people, despite whatever handicaps they may have been dealt, are still people, with thoughts and emotions of their own, and deserve to be treated as such. The book is both a moving story of self-discovery, and a critical social commentary, and should not be missed by any thinking reader.e spectrum as he had been with an IQ of 68. The tables are turned.

B00005JN4O|5.0|I had originally went to the movies to see \\"Alexander\\" but because of it being a late-showing. I went to see \\"Finding Neverland.\\" This movie was one of the best I have ever seen in my whole life. The movie touched me, made me feel good and made me look at the world in a different way. <br /> <br />The basic storyline was about J.M. Barrie and his life during the writing of Peter Pan. Johnny Depp was astonishing as Barrie. This was really, to me, his defining role. Kate Winslet was also, always as good as Sylvia. One actor that really surprised me was the little boy that played Peter. He has such expressive eyes and is so adorable. The only bad thing, is beyond the boys, Johnny and Kate, the rest of the actors sort of fade into the background. <br /> <br />The visuals were stunning and very whimiscal. It made me want to go to Neverland. <br /> <br />But overall, brilliant film, excellent, there isn't enough words to say how good this is.
B000000H66|5.0|Death's 6th album, 'Symbolic' (1995) is a staple of what death metal is truly about. Overtime, Death evolved from an utterly insane, no-holds-barred, extreme death metal outfit to a much more mature sound with melodic guitar riffs and jazz basslines thrown in. 'Symbolic' represents this without breaking a sweat. All 9 tracks are representative of what death metal can and should sound like. It's such a bummer that we lost the mighty Chuck Schuldiner to brain cancer. He had the ultimate death pipes and was an awesome guitarist. Fellow guitarist Greg Koelble is good too, but not half as godly as Chuck. Bassist Kelly Conlon roars throughout this entire album. Fans of Strapping Young Lad should be familiar with percussionist Gene Hoglan, who does a helluva good job (as always.)<br /><br />And now, of course, the three highlights. Opener \\"Symbolic\\" is a fast, brutal ass-kicker. It says six words to me the moment I hear it: \\"This is THE death metal record!\\" Track 2, \\"Zero Tolerance,\\" is insanely fast, with a quick drum solo at the beginning to help add depth to the song. But the king of all death metal songs is track 7, \\"Crystal Mountain.\\" It's got several different parts to it. First, we get the Death standard: fast, brutal, in-your-face metal. Then it slows down, starts to accelerate slowly but surely, then...BANG! Just when you least expect it, it's lightning fast again. The mandolin solo at the end really adds depth. Overall, fans of old-school death metal such as Possessed, Coroner, Obituary, and other such bands should undoubtedly pick themselves up a copy of this.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|One of the best rock CD's ever released, The best guitar rifts are on \\"I'm On Fire\\" and \\"Eruption\\". I may even upgrade my original CD I had for years to the remastered version! Highly reccommended!
B0002Y69NQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This set is fabulous, both the Special edition and normal 10 Disc Box set are great. And being a huge Matrix fan, why did I give this set only three stars? <br />I have the three movies individually, each with it's own bonus disc of special features. I have the Matrix revisited DVD, the feature length making of Disc. I have the Animatrix DVD, and the Enter the Matrix game. <br />If you love the Movies, and were going to buy them anyway- You won't go wrong with this set. It offers great value for money and hours and hours of entertainment. <br />If like me, you're a fan and have already bought them separate...Think more carefully. You have to ask yourself if you're THAT much of a fan you need a few more extras. For me, I'm happy with my individual discs. Others will see this as essential. Like most fans, I'm kind of bummed that I diddn't know this set was coming out when I bought the movies in the first place.
B00002ZMNV|3.0|This dvd is ok but it's not as good as Kiss's Symphony. This just proves that no matter how hard they try  Metallica will always come in lagging behind the likes of better bands such as Kiss,Aerosmith,and AC/DC and also after that no talent cd called St Anger I might even put them behind Britney Spears. Better luck next time boys.

0805076476|5.0|This is a page for reviewing the BOOK. If you wanna review the movie, go to a movie review page. This is for the BOOK Fight Club. There is a difference. Books are those things with words on them, and movies are the ones that play on your TV.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing.  Corey Taylor and crew have thrown together a great album that I can throw in my car and scare pople with.  When an album can do that they have acccomplished their goal as far as metal goes.  I do not think the fact that slipknot has gone mainstream has affected how they feel about their music, only how it sounds.  Though streying from their original roots and sounds a bit this cd should still call for veteran fans to rush out and buy as well as open the door for new listeners. <br /> <br />I have been a Slipknot fan for a little over three years now, and I am now in love with this album.  Their first single off of Volume 3: (The Subliminal Versus)  DUALITY stays stuck in my head 24/7.  Also this is a band with stage presense like not other.  I would advise all loyal fans to buy this album if they havn't already as well as people who have been thinking about becomming fans.  This would be a great cd to get started on Slipknot.  I hope I have been some help to you.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Austin Powers in Goldmember has to be one of the funniest Austin Powers movies ever. One of the reasons it is so funny is the character Foxxy Cleopatra played by none other than the beautiful and talented Beyonc Knowles. This movie has many quotes and phrases that will keep you laughing and thinking about them for the rest of the movie.
B00005QK5X|5.0|Being from Portland, the Wipers were a band I always knew about but somehow never actually saw. Their heyday in Portland ended right before I turned 21, to my eternal chagrin. Greg Sage is one of the great unkown rock stars of all time, bow down before him.<br /><br />Kurt Cobain wanted to be Greg Sage. Think I'm full of it? Listen to the Nirvana cover of D-7 on the box set, listen to the original version of D-7 here and then consider the rest of Kurt's music in that light.
1400032717|2.0|Mark Haddon's novel is all about voice, and in that sense the book is a success.  Writing from the perspective of an autistic teenager must be quite a challenge, and Haddon succeeds admirably.  However, every other aspect of the novel (characters, plot, pacing) is a dismal failure.  There are many other books that have written from a perspective of adolescent benightment and have accomplished the task in a superior manner(10th Grade, by Weisman, or Rule of the Bone, by Banks).  A mediocre novel that is only seeing success due to its novel narrative voice and the ease with which it is digested.  Too light to have much of an impact, but the subject matter renders it too heavy to be funny.  And it ends very, very abruptly, in an unsatisfactory manner.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Here's the daddy of all the boo-movies, the most foreboding, retina-burning, tentacle-fingered bloodsucker, bar none. However, the year this film was released was 1922, not 1929, as is repeatedly claimed on the Amazon site.  I have no idea how all listings of this film consistantly claim that the great Rudolf Klein-Rogge appears in this film, either.  He does not. I've just checked the credits on my copy and he is not listed in the titles at all.  Klein-Rogge's own countenance is as memorable as that of Max Schreck's.  That's why Klein-Rogge's cameo in \\"Das Kabinet\\" (der Caligari) is so easy to spot. As to the opening titles - 1922 is the first thing I see when running my copy of the film!  Klein-Rogge was practically a Fritz Lang  exclusive up until that great director fled Germany in the mid-1930's.
B00003CXUM|5.0|In the Mood for Love is a beautiful movie about love. And waht's perfect about it is that love in here is not sad or happy or stupid like in other movies, but above all love in here is human. Visually it is excellent (Christopher Doyle's name always means perfection in cinematography), the music is beautiful and the story is wonderful. <br />It is a movie about two people that were in the mood to love each other but didn't.
0440238609|5.0|I have been reading some of the reviews of this series and have become more and more disgusted as I see all of the people warning others about the anti-religious content in the books.  This series is a beautiful look at the sacred qualities of life and love, and the fight for them.  If religious parents and teachers don't want kids reading the books they are only contributing to what Pullman sees as a corrupted church.  It is sheltering kids to only see things from the Christian point of view and not allowing them to listen to an opposing argument.  If a child grows up surrounded by a certain way of thinking, and then changes their beliefs because of a series of books, it demonstrates free will, and it is a good thing.  It demonstrates critical thinking, and questioning and an active mind, and it should be commended.  I should state that while I am an agnostic, I am not anti-Christian, but I do oppose anyone who brings up a child not allowing them to read, watch, or listen to anything that conflicts with what they personally believe.  It is mental slavery, and I find it to be a dispicable act.  I would never forbid my child from reading the Bible, going to church, or finding out and becoming part of a religion, as I know that what I believe should not constitue what they do.  If you religious parents and leaders believe that these books are dangerous because they may show a child a different outlook on life, you contribute to what is a great evil of much of the Church--the reliance on brainwashing and ignorance.  However, most Christians that I know are not so immature, and this is only addressed to those who do behave in this manner. <br />     As far as the books go, they are truly amazing.  Pullman is a master storyteller who continues Britain's history of producing awe-inspiring prose.  He puts so much emotion into his writing that it is impossible to read the story without feeling a connection with the characters.  He asks us to enter his world, and, as is thecase with all great authors, when you reach the end you don't want to leave.  I have never read a fantasy meant for children that was as eloquent, intellectual, or mature as this, which makes me wish that it would be remembered as the great fantasy of our time, though I am sure that honor will go to Harry Potter.  Highly recommended for anyone mature enough for the content (probably about 12 and older).
B00005V0X5|5.0|i own both versions of this sorely underrated and underappreciated album.  while the first one interested me a little bit, this remaster is what makes me keep coming back.  for those of you that have the original and may be wondering whether or not this version is worth the purchase, i'm telling you that there should be absolutely no reason not to.  it almost sounds like an entirely different album; nuances and details that were barely noticable on the original recording jump out and practically blast through the speakers, especially on the intro of \\"looking down the cross.\\"  gar samuelson beats the ever-loving sh*t out of his drumset, dave mustaine shrieks and howls like a banshee, chris poland rips through the throng with his lead guitar work, and david ellefson holds down the low end admirably.  eschewing the dungeons & dragons imagery that ran rampant on metallica's classic debut, mustaine used the medium to create a window into his own nightmarish world of murder, paid assassins, and crucifixion.  although his fury would be better focused on later records, this one is a keeper.  mustaine and company nary let up on 8 blistering tracks. <br /> <br />the only disappointment was the censorship of mustaine's tongue -in-cheek cover of nancy sinatra's \\"these boots\\" that stirred up controversy once the band started moving some units.  threatened by legal action from the writer of the original song (all of this is detailed in the excellent liner notes) mustaine gets the last laugh by butchering his track with obnoxious bleeps of all his \\"additional\\" lyrics.  dave has never been a subtle guy, and this album proves it.
B00020HEG6|3.0|John Williams has done better. Look at the first two Harry Potter's, ET, and Star Wars. And then look at this. <br /> <br />Some of the new tunes are enchanting and enjoyable. My favorite is \\"Buckbeak's Flight,\\" followed by \\"Double Trouble\\" and \\"A Window to the Past.\\" However, much of the music keeps popping up over and over and once-exciting themes become boring and repetitive. While a couple, like the ones mentioned above, make this CD fun to listen to, others are begging for the Skip button. <br /> <br />If you liked what you heard in the background of this movie, go out and buy this soundtrack. However, be warned you'll only like listening to half the songs or less.
078681859X|5.0|At the end of fifth grade I had decided to read as many good books left in the year and I picked up this one out of curiosity. WOW. I was glad that I had seen this on the shelf and swiped it.  <br /> <br />This book is a bit like Harry Potter, but today most fantasy books are a bit like Harry Potter or LOTR.another good thing about this book is that, like some other fantasy books it isn't \\"dumbed down\\" because the author thinks that kids have a low attention span. I also feel that magic in this books is much more realistic than in the Harry Potter books.  <br /> <br />In Harry Potter there are good magicians, stupid magicians, and evil magicians. In this book all of the magicians are pretty greedy and use their powers for personal gain and to rule over the \\"Commoners\\". In Harry Potter you have to have a magic stick, know a few words, and have a natural born \\"feel\\" for magic. In tis book you have to study for years, learn complex incanations, and draw runes and pentacles perfectly. If there is one tiny mistake, the demons they summon will kill them, no questions asked.  <br /> <br />The plot of this book is thus: Nathaniel is a commoner who is given, par regulations, to a magician for services while at the tender age of four. When he is eleven years old he is brutally humiliated in front nof a crowd of other magicians, by a ruthless and powerful Simon Lovelace. Nathaniel now has revenge on his mind. He summons Bartimaeus, a 5000 year old djinni, or genie, with a serious attitude.  <br /> <br />Nathaniel sends Bartimaeus to steal the infamous Amulet of Samarkand. It turns out that Simon Lovelace has stolen the amulet and killed a senior magician to do so. Nathaniel is caught up in a whirlwind of espionage, traitors, spirits, and a plan to overthrow the government that even the precocious Nathaniel cannot comprehend. Jam-packed with jaw dropping action sequences, this book will knock the socks off you. <br /> <br />Note: The names of the other books are:  <br />2nd book= The Golems Eye <br />3rd book= The Other Place. <br />Adieu!
B00006JJ1O|2.0|Do not waste your money buying this album, instead, spend your rubles on the original Russian version.  So much of the passion and meaning is lost in translation.  The Russian version lets the two express themselves the way that music should be heard.  You can hear so much more in listening to the original version compared to the Americanized english version.  Their level of hotness goes down when you hear the english translation, their voices are far superior in their native tongue.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm a fan of metal music since more than 18 years, actually i like the 70s & 80s era of metal,and listen to bands like iron maiden, metallica, judas preist ,w.a.s.p.,motley crue, kingdome come,dream theater,deep purple, led zeppelin......etc <br />and when nirvana came in the late of 80s ,i'm totally dislike them ,and from that time i felt metal music scene is goin' down specially when new wave of metal (NU-METAL)r created (with bands like limb bizkit, marlyn manson, korn), and i felt like its hard to find a good band with a real metal sound(with exception to european bands that came in the late 90s like nightwih, children of bodom, sonata arctica,lacuna coil.....etc they saved the real face of metal music) <br />and then when evanescence came with their debut album FALLEN i think they r creating new sound , better sound,and change the whole idea about american music,they r unique in their style , very fresh, very dynamic, and they r not copying anyone. <br />i hope that evanescence will be the key for  change the whole metal scene in united states after bein' trashed by bands like marlyn manson , limb bizkit, korn...etc,  <br />i recommend for everyone who want a really new music to buy this album <br />( i forget to mention that yngwie malmsteen,a guitar hero, is a fan of evanescence ,i read in interview with him that he really like evanescnce and when he was listening to one of thier songs in the radio , he quickly buy the album and its the first record he bought since many years as he said ) <br />
B0002TT0NW|3.0|As an obsessive Potter fan, I must admit I was entirely disappointed with the third film in the series. The book was fantastic, the best in my opinion, full of mystery, adventure, thrill, and humor. While the movie was all of the above, it left out the one thing that makes Potter Potter: charm. We love Harry in all of the novels, and not to get all Black Eyed Peas on you, but where is the love?  <br /> <br />Cuaron obviously felt the need to not reiterate the personality of Harry, but the movie began too abruptly without it and only shakily got back on track. While all the young actors have improved tremendously, I question some of the picks for the adult actors. David Thewlis did not match my thoughts of Lupin at all (he too lacked charm) and Michael Gambon replacing Dumbledore was not a top-10 idea for the casting directors. Gary Oldman was an interesting choice for Sirius, but he doesn't strike me as the murderer/Harry's godfather type. (If there could be one.) <br /> <br />The plot had quite a few holes in it, and my favorite scene out of all the books yet was cut short: the one inside the Whomping Willow, where we learn much of the history of Sirius and Harry's parents, as well as some of Snape's. The explanation of the Marauder's Map is absent, which angered me, as it is going to play a key role in later movies, and many other scenes were left out. Quidditch became less important, with barely three minutes worth in the entire film. While I agree Columbus' Quidditch scenes were too long, this actually left out the final game, which wins the cup for Gryffindor. It added new scenes, like the interaction between Lupin and Harry on the bridge (where did that even come from?), but that scene seemed almost worthless to me, other than the need for the filmmakers to somewhere add that Lupin knew Harry's parents. <br /> <br />Overall, it was not worth the anxious wait I endured. If you're a fan of the books at all, this film will seriously disappoint.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I don't keep up on most music that is aimed at the younger generation and am a huge 80's fan myself but after seeing her on Jingle Bell Rock I decided to give her latest album a try. Much to my surprise I was quite impressed overall with her singing style and the overall feel of the album. I think if she can manage to grow her music as she matures she will have a very successful career ahead of her.
B000268QB2|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this CD.  Their songs touch my heart.  The musicians are excellent.  Tom Chaplin's voice reminds me of the late Freddie Mercury of Queen, particularly when he sings \\"This is the Last Time.\\"  This band is going to be \\"big.\\"
B000002H6C|5.0|This really is the last of the great metallica cds. Even though they no longer have cliff burton at this time they do an outstanding job of continuing on with this album unlike they did with the black album. One of course if the best song on the cd and is personally my favorite as well. I would recommend this cd to anyone hearing metallica for the first time or anyone who likes 80's metal overall.
B00065GX64|5.0|M - Regarded by many as the greatest German film ever, the subject of a number of books and many articles, a review from this corner seems superfluous, if not pretentious.  Let me leave it with a few impressions.  For a classic, M is very entertaining, especially if you're a action/thriller fan.  A very young, pudgy Peter Lorre is a revelation in the role of the child murderer, and rightly became an international star subsequently. The print, restored and preserved in 2001, is very good.<br /><br /> Commentary - Anton Kaes and Eric Rentschler seem to know M backwards and forward, and provide a lot of information, the bulk of which deals with visual and thematic motifs.  As a plus, they seem to have recorded the commentary together.<br /><br /> Conversation with Fritz Lang - recorded in 1975 with director William Friedkin, when Lang was 85 (he died in 1976.)  Provides his version of his meeting with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, which is a subject of academic dispute.  Also interesting for his response to Friedkin's observation that he portrayed the child murderer in M as a sympathetic character.  Interesting because a later special feature will make the same point, decidedly less sympathetically, in one of their anti-Semitic propaganda films.<br /><br /> Claude Chabrol's M - A weird little six-minute film.  Seems the French were giving the Readers Digest condensed treatment to classic films in the `60s.  Includes a short interview with Chabrol discussing Lang's directorial techniques.<br /><br /> M editor Paul Falkenberg - Thirty odd year old audio tape with video images of the film.  Falkenberg discusses M with an editing class.<br /><br />  Harold Nebenzal interview - So-so interview with son of M's producer Seymour Nebenzal.<br /><br />  Physical History of M - About twenty minutes worth of material.  Some interesting scenes of Lorre's French version of his famous trial scene.  Also contains extended scenes from DER EWIGE JUDE (The Eternal Jew), a vicious Nazi propaganda film from 1940 that used clips from M as examples of Jewish depravity.<br /><br /> Stills gallery - Typical behind the scenes, promotional stuff.ious Nazi propaganda film from 1940 that used clips from M as examples of Jewish depravity.<br /><br /> Stills gallery - Typical behind the scenes, promotional stuff.
B00003CXUM|4.0|This is a truly beautiful film, both in terms of its physical assets, and the subtly wonderful acting.  <br />Both of the actors turn in fantastic performance. I cannot praise one more than the other-they were both completely inside the film, no longer actors, but the characters that they were playing. Visually, the film was breathtaking. The cinematography was simply stunning- sensuous, and vivid almost like another character within the film.  <br />The bittersweet, mysterious soundtrack proved once again the power music can have over af film. Much of the film's elusive atmosphere of impending doom is due to this amazing music. A pained Japanese waltz, and sexy Latin jazz work miracles. <br /> <br />However, the true revelation in this movie remains the fact of how much is understood, how much emotion is felt, all the while so little is said. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this film really left an impact on me. It left me feeling things I couldn't either explain or comprehend. It is certainly not for everyone-if you like films that spell out their meaning, and have an exciting plot, then this is DEFINATELY not for you. However, if you're looking for something with meaning that just happens to be stunningly acted, directed, and put together, you abosolutely must see \\"In the Mood for Love\\".
B000002H97|3.0|At this point in metallica's career, \\"Nothing else Matters\\" except the cash and publicity. I wouldn't recommend this cd to a <br />new listener to metallica, instead go pick up a copy of Ride the Lightning. The black album did have some rememorable riffs such as sad but true, the unforgiven, and of course the mtv-overplayed enter sandman, but not worth buying if you have not heard the best of metallica. Saying this i would only recommend this album if you already have metallica's first four albums.
B000002UW1|4.0|Released right after the stunning Lifes Rich Pageant, their next album had a lot of expectations to live up to... and this album really delivers. Not all the tracks are successful, but overall we have some memorable songs that make this album essential to any fan of R.E.M.<br /><br />Finest Worksong is a brilliant opener to the album, in fact it took me by surprise when I first heard it, completely brought me to my attention! This album also contains the huge hit The One I Love, a simple song about a persons ability to use people. This song means a lot to me personally.<br /><br />This album is heavily political, and this is brought across by great tracks like Welcome To The Occupation, Disturbance At The Heron House, and the fabulous It's The End Of The World... an all time classic that nearly everyone loves. Exhuming McCarthy is the surprise of the album, a bouncy, goofy political song.<br /><br />Other winners on the album is the simple but catchy Strange, quite similar to The One I Love, and the mysterious, magical King Of Birds, with it's warlike drumming and well placed backing vocals... one of the best underrated R.E.M. songs yet!<br /><br />Not all the tracks are winners, however. Fireplace and Oddfellows just don't do it for me, they don't grab me like the others do. And Lightnin' Hopkins is just bad, I'm afraid.<br /><br />But don't let a few mishaps stop you from missing out on a great cd. Some of the tracks here are some of R.E.M.s best, and should not be missed under any circumstances. Good, intelligent rock music that will please any fan!
B00005JNLY|2.0|This whole film is supposedly the writing of Christina, the daughter of Flor, the Mexican maid of a rich LA couple.  She is submitting her college entrance essay to Princeton, and for some reason writes only of her experience brought to her by her mother's working for this family.<br /><br />Debra (unemployed designer), John (chef, and we learn later, restaurant owner), their two kids (the boy might as well have not been in the movie), and Debra's alcoholic mother (former famous jazz singer) all live together and need a housekeeper/cook/driver six days a week.  In moves Flor, who has moved from Mexico to California (in with a cousin) to give her daughter a better life.  For awhile she works two jobs, netting $450.00 a week, then gets the gig at the Klasky's making $650.00 per week. She speaks very, very little English.<br /><br />Nice idea for a movie, but the reality is rather rough on the viewing public.  Tea Leoni's character has nothing likable to recommend her - she is loud, hyper, self-centered, and stringy-haired, not to mention, insensitive to her daughter's feelings.  She tries to take over Flor's daughter, and pretty much succeeds, much to Flor's frustration.  Adam Sandler is the very nice, kind, and ineffectual father and husband.  The problem is many scenes go on much too long and go absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />In the end, Flor asks her daughter if she wants to become a person different from her, her mother.  Christina doesn't answer her, but tells Princeton that if they reject her, it won't matter, as she \\"is her mother's daughter\\".<br /><br />Pretty silly, as each person is their own individual, or should be, and should be encouraged by their parents to be themselves.<br /><br />Not a typical Adam Sandler comedy.  Even Punch Drunk Love was more Adam Sandler than this.
0783233477|5.0|If there is one movie to see in your lifetime, this is it.  Meet Joe Black is amazing. One of the final scenes, with the father daughter, was extremely touching.  The one word to discribe this film is outstanding.  Watch it, it will change your outlook on life, it did for me.
B000060MWU|5.0|Certainly his most crafted, integrated film.  Don't review much, but had to after seeing J Walton's review.  Never thought about it, he may be quite right regarding his \\"moment of death\\" theory. . .   There's an inherent \\"logic\\" to the film (if you can use that word with Lynch, and I think you can) that doesn't exist in, say, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" (probably because the film cut of \\"Drive\\" betrays its origins as a TV pilot.  Would've made a great series, a shame it never got off the ground.  But I digress).  Blake's performance scares the heck out of me, and there are some truly frightening moments throughout the film that are reminiscent of dreams I've had.  Lynch captures the emotion and logic of dreams in this film better than anyone I've ever seen.  Hard to explain, but this film continues to haunt me. . . . Haven't seen the DVD, so I can't comment on the technical aspects, or the extras.  If you haven't seen this, and you're remotely interested in Lynch's work, well then, shame on you!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I know a lot of peaople fell off the Matrix bandwagon with the second movie but I think it fell short because the expectations were just too high.  When you get a chance to watch this thing all together you get a much great perspective and you're sort of mad thats it's over with.  If you've never seen it you HAVE to start with the Animatrix's \\"The Second Renaisance Parts I&II\\" first.  It's a great backstory that leads you right into the first film.  After the first film you have to go back to the Animatrix and watch \\"Flight Of The Osirus\\" before watching the second movie and the last.  The other shorts in Animatrix still relate to the trilogy but the aforementioned shorts are key to a better understanding.  All in all as I said before watching them all together makes it a great experience and I can't wait til next year when I can put all the episodes of Star wars together...
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I just watched the movie and was like, great movie, so I go out and try to buy the movie and couldn't find it, sooooo I got the soundtrack instead, I have not been disappointed, it is so nice, I listen to it all the time.
B00000DR8R|5.0|One can listen to \\"Rattlesnakes\\" in 2004 and not realize that the album was made twenty years ago.  The music, although \\"pop\\", seems so timeless that in another 20 years it will also seem to have been recorded just a few months ago.  The lyrics, too, dealing with love, loss, relationships are timeless.  A long time ago Lloyd Cole and the Commotions have managed to achieve a perfect gem, a minor miracle, and to this day it is a joy to listen to.
1402568851|5.0|I listened to this book.  Hearing Christopher narrate his story is to experience the world from the eyes of a remarkably intelligent mind that can't make sense of the world that 'neuro-typicals' take for granted.  People with Asperger's have insights we can all learn from, if we're willing to enter their world on their terms.  It's a gripping and touching mystery that sheds new light on the diversity of our world.
B00006CXXU|4.0|i was a huge fan of christina when she first arrived into the music scene back in 1998, her debut cd was one of the best cd's i've ever heard (it was perfection). Her latest stuff is not nearly as good, plus i was a bit disappointed with 2 of the singles choices, \\"beautiful\\" and \\"can't hold us down\\" were disappointments as this cd has several other good tracks. The former \\"beautiful\\" has good lyrics but the song itself is not eyecatching at all. If the song sounded more like \\"I turn to you\\" from her debut cd then it would have been a very powerful song. i did not like her song \\"can't hold us down\\" it carries a bad bad message, the point is \\"promiscuity\\" in not a good thing weather your a man or a woman period and this is coming from a guy.
0385510438|5.0|I've read most of Grisham's books and found them to be enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.  This book absolutely took my breath away.  I'm not very good with words, so I can't relay the pure unadulterated joy this book has brought me.  It is insightful, touching, hilarious, historic, tragic, and gripping all at once.  There are no other superlatives that I can think of that does justice for this book.  It is, by far, his best effort to date. <br /> <br />Most authors start pumping out almost a book a year after they become accomplished because of their contracted commitment to their publishers.  When a writer is under a time restriction, he or she is unable to put forth the type of careful effort the craft of great authoring requires.  I could tell Grisham really put his heart and soul into this piece, and you can suspect it is somewhat autobiographical in nature.  After I read it, I found out he put almost 15 years of his life into this book, which came as no surprise to me.  This is one that really stays with you for a long time, especially the characters.  I really, really hate to place labels onto anything, but I believe this is the first Great American Novel of this decade.
B0001932ZA|4.0|First of all, the movie has a great concept, but is VERY, VERY dated. The action sequences are cool, and Richard Dawson is sufficiently nasty.  <br />Now about the extras everybody seems to be peeing their pants about. The documentary is obviously from a liberal perspective, but does it mean it's not true? We've engulfed ourselves in this \\"left/right\\" mode of thinking, regardless of facts. If any real conservatives (okay, there are a few, like Bob Barr, James Bovard, Ron Paul, etc. just not on this disc) existed, they would have reinforced the main points about the Patriot Act's destruction of our liberties. Most of these reviewers probably think Arnie's a conservative!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I am a big fan of Dream Theater - this album just demonstrates the musical genius. For me they are tighter than ever before, Petrucci's solos are out of this wrold, is playing as become almost mechanical in that there isn't any flaws. His riff building shows growth and is totaly spell binding.  <br /> <br />Rudess and Petrucci are just a great combination melodically the key's and Piano demonstrate skill that doesn't happen every day <br /> <br />Portnoy - well what can you say about this guy. The drumming is fantastic. The time signature changes are so natural that you don't know it happening till it's happend. The double kick is well balanced for the music not over done as with some bands. <br /> <br />Labrie's vocals are stunning the guy keeps on getting better.  <br /> <br />Myung - His bass playing is out of this world - again sets the grooves, whilst Pertucci and Rudess set the secene, the guy is a amazing. <br /> <br />As you can tell I don't have a bad word to say. This album is another notch in Dream Theaters belt and demonstrates what an awesome combination they are. I read a review saying that they should give up the side projects, I disagree because I think it's what keeps them fresh. I also read that they need to do another scenes from a memory - my question to that is why? we need a new album and not a repeat and this album demonstrates that and I reckon that this album is the stepping stone to their finest work yet.
0446614459|3.0|I started reading David Baldacci after enjoying the superb book, Last Man Standing.  From there, I read Hour Game which follows Split Second in the same series.  Having enjoyed Hour Game (but not as much as Last Man Standing), I decided to read Split Second.<br /><br />I enjoy good, well-hidden mysteries and Split Second certainly has one of those.  Very few readers will figure out who did who to whom and why until the last pages in the book.  My only complaint is that the motives of the primary evil doer are a stretch, which hurts the plausibility of the story.<br /><br />If you think of this story as a thinking person's alternative to a James Bond story about an arch villain, then you will have a good sense of it.<br /><br />The book opens with a prologue in which presidential candidate Clyde Ritter finds himself under attack and defended by Sean King, a Secret Service agent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the attack succeeds.  In chapter one (which is set eight years later), Secret Service agent is protecting yet another presidential candidate, John Bruno.  Against her better judgment, she lets Bruno call off the guard to he can have a private conversation with the widow of a former mentor.  Within minutes, Bruno has disappeared.  As a result of these misadventures, King and Maxwell find their Secret Service careers compromised.  Maxwell is taken off of active duty, and she finds herself wondering about King's experience.  In the course of looking into the attack on Ritter, she finds reason to think that King's performance has been unfairly characterized.<br /><br />In the meantime, King is framed for a murder and wonders what's going on.  Maxwell approaches King about what happened to Ritter, and they ultimately team up to work on the Bruno kidnapping and the Ritter murder.  While that much would seem like enough to be a whole novel, it's just the backdrop for an extended procedural that unravels lots of filthy linen.<br /><br />For those who like superb character development and lots of action, this book will be disappointing.  It's much more of an intellectual and psychological exploration of crime.  If the book had been shorter, I think the lack of action and character development would have not been so noticeable.<br /><br />Knowing that Hour Game is a better book, I suggest you read this book first to know the background of the characters a little better for that book.  But if you decide not to read Split Second, you won't find yourself hindered in enjoying Hour Game.erb character development and lots of action, this book will be disappointing.

B000063DFQ|5.0|Ask any die hard Iron Maiden fan what his favourite album is. His answer would be one from the \\"Golden Age\\". However, amongst the fans themselves, there is no clear concensus as to which is the best of the the five albums that represent Iron Maiden's Golden Age. Some love \\"Powerslave\\", some love \\"Somewhere In Time\\" and some like me swear by \\"Piece of Mind\\". <br />For me, this album defines the essence of Iron Maiden's music. I agree that all the songs on this album are not great (they are good, but not great), but the great songs are truely great!! <br />The album starts off with the thunderous \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and continues to the excellent \\"Revelations\\". The lyrics of \\"Revelations\\" are cryptic and I may never truely understand what it really means, but somehow it has this erotic sound to it that makes it such a great song. \\"Revelations\\" is followed by \\"Flight of Icarus\\" which is a good song. Then comes one of the not-so-great songs \\"Die With Your Boots On\\". <br />Now comes the all time great hit \\"The Trooper\\". This is such a powerful song that it actually puts me in the shoes of the trooper destined to die on the battlefield. I can see the battle unfold all around me and I can actually feel his helplessness and dispair!! This is such a beautiful song!! <br />\\"The Trooper\\" is followed by \\"Still Life\\" which is another great song. This song has a mystic element which makes it a classic. <br />The album has a few more fillers and finally ends with \\"To Tame A Land\\" which is an adaptation of the science fiction book \\"Dune\\". The lyrics don't make much sense if you haven't read the book, but the music itself makes it a trademark Iron Maiden epic song. <br />All in all, this is a quintessential, evergreen album. Buy it today and you won't be disappointed.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Let me be honest here: I was never really a big Slipknot fan. Their debut was pretty good, I'd give it about 3 stars, but showed much room for improvement. The follow-up, \\"Iowa,\\" however, just took all of the band's skill for granted and was one of the sloppiest and most pointless \\"metal\\" albums in history. However, with their third release, appropriately titled \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses,\\" the nine members of Slipknot team up with mega-producer Rick Rubin (Who has made metal masterpieces with Slayer and System Of A Down) and put out their most diverse, most interesting and most musical piece of music to date. This album may turn off the dearly devoted fans, especially if you dug the sound they were going for on \\"Iowa.\\" There's no pretensions about it: This is a softer Slipknot. Yes, the band still knows how to pull the punches at all the right moments, there are a handful of songs that will sound familiar (\\"Blister Exists\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\" are two that come to mind), but they take a little more risks this time around. One of my favorite tracks is, oddly enough, the intro, simply titled \\"Prelude.\\" Frontman Corey Taylor croons oversome rather interesting and ambient music and sets the tone for the rest of the album. \\"Vermillion\\" and \\"Vermillion, Pt. 2\\" probably capture the essence of the new sound the best. While the first part is a more traditional sound, the second part is considerably quieter and moodier, both songs showcase the 'duality' of Slipknot's music. \\"Circles,\\" a mainly acoustic track (much in the same vein as Stone Sour's \\"Bother\\") remains a favorite of mine, with a chorus that will haunt you for days. Corey's knack for melody definitely comes into light here more than ever. \\"Opium Of The People\\" is another excellent track, more on the traditional side, but benefits from some excellent guitar-work. However, the album isn't without it's faults. One particular misfire is the tribute to Slipknot's fans titled \\"Pulse Of The Maggots.\\" This song just seems very forced and pointless, and doesn't fit in with the rest of the album, but then again, this is the only bad song on here I can think of, so all is forgiven. So what Slipknot have here is essentially their definitive album. They've got all their sides on display, and truly, the time they took off after 2001 to explore varying side-projects has paid off. Even though it's hard to tell where all nine members fit in here, it's still an incredible album. I never thought I would give Slipknot a five-star review, but they deserve it. For once, I am anticipating the next release.seems very forced and pointless, and doesn't fit in with the rest of the album, but then again, this is the only bad song on here I can think of, so all is forgiven.

0061015725|5.0|For the past 15 years, Jack and Julia Forman have been the quintessential Silicon Valley couple. Right now, though, he's at home with their three kids. Unemployed at 40, with his job search reaching the six-month mark, Jack attributes his wife's increasingly long hours at her own tech-firm position and her changed behavior when she is with her family to - what else? - an affair. Both his attorney and his psychologist sister encourage him to wake up, smell the coffee, and get ready to deal with Julia's exit from his life. But that's not it. That's not it AT ALL.<br /><br />This could actually happen, if people with the right combination of scientific expertise and moral stupidity make crucial discoveries and ignore long-term consequences in favor of solving short-term problems. Crichton sells his readers on believing this, consistently, as PREY's plot builds through the book's first half and then explodes into action. After that it's a wild ride, indeed.<br /><br />This one's ending, like that of JURASSIC PARK, provides an errie mix of resolution and future menace. If you're a techno-thriller fan, PREY is not to be missed.
B000001C6M|4.0|Well, that thing on the cover doesn't really qualify as a minotaur, but ny gut told me that that was the title meant for this review, and so it shall be.<br /><br />I'd always known that 'Show No Mercy' would be a pretty different game from all their other work, but it was still quite a surprise when I got around to hearing it.  To put it bluntly, 'Show No Mercy' doesn't even qualify as a thrash album, in my book.  Sure it's got some thrash riffs in it, and a thrash track or two (Tormentor, probably Black Magic possibly Die by the Sword), but, as a whole it is overwhelmingly speed metal. The key difference is that it largely lacks the rhythmic qualities which are the hallmarks of thrash: there aren't many harsh, substantial tempo changes, and the riffs are to smooth and even, lacking the choppiness typical of thrash riffs.  Whether or you agree with the classification of this album, it still should be abundantly clear that this is an entire different ballgame from what you'd here over their next 5 albums.<br /><br />Debuts tend to be a bit more primitive and simplistic than later albums, as you'd imagine, but this one is particularly striking in that way.  Most of the riffs here are very simple, and the songs frequently only have a couple of them, and they rarely stretch themselves out like they would on Hell Awaits.  But, relatively simple, straight forward metal has it's value.  The solos are also completely different from their later work.  There's a bit of discordance at times, but this is by and large an old school classic metal melodic shredfest.  It's far from innovative, for sure, but it suits the album well and they write some fairly nice leads, particularly on Die by the Sword.<br /><br />There really aren't any terribly weak tracks on this album, but it's never terribly brilliant either. Just good, fun and cheesy metal from beginning to end. Evil Has No Boundaries is a great opener, probably the best song on the album.  It's got a great, hyper-cheesy chorus with nice back-up vocals and a delightfully over the top vocal performance from Tom.  Die by the Sword is one of the more varied tracks on the album, with a very good lead break, and a more thrashy feel, as a whole. Black Magic is extremely heavy and unrelenting, by 1983's standards, but still pretty melodic and memorable.  Probably the second best track on the album. Tormentor is the only track which I'd definitely call thrash, and it's quite excellent, with a very good, very thrashy main riff and more over the top vocals.  Crionics is a weird one, slower and more contemplative than most of the rest of the album, with some more solid leadwork.<br /><br />Good album, this.sy chorus with nice back-up vocals and a delightfully over the top vocal performance from Tom.

B00003CXCT|4.0|In terms of a \\"nerd litmus test\\", there isn't much more to it than your feelings regarding Star Wars and its sequels. To be fair, the diehards and the haters may see it differently, but to my mind there have always been those who loved the movies but didn't need the spin-off Ewoks films or the novelizations by all sorts of sci-fi hacks. I fall into that category, and apart from the Boba Fett figurine that stands guard over my DVD player there's little else to alert the casual acquaintance to my love of these films (which I've denied on occasion to my more snobby friends).<br /><br />But I had to have the original trilogy on DVD before George Lucas could ruin it by forcing the \\"prequel trilogy\\" into the package as well, and I'm glad he was persuaded to do so. The films come off better than ever, all \\"special edition-y\\" but retaining the core of the original films. Like any self-respecting fan, however, I have my gripes, enough to keep this from being a five-star review:<br /><br />First off, there are some technical problems, not so much with the sound (I really couldn't tell) so much as some of the graphics. The most glaring example (and I'm assuming I'm not alone in having this happen) is during the TIE fighter-Falcon battle, when you can almost see boxes around the TIEs when they go around the Millenium Falcon. I'm sorry, but that's distracting as hell and almost laughable considering how much care Lucas puts into his films and his newfangled love for all things digital.<br /><br />Another thing: at the end of Jedi, instead of the original actor Lucas has saw fit to insert Hayden \\"I'm Emoting Now\\" Christiansan as Anakin Skywalker at the Ewok celebration. Lame, lame, lame, and it doesn't even fit right. Excuse me while I push my glasses back up, they seem to have slid down my nose...<br /><br />Other than those minor grumblings, I have to say the DVD edition delivers remarkably well on the promise all SW fans were made. The graphics look better, the images are crisper and you really can't tell which is digital and which is models for the most part. My other grumbles (such as Greedo \\"shooting first\\" in Episode Five and the lame musical addition to Jedi's ending) are more to do with the Special Edition itself, not the DVDs. The fourth disc delivers with some excellent featurettes, and the look ahead to Episode Three has no doubt ignited endless discussions on various fan message boards. All in all, this is a fairly good set.<br /><br />So pick this one up if you're the only person left in America who hasn't. You might find the same techinal problems I did, but it's negligable compared to the way the movies come across on DVD. The Force may not be with the prequels, but this original set will make any fan's Christmas.are crisper and you really can't tell which is digital and which is models for the most part.

0786714875|4.0|\\"Shake Hands with the Devil\\" is a disturbing book, written by a man who candidly admits to chronic mental problems in the wake of his horrific experiences in Rwanda. After reading his account, I now realize that my knowledge of the Rwandan genocide was very limited. For example, I always viewed the Hutus as the clear antagonists (they comprise 85% of the Rwandan population and carried out the vast majority of the killing), yet I'm now convinced that if the population distribution percentages were reversed, the Tutsis might have been equally disposed to slaughter their Hutu neighbors with little provocation. Moreover, the Tutsi-Hutu conflict is not limited to Rwanda, but involves other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (especially northern Burundi).   <br />     This book is a story of conflict on many levels - especially the interpersonal conflict within General Dallaire. On one hand he seems proud to have followed his UN orders to the letter, while at the same time he seems to regret not militarily intervening in defiance of those same orders. Throughout the book, he seems to alternately praise and scorn Kofi Annan and the UN in general. He is proud to be Canadian, yet he blasts Canada for not being more supportive of the Rwandan peacekeeping effort. <br />     I must say that I was disturbed by the constant use of acronyms - a condition that requires the reader to constantly page to the glossary until he becomes familiar with the alphabet soup that makes up \\"UN speak.\\" In one single paragraph, (bottom of page 132) the following acronyms appear: BBTG, MDR, MRND, PDC, PSD, RPF, CDR, RTLM. Over a dozen acronyms begin with \\"UN...\\" as in \\"UNICEF.\\" But then, the acronyms do seem to accurately convey the United Nations bureaucracy that frustrated Dallaire at almost every turn.  <br />     In the end, readers will read this book through their own political prisms. Conservatives will see it as a damning indictment of UN ineptitude. Liberals will see it as the natural historical consequence of racism, European colonialism, and exploitation of black Africans. Perhaps both are right. When this book is referenced, the subtitle is rarely mentioned \\"The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda.\\" Of that failure there is no doubt.
B0002Y69NG|3.0|I am interested in purhcasing this set. I noticed the Matrix Reloaded Revisited bonus disc has 21 featurettes. Does anyone know if these are the same features on the original theatrical DVD release or if these are additional and new features for the Ultimate Matrix set? The original release has only 6 or 7 features. Thanks.
0060526491|5.0|This is a great collection of drawings and illustrations from Tim Burton which I would definately reccommend. HOWEVER, keep in mind that the HOLIDAY EDITION is simply the ORIGINAL EDITION, with the addition of a new holiday themed slip cover. Remove the slip cover and you've got the same book. Just don't want anyone ordering thinking that it's a new edition with all-new or additional poems and art. Now that that's out of the way, buy this book! (Either edition, and any time of the year!)
B00005JN0T|4.0|If you like scifi you'll enjoy this movie, see the other reviews if you want more details about that. I'll elaborate more on the DVD. I watched this on a 100 inch screen with a front projector and dts capable 6.1 audio receiver and this DVD has outstanding picture quality and superb DTS sound. I was totally immersed in the movie,definitely one for a home collection.
B0006284JQ|2.0|I was going to title my review as 14:59 (meaning, her 15 minutes of fame are about to end).  Of course, she has lasted for a few years, so I'll grant her another minute.  Why this music is popular is beyond me.  She cannot sing (if she could, there would be no need for the way-over-the-top studio production).  Also, there would be no need to resort to the \\"bad girl\\" image that she so desperately (and pathetically) holds onto these days.  Who loves her?  Teeny-bopper girls who wish they could be her, and pre- (and current) pubescent boys who wish they could get to \\"know\\" her.   <br /> <br />Britney does not have an ounce of originality.  Everything she has done, has already been done before.  Madonna was the first with the sexy bad girl/tramp image--although Cher was (and still is) the only original, pure DIVA who led the way for everyone (Madonna included) for her continuous re-invention.   <br /> <br />All I can say to Britney is, cash it in NOW as best as you can, while you have your hot looks--which is obviously what you are doing.  Because I seriously, seriously doubt that your \\"staying power\\" is going to go much past 2005.  With American pop music lovers being as fickle as they are, count yourself lucky to have had a career as long as you have.  Trust me, artists with the longevity of Cher are truly one of a kind.  Even Madonna's fans have begun to bail--which is why she is now concentrating on a new fan base: children's books and clothing.  What parents would want to support someone who is the ultimate hypocrite is beyond me; yet, they clearly do exist.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|If you &quot;like&quot; punk rock, but you don't like The Clash, you're a tool. The people these days listening to &quot;punk&quot; bands like New Found Glory and Good Charolette are sad. That's not punk at all. Listen to Londing Calling. Now THAT'S PUNK. <BR>  I read a review on this album on Amazon, and couldn't agree more. Punk rock is about going against society, like wearing clothes that nobody else wears, and having little or no respect towards authority. Then you have bands like Good Charolette coming out and complaining that they're tired of people telling them that they're not punk. Guess what? You're not. You're POP rock, not punk. The only bands that come close to punk rock TODAY are: Sum 41 and Green Day. Sum 41 sounds nothing like The Clash, but they are deffinately punk. Just watch the &quot;Cross Your T's and Gouge Your I's&quot; DVD that comes with the &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; album to know what I mean. Then there's Green Day. They do at times sound like The Clash, plus they did a cover of &quot;I Fought The Law&quot;. <BR>  Pretty sad, eh? People need to realize what punk rock is. If you pick this album up and like it, then you're a fan of punk rock. If not, You're a fan of pop, or you're a poser. Simple.
B00064AM6C|5.0|That's my word.  I think you watch it a few times you learn to see why they went with 8 and 16.  I think it adds and maintains the mixed messages and sounds of this band.  I think people who have never seen them and think their cd's are so so will understand that the white stripes are performers.  If I  had to send a person or band to a different planet to show the inhabitants the complete picture of rock and roll it would be an easy choice.
B000286S8S|5.0|For over twenty years, several people have listened to Van Halen.  If it wasn't for Gene Simmons (who discovered the band)Van Halen probably wouldn't have gotten as lucky as they did.  First they had David Lee Roth, then there was Sammy Hagar, then Gary Cherone, and now Sammy Hagar is finally back.  Even though I would like to see David Lee Roth rejoin the group, we all know that that will never happen (Alex Van Halen once said that on a radio show) and we probably will never have to worry(as we did once)about Van Halen splitting up.  Anyway, to the album.  This is probably the best greatest hits album Van Halen has put out on the market, even better than the  \\"Van Halen Best Of\\" album.  This CD is titled \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\", and there are two discs.  There are songs on this album that were recorded with both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, and some songs on this album that were originally sung by David Lee Roth are sung by Sammy Hagar.  There are also three new studio songs on here( \\"It's About Time\\", \\"Up for Breakfast\\", and \\"Learning to See\\").  I enjoyed all three songs, and you can tell by listening to the lyrics that \\"It's About Time\\" is the Van Halen reunion song.  Excellent job, guys.  Another bonus for this album is that the Van Halen classics \\"Ain't Talkin' About Love\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"Panama\\" appear on two versions on this CD: Studio with David Lee Roth and live with Sammy Hagar.  Out of all of the good things 2004 has seen(as far as music goes) the Van Halen reunion and this new album are probably the best things the music industry has seen this year.
B000002UB3|5.0|These days, we listen to CDs as a collection of singles. However, this album was released first on record, and each track relies on the other tracks to make the whole thing make sense. Okay, sure. The Beatles released better tracks. I agree. But nothing can compare to the eclectic collection of songs that these guys managed to stream together to make one awesome album. Buy this, put it into your CD player, and listen to it all the way through. The only way to get the full experience of Abbey Road is to listen to it that way.  <br /> <br />The album exhibits the ability that The Beatles have at being able to do many different types of songs. You have the hard tracks of Come Together and I Want You(She's So Heavy). You have the soft, beautiful melodies of Something and Here Comes The Sun. A combination of soft and hard with Oh Darling. You have the \\"I wrote this on a drug trip\\" songs in Octopus' Garden and Maxwell's Silver Hammer. That's the beginning. Then you hit Because/You Never Give Me Your Money/Sun King....mellow tracks that just allow us to listen. All of a sudden, Bam. Mean Mr. Mustard comes on. 3 pieces of quick, catchy stuff in MMM/Polyethene Pam/She Came in Through the Bathroom Window. Back to something soft with Golden Slumbers, topping it all off with The End....and just when you think you're done, Your Majesty randomly comes in and ends as quickly as it began. But even with all of this chaos, several different styles switching back and forth, somehow it all comes together. Everything is different and yet every track is pure and true Beatles.  <br /> <br />This is the epitome of what every album should be.  It is not a collection of singles. It was released as an album and should be listened to as an album.
0446677450|4.0|I believe that you, as myself, are attracted in this book by its title and especially its subtitle: \\"What is that the rich people know and is it easy to get it myself?\\" My Kiyosaki has done an excellent marketing job, just with the cover of his book.    Don't expect to be rich by reading this book. You will probably still go to work or to college, still have the bills and the expenses that you already have. But, this book, if understood properly, will put inside you a special sheed: \\"There is got to be another way to make money, instead of working\\". And if you develop this idea, you will understand that the other way is more productive than the \\"usual way\\".    As a person who started saving from my teen age, and start investing from early 20's, I understand perfectly the ideas of this book. I haven't found a way to be so much succesfull, but I believe I am in a good way. Working is a mean to finance your investments. The type of investments will determine how rich you are going to be.    \\"Rich Dad, poor dad\\" is not a reading masterpiece. Sometime it goes wide and you probably get boring reading it, as it repeats the same thing. There is a old greek saying \\"repeat is the mother  of knowledge\\", but sometimes in this book it gets boring.    This book is a strategic not a tactical book. You don't have to follow Mr. Kiyosaki's steps. But you can think how you can make your strategic plans, in order to multiply your earnings.

B00005JMUA|5.0|This second part of the saga is by far less interesting than the first . I must confess however the two outstanding chapters ; the training process and the brilliant sword duel with Darryl Hannah .<br />Madsen reminded too much to Mickey Rourke look specially in Johnny Handsome . The script is very fine and sarcastic all the way .<br />Thurman is one the most attractive actress on the screen in the world . she irradiates magnetism , force and credibility to the film as any other actress in this exigent role<br />But think it over my kid reader To my mind  Tarantino might be well having made a film whose running time was three hours and a half  eliminating certain insipid sequences , unless certain market patterns have prevailed.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|This is a funny thing about sean connery, back in 1973, the producers of james bond movies offered him loads and loads of money, and really wanted him to continue as bond. he refused, and they hired Roger Moore to continue as bond. (after Connery had alredy turned down the role once before when Lazenby took over) but then about 10 years later, connery is fine by staring in this none-real james bond movie. i'm sorry, i'm a big james bond fan since i was child, but i could never dig this movie nomather how much i wanted.  it feels slow, pale and empty. it can't be compared with the regular \\"real\\" james bond movies. i want it to be a part of the james bond series, but it just doesnt have it. it doesn't have it. and the fact that it's a remake of \\"Thunderball\\" makes it just even more lame. and if they had to make a remake. why not do a remake of a movie that Roger Moore had starred in earlier? that would be so fun to compare. the bond films are based on books, so why not film the \\"Octopussy\\" book wich Moore was doing the same time 1983? But to do a remake of a movie that Connery has alredy done Bond in back the 60s.. that's just so lame.  this could be wrong, but i think i heard that sean connery doesnt like to talk about james bond in interwievs. isn't james bond what made sean connery? james bond is what sean connery always will be most famour for. what has he done since he quit the role? small movies, unknown movies, trash like \\"the league\\", or playing indiana jones dad or something.. he was at his best as james bond, and doesnt seem to appreciate the role as much as Moore and Brosnan has done. they were more like the oposit, they loved playing bond and never wanted to stop it.  Connery did this movie the same year as Roger Moore was james bond in a \\"real\\" bond flick titled \\"Octopussy\\", though \\"Never say never again\\" looks more like it was made 20 years earlier.. Connery's bond movies from the 60's looks more up to date than this. alote of people think Connery is tooold to play Bond in this movie, don't they know that Connery is younger than Moore? (who kept playing bond for 2 more years). what is it with these people and age? please. besides, bond is best as old. i want bond to be old. okey?. and just the title of this movie.. what a dumb title. there's only one good thing about this weak movie, and thats sean connery back as Bond. just too bad he didnt continue in a \\"real\\" bond flick instead of making this jive 15 years later.

You get behind the scenes, music videos, and concerts for every song but \\"Missing.\\" A must have for any Evanescence fan!
0618526412|4.0|This is a very good book that is well written and well developed. However, this is one of the saddest books I have ever read. It seemed that nothing good happened to the characters. Nonetheless I really liked how all the characters were all tied together in this one little town, especially with the use of a mute person.  <br />The book is about several different characters a deaf mute man who longs for friendship and for someone like himself, a little girl who loves music but because her family is poor always struggles to keep that love for music, a store owner who has somewhat feminine tendencies and possibly be a pedophile, a black doctor who wants to help his people, and a communist man who wants to spread his knowledge. <br />Some of the minor characters are interesting too and include an obese deaf mute, the little girls family, and the doctors daughter. <br />Well thoughout and developed book. I recommend is highly.
B000063UR1|3.0|I viewed the movie during it's initial release. It was about 4 years since 2001 and Douglas Trumbull handled FX for both. I believe Silent Running was Trumbull's first directorial job. Great visual detail, muscial score and a fine performance by Bruce Dern. I gave it only 3 stars because of the relative weakness of the script.
068987474X|2.0|It start out with books like \\"The Rules\\" and now has progress to this book \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\".  As a guy; I find these books silly and terribly annoying when you come up against a lady who has read and apply the instructions found on you personally.  The ladies who read these books seem to think this is a sure way to to catch guys!  As a guy, I like a lady that is herself and behaves as herself; not an actress playing a role! These books makes the dating life that much tougher for all concerned!    I have skimmed this book at the bookstore and found it lacking in alot of areas - but mostly in the areas of common sense and the detail analysis for what they say is really very shallow and simplistic.  Everyone is different! One person is shy; another aggressive!  One person needs time to reflex; another is impulsive!  Etc..., etc...      When I see someone that is so perfect in every way; I kind of freeze up, sweat and kind of fearful to approaching her; because if you are rejected; it really is a big disappointment!  So I kind of lay back; in worship mode and try to get a focus if she is at all into me! I'm might work up the courage to smile at her; or even try to talk to her if she is outgoing or just stare at her from a distance and not let her know. When I get a idea of my chances; work up the courage; I can then \\"hit on her\\" know the percentages and thus lessen the hurt because I know the odds!  It may take a couple of minutes or a couple of weeks, even months depending on if I see her again or not! The more I like her the more time it will take to ask her out!  It becomes a big thing for me; a major thing that consumes you when I really am \\"heads over heels for her!  It really takes my breath away and usually cannot talk with a dam!  I can approach gals that are really gorgeous but don't have that \\"feeling for\\" in an instant; but that something special gal; well it just like in the movies; slow going, gal thinks you are an idiot and situation is surreal at best!  Usually I come across making an \\"unbelievable bad impression\\" to that \\"special - love of my life\\"! You talk in broken sentences and use alot of uh! and usually look down instead of into her eyes!     The authors are from a cancelled TV show - \\"Sex In The City\\". One is a writer on the show and one a consultant!  How are they authorities on dating and relationships in the first place?; they are fictional writers!    This book is targeted at ladies that have been hurt or have trouble finding dates; and/or keeping boyfriends?  All I can say again is: - it just not that simple a solution! This book will definitely be another impedment for dating/relationship bonding!     The main theme from the two books - The Rules and this one, is that a guy really likes a challenge -  a good long hard chase(the hunt) in order to get the lady of their dreams! A guy will do whatever it takes to win you over; no matter what! There are some guys that really operate in that mindset; but alot of guys like me; really do not want to chase the girl - nearly forever and loose interest because either another gal comes along that is more receptive or the guy gets so frustrated and just moves on and she becomes history!    There is, however, some truth while in a relationship about one person's desire for the other person; the books title - a  \\"how hot are you\\" gauge.  If the relationship slacks off; then I think you should re-examine it to see if you should break up - as the book indicates you should serious consider!    Also, I love it when a lady ask me out!  I think it shows the lady has alot confidence and character in herself! She instantly becomes \\"very intriguing and sexy\\" because of it. It usually end up a great date for both! The opposite of the \\"aggressive\\" ladies; are the playing \\"hard to get\\" ones - the low esteem ladies that have nothing to offer except that between their legs and after she eventually offers that up; she gets the boot.  So give a guy some slack; be equalsand you will end up with a better understanding and respect for one another at the start. Don't listen to these self-help books!    In summary, to meet a guy - ladies;  I would tell you to just smile and say \\"hi\\" to a guy that you are interested in and see what happens!  In today's femininist and polititcally correct world; I  kind of waiting for the gal to make the first move; unless it is in a bar!  In any case; show him you are interested and the guy in most cases will come and socialize with you! In other word; be \\"friendly\\".      If you hook-up that is good and if not; then just try again!  This is the way to do it!  All guys are looking for a sign to approach; all you have to do is provide the okay to do so!  It is also okay to suggest getting together somewhere to sit down and talk some more after just meeting each other!  The first date!!!!!!!!!!!  I really like getting it over with at the first meeting! I make it a point to make sure during the get together that this is our first date!  This makes subsequent dates just flow that much better!    I learn recently, that a lady that applies chicanery, sophistry, mystification and cajolery should be avoid at all cost unless you want your heart to suffer for along time to come.  They are certainly the worse of all!    I just save you $20.00 and you can use for something worth buying.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|One of the ways we get hooked into movies is the \\"this could happen\\" feeling. Even when Ridley faces The Alien, if we've been brought along carefully, we say 'this could happen.'<br /><br />Of course nothing we see in Hollywood really could happen, Aliens and hitmen notwithstanding, so when the well coiffed, highly intelligent, money to burn assassin Vincent has been assigned to murder 5 key witnesses to the Federal trial of a billionaire drug lord, that \\"this COULDN'T happen\\" feeling starts to rise for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />You probably think with money to burn, a Joseph Aboud suit, and a $10,000 laptop in hand, why would the intelligent hitman get into a Los Angeles cab? Well, yeah, that's a problem for me. But the real problem is  . . . .the trial is TOMORROW. Vincent is going to wait 12 hours before opening statement to kill off the evidence? Why are the witnesses not in protective custody instead of making a pizza in a two bedroom flat in Venice, making out with two hot women in a West LA penthouses, and rocking 'n rolling in a club Beverly Hills THE NIGHT BEFORE A FEDERAL TRIAL? What if Jaime Foxx didn't speak English? What if they got a flat tire, a back-up on the 405 or LA smog?<br /><br />Having said that, Cruise is brilliant as the intelligent hitman, and Foxx as the bright but procrastinating cabbie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is absolutely gorgeous and plays a nice supporting role. The photography nearly steals the show, very slick like the Miami Vice days and always present as both a scene setter and conversationalist. But the movie lacks that sinister evil of To Live and Die, Body Heat and the much earlier Bullit, and seems confused as to whether it wants to be a slick shoot 'em up mystery or a series of \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" conversations between Vincent and Max.<br /><br />Kudos to Cruise and Foxx who do a nice morphing of the other's best characteristics, Vincent showing a hint of introspection and compassion at the end and Max more decisiveness. 4 stars.

B0002S947K|5.0|My first review, but i buy probably close to 100 CD's a year. I will tell you, of everything i have bought this year, this is the best CD of them all. I listen to music all day long, and i havent taken this disc out of my CD player in 4 days. A mix of Van Morrison, a little country twang, some blues and you have the most underappreciated album of the year. Buy it!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|I bought this DVD (used) without having ever seen it, and was at first disappointed.  The plot sounded funny enough, but I felt like a lot of potential humour was lost in the \\"Will trying to convince Kay that he was a former agent\\" that could have been there.  And, quite frankly, there were many times that it was just too obvious that there was a place where Barry Sonnefeld was going for a laugh but wasn't succeeding.      But then something funny happend (no pun intended).  I watched the DVD again, and started to find it at least somewhat humourus, and then after a while longer, flat out hilarious.  Not every part, mind you; but this movie has hilarious subtleties than most of the other reviewers never bothered to notice in their haste to be overly-critical of this movie.  So where the movie tried to be obviously funny, it failed (like when Will goes flying from Jeff the Worm into the subway car and we get a shot of his screaming facial expression).  But the subtle guestures make the whole movie worth while (like the twitch in the mouth and suprise on the face of the alien mail-sorter).      So yeah, not the best script in the world.  Not the greatest movie ever made.  But don't be too quick to pass judgement on this hilarious sequel!
B0000683WG|5.0|The Slider = Glam Rock Masterpiece.<br /><br />Marc Bolan influenced so many, and this particular work  is one of  Glam's finest offerings. His crunching LesPaul, cooing vocals and blatant swagger on this disc define a moment in rock that was an exciting phenomenon in Europe. Unfortunately Bolan's huge popularity in England never really surfaced on America's shores short of \\"Get It On (Bang a Gong) from \\"Electric Warrior\\".<br /><br />The tunes from this collection are some of Bolan's finest.<br /><br />\\"Metal Guru\\" opens the disc with an exhilirating wail of joy and power. It's anthemic vibe never lets up. Flo and Eddie of The Turtles showcase their harmonies on this track and throughout the disc. They were so essential to this work's sound as is the production of Tony Visconti.<br /><br />\\"Mystic Lady\\" is next and Bolan whispers a love song that no doubt melted many young girl's hearts at the time. How many of those young women identified with these lyrics: \\"The people in your life are cruel,keep on riding that hard road, the lovers in you life are few, keep on riding that hard road.\\" Desperation and  love within young females Bolan understood.<br /><br />I could review this effort track by track but you get the idea.<br /><br />The biggest standout on this album is the beautiful \\"Ballrooms of Mars\\" which many consider to be Bolan's finest moment. A hard rock ballad that completely encapsulates youth, glamour and rock and roll, paying homage to Bolan's heroes, Dylan and Alan Freed. It's perfect.<br /><br />Pick up \\"The Slider\\" along with \\"Electric Warrior\\" and soon you'll want everything T.Rex has ever produced. Brilliant.
B0000640SB|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it several years back.  As some of the other viewer's have remarked, the move is good because it's so enjoyable and humourus.  I know that Will Smith is often cast in the same type of role, but I cannot help but laugh at his character more and more each time that I watch this DVD.  If you're feeling down and just need a laugh, pop this one in the player! <br /> <br />Having moved to New York City, I can see how the storyline is at times frighteningly realistic.  Half the people here DO look like the auto guy that Frank the Pug was hanging out with in the movie, and having ridden in way too many cabs, one can certainly understand Jay's assumption that cab drivers are aliens.   <br /> <br />Having the bonus DVD with this deluxe edition is cool as well to see more of the behind the scenes bits to see how everything was made/done.   <br /> <br />My final comment is that this one of those excellent movies that gets a little bit funnier every time you watch it, so it's definitly worth buying the DVD to have for your own.  Enjoy!
0375707972|5.0|The topic of the Holocaust is raised almost every day in some manner. Many books have been written about the topic. Whether in studies, documentaries or fictional accounts, finger-pointing at the perpetrators of the crimes against millions has been part of the process of coming to terms with the Nazi atrocities. For Imre Kertesz, renowned author and Nobel laureate of 2002, there is no other topic. Yet, when he reflects on the traumatic impact of Auschwitz, \\"he dwells on the vitality and creativity of those living today\\" and \\"thus, paradoxically, not on the past but the future.\\" Bernhard Schlink, professor of law and practicing judge in Germany, born in 1944, has attempted to capture the struggles of his generation in confronting the past and the future in \\"The Reader\\".  \\"Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame\\", his narrator and protagonist contemplates, \\"but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it\\".<br /><br />The usually unambiguous distinction between villain and victim has facilitated the identification with those who lost their lives or suffered under the Nazi atrocities while all scorn, abhorrence and hate was piled on the perpetrators. Until recently, few books have focused on the after-war generation. While growing up, the children had to come to terms with the, often sudden, exposure of their parents' active or passive participation in the crimes of the Nazi regime.  \\"The Reader\\", set in post-war Germany and against the backdrop of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the mid-sixties, takes this new and, for our generations, important angle: in the form of the fictional memoir of Michael Berg. Michael, while not refuting guilt, shame, and atonement, is led to examine and dissect the complexity of inter-generational conflicts in the context of his personal experiences.  Like Schlink himself, he grapples with the fundamental problem of the relationships between these two generations.<br /><br />Michael recounts the most important stages in his life, starting with experiences long passed in his youth.  While his account follows the chronology of events, he progressively interleaves retrospective reflections on his past conduct, questioning his conflicting emotions - his behaviour.  The story starts with Michael's first, secret, love affair at age 15 with a woman more than twice his age. The blossoming erotic relationship strengthens his self-worth and confidence yet, at the same time, increasingly isolating him from his family and peers.  Hanna Schmitz, of whose circumstances and background Michael knew very little, was affectionate and standoffish at the same time, prone to abrupt mood swings. The young lover is completely captivated and eager to please.  He is the \\"Reader\\", in German \\"Vorleser\\" is a person who reads aloud to an audience.  At her insistence he reads his books to her and it becomes an important element of their shared intimacy.  When she disappears one day without any warning, her loss leaves him devastated and scarred for life. He can only seek the reasons in his own actions.  Seeing Hanna again years later and in unanticipated surroundings, triggers a flood of questions about the person he loved and thought he knew. Her behaviour raises many questions and Michael discovers a long secret that puts in doubt the facts as they are exposed.  He also wrestles with himself over his own inaction when confronted with choices.  \\"What would you have done?\\" Although addressed to the judge by the defendant, this question hangs over Michael, as it does over his whole generation.  It encapsulates the primary dilemma of the child-parent generations relationships.  Finally, writing the story of his life, drafting and redrafting it in his head until it is in a publishable form, is seen as a chance for his own recovery and for living his own life.<br /><br />The Reader, while a work of fiction, is deeply anchored in the personal experiences of the author and symbolic for his generation.  His spare and unemotional language underlines the impression of a biographical investigation and is used quite deliberately. The English translation captures the tone and style amazingly well.  Reading this book should not be an \\"easy pleasure\\" as some reviewers have suggested. The Reader covers difficult and complex terrain in a way that it forces the reader to reflect and question their own position long afterwards. Although written directly for a German audience of Schlink's and my generation, the novel, surprisingly, has attracted world-wide attention.  While reviews and reactions among readers are highly diverse and even contradictory, it should be read by as many people as possible and with the care the subject matter deserves.

B000002UAX|5.0|It's definitely my favorite Beatles album, w/ \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" following closely behind.  Some of the songs on here I could've done without (just a few).  But 90% of the songs on this album are pure genious and essential to any Beatles collection.  I never grow tired of it!
B0006399FS|4.0|...    I am admittedly a fan, but not a mega-fan like a lot who have contributed reviews.  And Bono does grate on my nerves sometimes, but I am basing this on the music and the music only.  As far as this being the \\"best\\" U2 ever, well, I don't know about that.  I would personally put the big three U2 cds as Achtung, All That You Can't Leave Behind, and The Joshua Tree.  \\"Second Tier\\" U2 cds in my opinion are War, Zooropa, and Boy.  These are incredible CDs, but not quite on the level of the first three I mentioned.    To me, Atomic Bomb falls somewhere in between the two groups.  In time, it might make its way to the top tier, but it's too early to tell for me.  If I could, I would give this a 4.5 rating, but since I can't, and since I have to give it time, 4 will have to do. Songs like Crumbs From Your Table, Original of the Species, and Yahweh are at the level of the best songs the band has ever written.  In fact, this album has the strongest second half of any U2 cd I can think of.      As far as those go who refer to it as \\"mediocre\\" and \\"bland\\", in my opinion it certainly is not.  No matter how much some fans want it, we will probably never again get the surprise that was Achtung Baby or the weirdness that was Zooropa.  They are now approaching, or at, middle age, and I remember Bono saying something to the effect that they are now more concerned with writing songs to rival \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" than being on the cutting edge of music.  Come to think of it, a bunch of guys in their mid forties trying to incorporate dance music with lyrics about teen angst would be pretty sad, wouldn't it?    So ignore those who say it's junk, because it's not.  It's not groundbreaking, but it's not trying to be, either.  As a whole, it is a collection of some of the greatest songs the band has ever written, and when you're talking about a band like U2, that's pretty impressive.
B000025SJ8|5.0|If you read the reviews on Amazon you'll notice many people will exaggerate the merits of an album, perhaps even myself occasionaly. However, I make this statement with full conviction: This is one of the most intense records ever made.  Not in terms of volume or speed but of sheer, brutal intensity. Varg is by far the most disturbing vocalist and I've ever heard and maybe the best black metal vocalist ever.  The instruments are minimal and raw, you won't find any ultra technical drumming or fancy riffing here, yet it is brutal in it's simplicity.  Besides less stuff going on in the background leaves more room for Vargs ungodly growls and that isn't a bad thing.  I guess this album isn't for everyone. If you have to have your black metal perfectly produced and laden with keyboards, solos, etc. this isn't for you.  And some people can't see past the things Varg has done or said.  I don't agree with everything he has said or done but this is a review about the music, not the man.  Buy this today if you think you can handle it.
B000006O7C|4.0|Jeff was an artist, and this is proof. I wish Coldplay, Travis, Snowpatrol, Stairsailer, Damian Rice, and Muse would drown... at least in a corporate sense. This particular LP by Mr. Buckley is unfinished, but that shouldn't frighten anyone who appreciates refined songwriting.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|There are some people who found this movie to be tiring, a boring plotless low key movie with no action and no big productive stunts.  I was definately not one of those people.  Napolean is one of the funniest characters ever seen in modern movies.  His detachment from reality is unbelievable, and his supporting cast is flawless.  If you can't laugh at his wacky character and dorky antics then you are an idiot!  Gosh!    \\"Its like my favorite animal, its a Liger...It's half lion half tiger, bread for its skills in magic\\"    as an edit, this movie has not stopped playin in my dvd player since i got it.  The lines get better and better each time and the ending dance sequence never tires me.  This movie is a hilarious masterpiece that stands the test of time.
0792841344|5.0|Extremely good horror film. This movie has a very creepy plot to it. Its a story about a \\"Tall man\\"(which is his characters name)who is an alien from another planet.What he does is he runs a funeral home which people think is a completly normal one. But they are wrong. Dead wrong.What they dont know is that after each fineral, the Tall man takes the dead corpses back into the funeral home and reanimates them (brings them back from the dead)and turns them into these midget like slaves on his home planet. When the young Mike finds out what is going on, he and his brother try to stop him, and finally do .............so they think.... <br />This movie has some awsome special effects as well.
B000002JSN|5.0|Overall, Led Zeppelin is a great album-oriented band; always listen to an album from beginning to end. The only way to listen to Led Zeppelin is to put your eardrums at the threshold toward explosion.  Well, first disc of Graffiti is flawless, drenched with riffs.  \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" and \\"The Rover\\" stand out especially.  Disc two is a transition.  Country and folk creep in through \\"Bron-Yr-Aur,\\" \\"Boogie With Stu\\" and \\"Black Country Woman,\\" all songs that were recorded in previous years.  It's a shame that Led Zeppelin is labeled as a \\"heavy metal\\" group.  They influenced contemporary bands that are undeniably heavy metal; however, it doesn't necessarily claim their style.  Anyway, Custard Pie is the perfect introduction after coming off of The Ocean.  The Rover has an addicting riff.  I'm glad Houses of the Holy ended up on this album.  Trampled Under Foot has a unique sound, making a perfect freeway song.  Kashmir is easily a contender with Stairway to Heaven as Led Zeppelin's best.  Bron-Yr-Aur is very soothing and peaceful to listen to while strolling through campus.  Down By the Seaside has a great transition midway through the song.  Ten Years Gone can only be appreciated at high volume, much like all Led Zeppelin songs.  Boogie With Stu is a personal favorite that ought to be played at bars. Black Country Woman is very similar to Gallows Pole with a great beat by Bonham.  There are more songs on this album.  Although I'm expressing my personal favorites, every song contributes to this 5-star rating.

B0002IU988|4.0|I was thinking, or I guess expecting, Creed when I first listened to \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and then bought the Alter Bridge CD. What I got from the rest of the songs was something totally different and unexpected. I didn't like it much at first. I enjoyed Tremonti's guitar, but it took time to hone into Myles Kenndey's voice after I stoped trying to compare it to Scott Stapp. <br /> <br />Then came the serious listens to \\"In Loving Memory\\" and \\"Metalingus.\\" I was blown away! Especially with the slow melody of Tremonti's guitar strings mixed in with Kennedy's voice on \\"In Loving Memory.\\" I was hooked! It starts of with a good guitar solo, has great lyrics, and ends with that same opening guitar solo. A perfect song full circle. Meanwhile, \\"Metalingus\\" is where Alter Bridge comes alive. Again, great lyrics and guitar playing. A great song to play in the car while in the fast lane. A great song to see performed live. <br /> <br />So that's how I discovered Alter Bridge and separated the former Creed band mates from Scott Stapps shadow of ego. I'm glad I gave the album time to grow on me, and you other doubters should too. <br /> <br />Songs to check out right now: <br /> <br />1) Find The Real <br />2) One Day Remains <br />3) Open Your Eyes <br />5) Metalingus <br />7) In Loving Memory <br />8) Down To My Last <br />9) Watch Your Words
0743216458|5.0|Stephen E. Ambrose successfully captured the moments of the 101st airbourne division. This book was dedicated to the soldiers who gave their lives during world war 2, It followed the Footsteps of Easy company, 506th regiment, 101st airbourne, or the screaming eagles, they were a top parachute regiment, men of easy company had their toughest experience in their lives. They first met as a group in Camp Toccoa,in geworgia. They all came from different places and backrounds but one goal to serve their country patriotically, they later were sent to Europe to fight the evil empire, the \\"nazi's\\" or the germans. They parachuted through the skys of Normandy,the fought against time in Holland, They were freezing in their foxholes in bastogne ,they fought bravely as a group. They had heavy casualties. Brothers and friends were lost. They somehow survived through the harshest times of wasr and came out strong and on top. It was becasue of these herosism things and that easy company did that made them trust their brother soldiers and later they would come together and be called the Band of Brothers.  <br />  The book is based on individual stories told by different people in Easy Company, the most respected and remarkable person in the book was lutinant Winters who successfully led the men of easy company to many great victories and came out on top, and Winters thanked him for that with their braveness and herosism throiught world war 2. Band of brothers was formed from the Book By stephen E. ambrose and was turned into a 10 part mini-series by Stephen Speilberg and Tom Hanks.After the first few episodes I started reading the book along with the movie there was 2 parts each week all an hour in length so it gave me time to read the book, and it helped me   the characters and orient what was happening. Also, the book gives you a greater understanding of why certain things and missions were so important in the war  When every chapter i read and every part of the series i watched itwas a new experience to me. <br />   This 10 part mini series starts from training in Georgia to D-Day in Noprmandy to finding Hitlers \\"eagles Nest\\" in the mother land in the mountains.with this in mind readers should deffinitally like this book and readers should accept that this book was a true story and should respect what these men of easy company did for our country and save us from hitlers reign.After seeing the series and reading the book, you can't help but stand in awe of these men.  Every day citizens were turned into incredible soldiers. They came from nowhere, saved the world, and then went home again. In these days we have to have a pefessional army who has to train vigiriously to fight our battles, it is difficult to imagine anything like this. I highly recommened this to book to anyonw who doesn't get the visual concept of the war and what these men witnessed and went throught and they should be more respected other than a medal on their chest. <br />I recommened this book absolutly, i loved it !!! <br /> <br /> <br />Kyle Kells <br />
B00003CXPJ|4.0|This movie grows on you.  I thought it was just ok the first time, but upon further review I thought it was hilarious.  Watch out for the gas station scene and the walk-off among others.  Ben Stiller's facial expressions are classic and I find that Owen Wilson is always an excellent sidekick.
B00000294R|5.0|to the person who rated this album 1 star: you are a fool. teens dont buy music to learn language. if you had half a brain you would listen to something before insisting its garbage. this album is truly a classic, his lyrical prowess is unbelievable. this is perhaps THE best lyrical hip hop album of all time. if your reading this, you know about big l and probably have the album anyway, just adding my $.02 if you dont have it buy it now. NOW!<br />RIP BIG L
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise and especially Jamie Foxx both shine in this hard edged crime thriller, masterfully helmed by Michael Mann (Heat, Manhunter).  For most of it's two hour running time, Collateral combines both an intricate character study and some intense action set pieces that make it a joy to watch, beginning with cool, calm, and calculated hitman Vincent (Cruise) hitching a ride with taxi driver Max (Foxx).  Max has big dreams and grand ideas and little to show for it, something Vincent uses to his advantage as he takes Max hostage to make his rounds of the night which include the executions of five people.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is undoubtadly Collateral's strong point, with Foxx giving a knockout performance and Cruise's surprising performance as one of the best screen villains in the past few years.  However, Collateral loses steam as it approaches it's climax when the tables are turned and a cat & mouse game ensues that ends on an MTA train.  Other than that, everything else about Collateral is nearly flawless, and it is definitely one of the best films to be released this year.  The cast also features Jada Pinkett-Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and look for a cameo in the opening scene from Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular, Snatch).
B0000035E7|5.0|This album is the most grundiest out of all nirvana's albums. I am a huhe nirvana fan and own about 21 of their cds and 3 vhs/dvd's and i will admit alot of nirvana is not grundge music. But htis is so if u like the bands like the melvins mudhoney alice in chains this is a great buy for you. This shows a young talented Cobain trying 2 find his voice. And wut i love about Cobain is he has so many different voices. This album is  a must hav 4 any nirvana fan, and if u r new 2 nirvana and like the hard sludgier sound i would even say to but his over nevermind.
B0002S94OS|4.0|Lamb of God is one of the few bands in metal that get better and better with each new album they release.  Vastly improving on \\"As the Palaces Burn\\", \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" finds the band evolving lyrically and musically, such as displayed on the rip roaring opener \\"Laid to Rest\\".  \\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\" and \\"The Faded Line\\" are just plain awesome songs that recall the golden age of metal, and the title track is an amazing instrumental (yes, some bands still do those) that nicely demonstrates Lamb of God's guitar work.  \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is loaded with brutal riffs and a belting roar, and while it may not be anything groundbreaking, it doesn't try to be.  This is pure american metal for the new age, and I can't wait to see what else these guys come up with.

0385508417|2.0|I don't know what John Grisham was thinking when he published this a few years ago to add his voice to the growing list of holiday-themed, sentimental novellas that are mostly dripping in saccharine sweetness.  Perhaps it presented a nice break from writing legal thrillers, since he certainly didn't write it for the money.  This is the kind of hack work that only a best selling writer can get away with publishing and dumping on his fans who must read every book he writes.  This mini-novel is skimpy on the details and words, making it an easy breeze to read through during the busiest season of the year.<br /><br />When I started reading it, I thought it was going to be an interesting satire on how commercialized our Christmas season has become.  It certainly leads readers in that direction as we root for the Kranks when they decline to buy fruitcakes, trees, and calendars from the town's firemen, Boy Scouts, and police.  They forgo their annual Christmas party, to the disappointment of everyone else who considers it the social highlight of their year. Everyone in this novella seems to be too interested in what the Kranks are doing or not doing, as if it was against the law to skip Christmas.  By the end, I was glad to finish this piece of tripe.  What is the point of this story?  The Kranks end up having to rush Christmas in six hours so all can appear normal to their surprise return of their daughter and her new fiance, whom she had just met a month prior.  Very poorly contrived story.  Grisham fans won't lose sleep if they skip this one.  It's a novel that should never have been published, one that should have remained in Grisham's file cabinet of unworkeable manuscripts.  To pawn it on his fans is nothing short of greed.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I am, and have long been, a great fan of Isaac Asimov's and the movie I, Robot is a fantastic rendition of what Asimov's vision of robots, AI, and their relation to humanity.  <br /> <br />Isaac Asimov was unique in that he rarely wrote a story in which robots were simple machines. His tales almost always involved the quest for, or the questioning of, humanity. I, Robot captures this quest for the soul fairly well, and still manages to mesmerize with great special effects and action sequences.   <br /> <br />The acting is all very well done, and one of the most interesting characters is, strangely enough, the computer-generated robot Sunny. We find ourselves identifying with Sunny as he questions what it is to be alive, what it is to have a soul, and why he was created.  <br /> <br />The special effects are great, with only a few noticeable glitches throughout the film. The camera-angles in the fight-scenes are some of the best I've seen in predominantly computer-generated scenes. <br /> <br />All in all, I, Robot manages to capture the essence of Asimov's stories about the quest for humanity, and at the same time, delight the viewer with action and humor that have almost become a staple of Will Smith movies. For sci-fi fans and Will Smith fans, this movie is a must own.
0553212737|4.0|Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.  <br /> My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book. <br /> I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels. <br />
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Collateral proves that there are many great actors out there who have yet to show how well they can shine given a great script. <br /> <br />Collateral's plot isn't very complex. A cab driver takes a hitman from hit to hit, trying in vain to stop the sociopathic killer before he can get away with his crimes. But the plot isn't what makes this movie great, it's the characters, their intelligence, and relationships to one another. One point that shows how much deeper this movie's characters are compared to most others is a scene in which Vincent (Cruise), a hitman, saves the life of Max (Foxx), the cab driver, despite Max's repeated attempts at thwarting Vincent. They stop and stare at each other, Max in confusion, Vincent with understanding and strength. It's as though Vincent is telling Max that he knows Max is incapable of stopping him, and that b/c of this, Vincent is willing to protect someone who, on a strange level, has almost become a friend in his lonely life. <br /> <br />These scenes wouldn't work at all if it wasn't for the fantastic acting. I never had much faith in Jamie Foxx as a serious actor, but after this movie and Ray, I have completely changed my opinion. Collateral shows exactly how wide a range he has as an actor. And Tom Cruise as a serious villain is perfection. Cruise has been missing his calling by playing random, throw-away heroes. The deep character of Vincent plays to all of Cruise's strengths as an actor and adds magnificently to the movie. <br /> <br />For a great drama, with very good acting, writing, and a few edge-of-your seat moments, I cannot recommend Collateral enough.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a superb book. Each character has a unique personality. For example, Mr. Darcy is arrogant at the start of Pride and Prejudice. While Darcy is arrogant, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, beautiful, and independent. Elizabeth is the protagonist and is the liveliest character. I rooted for her from the start to the end of the story. Miss Bennett seems to somehow always find herself in difficult situations. The plot kept me entertained. There were several times when I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened next.<br /><br /> Pride and Prejudice is sometimes a little wordy. And because it was written in the 19th century, the English isn`t contemporary.<br /><br /> Overall, this book is excellent. In fact, it is considered one of the best novels in English ever written. It is therefore a classic. I recommend it to readers who want to read an engrossing book with a lot of dialogue.
B0001Z36PK|3.0|Upon first listen you may dismiss this as string laden and pretentious, with nary a memorable tune to be found.  But as is the case with all of Neil Hannon's albums, upon the third or maybe even fourth go-round everything becomes apparent, the lush atmospherics, the Scott Walker homages, the wistful melancholia.  This is one of those rare albums that rewards over time, and I tip my hat to any artist that can pull this off in todays musical climate.  Its not as striking as Casanova or Regeneration (hence the three stars), but it is very good unto itself, so don't cloud your judgement with The Divine Comedy's past successes.  Standout tracks here are \\"The Happy Goth\\" which brilliantly rhymes 'goth' with 'Hoth' (as in Empire Strikes Back ice planet Hoth) , the hummable \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\", and the wonderous one-two punch of the two closing tracks, the haunting instrumental \\"Laikas Theme\\", and the lovely \\"Charmed Life\\", which could be described as Hannon's 'My Way'.  I recommend this  strongly to fans of The Divine Comedy, but be prepared to spend some time with it.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|There are so many things that make this movie work! if you are a fan of zombie movies you will love Shaun of the Dead, it has all the gore of a good zombie movie and it adds comedy, which to my knowledge has never been done before.<br /> I garauntee that if any movie tries to mix the undead with the funny it will no doubt be compared to Shaun of the Dead. In other words this movie is a pioneering sort, one that will be imitated but never duplicated.
B000051Y0G|5.0|This is definitely my favorite album by far. There is something special about every song that helps keep the 80's alive and kicking. I was not born in the 80's so i have never lived it, but i absolutely love it. Everything about it is great, the music, the funky style, the movies... and cyndi laupers pure spunk. I highly reccomend this album to others. It is filled with so much fun and memories of the 80s. And above it all Cyndi Laupers amazing vocals!!! I don't know many singers today that possess such an amazing vocal range! She is truly gifted!!! Buy this cd, and you won't be dissapointed!!

B000002H2H|5.0|Truly a great CD.  It's one of my favorite CDs of all time, and is definitely Metallica's best.  I shall now compile a track-by-track review of this masterpeice. <br />1.  Fight Fire With Fire - A song about nuclear war.  I don't like the intro, it's not very catchy, and slow.  And for me, the remainder of the track doesn't do much to make up for it...I usually skip this track.  8/10 <br />2.  Ride the Lightning - A song about execution by means of electricution in the electric chair.  Excellent at the beginning, and then flows into a pretty great song.  10/10 <br />3.  For Whom the Bell Tolls - A song about war.  Excellent.  Great lyrics as well.  The bells at the beginning remind me of Hell's Bells, which is my favorite AC/DC song along with Thunderstruck.  If only it were longer than 5:11.  10/10 <br />4.  Fade to Black - A song about suicide.  This is my favorite song by Metallica, hands down, and it's up there in my favorite songs of all time.  I love the whole song.  At 6:58, this is the longest song on the album with lyrics (the instrumental, The Call of KTULU, is 8:54).  10/10 <br />5.  Trapped Under Ice - A song about drowning.  This one doesnt really appeal to me all that much, along with Escape.  Still OK though.  7/10 <br />6.  Escape - I'm not really sure what this song's about.  7/10 <br />7.  Creeping Death - About the bible story with Moses and the Pharoah's first born son's being killed and such.  Excellent intro, unfolding into an excellent song.  10/10 <br />8.  The Call of KTULU - I usually don't like instrumentals, but I love this song.  The only downside is that the cymbals are played too much, which sounds awesome at first, but it gets old later into the track, seeing as the track is 8:54 in length.  10/10 <br /> <br />Overall I give the album a 10/10, although the average of my track-by-track scoring would be a 9/10.  And stuff.
B000021Y77|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is quirky, but that appealed to me.  I found the diversions interesting.  The format of running the story over three times didn't seem odd to me.  I found it a new way to look at a film without feeling like it was an \\"ART\\" film.  I can't say that making another movie like this would work, but it worked for this movie. <br />   This is also the first and only commentary I have watched immediately after seening the movie for the first time.   After the movie ended, I turned on the commentary and watched again.  I thought Franka Potente and Tom Tykwer give great added information to the movie.  They don't take it too seriously but rather take you along as they reminense about how the movie was made.   <br />   I realize people have different tastes in movies, but I recommend this movie for EVERYONE over 18.  A friend of mine watched this and HATED the fact that it went over the same story three times.  I don't know how to counter that other than to say, open your mind and give this movie a try.
B0002IQAN6|5.0|I cut my teeth on jamming listening to Cream.  So the Allmans' Live was not a revelation just a stunning album and purchased on release in Australia.  I know it all by heart -just burnt into the synapses. <br /> <br />In 1992 Tom Dowd did a full concert remix and remaster as \\"The Fillmore Concerts\\".  This is where the controversy starts cause it sounds different and so it should - Tom transferred the original 16 track master tapes to digital and remixed.  Taking advantage of the wider dynamic and frequency range, he produced a mix with the bass guitar stronger and drums clearer and more dynamic.  Unfortunately the guitar freaks found the relatively lower level guitar sound unacceptable but the bass freaks loved Berry's sound (more bottom end). <br /> <br />Now we have the SACD stereo, multi-channnel and Audio Stereo remaster release of the original 2 record set accurately split over 2 cds.  It should fit on one but there is marketing to us baby boomers. But I gotta say they did perform split sets so it does reasonably capture the night. <br /> <br />And more controversy - the stereo CD layer is a remix closer to the original LP release.  Drums are further back but the bass guitar bottom end is retained.  The tracks are identical to the original release but not on the SACD layer with the Fillmore Concert's \\"Stormy Monday\\" used, which is the unedited version including the harmonica break, and a different edit to end \\"Whipping Post\\".  On the SACD layer the tympany start to \\"Mountain Jam\\" is rapidly faded out and applause overdubbed which is annoying if you want the sonic continuity when following up with the jam from the \\"Eat A Peach\\" SACD. <br /> <br />Sound of both layers is excellent with SACD preferred because you can adjust the bottom end via the sub control.  The surrounds give some reverb and audience noise - \\"Play all night\\".  The centre has plenty of bass guitar, some drums and some of Greg's vocals (reinforcing the original centre-left positioning of the vocals).  I would have preferred the drums a bit higher in the centre. <br /> <br />I can feel the SACD Deluxe \\"Fillmore Concerts\\" is on its way - the wallet is already feeling lighter.
B00007AJF8|4.0|This is a very good movie, but not for the faint of heart.  This is  a film that is not typical but still entertaining.  I think it was made even better when I saw it in the theater next to a woman who HATED this film.  She kept talking and complaining.  I asked her to be quiet and still she was talking.  She then got up and left.  How does this relate you ask?  Simple, it made this odd movie even more real and interactive for me.  That doesn't happen very often.  If you are looking for a normal movie with a simple plot, this isn't it.  If you want to see a quirky movie that is entertaining, this is your movie.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Fantastic, the very best rock album of 2004! Fun! A great rock record you can dance to. A return to great 80s Brit pop.<br /><br />'Take me out' is simply awesome with it's change in tempo from twangy rock to stomping beats. It starts off as a gentle rocker, which then progresses into a stomping rocker about either taking me out (as in shoot me) or as in take me out on a date.<br /><br />The lyrics are clever and largely innuendo laden; 'Take me out' and 'Michael' (about dancing with a guy, Michael, so sexy!..) for instance.<br /><br />Other gems are the rocking 'Jaqueline' (which starts off with some gentle crooning before exploding), '40 feet',<br />Tell her tonight', 'The dark of the matinee' and 'Darts of pleasure'.<br /><br />Can't wait for the follow up.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I am a fan of the Harry Potter books.  I have read them all at least three times and listened to Jim Dale's audio version.  I own all the DVD's.  I do think this is the best movie yet, but that is what I thought of each book when it came out.  All three movies are good, but this one is the darkest yet.  This one also had great touches:  The Shrunken Head, the dorm room candy eating scene, very scary dementors, and muggle-like attributes of the school in general.  The shrunken head is a great character and not all annoying like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars.  The candy eating scene makes Harry and the other kids seem just like that, KIDS.  The scary dementors are really very scary.  The fact that the kids wear muggle clothes when out of class makes Hogwarts even more interesting.  The quiditch uniforms make it seem like Harry is playing football but on a broom.  I like the touches added here. <br />     As far as the DVD is concerned, there were some good extras.  The interviews were actually entertaining, not at all \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" type of garbage.  Of course I wish there were more interviews and more behind the scenes stuff, but it was enough to keep my interest.  I didn't like the DVD games, but that is because I never can play video games. <br />     Overall, this DVD gives you a great movie and some worthwhile extras.  Hope you like it!
B00005JMAH|5.0|i love the HP books. but, the movies can be better. i really, really, like to books. and i only really like the movies. you get what i'm saying? the books describe so much more, and the movies show it. <br />problem is, before you see the movies you have your own ideas of what everything looks like! my hogwarts looked ENTIRELY different than the one shown. (i have no faults with tom felton as draco malfoy...*smiles*) <br /> <br />draco malfoy is my favorite character, for some odd reason. but this movie did not do him justice! i mean, the longest scene with him in it is when hermione PUNCHES him! i mean...really! <br /> <br />as i said, there is a \\"but...\\" <br />the first \\"but\\" is of course the injustice to draco. <br />the second has to be the fact that i accidentally bought the widescreen edition. then i saw the fullscreen and was spitting mad. you don't see more in the widescreen! ARRGH! <br /> <br />ah well. i give it a five. and the special features and all that, also a five. so yes, i enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br />oh, and this was the first time i've ever seen it. so i'm not like, jaded or anything. <br />

0395389496|1.0|I read this book in the bookstore. It took me a minute. There is absolutely no depth to the book at all. It never has a chance to have depth because it basically goes like this: Event A happens, Event B happens, Event C happens, Event D happens, etc, like two weeks worth of the comic strip \\"Mary Worth\\". Each page has one paragraph in it and pushes the story along one inch at a time. And then it ends. A lot of things that were in the movie weren't in the book and that's somewhat to the book's redemption. Perhaps the book has sparked memories in some readers' pasts and that has what has endeared it to so many but for me reading it was an empty experience.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film is well mad and should anger most patriots severely.  I have noticed most who gave this a bad review did not watch it as they are unable to list any specific \\"untrue facts.\\"  I personally remember at least half these facts from watching the news and reading over the past few years.  Most of the facts I have checked so far are real.  But don't take my word for it, and please don't listen to those who worship Bush like many German's worshipped Hitler before 1942.  Find the truth for yourself.  Most of the facts here are shown as actual video clips or newspaper articles, very little is actually just someone telling you something.  This movie really does something else most seemed to miss: it shows how the elite in our society need to keep some in this country in poverty so the poor can be sent to fight wars that make the rich richer.  If you don't bekeive this, you better start reading your history book.  Most kids fighting are poor kids who had no better options.  This movie cast great respect and sympathy toward the poor who are econimocally forced into the military to fight our wars.  I know many join because they are patriots, but many see this as their only choice.  My family has lost 3 to war.  I feel for those fighting or waiting for their return.  I beleive this type of corruption is within both parties and we need to take our country back from the rich elite businesses that create most of our policy.  Our founding father's would be sick to see what has happened to our great land.  Why else would there even be debate about giving a driver license to an illegal immigrant?  Because big biz wants cheap labor and the Mexican lobby gives these fat cats big campaign contributions.  All of life's problem's, follow the money.  Don't miss this film.
079284131X|4.0|Forget Seed of Chucky, Bride of Chucky, and the other two sequels that came after this surprisingly good horror romp.  Tom Holland (Fright Night) directed this horror romp, in which the soul of a deranged killer inhabits a child's doll.  Child's Play manages to boast a few genuine scares and add some creepy atmosphere to boot, with Brad Dourif doing great work as the voice of killer \\"good guy\\" doll Chucky.  I won't go into the plot, since everyone pretty much already knows it, but what I will say is that this is about ten times better than any movie to feature the killer doll released since, and surprisingly the film hasn't aged too badly.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Child's Play, give it a try; although I wish the DVD were presented in widescreen.

0743455967|5.0|If you have a dream of becoming a writer then I suggest you pick up this book.  There is much to learn from this book (if you haven't picked up many books on writing already).  But lets be forewarned here.  This is a \\"Memoir\\" of the craft, not just a \\"This is how to write\\" book, which several people seem to overlook.<br /><br />As the book begins he talks about his childhood and his adult life.  \\"What does this have to do with writing?\\" you'll probably ask yourself.  Then you'll remember that along with talking about the craft, he's creating a memoir.  Even in his childhood and early adulthood he was a writer.  The purpose of the first half of the book is for him to explain how he got to where he is today and where some of his inspiration came from.  In the first half he mentions several of his books and where the inspiration for those books came from.<br /><br />But the real meat is after the C.V. in which King talks about the Toolbox and truly begins what the book is about.  On Writing.<br /><br />The entire section on writing has helped me a lot.  He has some pretty useful tips for anyone who dreams of writing.  He talks about how the first important thing should be the story and to take out what isn't the story.<br /><br />It's amazing how brutally honest King can be.  But brutal honesty is always the greatest (and often times most helpful) truth.  From reading this book I've been able to back and see what I've been doing wrong.  Out go those clumsy and redundant adverbs.  Out goes all that \\"telling\\". Out go the needless (and often times only flavoring) words.  Through this book I've learned how to connect with the reader, as well as the text.<br /><br />The book has also answered several questions about grammar, character development and even why you have paragraphs that are as short as one sentence, and sometimes even one word.<br /><br />King even goes as far as to show us an unedited copy from one of his stories (1408) and the changes made to it.  You'll see that even King makes a lot of errors and that he's only human.<br /><br />Will this book make you a better writer? The answer is simply that it can.  It won't \\"make\\" you a better writer unless you WANT to be a better writer.  If you \\"want\\" to be a better writer but you're not willing to take tips outlined in this book or any other book, then you obviously don't care to be a better writer.<br /><br />Now then.  A lot of people think this book is nothing more than an ego trip.  This isn't entirely true, but it isn't too far off.  A lot of people say these tips are useless and couldn't possibly be of any use.<br /><br />To those readers I ask this.  Are YOU a published author?  Are YOU the world's best-selling novelist?  Are people standing in lines and rushing off to read YOUR books and stories? And most importantly, are you a SUCCESSFUL writer, doing what you love? If the answer to these questions is \\"no\\" then you've no right to say these tips aren't helpful.  Maybe you should actually try them before you jump to conclusions.<br /><br />After the writing King talks about his accident in the summer of 1999.  This is perhaps my only problem with the book.  It was great to hear insight on the accident and all, but the book (throughout the memoir and the craft) talks about the van several times!  It's almost redundant how often he mentions he was struck by a van in the summer 1999 when on a walk in Maine.<br /><br />I was also saddened that throughout the entire Memoir and craft he never mentions a thing about \\"The Dark Tower\\" series.  This is often said to be one of his greatest achievements as an author but he never once mentions The Dark Tower books.  He mentions \\"The Stand\\" (often said to be his greatest work).  Not only did he neglect the Dark Tower series, but he also never touches base with writing as Richard Bachman.  In the memoir it would've been nice if he had been able to tell us a few things such as what really inspired the Dark Tower books or even why he wrote under the name Richard Bachman for a few years.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a worthwhile read.  Any die-hard fan of Stephen King owes it to himself/herself to pick up this book and read it.Dark Tower books or even why he wrote under the name Richard Bachman for a few years.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a worthwhile read.

B0002XDODU|4.0|I never thought Rammstein would ever put out a new album but they finally did with \\"Reise Reise\\". I remember seeing the music video for \\"Du Hast\\" back in '95 and was immediately hooked on Rammstein's fiery brand of industrial/metal. Although I don't undertand a lick of German, it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the band's music. I finally got around to buying \\"Reise Reise\\". It took me a few listens for the music to slowly sink into my head. The more I listened to \\"Reise Reise\\", the more I grew to love it. The album is definitely a far cry from the band's first three albums. I have noticed that the general sound on the album is more rock-orientated than their usual brand of industrial/metal sound. One of the most unsual songs on the album is \\"Los\\" which there is no electric guitars but only acoustic guitar in place of the electric guitars. The song has a different vibe that I had never heard from the band's other albums but the song totally rocks. I had already heard \\"Mein Teil\\" from the \\"Resident Evil 2: Apopcalypse\\" soundtrack. It is your traditional Rammstein. My favorite songs though has to be \\"Dalai Lama\\", \\"Keine Lust\\", and \\"Amerika\\". I love the hooky chorus of \\"Amerika\\" which is sung in english. Very infectious yet it really speaks volumes about America and its free trade policies. All it takes is the chorus to figure out the band is singing about globalization and how America is 'americanizing' the entire planet. \\"Keine Lust\\" and \\"Dalai Lama\\" is two of the heaviest songs on the entire album. I absolutely cranking up the stereo to those songs. Initially I wasn't wild about the album but the more I listen to it, the better \\"Reise Reise\\" sounds. This is one of those albums that just needs time to grow on the listener like myself. \\"Reise Reise\\" may not be \\"Sehnsucht\\" or \\"Mutter\\" (my two favorite Rammstein albums) but the three year wait was worth hearing the music for.
B000002WU9|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best Wu solo albums of all time. The only other Wu solo that can compare to this is GZA's Liquid Swords. This is not the type of album you'd expect to be a classic. The production is very dark, there are intros to a lot of the songs, and Ghostface is on nearly every track, whether rapping or talking. However, I love the production on this album. It's the signature \\"Wu-Sound\\" (compliments of RZA), only with a mafioso twist. This mafioso feeling is furthered by Rae and Ghost's rapping about things they know. In some tracks, they even go into full-on storytelling mode (mostly Rae), similar to their duet on 36 Chambers, \\"Can It Be All So Simple\\". In fact, this album contains a remix to that song.    Most of the skits are attached to the songs themselves (another Wu trademark). In any case, the intros/skits are very relevent and further make you believe that Rae and Ghost really live this way. And my other point about Ghost being on a lot of the tracks was not a complaint at all. Ghost is very talented, and steals the show on more than one occasion.    The best tracks on the album, in my opinion, are \\"Knuckleheadz\\", \\"Guillotine (Swordz)\\", the previously mentioned remix to \\"Can It Be All So Simple\\", \\"Glaciers Of Ice\\", \\"Verbal Intercourse\\", \\"Ice Cream\\", and \\"Wu-Gambinos\\". I think \\"Guillotine\\" is probably my favorite track on the album. The beat will sound familiar to fans of Method Man's Tical because snippets of it have been used all over that album. Well, it's one of the best Wu beats the RZA has ever made, in my opinion. Inspectah Deck starts off with a very cool intro (\\"Poisonous!\\") and tears it up. Then, we get some blazing verses from Ghost and Rae, who bring more of their storytelling/braggadocio combination. But then GZA the Genius comes out of NOWHERE and destroys the track. He uses a deeper voice than usual on this track, and the transition from Rae's slightly higher-pitched voice is eerie.    \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" is the definition of dopeness. The track starts off with none other than NY street poet Nas. Nas spits a ridiculous (that's a good thing) verse, followed by two dope verses by Rae and Ghost. Rae and Ghost come correct as usual, but their verses pale in comparison to the one from Nasty Nas. Keep in mind that this was 1995, a year after Illmatic and a year before It Was Written. So if you want to blame somebody for the \\"Nas Escobar\\" persona, Raekwon is your man. It even says \\"featuring Nas AKA Nas Escobar\\" on the back of the CD. This was the first guest appearance on a Wu album by an artist not in the Wu-Family. DOPE track.    \\"Wu-Gambinos\\" is another one of my favorites. It's a Wu posse cut with Rae, Ghost, Method Man, the RZA, and the often silent Masta Killa. They basically showcase their \\"Wu-Gambino\\" mafioso alter egos here. Great beat, great lyrics, great lyricists, great subject matter, great everything. Listen to this song if you haven't already.    All in all, this album is a must-have for any fan of the Wu, mafioso-style rap, or hip-hop head in general. If you have been thinking about buying this album, I would highly recommend it.
0679735909|4.0|This book is very hard to rate because, although I found it tedious reading, I also recognize its literary merits.  It is, as another reviewer said, a book for intellectuals.  It is filled with poetry and difficult, convoluted sentences, yet the premise of the book is an interesting one.  Two researchers of Victorian poets, Roland and Maud, discover some letters which indicate a previously unknown affair between the two authors which they are researching.  Through painstaking investigation, they begin to slowly uncover the mysterious relationship, so long hidden, between the two authors.  Eventually the news of their discoveries leaks out and they are forced to protect their interests in the letters they have found.  This is a multi-layered book with romantic themes running throughout.  It is not a book I can say that I enjoyed reading, but it is interesting and complex.
B00006879E|5.0|I knew when I saw \\"This Love\\" earlier this year in January on VH1 this group was going to be big.I love this CD.They have a very excellent mixture of funk and rock.Kinda on the verge of a modern Hall and Oates if you will.I will say my other fav songs are \\"Sunday Morning\\" very Stevie Wonder influenced.I also enjoy \\"Not Coming Home\\" and \\"The Sun\\". <br />Nope these guys are not an all boy band that would be silly to say as they are great musicians and since they are up for a Grammy I would say the rest speaks for itself,they are a real rejuvenated sound that I'm sure to enjoy hopefully for a very long time.
B0000C1733|5.0|All of the songs on this CD are great, I have listened to it over a million times and never get tired of it.  Any RHCP fan needs to have this CD in their collection, the songs on this CD are defiently some of their best. <br /> <br />  My personal favorite on this CD is Road Trippin'.  It has such a beautiful sound to it, it will always be one of my fave songs.  The only two songs on the CD that I don't really like are Suck My Kiss and By the Way because I do not really like the rap-type-thing. <br /> <br />  Everyone should have this CD, whether they are a fan or not of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. <br /> <br />
B00062J00S|5.0|Everyone has their films that they must watch during certain holidays.  For some reason, at my house we always watched \\"Uncle Buck\\" on Labour Day weekend.  Likewise, Roger Ebert apparently watches \\"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\\" every Thanksgiving.  My wife likes to watch \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" on New Year's Day.  But Christmas is the time most saturated with films that the season wouldn't be the same without.  \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" and some version of \\"The Grinch\\" are holiday necessities for many people.  My personal favourite of all these films is Frank Capra's \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" <br /> <br />Because the airwaves are saturated with it (because the copyright was not renewed when it expired in the '70's) it's easy to flip by and watch bits until a commercial comes on.  People who have only seen the film this way are missing the joy of the film - it is a finely-crafted vision of a town, the progress of years of the characters in that town, and the steady wearing down of one man's dreams until one Christmas Eve he decides to take his own life.  What he hasn't noticed is all the good he done, and he's momentarily forgotten how much he is loved - by his extended family, by the people in the town touched by his basic goodness.  He is not a Scrooge or Grinch remarkably transformed by the meaning of Christmas, but a good man worn down and worn out that is then rejuvenated by the Spirit of Christmas. <br /> <br />Capra and Jimmy Stewart evoke such a sense of place and timing that you can't help by be immersed in the story.  The extended cast weaves in and out of the story, without intruding on the primary narrative.  It's suitable for all ages - in 1947, the MPAA didn't allow anything questionable through - but I suspect that younger viewers will grow bored since the film is mostly dialogue and \\"grown-up\\" events. <br /> <br />This DVD edition looks very good.  The sound is okay, but as usual, the visuals were cleaned up much more than the sound.  There are a couple short (20 minutes) making-of featurettes, one of which is the same as on the VHS edition that came out many years ago (with Tom Bosley as host).  But the main reason to buy the DVD is so you don't have to sit through the ads and suffer the cuts television stations make to cut down the running time.  This film deserves much better than that!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie does exactly what I think it was meant to do: shock the people with how Jesus was betrayed, tortured, crucified. It comes straight from the Bible. I didn't recognize any added sensation or fiction. This is how it must have been. Too cruel? Does anybody believe that what Jesus had to go through for us was anything better than what is being shown here?
B00005JMUA|4.0|If Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a samurai movie, then Vol II is a spaghetti western.  To recap - The Bride has polished off Vernita Green and Oh-ren Ishi (and her bodyguards) in what was essentially a wall-to-wall action fest of Kung-fu and swordplay.  Having done in two of the group that massacred her bridal party, The Bride sets her sites on the remaining three perpetrators - Elle, Bud, and the boss of the group, Bill. <br /> <br />Anyone who has seen the ads of the film know that Elle and The Bride have their battle in a mobile home in the desert.  In fact, most of the action of the film takes place in and around this trailer, as it happens to be owned by Bud, who also meets his fate there.  The Elle/Bride battle is, in fact, the only large-scale fight scene in the film.  The pace is much slower with significantly more dialogue than Vol. 1. This is to my liking - Tarantino shines his brightest when his characters are serving up their versions of philosophy.  Especially brilliant is Bill's exposition on the difference between Spider-man and Superman, as pertains to their secret identities. <br /> <br />Much is answered in this film - how Elle lost her eye, how the Bride became such an efficient killing machine (and why she fled Bill's group), and we even learn the Bride's real name.  Other things are never explained - why everyone hates Bill so much, for example.  There are few surprises - the audience is likely to be ahead of the plot.  However, such is Tarantino's editing technique and dialogue pacing that the plot is never important - it's not about what happens so much as how it happens.  And there are a couple genuine surprises that are all the more effective after thinking you have everything figured out. <br /> <br />This is a fine movie, and a worthy second part (not sequel) to the first.  Although my favourite individual scene (the escape from the hospital) is in Vol. 1, there is more in Vol. 2 that is memorable, because it's more dialogue driven.  I wonder if Tarantino plans to recut the films and mix up the scenes in some future special edition version? <br /> <br />On that note, I will repeat the warnings of some others - don't bother buying this DVD.  Mirimax is notorious for their crappy first-release DVD's, and both Vol. 1 and 2 have no worthwhile extras (although a cut scene of a fight between Bill and an unidentified assailant is mildly interesting).  Since the films work as a whole, wait until the special edition set comes out.  I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I remember like it was yesterday.  I believe I was drinking a glass of water at the time.  I turned the corner in my local Walmart and to my horror thought I saw a serpentine creature eating a child on the cover of a bright pink CD.  My horror soon turned to joy when I realized it was the exotic, beautiful and intellectually-challenging lyricist Celine Dion with her tender little baby on the cover of a new CD!  My heart lept.  I lunged for the last copy, overturning a few carts and knocking down a Contemporary Christian Bible display.  Holding it in my hands, I caressed it, \\"My Preccccious.\\"<br /><br />And when I got to my car, tore off the seven layers of security wrapping on the CD, and tenderly fed the CD to my car's CD player, I heard the most beautiful music I'd ever heard in my entire lifetime.  As if the angels in the highest of heavens were singing for only me!  And then, gentle reader, I wept.  I wept openly for all to hear in the parking lot of that WalMart.<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone buy at least three copies of this CD (work, home, car).  However, I took off one star for the fact that this one didn't contain any Chrysler advertisements or endorsements.
B0002EXH40|5.0|Do enough research and you'll find that metal fans seem to be divided in their opinions of Megadeth's sixth album, Youthanasia. Dig a little deeper and you'll also find that that's kind of understandable. <br /> <br />In 1994, Megadeth were riding a wave of unbelievable success coming from 1990s' Rust in Peace and '92s' Countdown to Extinction, (both absolutely groundbreaking works in their own right). While Youthanasia may have lacked the outright unapologetic aggression of previous recordings such as Hangar 18, The Conjuring, and Holy Wars, it achieved something that previous recordings had not... it signaled the new age of Megadeth. An age of mature and thoughtful songwriting served beneath a heavy layer of utterly brilliant musicianship. Mustaine's words are second only to the masterful guitar work of Marty Friedman.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Rust in Peace showed the world that Megadeth was a serious threat to the more commercial metal contemporaries of the era like Metallica. Countdown to Extinction finally dug the grave and Youthanasia sung the death knell. Dave Mustaine and crew are peerless... true metal pioneers who have paved the way for endless imitators and haters alike. All the while Megadeth have stayed true to their vision and in the process crafted wickedly haunting and powerful works of pioneering metal. Youthanasia is the dawn of a new age and a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
B000050HTO|4.0|Bob Dylan did quite a bit for songwriting.  He's been praised by such illustrious peers as Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson.  His songs, such as \\"The Times They Are A-Changin\\" and \\"Blowing in the Wind,\\" have become cliches--a status every songwriter wants to reach.  Fans and nonfans alike admit to his astonishing musical impact.<br /><br />Though Dylan made a name for himself with politically-charged daggers aimed at the government, it is on the second of these two discs, when he begins in earnest to explore relationships and sensuality, that he reaches his peak.  His songs ring with an honesty found in few artists.  Not saying there aren't flaws; sometimes, he tries to hard to get a point across; on others, his allusions and rhymes seemed forced.  But at his best, Dylan is a poet.  And that's quite an acheivement.<br /><br />When compared with the \\"perfect\\" vocalists of today's music, Dylan's flawed, nasally vocals are a welcome reprieve.  This two-disc retrospective may not be complete, but it is pretty darn good for the price.  I reccommend it for anyone who wants to get to know this guy's body of work without paying too much.  If you become a fan (and you probably will), you can go out and buy a better collection.  For starters, though, this is the place to go.
B00005NP04|5.0|there's a huge difference between martina mcbride and the rest of country's female artists(not that i have a problem with them) but the real difference is MARTINA POURS HER SOUL INTO THE SONG SO WELL..alot of the issues she chooses to sing about really are the issues of the world. The song that stands out the most is INDEPENDENCE DAY.such a sad song but beautiful lyrics and it really does touch your heart. Her older hits are magnificent and really are tad mix of country a lil hint of pop(if you will) and it really works for her. This is a cd almost every person should own ITLL SPEAK TO YOU.i luv the new material my favorite song is WHERE WOULD YOU BE its such a beautiful ballad that has martina's voice so strong and with the instruments it just flows THIS SONG SHOULD GET TO U. All the new songs stand out and well do they stand out. The best one is BLESSED. its just so beautiful and really that song must be autobiographical in many ways for her. WHEN GOD FEARIN' WOMEN GET THE BLUES my god it was a huge hit for her. she chooses her music well.The last song i mention from the new ones is CONCRETE ANGEL when u hear it, itll tear u to pieces is how sad the song is.Shes an artist who doesn't ignore the issues of today and the past. GIVE THIS ALBUM A SHOT ULL LOVE IT AND Ull LEARN SOMETHIN NEW..GUARANTEED
B000003S09|1.0|King Crimson are just plain rubbish.  Does the Judge understand what rock and roll is all about?  Listen to what he he telling you to listen to-the Velvet Underground.  They are rock and roll, they define rock and roll, they are all that is great about rock and roll.  King Crimson [...].  To like then is to admit you don't like rock and roll, or music for that matter.  If you have to ask what rock and roll is you'll never understand it - the fact you are defending this [...] band proves it!!!!!!
0060516402|5.0|Years ago, my boss, hiring many of as refugees from another company, opened the doors on his own business. The first thing I remember his doing was giving me a copy of this book so that I would know how he wanted to approach management. <br /> <br />I have since moved on to become a college English instructor, so some might wonder what I was doing in what was, effectively, a management role. What this book illustrates, however, is that managers don't make companies work, worker-centered policies do. <br /> <br />Now, years on, that company has become part of something much larger and quite successful. Nonetheless, I still apply many of the ideas expressed in this book in the way I interact with my students.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|\\"Collateral\\" isn't just one of the best thrillers of the year, it's one of the best American movies of the year. Admittedly, 2004 has been a fairly weak one for exceptional films, but \\"Collateral' could hold it's own in any recent year. It becomes more than a little implausible towards the end, but, as in a lot of great movies, you don't really think about this until after long after the final credits have rolled.  <br /> <br />\\"Collateral\\" reaffirms my belief that a great action film isn't just about great action, it's also about great characters, which comes from great screenwriting and great acting. \\"Collateral\\" takes the time to define the main characters, Vincent [Tom Cruise] and Max [Jamie Foxx], and allows the actors to actually act.  <br /> <br />Max is a Los Angeles cab driver. He has conned himself into believing that, even though he's been a taxi driver for twelve years, some day soon he'll realize his dream of operating a limo service in some island paradise. One night he picks up a fare, Vincent, who offers him $600 to drive him to five stops over the course of the night. What Max doesn't know is that Vincent is a contract killer. The five stops are to eliminate five witness from a gang-related Federal trial. In a perfect world, Max might have been none the wiser. Vincent would have gotten out of the cab and quietly done his business. As luck would have it, though, the first victim falls out of a third story window and lands right on the unsuspecting Max's waiting cab. The rest of the night turns into chaos.  <br /> <br />Between each `hit'. Vincent and Max get to know each other a little better, and the audience gets to know the characters better, thus allowing a greater involvement in this deadly cat and mouse game.  <br /> <br />In a way, \\"Collateral\\" is an `homage' to the great Alfred Hitchcock, whose persistent theme was that of an innocent man's being caught up in a web woven by a villain. Director Michael Mann, though, takes the genre and createssomething uniquely his own - a masterful thriller in its own right.  <br />
B00006HAZG|4.0|The movie was overall pretty good. The story in the movie stayed close to the book, with the exception that several characters such as Dr. Strong, Thomas Traddle were eleminated from teh story. Which I thought was a bit odd, because these characters were great to the story. It is argued that David Copperfield himself is rather a dull character with no strong personality and that what makes Dicken's book wonderful are the David's surrounding characters. This argument was well presented in the movie because the actor who played adult David Copperfield had a relatively dull camera time than rest of the roles. He didn't seem to have much freedom to express any of his emotions in front of the camera. My favorite character is David's aunt Betsy Trotwood, both in the book and in the movie. The actress was very good.  <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to everyone who likes the book.  <br /> <br />Purple_Garden <br />
B00005JGAB|5.0|1976 was a watershed year in rock & roll history. It divided everything into pre- and post-Ramones eras.    Really, can you even begin to try to imagine the existence of The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Rezillos, Dead Kennedys, Buzzcocks and Minor Threat sans Ramones?  Unthinkable!    Can you imagine later punk bands without the influence of Joey's warbling voice and Johnny's fuzzbox guitar strumming in cut-time gone haywire?    Strangely, the Ramones never sold out, because they understood intuitively that what rock was about was reaching as many ears as possible. Yet, they never really caught on in the AT40 sense the way bands like The Clash did. The Ramones pined for fame and fortune, whereas it became the kiss of death for these other bands to be thought of as \\"mainstream.\\" That was the biggest hypocrisy of punk: Once it became a \\"movement,\\" too many poseurs became keepers of an elitist, exclusive flame. The Ramones, than God, never fell prey to this childish idiocy.    The first four songs on this album: \\"Blitzkrieg Bop,\\" \\"Beat On the Brat,\\" \\"Judy Is a Punk,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.\\"  Wow! Elvis and the Beatles should've been so lucky for a playlist that hot!    \\"Chainsaw\\": This is officially the first Ramones song in which Joey butchers the English language to get the rhyme:    Texas chain saw massacree  They took my baby away from me    Ha ha!    \\"Havana Affair\\" and \\"52rd & 3rd\\" are the catchiest tunes on this record. \\"Havana\\" catches the flavor of surfer songs, though it places them in Banana Republics with JFK on a PT boat and 53rd unequivocally ties the band to their streets of New York City roots. They're in the same league as Dion with this one about Dee Dee's addictive behavior, and the street corner at which he could get it sreviced.    The Ramones also offer lots of advice on the priorities of life, long before Deepak Chopra and Anthony Robbins:    \\"I *Don't* Wanna Go Down to the Basement,\\" \\"I *Don't* Care\\" and \\"I *Don't* Wanna Walk Around with You,\\" BUT....  \\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\\"!!!! Thank God the PMRC wouldn't be around for another 12 years. That song was an anthem for many of us whose interest in model airplanes expanded into getting high on Testor's airplane glue when we hit 12 or 13.    \\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World\\": Some credit this song as the beginning of Nazi punk rock, but I think they're missing the shtick between the lines:    I'm a shock trooper in a stupor  Yes I am.  I'm a Nazi Schatze  Y'know I fight for Fatherland    Besides, I really doubt Joey (who sung it) was a Nazi; Joey's real name was Jeffrey Hyman -- Jawohl, he was a Jew.    Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny: May God bless your souls. Tommy: May you live long and prosper.
B000002IGV|5.0|I loved this album when it came out. In fact, I still have the vinyl LP, not a CD (this was years before I had a CD player). I can only say that Dee Snider & Co. deserve a place of honor alongside other '80s metal gods like Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses and Metallica; they really did \\"Stay Hungry\\".
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears' fourth album \\"In the Zone\\" propels this sterling  prodigy into the forefront of the musical world with songs that bear the stamp of a matured voice, compositions that rival Bach, Mozart and Duke Ellington and the performers' adherence to line -- without sacrificing supple phrasing -- that would have the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski or Count Basie drooling. <br /> <br />\\"Me Against the Music\\" (featuring Madonna) is simply a treasure to behold. It made me ask myself why I wasted all my money on Maria Callas and Charlotte Church albums, when I could have heard these far superior vocalists. Britney hits notes in the coloratura range that Elizabeth Schwarzkopf and Kirsten Flagstad could only dream of! <br /> <br />\\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" (featuring Ying Yang Twins) borrows complex harmonic phrasing from Stravinsky's \\"Le Sacre du Printemps\\" and reveals Britney's uncanny ability to stay on the downbeat, as she effortlessly glides from 12/8 to 3/4 to 5/4 to 6/8 tempo. <br /> <br />\\"Showdown,\\" Britney's musical tribute to Italian composer Ennio Moricone, is full of operatic bravura and pathos. Forget about \\"I Pagliacci,\\" Britney's in the house! <br /> <br />\\"Toxic\\" is Britney's foray into social commentary, set to Philip Glass's minimalist strains, a dirge lamenting Vietnam War soldiers' plight, suffering the ravages of Agent Orange. <br /> <br />\\"Brave New Girl,\\" set to a jazz rondo based on tracks by Miles Davis, Earl Klugh and Gene Ammons is an eclectic tune that mixes clips from the great masters of jazz to Britney's breathy alto, which makes Diana Krall sound like a Joanie-one-note amateur. <br /> <br />If you want to hear the sound of a great musical genius maturing before your very ears, you cannot go wrong by staying \\"In the Zone.\\"
B00005JN0T|3.0|This was a big disappointment, and easily the worst movie I've seen Smith in.  Smith is so bad, that you have to wonder if acting with computer generated robots was a factor -- but that shouldn't be it, since he's been in a number of films with loads of special effects, and done pretty well for himself. Smith's performance is off, in the sense that he always seems distracted or even bored. It's like he's always cutting a look toward a mirror -- yep, pecs look good. On the good side of things are the robots. Their faces are remarkable in their ability to convey emotion. The trailers for the film don't do them justice. The plot is kind of muddled, but there are a couple of standout action scenes, in particular the chase in the tunnel, that help to raise this movie into the should-see category. But a few good scenes do not make a good movie. Probably the most over-hyped movie of the last year.  Note: Will, take an acting class.
0140074317|4.0|Until recently, I was blissfully ignorant that the popular movie I had seen several times (in my younger days) was actually based on a book.<br /><br />Judging from the cover illustration of Bastian Balthazar Bux doing his \\"King of the World\\" thing aboard the Luck Dragon, you get the feeling that this is no ordinary fantasy book, and indeed it isn't.<br /><br />I did get the feeling that some aspects of the story were lost in translation (which is another story altogether), as it has some abrupt swings in tone, the dialogue sometimes seeming clumsy and childish compared to the rest of the book - but that's nitpicking.<br /><br />This is truly a Neverending Story, most of which springs from the imagination of the unlikely human hero, the aforementioned Master Bux, who steals the titular tome, and flees with it to the safety of his school attic, where he becomes much more than a casual onlooker of the worlds of Fantastica.<br /><br />Michael Ende's imagination works overtime in creating Fantastica and all its inhabitants, and for each thrilling chapter, he introduces another story to be told at another time.<br /><br />The main story however, is the metamorphosis of Bastian Bux from a frightened, insecure child, and the new relationship he was able to forge with his father after his great learning adventure.<br /><br />Be wary in your reading of the adventures of The Childlike Empress, Atreyu, Morla, Ygramul, Falkor, Grograman, Hero Hynreck and Xayide, among others, beware the Nothing, and be careful what you wish for, least you also become a part of the Neverending Story, and forever lose your memories of this life.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 19, 2004
B00064AM6C|5.0|Great. You can really feel the energy. A must for anybody interested in music
B00003CXRM|5.0|O brother, where art thou? is definitely one of my all-time favorites.  I watched this movie for the first time after reading the Odyssey.  To truly appreciate the movie, you must read the book from whence its plot comes.  The movie is very intelligent and fast-paced, with Clooney playing the smart-mouthed main character, Ulysses (aka Odyseus in the book the odyssey) Everett McGill. Highly recommended!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I recently had the privilage of catching Sarah live and although I'd heard her previous albums dozens of times, I gave her latest effort a few more listens and was greatly impressed.  The lyrics and musicality are a lot more mature and not what you'd expect from Sarah - however her effortless vocals and soothing, beautiful vocals are still in full force here.  Its amazing how she is able to channel power in her voice without being irritating. <br /> <br />The most recognizable songs thus far are the melodic \\"Fallen\\", the operatic \\"Stupid\\" and \\"World on Fire\\", which is similar to some of her older tracks. <br /> <br />One of my fave songs on this disc are \\"Drifting\\", a peaceful track with great harmonies during the chorus that reminds me of the maritimes in Canada.  Another great song is \\"Push\\", a track Sarah wrote for her husband as a thank you for putting up with her during some of her moodier times, although the \\"Doo-doo-dah's\\" in the backgrounda reminicisent of the Dawson's Creek theme, \\"I Don't Want To Wait\\".  \\"Perfect Girl\\"  Has some really neat effects-driven harmonies in a sorta echoey tone as well, and Sarah's voice really shines here. <br /> <br />Although not all of the songs are showstopping singles like on some of her previous albums, this cd will satisfy fans of Sarah - new and old - with graceful vocals, thoughtful lyrics, and soaring melodies.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I know I'm basically repeating what most of the other reviewers have already said about this film, but it is fantastic.  Well-written, great cast, great characters, suspensful, action-packed -- how many more cliches can I throw at this thing? <br /> <br />Ripley returns, with a group of marines, to the planet where the Alien was first encountered in the previous film.  This is one of those rare sequels that surpases the original.  Highly, highly recommended.  The DVD also includes the extended director's cut (which surpases the theatrical cut), and tons of goodies, including a commentary track with the cast and crew.  It's an entertaining track, but writer/director James Cameron comes off as arrogant a bit.  But arrogant or not, it's a great film, one of my all-time favorites, and for that, I'm thankful.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|My first impression of Daredevil in the theater was that of a confused, poorly edited yet energetic and moody look at the Daredevil character. I didn't like it much but I have liked the character since I was a kid and enjoyed enough of it to avoid  seeing the whole experience in a poor light.<br /><br />The director's cut of the film fixed a good 50% of the problems I had with the theatrical release. There is around 30 minutes of extra footage involving a subplot that showcases the character of Matt Murdock. This cut also retells the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil and makes it a lot more involving and a lot less gratuitous. The action scenes are extended and more violent and there are even a few more snipets of things you may have missed in the theatrical cut as a fan of the character (like Matt's mom).<br /><br />I still won't give it a perfect score as the scenes that didn't work for me still don't but the director's cut moves the film from an average yet faulty attempt to a legitimate vision of the character.
B0000VD04M|5.0|When this film was released theatrically, a friend and I went to see it because the television ads made it look like a funny film.  And while it does have it's funny moments, this isn't really a comedy, and it was nothing like we expected it to be.  I'm not sure what my friend thought of the film, but I loved it.  It tells the true story (with at least one exception) of Ed Wood -- a writer/director/producer/actor -- of what are widely regarded as some of Hollywood's worst films.  But he comes across as an endearing character due to his enthusiasm and likable persona. <br /> <br />This is a great film, especially for Halloween (due to Wood's monster/alien themes).  Oh, and the exception mentioned above: in real life, Ed Wood did not meet Orson Welles.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Show has fantastic writing, great character developement and superb acting. I'm a sucker for urban crime drama and this show is as true to its subject matter as it can get. some may say that it would gain a lot as an HBO vehicle but it rides the line without being gratuitous and keeps integrity in the storytelling. The show doesn't play out like it has compromised anything.<br /><br />The first 2 seasons are a lot stronger than the 3rd (but what show doesn't follow this pattern). Regardless, i'll be buying the 3rd when it comes out in February. WAtch 3 episodes and you'll be hooked.
B000005QH3|5.0|If you are a MoPar Maniac like I am then the story line is meaningless. The fact that there is a Challenger R/T Big Block tearing up the road is all that matters. Otherwise the movies OK.
B00005JLFC|4.0|Not the most logical film in the world, and rather strange seeing Babs as a boy. (But how many times have we seen boys as Babs?) This musical drama's biggest feature is the beautiful music in its soundtrack and the love that Ms. Streisand had for this project.  Lushly filmed by the diva herself, this film features excellent camera work and powerful emotion.  Now after saying that lets get the DVD out already.  My tape is getting worn and I would love to hear all the songs in 5.1 sound.  Babs, no disrespect or anything but what ever the problem is WORK IT OUT!!!!  Your fans are very loyal and very patient, but lets face it ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.  Barbra can you hear me?  Can you understand me?  Lets not be frightened of the DVD.  Embrace the DVD.  He is your friend, and lets face it, would be a best seller now wouldn't it?
B00028HBKC|5.0|The Passion thrilled me to the core when I saw it. Mel Gibson is a hero for his unflenching vision of Jesus. I sat through the whole movie with my plug and just thought of brave strong Mel. You should get the plug I reviewed and use it when you watch this movie too - as Jesus's pain limits are being pushed to the limits, so will yours and it's an amazing way for you to show your love for Christ as well as experience what it feels like to save humanity. See my other reviews to see what I mean. Get this movie! It'll change your life.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This 40th anniversary edition of \\"Mary Poppins\\" is absolutely fabulous.  The picture quality and new soundtrack in 5.1 is stunning.  A far better picture/sound than in the previous two issues.  I even watched disc 2, and I never watch the second disc.  It features one deleted song, and it was rather charming.  Other features include jumping to a song, or just watching all the songs with optional subtitles.  This is a great feature if you are trying to teach your kids those wonderful, loving songs.  This is one of the best discs Disney has ever put out, and its about time that \\"Mary Poppins\\" gets the same treatment as any other \\"Vault Classic.\\"
B00005JN0T|4.0|I found Will Smith's acting to be a little overdone but other than that, this is a good action film.  Smith's tough guy swagger reminded me of John Travolta's walk in Saturday Night Fever.  It was totally out of place but I should note that he is still growing as an film artist and developing his talents.  This is a CGI driven film and those effects do not fail to please.      Smith's role is one of a homocide detective that hates robots.  His job is to investigate a murder that he suspects has been committed by a robot.  Robots are programmed with the 3 laws (see the film) so it's inconceivable to folks that a robot could have committed murder.     It's a nice murder mystery type of film with a twist.  The usual warnings about robots apply.The special effects are great.    Parental advisory:  There is a small bit of nudity but no sexual situations.  There is a small amount of foul language and plenty of violence.  I suggest a viewing age of at least 13.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Forget \\"Scarface.\\"  FOrget \\"Traffic.\\"  This is the drug movie of choice.  A real story without resorting to fake accents, chainsaws, or a scrambling camera.  Depp shines in this movie.  Cruz is mere window dressing, but still was effective in her role.  The big suprise here is Paul Ruebens.  See this movie and you will forget all about Pee Wee Herman.  Great performances all around, great musical score, and a moral lesson at the end that didn't involve chainsaws, bloodshed or retribution.  Excellent casting and a great time at the movies.
B000002JKA|5.0|Originally released in October 1994, I picked this album up because I was fed up with how the grunge scene had taken over the days of 80's Metal bands. Awake not only proved to be a much needed breath of fresh air, but it was also the first Dream Theater record I ever bought and made me genuinely more interested in Progressive Metal which they so successfully pioneered in the early 90's. Dream Theater paved the way for hundreds of other bands -- and they did it when the Prog Metal genre was no where near popular as it is today! -- and Awake is without doubt one of their most amazing, profound and timeless masterpieces ever.<br /><br />The album clocks in at exactly 75 minutes featuring a total of eleven tracks all of which add to the unity and cohesiveness of this ageless record. There are certain recurring themes to be found here, on separate tracks, which serve the purpose of giving Awake its ultimate character. Be it the keyboard melody in \\"The Mirror\\" (depicting Mike Portnoy's bold fight with his alcohol problems) played in a lush manner by Kevin Moore during the mid-section; the main riff introduced after the frenzied guitar work on the instrumental track \\"Erotomania\\"; or the album-closer \\"Space-Dye Vest\\", this recurring theme eerily glues the whole album together even though it's not a concept album per se. That said, Awake is a dark, dangerously heavy, and musically complex creation which, unlike the band's other two magnum opuses, I&W and SFAM, to this day, remains unrivaled and perfect.<br /><br />I am literally struggling as I try to do justice to this record reviewing it after having listened to it for ten long years. That is because Awake works on a variety of levels; lyrically, musically and even production-wise. Each song on this CD relates to a (dark) feeling and internal conflict and therefore guides us through each member's inner world (even John Myung wrote the lyrics for a song) as we pay attention to the lyrics. Kevin Moore wrote words for the album opener \\"6:00\\", \\"Lie\\" and \\"Space-Dye Vest\\". His lyrics are introspective in nature and challenging to sing as they demand different vocal harmonies. Petrucci's lyrical work is more abstract yet eerily easy to identify with: he explores religious conflicts along side personal problems, while Mike Portnoy proves to be a stunning lyricist leaving plenty of room for vocalist James Labrie to thoroughly shine through, especially in the chorus of \\"The Mirror\\". The absence of mainstream elements and the band refusing to compromise on any level further strenghten this piece elevating it even higher.<br /><br />The whole record has a lucid layer of atmosphere around it built by none other than Kevin Moore whose opaque minimalism delicately blankets each song as the rest of the band members seamlessly blend their musical instrumentation. Moore's contribution to Awake is immense! His songwriting is creepy, bordering on uncomfortable. His agile melodies never cease to hop in and out of the focus of each track. After listening to Awake, I can see why he left the band to pursue his solo project Chroma Key. I think Chroma Key is amazing, as unique as anything else he's touched, but Awake and his work on Fates Warning's A Pleasant Shade of Gray are in my opinion his most amazing works ever. James Labrie sings incredibly well; he is articulate, deep and powerful in the truest sense of the word. Be it the aggressive singing on \\"Lie\\", the catchy chorus on \\"Caught in a Web\\" or the high scream on \\"Innocence Faded\\", he does a phenomenal job. John Myung perhaps plays his most mesmerizing bass lines and what's more is his tone is very subtle in the mix. He generates inherently intelligent musical ideas in each composition while always creating a nice wall of sound tapestry that complements John Petrucci's somewhat quirky guitar work (\\"Voices\\"), delicately surreal acoustics (\\"The Silent Man\\") or melody-strong instrumental (\\"Erotomania\\"). Petruicci's guitar work burns with passion and fire: just check out the tapping on \\"Lie\\" and the shuddering main riff on \\"Scarred\\". As Mike Portnoy does an awesome cymbal work, the song dissolves into a busy interplay where each member performs their parts brilliantly. The ballad \\"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream\\" juxtaposes light electronics with subtle bass and guitar work hidden under multi-layers of atmosphere. Awake is not my favourite Dream Theater record, but it's certainly their most unique, most expressive and most varied album. My highest recommendation.pping on \\"Lie\\" and the shuddering main riff on \\"Scarred\\".

B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle is an amazing cd. The cd starts of with a wonderful instrumental called ONE OF THESE DAYS. After the intense song it goes down to a softer song with A PILLOW OF WINDS. Then continues on with FEARLESS which is a good song. San Tropez is a nice relaxing song which sort of sounds like the beatles. Then the song which is the reason i couldn't give it 5 stars is SEAMUS the song was made as a joke but is very bad. A couple of lines of horrible lyrics with a dog howling. And finally the best of all the songs ECHOES. This 23 minute song is worth the price of the CD alone. This CD is highly recommended.
B00006JJ51|5.0|Say what you may about this album if you are over 26 years old and listen to hip hop you had this tape.Most of the group are still some of the most successfull and looked up to rappers in the bussiness today and this album is what put them on the map. If you dont like this album you dont like hardcore hiphop because this is were it all started.Better than most hardcore hiphop out today.
B000002GVO|5.0|Thanks for reading.  It's pretty hard to fault this album, even if you are not an Eagles fan, due to the sheer brilliance of the first three tracks, which have been oft played, and are extremely well known.  What I like about the album now, is the sheer brilliance of the last three tracks on the album.  The Eagles were definitley sounding ultra smooth, and they harmonise so well, no matter what combination of singers is in the line-up. This was the absolute height of their amazing career.  The title track is one of the all-time classic hits and a flawless hit record. What a great guitar solo. \\" New kid in town\\" also contains brilliant harmonies, with a wonderful melody.  \\" Life in the fast lane\\" is one of the best rock tracks of all time.  My only complaint ( really twisting my arm here ) is that \\" Victim of love \\" should have been the fourth track on the album, leaving the mellower stuff for later in the album.  Instead we get the ballad \\" Wasted Time\\" and then \\" Victim of Love\\" which is another rock track.  Just goes to show that nobody's perfect.  But what is perfect is the last three tracks on this album which I just love.  \\" Pretty Maids all in a row\\" is next. Had no idea this was Joe Walsh until I saw \\" Hell freezes over \\"  Not a huge Joe Walsh fan, but this is a brilliant track. Nice slow, mellow, haunting with great piano.  \\"Try and love again\\" is Randys last track as singer, and we all know he left the band after this. Pity, he had a beautiful voice, I loved his high singing. This is another briliant track.  Heavily country influenced.  \\" The last resort \\" is last. Possibly the best track ever by the Eagles, with Don Henley at his best. Spine tingling music, very emotional.  All in all, an all time classic album.  Words hardly do it justice.  Even non Eagles fans will admit it.  Get it for your music collection NOW if you don't have it!!

B00005JMEW|5.0|This is nothing new for Tarantino, but this movie was a pure joy to watch. It has all of his trademark dark humor and originality throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />Uma Thurman was wonderful as the nameless Bride and all of her counterparts were all equally great as people who 'deserved to get whacked.'<br /><br />The action scenes might be the main draw of this movie but the best part of it for me was the music. Each tune and song was catchy and fit the scene to perfection. Kudos go out to the RZA for putting together the sounds of this movie.<br /><br />And bravo to Quentin for making yet another enjoyable movie that breaks away from the typical Hollywood mold.
B00000JAXT|5.0|When I first got my used, abused, scratched wreck of an import LP copy in the 1970's, I could not escape from this dense 'beer coaster' sound fast enough. Seems it's true, this one do grow on you. It finds a crack in your brains, then the living experiments just slither in. I have been praying for this re-release for 20 years ever since.<br /><br />Here is a true sound scientist's sweeping, edging into-and-outa chaotic jubilation, and the roiling clouds of beyond all glory.<br /><br />I can understand utterly why listeners are all-go-or-no-show. What I don't get is how this disc remains one undiscovered masterpiece, absent on anyone's best-o'.<br /><br />It is true this disc is demanding-So much that I compare this creation to the imaginary, rarely-all-there Grateful Dead roadtrip-- or better, the ultimate source that is The Holy First Velvet Underground Disc.<br /><br />Wyatt's writing resides right alongside the 'literary experiment' of Lou Reed.

0385513755|4.0|Da Vinci Code proves to be a great story, cleverly written and quite a yarn. The Special Illustrated edition really advanced the story since the book shows prints of many of the arts, photos of buildings and  European locations as mentioned in the story. It really does helped to have the print of the Last Supper in front of you as the mystery unfold in the book. For many of us who never been Europe, such illustrations proves to be very helpful and I was more then happy to pay a little more if that enchane the story further.<br /><br />But after reading the book, I can understand why some of the people wrote negative reviews and picked at it. The main theme of the story would offend many who take their Christian faith very strongly and don't tolerate much lee way on the subject. Just look at that Martin Scorsese's film on Christ as a prime example of why this book got slam-dunked by many reviewers! If you are such a person who is dogmatic regarding your Christian faith, it may be that this book may not find your favor regardless of its fictional nature.<br /><br />The book combined elements of history, art and religion into the story. Some of the information are true, some are not and others stretch the fabic of truth and fiction for story's sakes. But the combination of all of the above is the primary reason why this book proves to be so entertaining, that the reader cannot tell fact from fiction, generating interest, debates and research among the readers.<br /><br />This book is a definite page-turner. Like it or not, you would feel compelled to read on, perhaps in pleasure, perhaps in anger but it will keep most readers glue to the end. While no great literature as some reviewers would write, its still a great story.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Radiohead sucks.  The lead singer looks like a retard with his head bobbing around.  Their music is boring too.  You can tell how bad a band is when they are worshipped by rock critics and pseudo intellectuals who think they are on \\"the cutting edge of rock music\\" just because they like Rdaiohead.  Stay away from Radiohead folks.  They are BORING.  BORING, BORING, BORING!!!  I can't stress that word enough.   <br /> <br />If you want to listen to something more entertaining than Radiohead, here's what to do: go turn on your TV.  Change it to a channel with nothing on it.  One of the channels with \\"snow\\" on it.  Just turn that up and listen to it.  Even that is more entertaining than this junk.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This was the first movie I saw in the collection of Bourne Movies, and I thought it was pretty good for a few reasons. One reason was that the movie was very ingeniously designed. Some factors of the film I enjoyed were when Bourne was shot by an enemy, then grabbed a bottle of alcohol during a chase through a grocery store and then later poured it on his wound to assist its healing. I also thought it was clever when Bourne stole a set of keys and then continually pressed on a button attached to them in a parking lot until he found the vehicle they went to. This movie was also good for its nonstop action, although a few scenes are literally impossible to follow because everything happens so fast that the screen is practically a blur. Besides the blurred action, the only even slightly negative factor is that you pretty much have to pay attention to every second of the movie or you might not understand a whole lot of stuff later into it. I would recommend this movie to all who enjoy action films and movies with engrossing plots.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Coming from a really big Simple Plan fan previous to this album, I was so disappointed when I heard this album.  This music is just a rehash of everything on the first CD, and all the songs on this current CD sound the same.  On every track they are still complaining about how people are trying to put them down, and no one knows how it feels to be them because their lives are so hard.  I just think that this is very lame considering that the band is rich and famous, and shouldn't be complaining about these same \\"highschool like\\" problems.  This music did nothing for me, and after listening to it once, I wanted to sell it to somebody else, or else leave it on the shelf to collect dust.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|After viewing this movie's trailer, I thought that I would despise this movie because it appeared too childish for my taste; yet I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed this film quite a lot. The movie is about a boy who has been raised as an elf in the North Pole but then must adapt to the ways of the modern world when he goes to live with his true family. One of the main things I liked about this movie was that it was very humorous, especially at moments where the elf discovers something new about the modern world and then reacts to it. The actors are also quite well-chosen, and the plot is pretty good in that there are no unnecessary occurrences that distract from the basic flow of the film. Negative things are primarily the corny sections of the movie (which are plentiful), but otherwise I would recommend Elf for its funny moments and its reasonable plot.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|My fifteen year old son insisted that I see this film with him.  He had already seen it three times.  He is obviously a very big fan.<br /><br />It can be safely said that \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is not a typical Hollywood production.  Rather it is a dead pan comedy that runs very much counter to what one might expect of an American film.<br /><br />Napoleon is a sixteen year old nerd attending high school in the back blocks of Idaho - beautiful scenery but relentlessly boring in terms of lifestyle.  He is picked on at school and clearly doesn't fit in.  His only friend is an alienated Mexican also trying to come to grips with mid west America.  However, together they ultimately succeed despite Napoleon also having to deal with his dysfunctional family.  He has a crazy thrill seeking grandmother, a loser geek brother and an uncle whose mind still dwells in 1982.  Yet, somehow, this bizarre mix is conquered.<br /><br />Despite protestations from my son, I'm unable to give this film more than three stars.  Perhaps it's me that doesn't fit in?  For a film that started out at art house cinemas it quickly went mainstream and with generally positive reviews.  See it to understand a world that many of us left behind many years ago.

B0006399FS|2.0|I am a die hard U2 fan and I have liked every album they have ever released with the exception of Pop. So I am not biased against Bono or U2. But I sadly have to admit this album is garbage compared to U2's previous work. There is not a single song on the album that is a quality U2 song. Even though I did not like Pop it had some great songs like Mofo/Please that were at least innovative, but this album has absolutely nothing worth mentioning. Vertigo is a direct rip off of their Boy album sound (but not as good as Boy) and every other song sounds like half finished works you might hear on a stolen U2 recording session. <br /> <br />The lyrics are uninspired and many are reuses from previous U2 songs. All in all it is a total disappointment especially since Bono was hyping this album as a master piece. Bono better start caring more about the U2 sound than his politics because if he keeps releasing this junk, all of his fans, who mostly only listen to him because of his music, won't be listening to him anymore.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I saw this one in the theater and it is BRILLIANT!<br /><br />It's presented as a comedic zombie romp (which it is), but it's also a story about a slacker rising from his self-imposed ennui to take control of his life.<br /><br />Highly recommended; this Santa is going to give it to himself!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!
B00013RC9I|5.0|This album is brilliant. <br />And if you do not see the brilliance in it then you are negating what french culture have had to offer to electronic music. <br /> <br />Surely some of you might not really comprehend this album but if you take a listen closely you will see that this is a wicked album.  <br /> <br /> <br />The whole concept of love in outer space, the chemistry of love and the incorporation of semi-classical music into their repertoir of music and all combining it with electronic music is just incredible. I am sorry if anyone can name me an album that incorporates pop, semi-classical all meanwhile making scientific references AND sounding as acessible as these guys are...please do so. Please recommend me an album that is as good as this one, because to be quite honest this is brilliant. If air sound like cheese to you then they make the best French cheese that France has to offer in terms of electronic music. But to me their sound in this album is mature compared to other albums, it is brilliant. It walks 10 steps forward from all other albums they had made previously. <br /> <br />I totally recommend it.  <br />songs that I specially love: <br />the transition between mike mills into surfing on a rocket is incredible.  <br />Mike mills alone is an incredible track. Amazing instrumental work. <br />The lyrics in Biological as well as the instrumental work is just phenomenal. Very subtle but very rewarding. This is one of my favourite tracks. <br /> <br />The closer alone in Koyto is just perfect. It captures a very subtle and beutiful moment somewhere out in the open, almost as if capturing a melancholic moment of deep thoughfulness and those piano stabs at the end are just amazing. <br /> <br />Also the frist track is a great romantic ballad. This is basically the next step of romantic ballads. Talking about love in outer space, the lyrics are great!. \\"you could be from venus, I could be from mars...\\" <br /> <br />Great cd! <br />
0061020680|5.0|When we mere male mortals reach a certain age we sometimes, aware that we are closer to our future death than our past birth, start to act up. We trade the 1981 Honda Civic in for a Corvette convertible, quit our old job to write a great novel, and have even been known to trade in our wives or significant others for a younger, newer model. It's known on Earth as a mid-life crisis.  But on Discworld, and in the hands of the master Terry Pratchett, a banal mid-life crisis is turned into another one of his hilarious and thought filled romps. Through Pratchett's hilariously skewed prism this crisis is not being experienced by a mortal but rather by the harbinger of death, the aptly named DEATH. What we have is a mid-death crisis. Death may, like an ever-rolling stream, bear all its sons away but DEATH seems more than a bit tired of doing all the bearing away. <br /> <br />Terry Pratchett's Mort tells a rather simple tale. DEATH is looking for an apprentice. Young Mortimer, one of life's simple trusting souls is a young man with little career prospects. He is ungainly and spends a bit too much time thinking random thoughts. Mort's dad and relatives find him to be a well-intentioned but generally useless young man.  Dad has been told that becoming an apprentice will get Mort off his hands and teach him a trade. So off to town they go for `apprentice day' in the market square.  As luck would have it, DEATH arrives and takes Mort on as his apprentice. <br /> <br />Mort develops in the expected Pratchett manner. The relationship between Mort and DEATH, and the chores Mort performs to learn his trade, seem very similar to that in the movie Karate Kid. Shoveling poop is not immediately relevant to learning how to become the messenger of death yet Mort takes to his tasks well.  Mort seems to enjoy living at DEATH's house and enjoys the food prepared by Albert, who may not be quite what he seems. He doesn't seem to get along to well with DEATH's daughter, Ysabell but that againmay not be quite what it seems. <br /> <br />Within no time DEATH is entrusting Mort with more responsibility while he experiments with drinking, dancing, and a stint as the best short order cook in Ankh-Morpork. Meanwhile, Mort, left to his own devices makes a mess of things in short order. Specifically, Mort falls for the heavenly charms of a Princess and fails to bring her over to the next world.  This of course causes no end of confusion as the natural order of things on Discworld has been greatly disturbed. <br /> <br />As with most Discworld books, events proceed at a furious pace followed by a conclusion that, like death itself, is inevitable. For any Pratchett fan, of which I am one, the joy in the journey and not in getting to the conclusion.  Along the way we are treated to the usual array of cultural references and little jokes. When Albert mutters \\"s-odomy non sapiens\\" under his breath Mort asks what that means to which Albert replies \\"buggered if I know.\\" When DEATH notes he is closing out a bar, alone, at a quarter to three, Pratchett tracks the lyrics to Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen's \\"One for My Baby\\". It is priceless. <br /> <br />Last, this is a stand-alone Discworld book.  Although some recurring characters make cameo appearances the reader does not really need to be overly familiar with any of the other Discworld books to enjoy Mort.  Mort was a pleasure to read.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My name's Catherine, I'm from Qubec and it's a real complicated job to get broadway CDs up here, but once when I saw a clip of Defying Gravity in a documentary. It was like stepping in a new world. I ordered it from amazon.ca and now I can't get enough of this CD. There's something truly magic about Wicked, like flying. I think it's one of the only CDs I never skip a song, they all have this magical universe around them, like Defying Gravity, No Good Deed, I couln'd be happier, etc... and the voices! Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth have such a beautiful intensity (not to be sexist, but that's a real lady job!), they truly made the songs their own. I'm so happy I'm going to see the show in Toronto (7 hours of road from where I live, but it'll be a nice trip), I can't wait. You've got to see it live to know what Wicked really is. Let yourself be carried by this wondeful music, and story.

B00003CXS4|5.0|I found it hard to take my eyes off this movie.  Guy Ritchie's flair for the action scene is impeccible.  The combination of music, lighting angles, and sheer verve in Snatch and Lock Stock... is outstanding.  I loved the plotline and suspense.  As usual, I had no idea what would happen until the end. Brad Pitt is almost as good in this movie as he was in Kalifornia; his accent is hilarious. Brick Top is terrifying and other than Dennis Farina's overacting, its hard to find any fault in this film.
B00005JMYG|3.0|How stupid is this?  Well, pretty stupid.  Consider the scene where the News at Five teams from the various local stations (in San Diego) square off, gladiator style complete with tridents, swords and axes.  Or how about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) reading everything put on the teleprompter--\\"You put it there, he'll read it\\" including the \\"f\\" word.  Or the musical score in the background, a selection of the most sappy seventies tunes including (God help us) \\"Skyrockets in flight/Afternoon delight.\\"<br /><br />I watched this on a United Airlines flight and took a read on the other passengers.  The guy in the window seat was in and out of sleep most of the time, and there weren't many of the other passengers laughing, at least not aloud.  However I have to say almost everybody put on their headsets and watched.  I attribute that to the mass bucks the producers spent on advertising.  I just had to check it out.<br /><br />And it WAS kind of fascinating to see a film done this way, so much so that even if you don't laugh, you might be glued to the tube anyway.  The satirical idea is to lampoon TV news anchors as empty-headed, surface kind of people who wouldn't know a differential equation from their hair spray.  Ferrell is perfectly shallow and vain and arrogant--and that is right on target.  However he proves the counterpoint to the movie's premise by actually being Quite a Guy, especially in the scene at the bar restaurant when he gets up to play the flute.  He plays one mean flute, I gotta tell you.<br /><br />Ferrell gets support from Christine Applegate as Veronica Corningstone who wants to become the anchorperson herself.  Most comedy fans will remember Applegate as the ditsy and voluptuous Kelly from TV's \\"Married with Children\\" where she started out when she was something like 14-years-old.  However, you might not recognize her at first glance since (1) she is trimmer, although she still has a bodacious figure; and (2) she's had the pre-mature wrinkles under her eyes surgically removed and her face looks a little different.<br /><br />Although this is a burlesque of the \\"reality\\" at your local news station, some of it is strangely real.  For example, the lead story constantly being the latest update on the panda bears at the San Diego Zoo and the media frenzy surrounding them is pretty much true.  Also real was the fanatical insistence by the TV producers (as a means to higher ratings) to feature human interest and crime stories as entertainment for couch potatoes.<br /><br />One of the funniest bits in the movie is near the beginning when Ron Burgundy tries out his unique pick-up style on Veronica by telling her that she has one very fine rear engine...or words to that effect, and she comes back with something like, \\"You sure know how to flatter a girl,\\" the sarcasm as heavy as molasses in January at the North Pole.<br /><br />See this for Will Ferrell, whose over-the-top performance fascinates even when he isn't funny, and just kind of zone out on the dead parts that don't quite make it.der her eyes surgically removed and her face looks a little different. <br /> <br />Although this is a burlesque of the \\"reality\\" at your local news station, some of it is strangely real.

B0000028M7|5.0|'Dirt' the second album by Alice In Chains changed my life, I am a very open minded person who has a great thirst for metal, but I love Grunge metal too! And 'Dirt' is, to me, the perfect Grunge album! It is SO inspirational & it even makes you think about life & death, which gave a very morbid touch to AIC's sound. 'Them Bones' is a blast full of superb riffs by Jerry Cantrell and the vocals are harmonic, haunting, and soothing by Layne Staley (R.I.P). The album takes you on a journey through the eyes of a dangerous heroine addict, and a very dark journey at that. <br />'Sickman', 'Junkhead', & 'Godsmack' are perfect examples of this and keep the genius quality flowing through the entire album, but it's with tracks like 'Rain When I Die', 'Down In A Hole', & 'Would?' that foreshadowed Layne's untimely death exactly 10 years later, letting the record have a much more errie feeling towards the listeners of today. <br />But don't be fooled by the morbid side of 'Dirt', this is an highly enjoyable album with plenty of catchy choruses, amazing riffs, and incredible singing. <br /> <br />AIC forever!

B0000027RL|5.0|Along with Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Tad, & others who weren't noticed by the media that made Nirvana so commercialised it was sickening! Pearl Jam also stood as one of the greats in the Grunge movement, Eddie Vedder and co. really brought out all the best on 'Ten'. I mean, it's just a classic! Totally one of the best albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, I was brought to the attention of Pearl Jam when 'Jeremy' & 'Alive' was shown on a music channel and I was totally blown away! <br />Since then I bought 'Ten' and was amazed with how clear and fresh it sounded what with all the copy-cat type grunge-wannabe bands try to do today. Obviously I'm talking Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Seether, Creed, and other talentless losers who rip-off the originators of the genre! <br />Please fellow CD buyer, DO NOT purchase anything from THOSE bands, only listen to the original intelligent bands like the ones I recommended at the beginning of my review. <br />

B00008J4P5|1.0|I just don't understand people's obsession with The White Stripes! They suck SO badly, Jack & Meg can not, I repeat, CAN NOT play instruments and are certainly not worthy of being \\"rock gods\\"! 'Elephant' is one of the worst, most overrated albums I've ever had the unfortunate luck of hearing. I'm a very open minded person, but my intentions of hearing good music were gone and thrown out the window when this heap of horse crap was put on at my friends house.  'Seven Nation Army' is probably a song that'll come to hunt me down for the rest of my life, because of it's intentions to try and kill me with it's bad riffs and VERY poor drumming.  Jack White isn't a good frontman either, he moans and groans through the songs like a little pre-teen who didn't get their own way!   And as for Meg, drumming has never sounded lazier!    Please avoid & get some Black Sabbath or Def Leppard instead!
077106506X|5.0|I borrowed &quot;Runaway&quot; from the library. Now that I have read it, I have no choice but to go out and buy it. One read will never  suffice. <BR>On the surface the stories seem straight forward, perhaps more so than Munro's other recent books and yet they are rich and complex.   <BR> These are stories of great humanity. Outcomes are not predictable and the smallest of decisions can change a life forever. A word not said, a second glance not taken, have huge consequences. The characters and plots do not follow a predictable course as they would in a lesser fiction.<BR> Even the less sympathetic characters are drawn in shades of grey and we feel their pain and humanity. In the title story, a bully of a husband is a complex man who may or may not destroy, depending upon so little.  We hold our breath in dread, hoping that those around him tread lightly. <BR>This collection of stories is simply breathtaking and deserves  to be savoured again and again. <br />  <br />    <BR>.
B000021YQV|5.0|'Toxicity', man, I just can't seem to make up my mind which is better, THIS or their self-titled album, they're both SO good!!! Serj Tankian is an incredible vocalist and an intelligent, amazing person it's no wonder he get's along with so many people in the music industry. He's a man who's not afraid to say what's on his mind in OR outside the the music he creates. Daron also brings out his superb guitar playing skills unbelievably well on this recording too, his solo's are incredibly individual to anything else I've ever heard before. <br />Shavo, the best beard in the band! And one hell of a bass player. John, the drummer, has too never sounded more energetic. <br /> <br />This album goes straight up there with all the other metal classics!  <br />'Prison Song' is my all round favourite track on the entire album! It took me quite a while to pick a fave, but I got there in the end! 'Bounce' is just incredibly silly and funny, 'Science', 'Chop Suey' (ANTHEM!), 'Deer Dance', 'Psycho', 'Shimmy', 'X' & 'Ariels' are all my other faves too. <br />SOAD rule! laters!
1591840562|5.0|As someone who has volunteered many times for non-profit organizations, and has worked in small businesses AND is a perpetual \\"starter\\" of things (two publications, several web sites, two organizations, several re-branding campaigns, and dozens of product launches, not to mention numerous \\"incidents\\" which shoudn't be mentioned!), I can vouch that this is a great book for anyone looking to start anything.  Its not just for entrepreneurs... its for the corporate employee looking to get a project, new division, or product off the ground.  Its the charitible fundraiser looking to start a new fundraiser (or a new charity!).  Its the product manager trying to launch a line extension.  So on and so forth.<br /><br />In this book, Guy has assembled great advice from a variety of sources, and translated it in a way that makes it easier to digest and apply to your real-world challenges.  Even if you're actually starting something, it still makes a good general business book, and if you're just thinking about getting something started, pick this up and it might motivate you!
B000001F3C|5.0|I wrote a review on U2's newest ablum, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" and forgot to mention a few things.  I have loved U2 since first seeing the video for \\"Gloria\\".  I can't remember how old I was, maybe 12, and that image has been burned in my brain. I am now 35, and still love U2.  This album is U2 at their absolute best.  I think everyone who is too young to remember or who weren't born yet and like the new stuff, to listen to this.  This is truly a masterpiece.  So much better then anything recent or from Achtung Baby.  I give credit to U2 for staying together for 25+ years but sometimes I just long for bands like Nirvana, The Clash, or The Sex Pistols.  Theese bands had a brief moment of fame, but are remembered for greatness.  It is a shame that U2 is leaving legacy of medicore music that may just make everyone forget just how great they were at one time.  Please, listen to this album, and see just how inspirational music from U2 can be.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|What else did you expect from Michael Mann?  The master knows how to develop deeply motivated criminals (Frank in THIEF, Neil in HEAT) and give them their own unique look.  Here, it's Tom Cruise with greyed hair and a sharkskin suit, earily set against L.A. neon.  An incredible contrast!  COLLATERAL is a 2 hour thrill ride, all the minor flaws aside (empty downtown streets at 4:45AM?).  COLLATERAL belongs to it's players:  Cruise, Jamie Foxx and the usual important supporting roles:  Peter Berg, Bruce McGill and Jada Pinkett-Smith.  COLLATERAL is one of 2004's best films, at last this may be Mann's Oscar year.
B00068IOWC|1.0|I gave this one star because I had to give it something.  Please understand, I love U2.  I have loved them for many years.  I remember when I first saw the vidieo for \\"Gloria\\".  I enjoyed reading the review that listed the new song lyrics with older song lyrics, and I can not agree more.  I miss being inspired by U2.  I miss feelings chills when I hear one of their songs.  Nothing compares to \\"Bad\\", \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" or \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday.\\"  I hate that they have written a lyric like \\"As the boys play rock and roll\\" in Vertigo.  U2 never had to identify their music as rock and roll before this. Pleae, listen to some older songs from U2, and see just how great they were at one time.  It is ashame that Bono's head has gotten so big.  Please watch the bands performance of the song \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" in the movie Rattle and Hum to see just how great U2 can be.
B0006399FS|1.0|Boy this is terrible. How egotistical can Bono possibly get? Who knows, but there seems to be no limit to how bad his music can be. Hey, that's a nice little ad for a multi-zillion dollar corporation you all appear in. Way to stick it to the man! You just gotta love unbelievably self-important billionaires jabbering about their love of poor people. Hey Bono, wanna trade lives with one of the third-world citizens about whom you so deeply care? Live in a mud hut in a village where everyone has AIDs? Didn't think so. Being a rich middle-aged \\"rock star\\" dork is much better, right? Please, no mas!!
B0006399FS|1.0|I'm not rating this album ( I had to give one star) because I have only heard one song-Vertigo, but I have to agree with the writer comparing the new U2 lyrics to the old U2 lyrics.  I love U2.  I have loved them since I was in the 7th grade.  I long for the thought provoking lyrics of War, and The Joshua Tree.  The line that instantly turns me off in Vertigo is \\"As the boys play rock and roll\\" or something like that.  As an older fan, I know what U2 can do, and I wish some of the younger fans would listen past offerings before Achtung Baby.  Even before Rattle Hum.  I beg you to listen to The Joshua Tree, War, and The Unforgettable Fire.  You will not be disappointed.  I still get chills listening to \\"Bad\\", \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\", \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", and \\"With or Without You\\".  This is U2 at there best before Bono head became so big he forgot who and what he was writing for. Also, to feel and see the passion of this band, please watch the performance of \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" in the movie \\"Rattle and Hum.\\"  It is truly amazing.

B000002KHH|5.0|Not only does this album represent the pure brilliance of Black Sabbath's first line-up, but it is a representation of the genre of metal. This album is absolutely incredible. 'Paranoid', 'Iron Man', 'War Pigs' and 'Electric Funeral' are the best ones. <br /> <br />Although this album is so brilliant, most of the songs from this album, plus some other really good Sabbath stuff is on 'We Sold Our Souls For Rock 'n Roll'. That's probably a better buy.
0446613444|3.0|The Black Ice is book number two in the series of books by Michael Connelly that star detective Hieronymous Bosch. It is in ways more symbolic and experimental than both its predecessor and all of its successors. While this is interesting, and not entirely without merit, it all adds up to a sum that is less than its parts.<br /><br />This is the weakest of the Bosch novels so far.<br /><br />There is an overwrought, yet uncompleted feel to The Black Ice. Its conclusion in particular is more than a little far-fetched and all too convenient.<br /><br />With that said, here is why The Black Ice is worth reading:<br /><br />1. Michael Connelly is one of the most interesting and talented writers out there. The combination of his journalistic training and his ability to paint cinematic word pictures that still work as lengthy pieces of fiction is unmatched by other genre writers.<br /><br />He links all of his books together in interesting ways. Once you step into his world, you begin to get inklings of just how vast it is. This is something rare in genre fiction--at least it is very rarely done this well.<br /><br />2. Harry Bosch is one hell of a character. Rather than being the one-sided archetype so often found in genre fiction, Bosch is fully human. He is exceptional in that though he is quite humanized, he is completely dedicated to his \\"mission\\" as a detective--most ably summed up by Bosch himself:<br /><br />\\"Everybody counts, or no one counts.\\"<br /><br />(An aside: I was recently discussing with my wife who her favorite character in Stephen King's Dark Tower Series is. We have read the books together. She went the emotional route and chose Oy--a sentimental, furry little creature.<br /><br />When asked who mine is (outside of Cuthbert, who is a bit player in books 1 & 4) I answered Roland.<br /><br />My wife does not like Roland. He is too mission-driven for her taste. I find, that like Bosch, Roland is more human for having to labor under the weight of a mission (I also feel that Oy gives his all for the mission as well, that he is not all cutesy and cuddly, but that is neither here nor there). The point being, that Bosch and Roland are two of the most fully fleshed out characters that I have come across in some time.<br /><br />I feel that this is because, conciously or not, we all live by a \\"mission\\" of sorts; be they for ill or good.<br /><br />an aside within an aside: my wife likes Bosch.)<br /><br />3. The Black Ice is the gateway to the rest of the Bosch books. The books take a huge leap in quality from book three on. Its well worth paying the price of admission: reading the first two books.<br /><br />I recommend the Bosch series of books very highly.<br /><br />As part of that recommendation, I suggest you grin and bear The Black Ice.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe you will find more here than I did.r the weight of a mission (I also feel that Oy gives his all for the mission as well, that he is not all cutesy and cuddly, but that is neither here nor there).

B000002LMK|5.0|The songwriting here is excellent and there are plenty of guitar solos with Neil at his from the gut, turn it to 11 feedback best.  Country Home, Over and Over, Days That Used to Be and Mansion on the Hill are standout songs but it is great from start to finish.  I very highly recommend this album
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I am not really sure what movie people are watching when they give this anything more than 1 star.  The movie had no actual premise.  I also didn't get why they tried to tell the story of impressionist-era artists using trite 20th century pop lyrics.  I got about 3/4 of the way through the movie and finally called it quits when I realized the movie was really going nowhere.  This is the kind of mindless, ADD-causing crud that epitomizes MTV these days.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00008H2LB|4.0|When you listen to the album you realize a few things <br />1) It is consistenly good <br />2) All the songs are different but similar  <br />(sounds stupid but you will know what I mean once you go through them all, it is like they have found the perfect song creation algorithm and can churn out millions of songs with minor differences but the sam intrinsic value)  <br />3) It is too good to be true <br /> <br />More on point 3) - This album appears to be engineered to perfection. It seems that the music industry has found a way to create a hybrid that appeals to all. Here the full spectrum of musicl genres meet to creat an amalgamation that will produce instant and sure hits. Congratulations on the producers for creating the perfect hybrid. This said, too good sometimes is not good - it is not realistic, its smells like there is something rotten inside of the polished and shiny surface. Its like a clever alchemist created the perfect concoction. How long will this last? I think they are done with.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I got this album the day it came out, in June 2001, but I didn't really settle into it until after the summer and into the fall.  During the latter half of that September, and all of October, there were three albums that I just kind of listened to over and over during my long commute to and from work: Ron Sexsmith's \\"Blue Boy,\\" \\"Smiley Smile\\" and \\"Amnesiac.\\" <br /> <br />When I think about that period, I remember listening to news on the radio for as long as I could, absorbing stories and investigations and the latest bad news, and then once I felt I'd gotten the gist of the days events, I'd switch over to music and, more often than not, \\"Amnesiac,\\" which perfectly articulated the way I felt.  It's downbeat music but it isn't gloomy and it made me feel better, not worse.  As corny as it sounds, \\"Pyramid Song\\" always gave me a feeling of reassurance that somebody else had felt the way I was feeling, at the time, and while they didn't have the solution, they had empathy. <br /> <br />\\"Amnesiac\\" and it's not-nearly-as-weird-as-it's-supposed-to-be-half-brother \\"Kid A\\" are divisive subjects among music lovers who like to debate and, while I can understand why some just don't like either of them, I think it's some of the best and most arresting music I've heard in the past 10 years.  \\"Kid A\\" is great but it's like a rough blast to clear out the jets and \\"Amnesiac\\" is the precise ignition that followed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|...... with this spellbinding, hypnotic, decadent love tornado they call \\"Moulin Rouge\\". I admit, the first time I watched this DVD, I almost spat at the TV in fury because of Baz Luhrman's bizarrely anachronistic use of modern music, and his psychadelically inaccurate portrayal of turn-of-the-century Paris. But I kept watching, and something happened to change my mind.  <br /> <br />Ewan McGregor sang to me. Yes, to me. OK, to Nicole Kidman, but whatever, I felt like he was really singing just for me. \\"My gift is my song........ and this one's for you.\\" Who knew that this stupid, cheesy song by Elton John would resonate in my mind for the next 3 years? Or that, whenever I'm feeling bad, just those 5 or 6 notes can lift me up where I belong, to a fantasy world where love is a many splendored thing, all you need is love....... Isn't that what movies should do, at their best? Yes, Ewan, I will be your beautiful courtesan, dying of tuberculosis, just sing for me again, will you?
0451169514|5.0|IT is the pinnicle of Stephen King's fame. By far, it is his largest book, which is a put-down at first, but it is worth it. <br /> <br />I read a couple Stephen King books before this, like Dreamcatcher (which does have an IT reference I didn't get when I first read it) and Carrie, but IT made me a huge fan. The characters jump off the page, and so does the monster that terrorizes them. The seven main characters are well-drawn out and you grow to love them. You can feel with them, and that is a big part of what makes this book so good. If any of the characters weren't detailed the way they are, IT wouldn't be very good. <br /> <br />There are intricate little details I that I first skipped over when reading it (because, hey, it's a REALLY long book, and I wanted to get to the end), like the middle sections when Mike introduces us to happenings long before the book takes place, but it's fun to read back on it later and see how it ties in with the story. <br /> <br />Yes, it is a whopping 1,038 pages. But once you get past the length, it is a rockin' good book. I've read a lot of Steven King books, but whenever I read IT, I'm always drawn back into Derry, where you've got to be sure you step around the sewer holes instead of over them. It deals with some mature subjects (being pretty much curse words, violence, and 3 sex scenes) so I would say you wouldn't want to give this to anyone under the age of 16.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a worthwhile book to have and read over and over. I read it when I was a high-school sophmore, and I still read it. That's gotta count for something, right?
B0002G2B2M|1.0|this movie (\\"film\\" to the in-crowd) was a boring incoherent mess.  is it possible that mainstream media reviewers often submit good reviews of movies that their instincts tell them are awful for fear of being accused of not really grasping the true beauty of the trash?  the only way i can think of to account for the pretty uniformly great reviews.  i am very happy to see that a few of the casual online reviewers like me also found this movie dreadful.
B00005JN0T|4.0|First let's get the obvious out of the way from the start; \\"I Robot\\" although it incorporates elements from some of Asimov's Robot stories has little to do with the short story collection of the same name beyond the character of Dr. Susan Calvin. In fact, \\"I Robot\\" began as a homage to Asimov and an original screenplay entitled \\"Hardwired\\". When director Alex Proyas (\\"Dark City\\", \\"The Crow\\") became involved things changed and the screenwriter incorporated more elements of Asimov's stories from the collection once Fox acquired the rights to the title. The only true adapation of Asimov's stories was done by Harlan Ellison in his marvelous unproduced screenplay of the same name.<br /><br />\\"I Robot\\" has all the right elements for a great Science fiction/mystery film and, although it doesn't achieve the greatness Proyas so clearly was shooting for, he and the writers on the film have done an admirable job at creating a fun bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the murder of Dr. Alfred lanning (James Cromwell)at U.S. Robotics. Spooner, who detests and doesn't trust robots (an idea borrowed perhaps from Asimov's novel THE CAVES OF STEEL). All leads point to a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) as the murderer. Dr. Susan Calvin (a character from Asimov's \\"I Robot\\" short stories played by Bridget Moynahan)doesn't believe its possible for Sonny to have killed Dr. Lanning as it would violate one of the Three Laws of Robotics ingrained in every robot as a moral compass or conscience. When machines mysteriously try and kill Spooner and Lawrence Robertson the head of U.S. Robotics tries to kill the case Spooner is building, he becomes suspicious and does some digging discovering far more than he expected about why the murder occurred and who killed Lanning.<br /><br />Visually stunning, Proyas film captures some of the flavor of Asimov's stories although it seems most indebted to Phillip K. Dick's stories and novels (as was Proyas film \\"Dark City\\") that deal with androids that develop self awareness. Smith gives a solid convincing performance while Moynahan's performance as Susan Calvin brings life to a character that is sketchy in the screenplay. Nevertheless, the director has created a stylish, involving action film perfect as escapist entertainment. Although the subplot involving Spooner's \\"racism\\" regarding robots was a bit heavy handed, it works creating a character that's suspicious of the \\"good intentions\\" of robots.<br /><br />The DVD looks particularly good although I'm a bit mystified as to why it wasn't released as a two disc set here as it was in other regions of the world. Because all the extras are are on the same disc as the movie, there are more compression artifacts that one might expect resulting in picture quality a grade or two below what one might expect from a movie like this. Overseas, the film had only the film and multiple commentary tracks on one disc with the extras on a second disc (with many more than the ones included here). My guess is that Fox will release a \\"Special Edition\\" somewhat down the road to double dip the fans like many other companies have been doing.<br /><br />The extras are solid if unspectacular with a glimpse behind-the-scenes and into how the FX were created for the movie. Again, more could and should have been done. The packaging with the seep through plastic sleeve is clever.<br /><br />Although the film doesn't quite live up to the hype generated by the terrific trailers Fox used to sell the film, \\"I Robot\\" is an engaging, interesting murder mystery with some nice twists and elements from Asimov's stories thrown in for good measure.royas film \\"Dark City\\") that deal with androids that develop self awareness.

B0002Y69NG|2.0|This is boring, 10 DVDs no way I'll sit down to watch that [...].  When The Matrix came out I kind of like it, but when the sequels came out it was just too [...]  much for me, like Star Wars, I get bored really easy with that kind of movies. But don't get me wrong in here only if you're a huge fan of the Matrix go ahead and buy this [...] . . .
B000002KCC|2.0|Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. There is no way you can physically help yourself from singing \\"C'mon Baby Let's Go Downtown\\"..(i KNOW that riff is on some pearl jam CD somewhere).  <br />I mean, I know Neil quite well (in the biblical sense), and he's just as excellent a tunesmith and melodymaker than Sir Dumbass McCartney. But, listen people...jus' because he lost a couple drinking buds doesn't mean he can play this sloppily and speak-sing his way to musical genius (who does he think he is Lou Reed, circa 1992..get real.) All I see is some quickly thrown together rehashed bar songs. Did he even try to compose some coherent melodies? I mean, i feel embarassment for the man when listening to the chorus on \\"Mellow My Mind\\". \\"New Mama\\" would be a LOT better if they had hired some decent studio back up vocals. I mean, his slow songs are just cheesy and preachy. The falsetto croon on \\"After the Gold Rush\\" is no where to be heard here, sorry people. The ONLY other good song on here is \\"Lookout Joe\\". But you can just download that. Bottom line, homies..if this album is supposed to project any darkness, depravity, sorrow, or wallowing of any kind...well, um..let's just say you should buy anything else before 1974 by this cowboy. peace.
1401200842|4.0|Whatever you say about HUSH, you've gotta admit the art is good. REALLY good. Jim Lee does a wonderful job on the main characters; some things could be a little different, but it was good overall. Don't be too picky, because then you lose the big picture.<br /><br />The plot is...confusing. I had to go over it a few times because I was really confused on who Hush really was. But then I got it, and all was good again. However, I did like the apperance of the famous sidekicks and such, like Robin, Nightwing, Jason Todd (that was very cool, by the way), Huntress, and the extremely famous villians, such as Poison Ivy, the Joker, Harley Quinn, Catwoman. I would have liked to see how Jim Lee would have drawn Two Face, but a minor loss.<br /><br />Don't get this if you are a starting Batman fanatic. Trust me. Background information is needed to understand, at the very least, the small part about Huntress. It can get even more confusing without any background, so you might want to try something else before you tackle this one.<br /><br />I'm all about the artwork, so that's what did it for me. If you're looking at the art, I'd recommend this in a heart beat. The artwork is wonderful and intriguing, and I loved it to the end. If you are looking for plot, HUSH is not the best of the bunch. It's more predictable than the usual Batman storyline, but not so much it's not worth reading. But even with the somewhat-weak plot, I still enjoyed reading HUSH. It doesn't have to be excellent to be good. HUSH isn't the best story on the block, but it holds its own in the Batman world...and that's all I ask.
068987474X|5.0|So I'd been not-dating a guy for, oh, six months. We've been so careful about not seeing each other too much, to the point where I move across the country when it starts to get too close. Yeah, I've got my commitment issues, too. I move back, and realize that we do, despite our efforts, care deeply for one another, but he's still got the walls up and the crocs in the moat. My mom (of course) tells me she just read this book, and maybe I should check it out because his behavior is ringing some bells. Lo and behold, fast-forward to me crying in my mom's arms, realizing that he must not be that into me cuz the bastard's the spitting image of all of the guys profiled. I got some guts, told him to hit the road if he couldn't make up his mind, and, all of twelve hours later, he bucked up and admitted that he loves me, that he's never been in love before, and that it was fear. So I guess in a way the book was \\"wrong,\\" in that he is that into me (and how) but it was so right in its advice -- had I just let things go on the way they were, I'd still be in limbo-land, feeling undesirable and less-than, wishing for love I secretly felt I didn't deserve. But I do. And now I'm getting it. So there. :) <br /> <br />Just read the book.

B00001OH7N|4.0|There is no way to describe the musical ground that this record covered and broke. Even if, right after this album, Bowie crashed and burned on a coke/alcohol binge at some party in Berlin while making out with Iggy Pop and Lou Reed (wow, i'm suddenly becoming aroused), people would still be name-dropping MWSTW like it was preverbially hot. The instrumenatation is blatantly so far ahead of its time, I actually refuse to believe the songs were written in '69. The riff on \\"savior machine\\" sounds like it was Ron Asheton was playing it..this is a good thing if you've never heard the Stooges' first record. \\"All the Madmen\\" and \\"She Shook Me Cold\\" are straight up stonermetal with a twist of Bowie. Flowers and Ronson play SOOOO well together it's really not funny. And, personally, I prefer Bowie's \\"Man Who Sold the World\\". Plus, if you're ever on a shooting rampage and need something to rock to, just play track 5 and \\"plug a few civilians\\", bowie style. And the first track is so good it doesn't even act like it's 8 minutes. Man, jus buy this and rock out with your c0ck out..or with any other genitalia you glammers might harbor. peace.

B000056HE9|4.0|\\"The Bishop's Wife\\" is a mildly diverting fantasy that falls short of greatness because of the flatness of the direction.  I kept thinking that if this film were directed by Frank Capra instead of Henry Koster it would be a whole different enterprise.  The strengths of the film lie with the basic story <br />and the charismatic turn by Cary Grant as Dudley, the angel that visits a diocese in New York to set the priorities straight.  David Niven does admirable work as the uptight bishop who cannot see the forest for the trees.  Loretta Young, on the other hand, gives a performance akin to a cigar store Indian.  Master cinematographer Gregg Toland films her in soft focus to show emotion and passion that are otherwise absent in her performance as the frustrated bishop's wife.  Good supporting turns are also delivered by Monty Wooley as a historian and Gladys Cooper as Niven's main benefactor in getting his cathedral built.  But why is the talented Elsa Lanchester wasted here as the bishop's maid?

0613624688|5.0|Garth Nix changed the face of dark fantasy (usually just horror with a prettier cover) with his instant hit \\"Sabriel.\\" It provided fans with a unique type of magic, a well-crafted alternate world, and talking animals that were anything but cute. Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. And Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note.

B00008PX8P|5.0|You should have seen them in person, nuff said!!!
B000002UB3|4.0|Ah, yes...\\"Abbey Road\\". The most frustrating album of the Beatles' career. Frustrating in this sense: Side 2 of the album is very possibly the greatest side of recorded music in the 20th century. A medley that flows with ebbs and tides and never fails to thrill; it is flawless and brilliant, and contains some of the very best vocal harmonies the band ever did on \\"Because\\" and \\"Sun King\\", and \\"The End\\" simply rocks out. But Side 1 is more problematic - it's an erratic performance. It gets off to a great start with John's \\"Come Together\\" and George's \\"Something\\", both superb songs, but what follows are three of the weaker songs in the Beatles' catalogue: \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is silly and annoying and very possibly the worst song the Beatles ever recorded (even worse than \\"Revolution 9\\"), \\"Oh! Darling\\" has a gutsy McCartney vocal performance but the song itself has very little substance, and Ringo's \\"Octopuss' Garden\\" attempts to be charming but comes off rather traumatic after the silliness of \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\". Things get interesting again with John's \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", sort of an attempt at heavy metal, but lets face it - it doesn't take much to write \\"I want you, I want you so bad/it's driving me mad\\", and repeat it ad infinitum throughout the song with no other lyrics and one repeating riff.  <br /> <br />If Side 1 of this album was as good as Side 2, it would be, hands down, the best album the Beatles ever recorded. As it stands, it's a flawed masterpiece that, while essential like everything else the Beatles recorded, simply does not stack up against 'Revolver' and 'Sgt. Pepper' - arguably their two greatest recorded achievements. 4.5 stars overall based on the amazing strength of Side 2.  <br />
B003ASLJS6|5.0|\\"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth\\" (Revelation 6:8). We hear the first sentence of this verse with the appearance of the Pale Rider in the camp of miners; the second sentence is not read but is present throughout the film, and its silence is why many misunderstand and fail to comprehend the significance of the appearance of the angel of death and its meaning for the film. \\"Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the demigod, a satyr-play; and around God everything becomes--what? perhaps a `world'?--\\" (Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil §150). Pale Rider is a concealed satyr-play posing as a tragedy that takes place in the world of God. It is not surprising that this ironic or dissimulating aspect of the film often escapes attention, for that is the nature of irony.    As a film self-consciously participating in the western genre, Pale Rider is an obvious simulacrum of Shane. In terms of plot, the big difference is that miners do not generate as much sympathy as homesteading farmers. What is missed by those taken in by the film's ironic dissimulation, however, is that Pale Rider is pointing deliberately, although indirectly, to the violence necessarily consequent when a political community imposes by law and, if necessary, by force, the American faith in anthropological equality that is embodied in the squatter's ethos, miner or homesteader. Obviously these people are not equal in their capacities or virtues, just as they were not in Shane. The dramatic religious setting and background images the order of rank--the hierarchy--of souls of human beings in various states and degrees of need or lack. The film also uses irony to point to the connection between the modern exaltation of courage and an over-indulgence in the self-expression manifested in violence and vulgarity.    It is striking that there is a complete lack of moderation in the souls represented herein; there is no moderation of the satisfaction of personal desire. The miners tell themselves that they are more righteous than LaHood because they are trying to better their families. Of course this is merely cover for the personal greed of the miners, made evident by their crude and braggadocios behavior after finding some gold. It still breaks down to love of one's own without moderation--a refusal to recognize natural limits. This is the meaning of the unspoken second sentence of Revelation 6:8 which is ever present in the film: all seem to believe it is given to them, as sovereign individuals, to rule as they wish with sword, beasts, machines, etc., and this appears to be a necessary result of the modern desire to turn the juridical notion of equality before the law into a metaphysical doctrine of justice (the Rawlsian spirit writ large). American liberty and equality have turned into freedom from self-restraint and a rejection of order and rank, which has resulted in moral bankruptcy.    The American way of life is supposed to be based on the Enlightenment principle of reason; instead a crass individualism has devolved out of the theory of the social contract and its emphasis on self-interest with the practical effect of leveling all hierarchies and unleashing the destructive forces of unmitigated passion, always in the name of equal rights. Thus the film evinces a Nietzschean interpretation of this phenomenon as the spirit of revenge and the dawn of the era of the Last Man. In sum, we are made to see that a political community ruled by the passions of the demos is by nature vulgar. All grand purposes and virtues have been muted in favor of the self-expression of even the lowest capacities. The modern project of mastery that began with the exhortations of Bacon and Descartes to conquer nature for \\"the relief of man's estate\\"--which hasits political corollary in \\"rights\\" politics, derived principally from the right to self-preservation--has resulted in nihilism.    How are we to view to the fact that the Pale Rider guns down seven (and here we are being asked to associate the number seven with the seven seals in Revelation) men so that miners can make money and fulfill their hearts' desires? How are we to view the people who admire the man who actualized the spirit of revenge they themselves wanted to enact but lacked the courage to carry out? Given the dramatic context of the film, I suggest we are to view these as examples of the nature of man as a Fallen creature. Whence Eastwood's emphasis on the Biblical themes of the evil of man and the avenging angel of death, not only in this film, but really in most of his films, and especially his Westerns. I say this not to join the contemporary view that the mythology of the Western is ideologically unsalutary, for contemporary America is based on the same principle inasmuch as those who say the mythology of the Western is harmful do so from the perspective that it fell short of the utopian dream of justice as equality. By this ironic and theological interpretation of Pale Rider, however, it is the attempt to inculcate and enforce the metaphysical doctrine of justice as equality that has disastrously damaging effects on the human soul, not the belief in, and desire to maintain, principles of hierarchy of the good. This is what Pale Rider the film can teach us, and what those who view it too narrowly--as a simple Western tale of the Stranger saving the little guys from the big guys--miss.    \\"Has it escaped your notice, that--by Homer's account--you are bringing not a Stranger but some god? He says that besides the other deities the god of strangers especially becomes a companion to those men who participate in just reverence and that \\"he looks down upon both outrages and lawful conduct\\" [cf. Odyssey 9.269-271 and Odyssey 17.485-487]. So perhaps here too the Stranger that accompanies you might be among the Mightier, come to look over us and refute us, since we are feeble at giving accounts--a sort of refuting god.\\" (Plato, Sophist 216a-b)
0440238609|5.0|This trilogy of books is by far one of the most emotionally riveting that I have ever read.  The character development in the first book, and throughout the series, captivates the reader, and the books become for than just a story.  Pullman creates an array of fantastic worlds dabbing the extraordinary in a rather realistic world.  His settings and descriptions make these places easier to picture, with an added awe.  The suspense that the author employs through the use of foreshadowing and a general foreboding tone makes it impossible for the reader to push out of their head the inevitable unhappy ending.  However, after getting well into the third book, one seems to forget about Lyra's ultimate decision.  But after reading the last few pages, a sense of such wrongdoing, injustice, and anger is the only way to describe the emotional reaction.  The fact that even the toughest shelled readers are brought into such an emotional outrage and eventual sorrow, is proof of how good the books are.
B000002JSP|3.0|Aww, poor whittle babies...., September 8, 2004 <br />Reviewer: metaliman \\"Eddy\\" (From the Streets Ese!) - See all my reviews  <br />What is everybody's problem anyway, this album wasn't even successful. Plus, Led Zeppelin, \\"the greatest band on the planet\\", lost their drummer and called it quits. Come on, surely the greatest band of all time could find the perfect replacement, seems like they could survive for more than 11 years. Let me give you a list of bands that continue after losing a band member and you guys can shut up about Led Zeppelin being the best band ever.  <br />Bands which have lost a band member and have continued afterward.  <br />Metallica:Cliff Burton(bassist):one name, Jason Newstead  <br />Def Leppard:im not a real big fan but I heard they lost their guitar player, but they reformed the band and continued.  <br />The Who:Keith Moon(drummer):The Who hired a new drummer and they later recorded 'You Better you Bet'  <br />Lynard Skynard:The whole damn band!(their relatives recreated it like 5 years after their deaths)  <br />Motley Crue:Nikki Sixx(bassist):Had an enormous drug overdose which left him dead, but while in ambulance, he suddenly resurrects, so all hail Nikki!  <br />Mayhem:Norweigan death metal band:frontman commits suicide, guitarist eats frontmans brains, bassist kill guitarist, bassist goes to jail and escapes only to be caught again. The only original member is the drummer.  <br />Kiss:Eric Sarr(drummer):died while on tour, they replaced him and continued playing.  <br />Ac/Dc:Bon Scott(frontman):died choking on his own vomit. Ac/Dc replaces him with Brian Johnson, and enjoy the most successful years of their carrers.  <br />Ozzy Osbourne:Randy Rhoads(guitarist):died tragically at the young age of 25 when the plane he was in crashed into a house and everyone aboard was killed. After months of depression at the lost of his best friend, Ozzy releases Bark at the Moon with new guitarist Jake E. Lee.  <br />Randy Castillo(former Ozzyand Motley Crue drummer):died of some kind of cancer. Wasn't in any band at that time, but a ton of people showed up for his funeral.  <br /> <br />So as you can see, these guys have no excuse. They only lost the drummer man, and he was old. I mean come on, if Nikki Sixx could rise from the dead, why cant Jon Bonham? If Ozzy can come back stronger than ever from losing the best friend he ever had in a plane accident, then Led Zepplin has no excuse. <br />----------------------------------------------------------------- <br />While i agree that this album along with much of Zepplin's is overrated i have to tell the reviewer that wrote this above he needs to get his act together before trying to come across as some rock know it all. <br />   First Bonham died and doesn't deserve the crap you're saying so you should take your own advice and shut up. Second you don't know who the Def Leppard band member was that died so i'll tell you...his name was Steven Clark.Def Leppard never reformed the band after his death because they never broke up, they hired Vivian Campbell and continued on. Also in your limited wisdom you failed to mention that Leppard's drummer Rick Allen lost his arm in a car crash and they continued on.........with the same drummer! A very remarkable task. Third the band LYNYRD SKYNYRD not LYNYARD SKYNARD contrary to what you say didn't have the whole band die in the plane crash that happened in 1977. The band members that were lost were lead singer Ronnie VanZant, guitarist Steve Gaines and his sister back up singer Cassie Gaines.Also the band wasn't reformed by family members five years later but was formed by the surviving band members almost ten years later. <br /> Please in the future do a little home work before you come on here and try to impress us ok.Untill then again i say ,do what you seem to like to tell other people to do and.......shut up.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I first saw him on \\"The Tonight Show\\" with Jay Leno where he sang 'You Raise Me Up'.  His voice blew me over!!!  Then recently his PBS special \\"Live at the Greek\\" was on, but I had to go out.  So I decided to buy this album to give this kid a listen. I'm finding it hard to \\"make a connection\\" with him?  I was able to connect right away with Andrea Boccelli and Helmut Lotti, but he's not hitting a resposive nerve with me for some reason.  His live performance of 'You Raise Me Up' was more fulfilling than on this CD.  Maybe the Amazon reviewer was right--that he needs a little more experience and maturity under his belt?  He seems down-to-earth and very modest.  And I'm willing to wait, watch and listen.  And while I'm waiting, I love looking at that head of HAIR!!!  ;-)
B0002OERI0|5.0|A rock opera about living in our times, laced with the bitterness of Bush hatred and including not one but two nine-minute, five-part epics, American Idiot is stunning. Who among us thought, in the Dookie days, that Green Day was hiding within it all the components needed to create a modern masterpiece? That Billie Joe's voice would one day be the perfect vehicle not for teenage loutish angst but for a searing look at what's wrong with the world? That Tre Cool's drumming could become a force of nature? Not me. But this album proves me wrong. It elevates its art form to a whole new level. The quintessential 2004 album.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I've travelled to a few off-the-beaten-path countries in this world, including a communist nation and one run by a dictatorship... this movie would be considered in the same vein with communist propoganda. I'm saying this out of a sincere belief that people should speak their minds, share their beliefs in a civil manner, and pitch in to make this country (and world) a better place.  <br /> <br />However, to call this movie a great \\"journalistic/documentary masterpeice\\", as some people have written and said, is to say that truth no longer matters. Even if it is being considered on a more theatrical performance, I'm not sure this movie should get more than two stars... it's a bit choppy and too convoluded. This movie gets a thumbs down from my perspective.  <br />
B00006RIO7|5.0|I must agree with everything tha has been said, not only is Chicago by far one of the  best films of the past years, it has also an excellent soundtrack. <br />The music,each song, the melodies, it all helps to feel the movie justas it is. Spectacular voices that bring all the feelings into the screen and with this cd into our homes. <br />Unfortunatly i haven't had the chance to see the play, but the motion picture was enough to make me a fan of this spectacular show and an adict to the soundtrack.
1592400876|4.0|Sticklers of the world unite! But, at the same time, don't take yourselves too seriously!<br /><br />I've never had so much fun learning. Thankfully I did not attempt to read this book on a plane as I would have embarassed myself laughing out loud.<br /><br />Is it the ultimate authority on punctuation? No. But it sorted out a lot of things in my head - particularly as I write British English - and did so in a most enjoyable manner. The mood was light, the sense of humour refreshingly irreverent, and the points well taken.<br /><br />And now I feel more motivated to pick up those style manuals and delve deeper into the subject.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Everything is in its right place on this album, the debut from a Scottish rock foursome that is this year's answer to The Strokes. Rock with precision, it's also-somehow-maddeningly fun. Witness the lead single, \\"Take Me Out,\\" which was mainstream enough to be played during an early episode of Joey. It's a good representative for the album as a whole: clever lyrics that can be interpreted in different ways, carried forward by carefully laid-out rhythms and vocals that wrap themselves up into a four-minute gem. This is an album of such gems, many of them with a sense of humor that is part of the magic of the disc. \\"Jacqueline\\" preaches the virtues of vacation: \\"It's always better on holiday...that's why we only work when we need the money.\\" \\"Michael\\" finds the singer hitting on Michael at a dance club, despite the fact that he's a man, because he's \\"the boy that everybody wants.\\" Homoerotic or campy? It hardly matters: FF may have a name from 1914 and a sound borrowed from rock and punk history, but the band's unique blend of recycled sounds and new ideas is distinctly 2004.
B000002ITK|4.0|Wow, this is a great cd for anyone who wants a Twisted Sister greatest hits package. Some \\"best of\\" cd's have remixes and edited tracks, well this one doesn't which makes it a good choice to buy. Plus you get 5 live tracks which lets you hear Twisted Sister live in their glory days. There isn't a lot of offical live Twisted Sister songs availabe also, plus the choice of live songs are excellent eg: Rolling Stones: It's only rock n' roll. Plus the compilation was produced by TS member Jay Jay French who also provides liner notes.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|I've bought this DVD in german an it was so funny; never seen a better movie. <br />Even though the producers did much mistakes about the european people (yes, Europe is not a country :-) and though the word \\"zussammen\\" doesn't exists in german, only \\"zusammen\\", and that means \\"together\\" ) I rate this movie with 5 Stars. <br />And the Scene in Amsterdam: It is really Amsterdam! No Fake ;-)
B0002OERI0|5.0|Awesome CD!  I listen to it every day and never tire of it.  Each song is better than the next.  Great having Green Day back in the fold; this country needs true rockers in a vapid world filled with the Simpson Sisters, Britney, and the likes of Clay Aiken and the Awful Idols!
B0002O06N0|5.0|This year's White Stripes, only without the self-indulgence and the goofy backstory. I don't know how to describe this incredible album except to say that it sounds manly-deep voices, deep drums, a certain weight to the bluesy music. By the second song, lead single \\"10 A.M. Automatic,\\" I'm hooked every time, floating through the rest of the album in awe, as if I'm wrapped tight in its manly arms. (Huh. Maybe that's why I love it so.) Rubber Factory sounds so much like a greatest hits album-every song is THAT good-that it's hard to believe these 13 songs represent a single effort. These guys are for real.
0375507256|5.0|This goes down as one of my favorite books of the year.<br /><br />Story in a nutshell (without spoilers):<br /><br />Cloud Atlas consists of 6 [slightly] interlinking stories, told from the viewpoint of 6 different individuals at different points in time. The first story consists of the letters of Adam Ewing, and his fateful trip on a ship in the Pacific in the mid 1850's.<br /><br />From there we go to the second story, which takes place in the 1930's and is told from the viewpoint of Robert Frobisher, a talented disinherited muscial composer who visits an infirm maestro and his family in an attempt to get work and advantage. His story is told through his letters to a scientist friend/lover named Rufus Sixsmith.<br /><br />The next story takes place in the 1970's, and has to do with reporter Luisa Rey, and her exposure of corporate malfeasance that could result in disaster. Sixsmith is a scientist there, and plays an important part of the story.<br /><br />Next, (and my personal favorite), is the story of Timothy Cavendish, in present day England, and the tale of his (mis) adventures as a book publisher. Utterly hilarious and poignant.<br /><br />The second to last story becomes a sci/fi read of future corporate controlled Korea, complete with cloned humans.  And the final story is one that takes place in post apocalyptic Hawaii.<br /><br />And then we go back to each story, in opposite order, and put the pieces together and complete the cliffhanger endings from the first half.<br /><br />I think this book is brilliant. I often found myself rereading various sections because I found them so ingenius and profound. I think David Mitchell is one of the most talented new writers around.<br /><br />My only complaint? Sometimes I think that the author was a bit taken with his own writing, and was too clever for his own good. At points the writing became tedious, although never to the point that I wanted to throw in the towel.<br /><br />Note...I personally had trouble getting through chapter one, but then I was hooked by chapter two. If you find yourself getting impatient, hang in there.<br /><br />Highly recommended, with the reservations expressed above.ourself getting impatient, hang in there.     Highly recommended, with the reservations expressed above.
6300181553|5.0|Wow! Holiday inn is such a wonderful movie!! And so filled with the spirit of christmas. And I definetely agree with everyone here, this is not a film just for christmas. The tunes, and beats, and scores in this movie are really, top rate! <br /> <br />Fred is perfect for Ted Hannover. This movie begins with a wonderful song, and dance performed by Fred, Bing, and there girl dance partner. And this partner, Lila Dixon, is engaged to be married to Jim (Bing). Until, Ted, (Astaire)explains how much he loves her. So she promises to marry him, but is still figuring out a way to tell Jim. When the news is finally dumped on him, Jim leaves show business, to live on a farm where he plans on being ''Lazy,'' and celebrating holidays. And then one day, he gets a brainstorm. He decides to turn the farm into Holiday Inn!!  <br /> <br />I hate to hive the whole plot, laughs, trials, and everything away to you. For if I told you everything, the movie would be dull, because you know what was going to happen next. <br /> <br />But, I will tell you this, this WAY TO GOOD to be watched only around christmas. This is a great movie with humor, songs, taps, and filled with the magical wonder of Christmas.
B0006399FS|5.0|Some reviewers (like the mind-numbingly awful \\"fan\\" known coincidentally enough as \\"Comfortably Numb\\") gave this album a 1-star review.  But a little digging discovered that this person is a fan of albums like \\"Pop\\".  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with this - but it seems that he is stuck in a timewarp.  U2 have already done \\"Pop\\".  We had a decade of experimentation. It's time to move on.  If you are a die-hard fan of that era, you have 10 years of it to enjoy.  But if you like to see artists grow and change, then this album is for you.    \\"Atomic Bomb\\" is filled with uplifting and even joyous songs.  U2 have shown many faces over their long career - and this current face seems their most real and sincere.  No longer do we have the flag-waving punk rockers or the preachers or the ironic rock stars.  Instead, we see the true face of U2 in perhaps their most honest and pure work ever.  These are the words and this is the music of men who are fathers and husbands.  No longer do we hear Bono preach to us - instead he is leading by example.      These are mature songs.  Admittedly, this album is not as experimental as past works, but don't let some supposedly experimental albums like \\"Pop\\" fool you - that album still contains the traditional verse, chorus, verse structer on its songs.  And many \\"Pop\\" songs are classic rock songs that could easily blend in with U2's recent work.  But alas, some people are unable to move forward.  It's a shame because they are missing out on perhaps the best album of 2004. Fortunately, with \\"Atomic Bomb\\", we retain U2's experimental edge with songs like \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" and \\"Fast Cars\\" and U2's rocking side with \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"All Because of You\\", while retaining U2's anthemic soul with beauties like \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\".  If you are able to open your mind a little (how ironic that the fans who claim to love \\"experimental\\" works are often the most close-minded fans),you will fall in love with this work.  This is truly a beautiful album that deserves the praise it is receiving.  Do not let the naysayers turn you away.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This phenomenon of a movie was written and directed by brilliant people.  It is SO funny, and deserves the attention that it got.
B00006RINF|5.0|i first learned about lacuna coil from my boyfriend... who happens to be a HUGE metal fan.. im not.. usually i cant stand metal.. the closest thing to metal i get is \\" in flames \\" and thats pushing it.. but when my boyfriend told me about lacuna coil i jumped on here to check out the clips of music... then found the music video for \\" swamped and heavens a lie \\" on yahoo and checked out the whole song.. i instantly fell in love with christina's voice.. probably because i can sing just as well as her.. but thats not the point here... usually i look for a good female vocalist band like evanesence or somebody like that; that i can sing with to better my own vocals but christina took my breath away.. i had to run out and get the cd. i have to agree with some of the other peoples reviews about andrea's vocals in this album and i agree he doesnt belong here... his voice is too gothic to compliment christinas and it takes away from the beauty and flowingness of her voice... but i still give it 5 stars because she is an awesome singer and its just music i can use either to relax and drift to sleep by.. or really get into some deep soul searching or possibly even better my voice along with hers.. i definitely recommend getting this album.. at least give it a try.. its worth it.
0451191153|5.0|Those who have been critical of this book, simply did not get it.  The critiques illustrate this more profoundly then  anything I could possibly say. They accuse Rand of being guilty of the very thing she brilliantly denounced. Rand knows reality, and deals with it accordingly.  <br /> This book speaks for itself only for those who care to listen.  YOU either know what I mean or you don't.
B000055ZDT|5.0|For pure, unadulterated doom, they don't come much heavier than England's Electric Wizard. This is doom-METAL, and moreover of the most intense and heavy kind. This band rarely approaches even a midpaced tune they're slow, they're heavy, and they're evil. Playing heavy downtuned Doom Metal and creating a thunderous roar, this monstrosity will put you into a trace, and make you feel stones. This album is known for being most effective with headphones on and listened to at night. This is their third outing, on Lee Dorrian's Rise Above records, and what a third outing it is! After changing their sound somewhat picks up where 'Come My Fanatics' left off. Starting off the album is the intense 'Vinum Sabbathi', the Wizards shotgun eight amazing tracks down your throat. Oh it gets better, they are finished, they have only just began, after that you have to make it through long, and heavy 7 tracks. You may barely surviuve, but when it's all over, you will want to do it again. They do not drop jaws with overly-technical compositions or blazingly fast, relentless drumming, mind you; they drop jaws with the sheer power contained in their songs. A must have for Doom Metal fans and especially for fans of Black Sabbath, Candlemass, and Warhorse.
0156027321|1.0|What is the worst book you ever read - mine is The Life of Pi.  I can't understand how people can read it and not realize that the \\"alternative\\" story at the end was carefully crafted to correspond to every event of the main story. By the time one finishes the book, a thoughtful person realizes that all along the book was about cannibalism and the worst sort of survival and that the author constructed the \\"pretty\\" main story as an allegory.  His claim that the book would prove the existence of God indicates that he thinks of God as a pretty made up story, just like a survivor of cannibalism might hallucinate a pretty story so that he could live with himself and forget the terrible tragedy and trauma.  If you are an insightful reader I advise you to avoid this book unless you like dark reading.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Back In the Era of Images and Words, Dream Theater were singing that \\"...A Picture worth a Thousand Words...\\", and now those crazy guys offer their Live Experience on this DVD, just to prove it. Believe me, I've seen 4 times Dream Theater live, but this time I felt like being there for real. Probably that's because  the Train of Thought did not stop in Athens this year, but I feel like I've experienced Dream Theater Live for the 5th time. A must for the musicians, a challenge for the listeners. \\"Take the blue pill and see how far the rabbit hole goes\\"...
B0006399FS|1.0|I usually don't write reviews, but after 2 less than stellar offerings, something must be said.  I own most of their catalog and enjoyed every one until All That You Can't Leave Behind (Rattle and Hum had it's moments).   <br /> <br />I tried to like this album, but all the songs meld together in blandness.  Although it is slightly better than ATYCLB, it's painful to listen to as I know what this band is capable of.   <br /> <br />It's basically recycled Joshua Tree melodies and forced lyrics.  If you're new to this band, please check out my favorite cd - Achtung Baby (Ultraviolet anyone?) <br /> <br />As far as major releases go: <br />1. Achtung Baby <br />2. Joshua Tree <br />3. Zooropa <br />4. The Unforgettable Fire <br />5. Pop <br />6. War...that's the oldest one I have listened to enough to review. <br />7. Rattle and Hum <br />8. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb <br />9. All That You Can't Leave Behind <br /> <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|Usually I don't waste my time responding to the idiots who post inflammatory reviews to get noticed but on the off-chance that said idiot was too young when this album came out, I'd like to take them back to 1992. It was a time of great optimism and weariness. A Bush was leaving the White House, Bubba was going in. Ruby Ridge, Somalia, grunge, Starbucks as a household name, \\"A Few Good Men\\", blah blah blah.  A band called Pantera released an album called \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\" that shocked critics by debuting at number 1 on the Billboard charts. VDOP wasn't the *first* heavy metal album to chart at no. 1 (that distinction goes to \\"Slave To The Grind\\" by Skid Row) but it certainly *was* the heaviest. This might not seem like a big deal in these days of nu-metal where any bunch of wiggers in cargo pants and backwards baseball caps can record an aggro-rap album.  The surprising thing about VDOP is that it has no obvious radio singles. Great songs yes, but no novelty songs, nothing that your grandmother will find herself humming along to, nothing that your Britney Spears listening friends will like. It's just a great album that was screaming to get recognized in a market that was becoming saturated with 'grunge' rock.   I love this album to death. \\"Mouth For War\\" and \\"This Love\\" are absolutely my favorite metal songs, right up there with \\"Children Of The Grave\\" and \\"War Pigs\\" by Sabbath and \\"Highway Star\\" by Deep Purple. \\"Walk\\" is great for listening if you've been disrespected. Who needs alcohol to get that inflated sense of self-esteem eh?   I was saddened to hear that \\"Dimebag\\" was murdered recently. I was just getting into these guys again. Great bands don't break up for song and I was thinking how great it would be if Pantera got back together and showed some of these limp biscuits how to grow a pair of [...]. RIP \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell!
B0002ZDVF4|4.0|Okay - great movie.  I could have done without the shaky-hand cam stuff, but all in all, pretty good.  Fight scenes, stunts, and so on - all on par with the first move. <br /> <br />Thats said, I read the actual book over the summer.  Totally different story.  In the book, Bourne is in Hong Kong frantically hunting an assassin who is impersonating him in an effort to save his wife who has been taken hostage by the CIA.  In the movie, he's in Berlin randomly kicking ass and taking names and hunting the CIA for, he believes, killing his wife.  WTF?  Where did the second story come from? Am I missing something? <br /> <br />Still a good flick - just shocked.  On the bright side, I was anticipating a night of critiquing the film based on poor portrayal of the book....instead, I saw a whole new story.
B000002UUX|5.0|I will sum this album up quickly. The opening riffs on the tunes are fast and aggressive. The vocals are hostile. The solos are amazing. This is their best album. It is so technical. Buy it and be blown away. Anyone who criticises this album negatively needs help. Seriously buy this. And their new album, the system has failed it kills!
B00005Q4CS|3.0|i honestly dont think that this was a very good movie. my main focus though was on the search. i searched for pie. What did i get? i got requiem for a dream. huh? how did that happen? the directors name, the name of the movie...nothing has to do with pie. darn...thats annoying. honestly, i didnt like this movie. i thought it was way too weird. it made me think about the meaning of life. i didnt want to think about the meaning of life. its boring.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|A human baby, accidentally taken to the North Pole in Santa Claus's (Edward Asner) bag, is raised by elves.  Although Buddy (Will Ferrell) believes he is an elf, he knows that he doesn't fit in-and not only because he is four feet taller than everyone else.  Shocked at the news that he is really a human, he travels to the human world to meet his real father (James Caan), a cynical publisher who is facing a crisis in his professional life.  In a film like this, it goes without saying that everyone will be the better for having met Buddy.    This film is a real delight.  Ferrell shows that he has what it takes to carry a film; he should enjoy a long and successful movie career.  Genuinely sweet and happy without becoming cloying and phony, \\"Elf\\" is perhaps the best Christmas movie in recent years.  The eclectic cast is one of its greatest assets.  Besides the abovementioned actors, it features Bob Newhart, the beautiful Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenbergen, Faizon Love, and the Howard Stern Show's Artie Lang in a memorable cameo as a department store Santa./
0679777547|4.0|Perez-Reverte has developed a following as a mystery writer for the educated reader.  The Club Dumas shares the strengths and the weaknesses of his other works.  In the world of rare and expensive books, Corso is not a collector, but one who finds books on order for collectors.  He is simply a mercenary who stumbles into two linked mysteries, one having to do with Alexandre Dumas's \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and the other with a 17th century satanic text.  Corso's world is full of strange booksellers, erudite academics, and eccentric collectors.  By following the plots of the books he is seeking, he manages to unravel the mysteries, more or less.<br /><br />Perez-Reverte has done his homework.  It's fun to be in the world of rare books that he creates.  But as in his other works, his rich and detailed plot once again fails in the final chapters here.  In \\"The Flanders Panel\\" and \\"The Nautical Chart\\", for example, after hundreds of wonderful pages of plot development, the stories collapse into banal and cardboard endings.  \\"The Club Dumas\\" shows the same weaknesses.  These are fun books, page turners for the middle-brow reader, but ultimately they leave the reader wishing they were more clearly executed.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|I'll admit this isn't their best work but for EasTNuGgA187 to criticize it would be like myself writing reviews for Lil Kim or Lil Jon or Lil Rob or Lil Whoever-is-cool-this-week and mention how they sound exactly alike.

0446530891|4.0|This David Baldacci mystery takes us inside the world of the Secret Service where a long-shot presidential candidate has been kidnapped. Michelle, the former Olympic champion and Secret Service agent responsible for this mess, decides to spend her otherwise idle time in commiserating with the only other agent in recent years responsible for a bigger mess, Sean King.  <br /> <br />Not coincidentally, King is living nearby, and witnessing a crime spree involving the murders of his client and office assistant, the latter done with his own gun. Eight years earlier King had outdone Michelle by allowing his protectee to be assassinated. Joan, another agent who was with King that day and may have been a contributing factor in the foul-up, also reappears. She is now a private investigator hired to find the kidnapped candidate. The three former agents decide to join forces to solve the two cases, after it becomes clear that the two cases are connected, although they insist on minimal cooperation and outright hostility at times.  <br /> <br />Baldacci carefully provides us with clues, but few will guess the outcome until the last chapter. No one is really whom they appear to be and all have dark secrets and unexpected alliances. Unfortunately the assassin/kidnapper starts to develop into a cartoon character with bizarre motives, unlikely skill sets, and unreasonable influence over his co-conspirators.  <br /> <br />Baldacci makes some minor factual errors (he thinks the Impala was a Buick), but nothing worse than a Tom Clancy thriller. In Split Second, the focus is on weaving together a fascinating, intricate, and difficult to solve murder, leaving character development and dialogue for a later day. Even the main character King is poorly developed. We don't know much more than that he is a wine snob who enjoys boats and water, and has rebuilt a life in rural Virginia as a lawyer. In summary, this is a well crafted who-done-it, perfect for the beach or a lazy winter afternoonin front of the fire.
B00005JKED|5.0|Well, I keep reading it was over the top. Hey if everything was \\"real\\" we'd have nothing but documenteries. Denzel's performace was truley amazing. The whole movie kept my full focus. Get down on your knees n that god for a lil mindless violence and a rather well done plot.
B00005MM01|5.0|This is my favourite Donovan album. Actually it was originally a double album box set with beautiful individual colour pages with ink drawings and lyrics printed on each page. Ahh, I really miss vinyl sometimes. The music here is outstanding. The lyrics are lovely, so typical of this gentle poet. The first album contains upbeat pop songs and the second album has quiet, soft ballads. So many of these songs embrace the sea and and there is so much serenity here. If you need to get away fom insanity and want to feel truly peaceful inside, then don't miss this gift from a flower. Bless you, Donovan. I love you.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|this DVD show Dream Theater (DT) live at the historical japanese avenue, the Budokan, at their finest. i think DT have taken their music at another highest after having Rudess on keys, he is much more than just a keyboardist, combining speed, technique, musicality, together with Petrucci, Portnoy and Myung, they expanded their musical level to somewhere that no one had done before. and this DVD show what the best the fivesome can probably do (not the last one, Metropolis 2000, though that feature Rudess as well but the whole DVD is badly produced). <br /> <br />the concert footage consist of 18 songs, 5 from the lastest ablum \\"Train of Thought\\" (As I Am, This Dying Soul, Endless Sacrifice, Stream of Consciousness and In the Name of God), and some old stuff, also a new \\"Instrumedley\\", a combination of some their highly technically instrumental medley from their old songs, neck-breaking solo, breathe-taking unison, head-turning drum works, what else can i say about this... i really can't find one second from the performance that's not satisfying, their performance is no doubt at their finest. <br /> <br />and on disc 2, you'll be amazed that they are much more that a player/musician, they have so much knowledge on their instrument, Rudess's \\"turnable\\" keyboard setup is mind blowing, he even considered about the emergency power supply, and Petrucci's guitar setup is just as stunning, he take care of his instrument to a very subtle detail, not to mention Portnoy monster drumkit and his drum solo...... <br /> <br />DT is no doubt one of the most influential band nowadays, not only because their superb music and musicianship, but also on their devotion on their instruments, fans and the business as well... this DVD will become one of the classic live DVD of all time, don't miss it!!
B00005K3OT|4.0|I love this movie. It has it all... plus Johnny Depp! But even without him, I love the story, and the fabulous actors in this wonderful tale of romance, heartbreak,and quiet heroism. (And I'm a sucker for a happy ending!).<br /><br /> Cuddle up with a mug of hot chocolate (and a few truffles wouldn't hurt). Enjoy. Alone, or with someone, it's great. And the soundtrack will put you in another world.<br /><br />  Gift idea: Make it a theme.Buy the DVD, add some truffles, a canister of imported hot cocoa,and maybe a chocolate scented candle, or whatever else you may think of. WOW!!!
B00005JMUL|3.0|I'm beginning to learn not to trust in previews to give me an accurate sample of what a movie might have to offer, because I've had several movies fail to deliver on preview-induced expectations. I don't think my expectations were terribly high; a warm fuzzy Christmas movie that would be on DVD within a few months, and would become part of the essential holiday viewing, alongside Frosty and Rudolph. Unfortunately, the movie didn't come through. I felt like I'd been on two or three roller coasters, and had been left out of much of the Christmas magic. <br /> <br />PLOT: As you might have heard, two of the three main kids are never named. There is the primary boy (sometimes called Hero Boy,  but I'd call him Doubting Thomas) and the young girl he meets on the train (hereinafter referred to as the Believing Girl) and the somewhat disillusioned boy for whom \\"Christmas just hasn't worked out.\\" All three are invited onboard the Polar Express by The Conductor (Tom Hanks) for a round-trip visit to the North Pole to have their Christmas beliefs confirmed. (Except, the Believing Girl never seems to have lost her faith, so I wonder why she was on board) <br /> <br />GOOD: There is a good deal of Christmas warmth and fuzzy -- but it's kind of scattered. Any movie whose landscape is dominated by lovely, fluffy white snow is somehow attractive, and there's plenty of it to be found. There is a strong message of belief and trust in unseen things, or as the Conductor puts it, \\"sometimes the most real things in the world are the things you can't see.\\" The music is a definite plus, with the sweeping choir lending splendor to the North Pole. (And for Josh Groban fans, his \\"Believe\\" song is featured in the end credits) <br /> <br />BAD/OBJECTIONABLE: I can't necessarily say there is anything BAD per se about this movie, but in several ways, it failed to live up to expectations. There seemed to be a lot of needless foreboding in the film. Hero boy/Doubting Thomas encounters several different dangers, perils and oddments while traveling to the North Pole, including meeting a phantasmal hobo stowaway on the train's roof who is kind of creepy, which happens while he is trying to catch up with a girl who he's been told is going to be thrown off the train, being grabbed by what appears to be the same ghostly apparition for an adrenaline-pumping race on skis down the train as it plummets down a dip in the tracks, very nearly falling off the train, thinking he's about to crash into a mountainside, and being scared by creepy, retired toys in one train car when the wraithlike hobo takes up the strings of one marionette and begins scaring him. As well, he is also frightened when the train skids across a giant lake of ice which has encroached on the tracks. The train is nearly submerged before grasping the tracks. He becomes stuck on board a runaway train car, falls and starts sliding down an enormous chute, and precariously inches his way across a train trestle, perched over miles of empty space. He and his companions then wander through eerily vacant and abandoned areas of the North Pole while trying to rejoin their group. Even the elves (who behave more like they're at a political rally than sending Big Red on his way -- you'd think they get enough of the Big Guy during the year) seem sinister or creepy.  <br /> <br />All of this might potentially frighten youngsters, but also detracts from the magical Christmas spirit that one would expect, leaving you feeling more like you have to catch your breath than snuggle tight those you love. The entire first twenty minutes or so of danger and intrigue while traveling to the North Pole seem absolutely pointless, not to mention wandering. There is some thematic material regarding belief/ non-belief in Santa which some choosy parents may wish to avoid. I think the emphasizing of belief is a good thing, but not when the whole \\"belief\\" part is contingent to children being taken to the North Pole before their beliefs can be confirmed. <br /> <br />THOUGHTS: There were mixed reviews when this film first came out, and now I understand why. I have mixed feelings about the film myself. At times, you're checking your watch and curious why you're sitting there. Then once some of the Christmas magic (perhaps at its strongest with Matthew Hall and Meagan Moore's \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\" song) begins to set in, you're hooked. But then moments come along which snap you out of it, and then you're pulled right back in again; a very up-and-down cycle. Hero boy/Thomas seems left out of a lot of the feeling of magic at the North Pole until the very end, and since we're primarily from his perspective, we're left out as well. I would almost rather have seen it from Believing Girl's point of view, to capture more of the belief and spirit of Christmas. <br /> <br />As far as the animation goes, excellent job all the way around, with only a few moments where the character seemed stoic or unrealistic. <br /> <br />I think any movie should have you talking about it afterwards, but I'm afraid all my siblings and I could do was discuss the upcoming Narnia film. <br /> <br />Conclusion: Mixed feelings, but if you think you want to see it after what you've read, then you'd probably want to.
B0002YLC24|4.0|This is not the romance that \\"Before Sunrise\\" was.  It is about how Celine and Jesse have matured and become more realistic about the world, including love.  While Jesse is still hopeful and optimistic, Celine has become cynical and disappointed in her relationships.  Jesse is even more interesting and inspiring this time.  I would like to be able to see the world from his point of view, except for the bad marriage.  The highlight of \\"Before Sunset\\" is their emotinal outpourings in the back of the limo, chapter 12 on the DVD.  The question is, this time, did Jesse miss his flight?
B0006399FS|4.0|I have to say I'm shocked by the number of people who were so quick to rip apart this latest offering from the greatest active band on the planet, U2.  I'm even more astonished by how many reviewers cannot get past the fact that U2 had the audacity to sound a lot like U2 on this album.  Admittedly, HTDAAB isn't quite up to the ridiculous standards of the Joshua Tree, the Unforgettable Fire, or Achtung Baby for that matter.  But it is another dynamically consistent and satisfying collection of well-crafted and passionate music from a band that's been around longer than most of its reviewers apparently have.      Not that I think any excuses need to be made for this album, but, my message to those who can't accept it at face value because they've obviously set their expectations way too high would be this: Keep in mind that Bono, the Edge, Larry, and Adam are all into their forties at this point.  As we all know, rock and roll was, is and always will be, in essence, a young man's game.  Even still, they are clearly demolishing the majority of bands who are only half their age at it.  And, for a point of reference, need I remind you of what the Rolling Stones were giving us when its members were around the same age that U2's is?  Dirty Work, anyone?  Or who could forget Paul McCartney's effort released when he was 43, Press to Play?  The Kinks were releasing their best album ever with Word of Mouth.  And, yes, Pete Townshend's Iron Man: A Musical was clearly on the same level as the Who's Tommy.  Or not. The point being: Knowing what history has shown we could be getting from U2 at this stage in their career, why are we pounding on them for releasing something THIS good?    Call me crazy, but I still get chills from hearing the combination of Edge's trademark delayed guitar, Adam's steady bass playing, and Larry's thunderous drumming.  Plus, there are few singers in this world with a voice as distinctive and powerful as Bono's - even if it's starting to show a little wear and tear.  Why wouldn't they want to capitalize and showcase these key elements of their sound, instead of burying them like they did on the lifeless and passion-less mess called Pop?  After all, this is a sound that they themselves created.  Do you really need to hear the songs embellished with drum samples and meaningless studio wizardry to make this a more acceptable and less snicker-worthy release?  Must they completely re-invent the wheel on each outing?  Or maybe if the album turned out to be a colossal commercial disappointment and didn't have the iPod connection, it would finally be embraced by serious and \\"hip\\" music fans everywhere as their \\"unheralded masterpiece\\".    The bottom line:  This is a startingly good record...ESPECIALLY for a band that's been at it as long as U2 has.  No, it isn't without a couple missteps, but the majority of the songs on HTDAAB are everything that we've come to expect and crave from U2:  Dripping with emotion, unforgettable, and packed with gigantic hooks.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", in my opinion, may even be among the best songs U2 has ever written.  As for the lyrics on HTDAAB, some of them can be embarrassing...but Bono has always been one to make us scratch our heads and say \\"huh?\\" from time to time.  Still, taken as a whole, HTDAAB is capable of creating the same eerie and atmospheric quality that albums like Unforgettable Fire and Boy had.  It can rock like Achtung Baby did.  And, it can produce lumps in your throat like Joshua Tree did.  For me, that's more than enough.      Don't convice yourself that you couldn't possibly find the room in your heart to enjoy this album; give it a good, honest listen.  You'll be pleasantly surprised with what you find.
0780622545|2.0|This movie has a good premise and an excellent set, but crappy writing! There's no story development. Everything we need to know is told in short bursts. I was annoyed because the movie unfolded without rhyme or reason. The movie felt more like a trailer. And the acting... Sutherland was totally miscast as the scientist. He seemed to be hyperventilating everytime he spoke. \\"The strangers\\" sounded like they ripped off their vocals from The Exorcist. Over-acted and over-rated, that sums it up!  <br />     <br /> <br />
