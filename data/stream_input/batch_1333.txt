086571701X|2.0|Now, before I say -anything- I would like to thank the author for presenting aquaponics in such a concise, clear, and informative fashion. I've been searching the net for months on end gathering information about systems and deciding how and where to build them. This book provided all that and more and I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in the subject. All those five star ratings are for a good reason.  That said, I don't know what happened to the kindle version. I'm working at saving money right now and reducing how much space I take up by selling books and trying to replace them with the kindle books. I've been acquiring a lot of data, and occasionally finding new and interesting things to read in the kindle store.  I say all of this to give a little background on why I'd give such a great book a low rating. On Amazon there are some kindle books that are free, and some kindle books that you pay money for. Generally when you get one for free it's expected to not have the finest formatting available nor is it usually going to have a table of contents. Paragraphs and chapter headings may not be clear. These are all things that I expect from a free or under five dollar kindle title.  I believe I payed around ten dollars for the kindle edition of step by step aquaponics and immediately noticed that there was no table of contents. This is a bit bothersome considering that there are some \\"rules of thumb\\" thoughtfully provided by the author in an appendix that I'm going to have to slog through the entire book just to get to and look at.   Sometimes there are quotes by online users or anecdotes from owner-builders in the text, but due to the lack of quotation marks in many of them I can't tell if it's the author or someone else until I read a page and a half more. It can be genuinely confusing.  Also chapter subheadings often have no space between them and the paragraphs they head, or no indication that they are headings at all just strange general assemblages of words with no punctuation that I have come to assume are headings. I had on instance where I was reading a paragraph and realized a sentence began over again in the middle...  So, once again. I am grateful that this book exists and I have no complaints about the quality of the information presented. But the formatting makes me regret spending the money for the kindle edition.
B0061TQBRK|4.0|This is a very strong group effort by Lacuna Coil. The songs are well written, with very complex and rewarding musical rhythms. This is album is full of great material, and it should satisfy the cravings of long time Lacuna Coil fans. The only complaint I have, is the relatively short length of the album. The whole thing is about 46 minutes in length. many Rock albums released in recent weeks have been 55 minutes or better in length. This is why I rate \\"Dark Adrenaline\\" 4 stars instead of 5. I really like the R.E.M. cover that they do, but one more live version of their newer material would have made this album better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game a really good and great game to pass time with. I would really suggest this for when your on a plane or a car trip.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|this game is so crap hate giving bad reviews but hey it's not my fault it is so lame kids also think it is so boring
B004TTMYQG|5.0|On my HTC G2 I use it just as an app, and on my Iconia I really love the widgets. Highly customizable in both size and  timeframe in both app and widget. This and Thumb Keyboard are my 2 FAOTD I don't know how I would live without. Good to see continued support, although I don't know what else it needs!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|This book was so Amazing as the other two. Loved so much the story of Christian and Anastacia. This book was so emtional. Dont want to spoil it, but beleive me as erotic as they all where really loved the story behind it. Really loved and enjoyed all the different emotions i got out of reading this book and the just the whole series. Wish to read more of Christian and Anastacia
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|bought the item without reading the reviews (I know shame on me) item didnt work. plugged it in and no video/ audio. moved it around and still nothing. removed the swivel adapter and everything worked as normal. Good luck to you if you do buy.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Product excellent, just unable to watch on a German video recorder, had to watch on the PC. A bit of a hassle. Find if the product is officially bought and paid for, it should be able to function everywhere.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I have not had a television since the year 2000, therefore i rarely watch it. But the DVD of this show is spectacular.  If you like to see the \\"bad guys\\" winning, this thing is the cats meow.  I also just love a show where the oppressive, domineering, cheating, cockhold wif is put in her place at least once.  Really, i dont have anything to compare it to but this show is TIT!

B006UAWH2S|4.0|I love watching a loving romance with an intriguing plot. I watched Perfect Sense the other day and I was so moved by it!  I enjoyed watching Michael and Susan fall hopelessly in love with each other.  When a pandemic occurs that robs people of their senses, they are faced with problems neither of them could ever have imagined.  Perfect Sense is an amazing film that really tugs at your heart and allows you to open up emotionally.  This is a great movie that anyone who has ever been in love will appreciate.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free copy of this movie for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.
0439023521|4.0|Summary: NO SPOLIERS!  Our story is set in the future when the US has perished and has been replaced with twelve districts that are run by the Capitol(government system). Every year, two candidates or tributes are chosen from each district to take part in the Hunger Games. The tributes are taken to the Capitol to prepare and are then put into an arena of some sort. It can vary from a stretch of grassland to a desert to a frozen wasteland. The name of the game is to kill everyone else and be the last one standing. The Games are broadcasted and the Gamemakers can manipulate the weather or conjure up a \\"natural disaster\\" to make things more interesting for the viewers.  Review:  I had absolutely no problem getting into this book. I first got a sample and ordered the entire book immediately. I devoured this book but had a few problems with the writing style. Thus the 4 stars. The author's style of writing was getting a little annoying. There are many fragments and it seems to be written more as thoughts than as a literary structure. Later in the book I either got used to it or decided to ignore it all together because it was getting really juicy as there was 5% of the book left and the plot was only intensifying.  One other problem I had was that I believe it is very important that main characters be well liked. Katniss comes across as very selfish and can do no wrong. Everyone else may be wrong, but never her. She even seems to heavily criticize those to whom she owes a great deal.  Apart from those two things, I got through the book in no time. It left a strange impression on me. It scared me. I was terrified of what these characters who seem to come alive on the pages are being put through by the vicious Capitol. Just when you think it can't get anymore twisted... you're proven wrong. The ending is so haunting that you just have to sit back and let is all turn over in your head. It's terrifying because humans are very capable of coming to this. Rome was proof and many more recent events as well. This book will whisper to you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok but its just that having to buy levels with coins is bad I'm only writing this review for 250000 coins
B004P2CQM4|1.0|I bought the EXTREME MODEL (and they charged me for that) and send me the \\"IR\\" version. A total rip off. Never buy anything from this guys.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I really like this app in general. I use on my iPhone, computer and now my Kindle Fire.  Big annoyance on Fire is that there is no icon.  I have uninstalled, reinstalled.  No help.  Also every day it shows up in the updates, but I don't see any difference, and still no Icon, just a white box. FIX THIS PLEASE!
B0068TL23G|5.0|Router takes full advantage of a phone/tablet's touch screen capabilities and implements them in a game that's fun, addictive and absolutely deserves a 'brain-twister' tag. The puzzles - connect pairs of dots and discover the shortest paths - get increasingly difficult to the point that they may seem impossible but they're not. You only need to twist your brain some more.<br /><br />I like the fact that there's no timer - this is a thinking and strategy game not a race. I also like the bright neon color scheme, probably could do without the monotonous 'music' but that can be turned off easily.<br /><br />I love this game for its honest simplicity and for demanding all the brainpower that you can spare to solve the higher level puzzles.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|There are many Sabbath albums that have been at my personal top at different times. Think Born Again might be my new fave. I never realised how good Hot Line (wrote this off because of the title itself, how inane of me) is, classic hard rocking song! For Gillan's high pitched screams alone this album should be one of the top classics in rock. Gives me chills every time he does it. I think he's the star of this album, as much as I adore Tony Iommi.  This album might even be a notch above all the Martin stuff, perhaps even Dehumanizer. And I never liked the first two Dio albums as much...  I'd say this is one of their best and the song Born Again is one of their best songs in every way. Such an emotional and well crafted song. Wish Gillan had stayed in Sabbath, as I never liked Deep Purple.
B0069GRIHW|4.0|This is a good re-release of LA Woman, the alternative versions make it well worth the price.  However,  there are some caveats:  it is missing \\"(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further\\" and \\"Orange County Suite\\",  and the more seriously,  the version of \\"Cars Hiss by My Window\\" lacks the long-missing fourth verse.  These omissions prevent this from being the definitive LA Woman release that it could have been, and that's why I cannot give this more than four stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this GAME! works well with kindle fire. I love the feature where I can have it deal a random deal or a winning deal.
B000C24I7M|5.0|I first got this book, when it was first published, as a present for my son.  Now he has taken it with him.  This copy has the audiobook CD in a pocket in the front.  Read by Liam Neeson, it adds a beautiful voice to the beauty of the pictures.  There is no question as to why this book got an award, and the audio CD adds to that.
0062060554|4.0|Several other readers have provided detailed accounts of the basic premise of this engaging suspense novel: a woman wakes up in a strange bed with an unfamiliar man, who tells her she had an accident affecting her memory and they've been married for 25 years. It turns out, she has a peculiar form of amnesia that allows her to remember very little of her past, but to form new memories throughout the day until she sleeps and it all starts over.<br /><br />Here I just want to offer a quick response, focusing on what I found to be most unique about this story, one I found to be quite gripping even if I thought the end wrapped things up a bit too neatly and the \\"twist\\" that it was clearly aiming for a bit too predictable.<br /><br />The story focuses on how she began to overcome the confusion induced by the fragmentary state of her memory, by beginning to write down what happened to her and what she could occasionally recall in a journal. In some ways it's a gimmick, that's been done before and familiar, but it's what Watson does with it that makes this novel emotionally engaging, suspenseful, and intellectually intriguing. At the heart of the story, and what I found to be most intriguing throughout, is the question how much our identities are bound up with memory. Just how much of a sense of self can be formed, artificially, in the process of writing it down? How much of our identity is fiction, a product of the very attempt to fabricate a coherence and purpose to the course of our lives through narrative construction?<br /><br />This is the kind of realistic fiction I like to read for pleasure: easy to read and both emotionally engaging and intellectually thrilling.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The app was fun but, some games are hard to complete. Once you get to a point the games are more points and harder to unlock.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I have owned these things for less than 6 months and the mic broke and today the left ear cup broke where it swivels. These things sound good but for the money they are totally cheap. I would not advise someone to purchase these and look else were.  these things have some nice features but the overall value is a rip off.
0786955554|5.0|Pros:  Durable, attractive, useful for almost any constructed<br />dungeon (not caves), can be built into semi-3D structures by putting books under them etc.  Great value!  Box is two big tiles!<br /><br />Cons:  Take longer to set up than drawing out a map on a Chessex battlemat.  That's my only complaint.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This was an excellent movie! I love the characters and how mysterious and romantic the movie was, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, exspecially if they like the musical type movies!
6301744136|5.0|This movie is a delight!  For years my husband has used the quote \\"Number 5 is alive.\\" What can be better than a good robot bringing together two kind humans.  My order arrived quickly and safely.  I would comfortably make purchases from this vendor.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|This 2 CD set should be mandatory for any music fan and every Beach Boys fan.  I've purchased previous Smile compilations, but this one is perfect and so gorgeous.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|After seeing the film, and having visited Hawaii several times, this music was a must have for me.  Listening to this soundtrack puts me right back at the movie theatre watching a stirring movie, and provokes the feeling of putting my feet on the Islands.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|How can this have reviews when it doesn't even release until 1/31/12 ??? Seems kinda funny to me that this 3D version has reviews when it isn't even on the market yet.
0307891372|5.0|Lost? Don't know where to go? Get this book for skyrim. Just do it. You need it. This is a very detailed book, it has everything in it, a few typos but that's about it. Get it now or else
B0068TL23G|4.0|Very touchy redo icon. Can't redo a line once another one is made; must remove every line drawn in opposite order you drew them. You should be able to edit a line already drawn. This is frustrating after you've drawn your fifth line and you need to fine tune your first line by one square. Also annoying when you accidentally make an unnecessary line just before you connect to the other ball. Also, this game would be much easier if I could see through my finger!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works exactly as it should!  Love not having to shuffle real cards.  Wonderful way to kill time!  Fun fun fun fun!!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is great for the Kindle Fire.  I love everything about it except it doesn't offer a portrait stand orientation, (only landscape).  My wife spent twice as much at Wal-Mart for a cover that doesn't provide near the protection.  She is suffering from severe case-envy now.  Materials are excellent and after 6 weeks of use, it doesn't show a sign of wear.
B0068TL23G|1.0|Kindle Fire user.  Couldn't get the game to progress past the initial &quot;Select a ball&quot; screen.  Literally, nothing happened.  As a result, I had to force the app closed.  Features graphics that aren't terrible, but aren't anything special, either.  What little graphics I saw, anyway.  I'm deleting it.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is addicting and I haven't found many negatives yet. It challenges you to keep figuring out how it goes. I only wish there was a way save your puzzles so you can always go back to the solution if you get stuck again. Overall it is a fun game.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game had an old school look to, but it is  surprisingly fun to play. Retro colors combined with making one use their brain, makes this FAOTD a winner for young and older alike.

B003V4AK8E|2.0|As a person that has always used my XBOX360 for games and PS3 for movies, I was a bit excited about the possibility of using and XBOX360 styled controller for the PS3. Looking at reviews, I saw that some users had complaints about 'dead-zones' in the joysticks. I figured I would still give it a chance, boy do I wish I would have avoided it altogether.<br /><br />The controller uses a USB dongle to connect to the PS3. Due to this, there is a ever so slight delay between the user input and the PS3s response. While playing Skyrim, this wasn't a problem, however once the FPS games are started, the controller becomes unusable and something that should be fun, becomes unbelievably frustrating.<br /><br />Due to this, I was forced to return my controller and keep searching elsewhere for a controller that actually works for the PS3.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have received a number of compliments on this cover.  Everyone things it really is a BOOK, not a kindle fire cover!  It is soft but sturdy, and just so classy!  One of my best purchases.
1401323820|5.0|I received a book for christmas, Richard Castle's HEAT RISES.  I was extatic!  However, I didn't want to read the books out of order. I ordered HEAT WAVE and immediately sat down that evening to indulge.  Mind you, I am NOT the stereotypical book worm.  I'm a mechanic.  Very seldom do you catch me reading ANYTHING but a service manual or some car magazine.  I couldn't put the book down.  It ties into the TV series pretty easy. I can totally visualize the characters from the TV show in my mind as I read the book.  If you are a fan of the show, you will enjoy the book.  Gotta go, my copy of NAKED HEAT is here.....

B004X6PRO6|5.0|When I see reviews entitled something like \\"A Masterpiece\\" on Amazon, I often suspect they're hyperbole.  But I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one of the best books I've ever read, and as a compulsive reader for over 20 years, that's saying something.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, the novel starts much like you'd expect a novel about North Korea: it's foreign, bleak and disturbing.  The first part of the book introduces us to Pak Jun Do -- the Orphan Master's Son of the title -- and it progresses steadily until you think you know what to expect from this novel.  But at the end of Part I (about 25% through) the author shifts the story so surprisingly, so audaciously, I couldn't help but pay closer attention.  Once I was hooked, I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />The Orphan Master's Son is one of those great novels, like The Life of Pi, that's both accessible and profound.  It takes you to emotional places you didn't think you'd go, and yet by the end it all seems inevitable that you'd end up there.  The author also did an incredible job rendering every nuance of the North Korean social climate.  It's as if someone who lived there all his life wrote The Orphan Master's Son.<br /><br />Mr. Johnson's storytelling is so masterful, it took me back to the feeling I had when I first fell in love with reading.  I imagine this hauntingly beautiful novel will stay with me for many years.
0679746048|5.0|I don't recommend reading if you have an unstable mind, it definitely gets you thinking about everything.Really good, and it's strongly comparable to the movie.I seriously enjoyed the book, think others would too. If you haven't yet, buy it. delivery was 3 day max.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this because it say it had 101 banes ht to my dissapointed,you have to complete games to get them. I like the games,they are pretty entertaining.but very Bsd quality and no instructions I think this is an ok app since it is free.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 6/15/10  Scissor Sisters have been away for four years. That's like a lifetime for pop groups. Turns out, it took them that long to create what could be their masterpiece. In a career of strong albums, Night Work easily eclipses their last effort and gives their debut a run for its money. Blazingly energetic and, most importantly, consistent, it's the rare pop album that works all the way through. Pop is well and truly back!  1. Night Work - Kicks off the album with a blast. Full-on 80's dance guitars and a propulsive beat combine with wistful vocals about a life lived after the sun goes down. One of the strongest, most instant tracks. It reminds me, in parts, of Prince's 80's output. 10/10  2. Whole New Way - Jake uses his distinctive Laura vocals on this funky midtempo. And speaking of Prince, this vocal style reminds me of his Sign o' the Times era alter-ego Camille. The middle-eight here is wonderfully dramatic. 9/10  3. Fire With Fire - The album's big anthem, and the closest to approaching the Elton-esque pop of their last album. It's also the closest the album gets to a ballad, though the chugging euro-beat keeps things moving. A brilliant, soaring single. 10/10  4. Any Which Way - A huge disco track with stabbing strings, a dramatic siren opening and a welcome, campy spoken interlude from Ana. It's got everything a Scissor Sisters track should have. The Filthy/Gorgeous of this album, though not quite as classic. 9/10  5. Harder You Get - A hard-rock, 80's pastiche with smutty, spoken verses and a stick-in-your-head (or somewhere else...) hook. The blazing guitar solo towards the end is a new (and thrilling) diversion for the band. 9/10  6. Running Out - Probably the most 80's inspired track, it reminds me of album-producer Trevor Horn's work with his band the Buggles. It works wonderful as a duet, and the herky-jerky chorus is completely addicting. Jake sounds like John Cameron Mitchell at points. One ofmy favorites. 10/10  7. Something Like This - Another highlight, though it's completely different from the last track. The band do robo-electro-funk surprisingly well. The lyrics are throwaway, yet somehow quite stirring in their simplicity. It demands to be a single. 10/10  8. Skin This Cat - This took me the longest to come around to. Now I look at it more as an interlude, segueing between the earlier tracks and the epic string of songs that end the album. It's got an icy electro thump to it, though Ana's vocals aren't quite enough to support the entire song. Still, a grower. 8/10  9. Skin Tight - An anthem, like Fire With Fire, with the melody up front. The bridge is exhilarating, leading into a powerful, singalong chorus. Jake sounds world-conquering, and it segues perfectly into the next track. 10/10  10. Sex And Violence - A dark, electronic opus with a flawless melody and even better production. Jake's vocal performance, subtler and more mysterious here, deserves more praise than it'll probably get. And those seesaw synths throughout are PERFECTION. 10/10  11. Night Life - Ridiculously catchy, like the energy of a rave smashed into a pop song. The percolating verses are Ana at her best and the Jake-fronted chorus compliments them perfectly. You will be singing this one. 10/10  12. Invisible Light - What can I say about this that hasn't been said before? The last two minutes, with the Ian McKellen vocals and the instrumental climax, are among the best work the band has ever done. This is an instant classic. A massive achievement. 10/10  Album Grade: 9.6/10
B003L77G8I|5.0|When BONES first started out, I admit I was HIGHLY skeptical.  I was a fan of Kathy Reich's books and lets face it, Emily looks nothing like the character.  She seemed too glamorous and elegant! And the setting was out of whack, not at all like the books.  But I quickly became a fan!  The ensemble cast works well together and seems to me to be friends, which adds to the cachet.  I like it that one time characters ended up a semi permanent part of the story line, reappearing often.  And I found Temperance's quirks endearing...I've done the manuscript work for PHD's and know how they can be!  That she is so beautiful and glamorous and has these single minded quirks makes her fun to watch.  The other characters story lines are developed so watching a show is like catching up with a bunch of friends, but with a good story thrown in as well. I've gotten every one of the series, and when I can no longer see it on tv, I'll have it to revist again and again.  I'm not fond of many of the 'hot' programs and tend to buy up series I like so I can go back and enjoy them (LIFE and LOST being two in question).  It takes something special to make me not want to do something else on the night a tv program is on no matter if I can HULU it or not later.  BONES does that.
B002M9FWQE|3.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 9/24/09**  1. We Are Golden - The first single, this really represents the direction that I hoped that this album would go. Big, bombastic, choral. I still love this track, though maybe not as much as I did a month or so ago. The album version has a slightly longer ending. It doesn't really change anything. 10/10  2. Blame It On The Girls - Beginning with an unnecessary spoken bit, the track quickly launches into a stomping, singalong dance track. Among the more addictive material on the album, this is the next single (or so I've heard). 9/10  3. Rain - The Stuart Price produced masterpiece of the album, this is a thrilling, lush electronic dance track that uses Mika's sometimes grating vocals to their best effect. Definitely the Relax of this album. 10/10  4. Dr. John - A campy, Elton John-esque uptempo track that fluctuates between endearing fun and annoying filler each time I listen to it. Right now I'm quite liking it, though. 7/10  5. I See You - The middle-of-the-road ballad of the album. There is one later on that's much better and one that's worse, so I guess this is just sorta there. Background vocals are nice, though. 6/10  6. Blue Eyes - I loved this song on the Songs For Sorrow EP and was slightly irritated to find it on the album rather than a new song, but it's still very nice. A breezier, more organic sound. 8/10  7. Good Gone Girl - Certainly catchy, but it also represents the annoying part of Mika's shtick. It's a little theatrical. And by little, I mean dramatically. Now I love drama in music, but this is a little annoying. 5/10  8. Touches You - This is more like it! Back to the choral sound of the first track, this isn't quite as strong, but the drama in this one feels more appropriate. It's got a harder edge to it. I like that. 8/10  9. By The Time - This is the ballad I was talking about earlier, the best of the bunch by far. Very pretty melody on this one, and one of Mika's best slower songs. His voice sounds very nice here. 9/10  10. One Foot Boy - Another very catchy uptempo track with some great, subtle hooks. I'll repeat the word subtle, because of all the uptempo tracks here this one doesn't call attention to itself. It's more addicting because of that. 9/10  11. Toy Boy - This worked alright on the EP, but it's a little annoying here. Again, it's Mika's theatricality at its most grating. Putting the lyrics aside, it sounds like it was written for a Disney move in the 1950's. 6/10  12. Pick Up Off The Floor - This is the other ballad I was talking about earlier, the one that doesn't work so well. Honestly, I skip it most of the time. The falsetto is irritating and there's not enough of a melody to keep me coming back for more. 4/10  13. Loverboy - Slightly better, though this feels very much like a b-side (I believe it was, earlier, wasn't it?). It's uptempo, I guess, but devoid of energy. Not a favorite. 5/10  Album Grade: 7.4/10

B003Y5H5FG|3.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 8/23/11**  Fright Night was not a movie I was planning to see a few weeks ago. But then I started hearing such great things from critics and others that I had to give it a whirl. Plus, each year around this time there seems to be a supernatural-type film that makes no money at the box office but becomes a personal favorite (last year it was the brilliant Let Me In, still one of my favorite movies of the past few years, and before that it was Jennifer's Body). I was hoping this would follow suit, even though I knew nothing about the original. I was going into this one cold. Honestly, that's kind of how I left the theater, too.  The main frustration I had with the film is that it kept reeling me in only to let me down. It was like the peaks on a roller coaster. One moment I'd be all excited, the next I'd be slouched back in my seat, daydreaming. To compare similar movies, in 2007 Disturbia managed to keep me hooked throughout. It's a hard thing to do. The problem with this one is that tension isn't allowed to build because the big reveal/mystery is pretty much spoiled in scene one. We know the creepy neighbor's a vampire, so what follows is basically your standard teen suspense film.  However, the action sequences are frequently inspired, particularly an encounter on a dark Vegas highway and a scene in the middle of the film that, without giving too much away, subverts audience expectations and ends with a wonderfully sick surprise (and I'm not easily surprised). Colin Farrell makes an incredibly unnerving villain, and when he--and others--vamp up, they look pretty damn awesome. These aren't your friendly, sparkly vamps. There's a constant danger surrounding the film. The supporting cast, filled with familiar faces, is pretty strong too.  I was less impressed with the casting of the lead. I've liked Anton Yelchin in Star Trek, Charlie Bartlett and Terminator: Salvation, but for me he was totally miscast in this role. I don't feel like he carried the film the way that he needed to, and I felt no connection to his character. It's crazy, because I really like this actor. Something just didn't click. David Tennant (of Doctor Who fame) is much more effective.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 12/6/11**  It's hard to judge a Nightwish album. In many ways, they're operating so far above other acts that it seems unfair to use the same scale to rate them. Like their last album, there's nothing here that hasn't been exquisitely crafted. The band continue to experiment with genres, and it's natural that every experiment won't fully click with every listener. So, where the band gets docked points is only where their experiments didn't click with me. But make no mistake, this is one of the albums of the year. No doubt about that.  1. Taikatalvi - An intro, sung in Finnish and setting the tone for the album. Nice, but I won't rate an intro.  2. Storytime - The first single, and not only one of the best tracks on the album but also one of the best songs of the year. It's absolutely massive yet still instantly catchy. This represents the sound that Nightwish do best. 10/10  3. Ghost River - Continuing with an experimental theatrical sound, this is slightly less instant. The riffs that open the track are amazing and I love the use of the children's choir, but the melody isn't as strong as the last track. 9/10  4. Slow, Love, Slow - A jazz number (!). It's brilliant for what it is, but I'm afraid this kind of music just isn't my thing. Maybe it would fit better later in the album, but right here I just feel like it kills the energy. Anette sounds great, though. 8/10  5. I Want My Tears Back - Now we're back! Mixing elements of hair metal, folk, rock and pop into a ridiculously inventive gumbo, you've got to hear this to believe it. The melody is among the most instant on the album, and then the track goes totally off the rails with a blistering instrumental. 10/10  6. Scaretale - More experimental with its song structure, of all the songs this sounds the most like a Tim Burton film. It's more like a freaky carnival circus than an actual song, but that's okay because it's just demented enough to be fun. A little long, maybe, but otherwise awesome. 9/10  7. Arabesque - It's all about the drums in this instrumental. It's a refreshing palette cleanser between songs and a dramatic focal point in its own right. 10/10  8. Turn Loose The Mermaids - A classic folk ballad with a beautiful, if familiar, melody. Anette sings this and does so very well. Not my favorite ballad on the album, but a close second. 10/10  9. Rest Calm - Probably the darkest/heaviest track on the album and, because of that, not a favorite of mine. I like the verses better than the chorus, and I think I'd like it more if the track wasn't so long. It's totally fine, just not a standout. 8/10  10. The Crow, The Owl And The Dove - My favorite ballad and rumored to be the next single. It's one of the poppier tracks on the album, while still maintaining a folk sensibility. It's a beautiful duet with a melody that I can't get out of my head. 10/10  11. Last Ride Of The Day - Now this is epic. It's similar in sound to Storytime, but might be even better. The choir is used brilliantly, and that moment we get the key change with the layered vocals? Epic! 10/10  12. Song Of Myself - Another ridiculously epic track, and the longest song on the album at nearly fourteen minutes. The latter half is a spoken poem, but the first half is pure bombast. One of the best things you'll hear this year. 10/10  13. Imaginaerium - An instrumental recap of several of the songs from the album. It's the closing credits for their upcoming movie. Here, it's a perfect capper to one of the year's best albums. 10/10  Album Grade: 9.5/10

B003IPC5SO|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 6/30/10**  In some ways, Kylie Minogue has had the quintessential pop career. She's gone from cheesy pop to indie artiness and back again. Aphrodite winks knowingly at her 80's past while at the same time moving things forward. It's very much the \\"carefree pop album\\" we've been promised. It's not perfect, but there are certainly glimpses of pop perfection throughout.  1. All The Lovers - The best-possible Kylie comeback single I could've hoped for. It's exactly the type of music I love from her. Shimmering and otherworldly, this is pure euphoria. Gorgeous. 10/10  2. Get Outta My Way - An obvious second single, and more uptempo and commercial than the opening track. Still, the melody is one of the strongest on the album (especially the chorus) and the production is suitably huge. 10/10  3. Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love) - Another highly commercial dance track, but not quite as strong as the last one. The chorus is catchy, for sure, but lacks the staying power of the last two tracks. Still, it sounds great played loud. 9/10  4. Closer - I didn't love this on first listen, but it's grown on me immensely. It's an odd little powder keg of a song, more a sonic vignette than a proper pop track. The hypnotic production is quite something. There's a great tension throughout. 9/10  5. Everything Is Beautiful - About as pop as pop gets, this is all about the melody -- and it's a good one. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a (very successful) single. It's got that polished sound to it. 9/10  6. Aphrodite - Completely different than anything else on the album, this hard, 90's-influenced dance track is pretty spectacular. The hook alone packs more of a punch than any of the other tracks. I can't help but think that this is the comeback single she should have released several years ago. 10/10  7. Illusion - One of the weaker tracks. The best part of it is the catchy synth hook that plays at the beginning and repeats throughout. The rest of it is pleasant, but slightly forgettable. 8/10  8. Better Than Today - A midtempo, new-wavey stomper that relies on a strong melody and a huge 80's influence. It's one of the best songs on the album and would make a terrific single choice. 10/10  9. Too Much - The last perfect song on here, it's a synth-heavy, aggressive track with shades of Calvin Harris (who worked on this) and several different melodies throughout. The chorus is slightly bonkers, but in the best way possible. Probably the most current-sounding song on here. 10/10  10. Cupid Boy - A hypnotic, high-pitched electro track. It's pretty throughout, but gets a little lost in the shuffle. I love how the chorus builds into a wall of synths, though. 8/10  11. Looking For An Angel - Opens with a string section, which carries on throughout the track. It's a very wistful, lush sound with vocals that hearken back to some of Minogue's 90's work. It's another song I didn't like so much at first, but I've really come around to. 9/10  12. Can't Beat This Feeling - Old-school, cheesy dancepop. It's certainly a reminder of where she started, though compared to the rest of the album it's slightly underwhelming as a closing track. I like the retro synths, but it's all a bit frantic. 7/10  Album Grade: 9.1/10

B005IZLPMY|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 7/27/11**  Growing up, I was a huge Marvel Comics guy. Like many comic geeks, my battle line was well and truly defined. It was Marvel all the way... no DC (except Batman... sometimes). And even though I'm \\"grown up\\" now, I still anticipate each Marvel movie release with great excitement. After all, throughout the past few years, they've had a pretty dynamite track record.  And they've done it again. Despite loving (and knowing every little aspect about) the Marvel Universe as a kid, Captain America was never one of my favorite characters. That being said, they've just made the perfect Captain America movie. I'm not saying it's a perfect movie, but I can't imagine anything better being fashioned from this character's story. It easily ties X-Men: First Class as my favorite comic book movie of the summer.  The film works so well for so many different reasons. For one, it has an ultra appealing lead actor and a main character with equal parts heart, humor and symbolism. It also features a charismatic (and truly badass) villain in the Red Skull (played by the always reliable Hugo Weaving). This was one of my main quibbles with Thor earlier this year, and definitely Green Lantern last month. A hero's only as good as its villain. Bonus points for the make-up job. Very, very cool.  Best of all, the movie's old-fashioned in the best possible way. True, the vast majority of the story takes place in the 1940's (and the parts that don't are pretty dang awesome), but like X-Men was, this is a heavily stylized setting, amping up reality to create a comic-book vibe that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet honors the story's roots at the same time. Most tellingly, the story itself has a good old-fashioned feel to it. The inevitable crash boom bang parts are there, but they're sandwiched within a story with characters you actually care about. One of my fears going into the theater was that this was going to turn out to be aboring trudge through history. Not so. I had an absolute blast. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie ups Captain America tenfold in the superhero pop culture pantheon. He's like Superman, but relatable. Oh, and stay for the end credits.

B005R5U5B2|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/28/11**<br /><br />Though they've got a lot of competition in the UK, One Direction have released the best boyband album of the year by a mile. Not only that, but it's one of the best pop albums of 2011 as well. It's that rare case of a record where every track could be a single. Couple that with the guys' insane popularity and I think we've got a new Take That on our hands. Or at the very least, a new Mcfly.<br /><br />1. What Makes You Beautiful - Their big, breakthrough single. This is the type of unabashed power pop that manages to cross audiences and appeal to everyone. It's everything these guys should be doing, and one of the year's best singles. 10/10<br /><br />2. Gotta Be You - This, on the other hand, should never have been a single. It's a nice song and a great album track, but there are stronger ballads on here. It does have a very Christmassy sound, though. 9/10<br /><br />3. One Thing - Basically What Makes You Beautiful Part II, which explains why it's the next single. Same writers, similar production, and nearly as catchy. This could end up being the band's defining sound. 10/10<br /><br />4. More Than This - Probably the best ballad on here. It's got a mature, classic sound to it and a wonderful melody with the expected boyband lyrics. Niall sounds especially excellent here. If this isn't a future single, it's a real shame. 10/10<br /><br />5. Up All Night - An uptempo, catchy track with more of a rock sound. It borders on the novelty side of things, but I really love the Def Leppard-esque refrain at the end of the chorus and all the little hooks that run through the track. As with most tracks on the album, it's a ready-made single. 9/10<br /><br />6. I Wish - Melody is the focus here, as this is one of the more mature sounding tracks on the album. It's got a throwback sound--a little rock, a little country. It doesn't initially stand out, but becomes better each time you hear it. 10/10<br /><br />7. Tell Me A Lie - This is such a ready-made hit. Written for (by?) Kelly Clarkson, it sounds a lot like My Life Would Suck Without You (which, ironically, the boys sang on X-Factor). If they really want to break America, this is the song to release. It's one of their absolute best. 10/10<br /><br />8. Taken - Another ballad, this is a Harry-centric track. It reminds me of something that Hanson would record, and that is no bad thing. It has a very organic feel. 9/10<br /><br />9. I Want - Probably my least favorite track on the album. It was written by Mcfly and has Queen-esque guitars in it, which should be a great thing. But the melody and lyrics just seem too obvious. Not bad by any standards, but not amazing either. 7/10<br /><br />10. Everything About You - Ushering in the dancier part of the album, this is a propulsive, repetitive radio track. Maybe a tad too repetitive, but I guess that's sort of the point. It's instantly catchy, for sure. 8/10<br /><br />11. Same Mistakes - The final ballad, and it's a great one. The melody really appeals to me. It's got an interesting sound that somehow feels a lot more indie than the other tracks on the album. 10/10<br /><br />12. Save You Tonight - The band's RedOne collaboration, and it's totally RedOne by numbers. That being said, the song's grown immensely on me. The chorus is still a bit underwhelming, but I love the bridge and verses. 8/10<br /><br />13. Stole My Heart - What a way to end the album! Over a Dynamite-esque beat, the guys have taken the current trend of electro-dance and perfected it. The chorus and production are ridiculous. This needs to be a single! 10/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 9.2/10
1594744769|4.0|This book seems to polarize opinion in the way that most bestsellers do. I'd been hearing about this one in librarian circles for a bit before it exploded into the mass market consciousness, and decided it was worth a buy solely due to what I knew about the story. While the book carries a couple of substantial flaws, I enjoyed it about as much as I expected to, rational criticism be damned.  Jacob Portman spent his childhood in the thrall of his grandfather's amazing stories, and the bizarre photographs that were displayed as proof of them. Even as Jacob grows into a sullen teenager, the unlikely recollections of a magical island where kids could float and lift boulders exerted a strange, nostalgic pull on him. On the night of his grandfather's unexpected death, Jacob sees something impossible lurking in the night. Determined to find out once and for all if his grandfather was crazy (and whether he is heading down the same path, himself), Jacob ventures to the remote, supposedly magical Welsh island that sheltered his grandfather from the Nazis during World War II. Expecting to find closure, Jacob instead discovers that the weird tales and photos made more sense than he realized.  The first half of this book was absolutely perfect, as far as I was concerned. The writing is fantastic and the macabre mood is established and maintained with subtle skill. The full-page photos, genuine oddities around which Riggs wrote the book, are a nice gimmick and add a dark weirdness. Between all of this and the sinister-looking cover of the book, I think a lot of people got tripped up on the notion that this is a horror story. It certainly feels that way at the beginning, but before long, the plot takes a left turn and becomes a mishmash of superhero fantasy and standard YA action. The transition is pretty seamless, from a technical standpoint, but it takes some adjustment for readers who were expecting more horror or mystery.  Unfortunately, though I didn't mind this new focus inthe second half of the book, the writing didn't work nearly as well past the halfway mark. The photographs that were so effective in the beginning, when the story and characters were being established, started to feel a little shoehorned in once the action got going. While some of the characters felt genuine, others seemed inconsistent or shallow. Emma in particular seemed a bit halfhearted in her characterization, which is kind of a big problem to have with your love interest. Worst of all, the ending of the book is decidedly weak, possessing a distinct episodic feel. \\"Want to know what happens next? Tune in next time!\\" For all of its charm, this book simply does not carry its weight as a standalone book, from a story perspective.  Still, the creepy wonder that suffuses the beginning of the book made a lasting impact on me. This is one of those rare books that captured me so thoroughly with its premise and atmosphere that I forgave more than I usually would in the actual plot. It is definitely not a perfect book, and its novelty doesn't quite balance out its problems in execution. However, it is an extraordinarily fun book with an evocative setting, a slick presentation, and a genuinely interesting angle in the antique photos. The writing style is definitely skewed towards teen readers (and Riggs does a great job in capturing an authentic teen voice, at least in Jacob's case), but this is a worthy read for anyone with a taste for gothic adventure. I look forward to the next book, even if I am annoyed that I don't really have a choice in the matter.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 10/11/11**  Real Steel is the kind of movie you can predict at nearly every turn, yet it really doesn't matter. Though it's not quite my favorite film of the year, it made me feel more ecstatic at its end than any other movie of 2011. To borrow a cliché, it's the \\"feel good movie of the year.\\" I feel so dirty typing those lame words, but it's true.  Yes, if you've seen a boxing movie or a family drama, you've pretty much experienced this story already, but it's such a powerful, archetypal tale. And Real Steel tells it perfectly. Every good boxing movie needs some secret weapons. This one's got two. First, the robots. Dear god, the robots. They are so frickin' cool. Each one featured has its own look and personality to match, but it's Atom, the \\"protagonist\\" robot, that really gets under your skin. In a lot of ways, this is a \\"boy and his robot story,\\" and Atom's got just enough humanity to make him feel real. The special effects are jaw-dropping, so jaw-dropping that you'll forget you're watching something from a computer. Best of all, they're present to serve the story... not the other way around.  But as kickass as the robots are, the movie's real strength lies in its leads. Hugh Jackman's played variations on his Real Steel character before and, perhaps because of that, has it down pat. He's clearly enjoying himself, which translates to the screen. The arc his character goes through is expected, but so satisfying. There's a bit at the end that totally got me. Just the look on his face. You'll know what I mean when you see it. Then there's young Dakota Goyo. Where do I begin? I've gotta be honest and say that the trailers for this movie made him out to be the typical, annoying Hollywood kid. It's a disservice, because his performance in this movie is nothing short of astonishing. He's got more charisma than any kid actor I've seen in a long time and really, really commits to his scenes. Most of the tears I shed (and there were quite a few... I'm an ultra sappy moviegoer if the movie is right) were doen to him. I just can't believe that such a young kid can take over a film like this. It really was his from the moment he was onscreen.  So there you go. See it. It's the kind of the movie that's so much better than you'd expect given the premise. Don't expect a reinvention of the wheel, but go in to see those established wheels spinning quite productively and passionately. It's a crowd pleaser, for sure.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this show, because I haven't seen many TV shows that did the musical number thing well. But \\"Smash\\" pulled it off. It's the classic \\"show within a show\\" story, which helps a lot. One of my favorite musicals is \\"Kiss Me, Kate\\" which is a classic of that genre.<br /><br />My wife and I loved the pilot. The characters are interesting, the writing is clever, and there's a good balance of drama and humor. And the song and dance numbers are certainly worthy of Broadway. I read that Spielberg said if the show does well that he wants to actually take the show to Broadway. It would be interested to see if that happens.<br /><br />Give this show a chance. You might get hooked.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 5/31/11**  Not much more can be said about this album, really. In the pop world, it's easily the most anticipated of the year. In fact, I can't remember an artist able to elicit such anticipation since the days of the Jacksons, Madonna, Prince, etc. That may sound like overkill, but there really hasn't been an event record like this in years. The closest thing would have been some of the releases of the late 90's, early 00's teen pop boom, but I think this is even bigger. So does the album hold up to the hype? Let's see.  1. Marry The Night - Opens with a theatrical, slow-burning vocal before blasting into an insanely unstoppable dance beat. As far as the album's concerned, it's one of the more traditional sounding tracks. It only descends into madness at the very end (which coincidentally is the best part) 10/10  2. Born This Way - The first single, which has experienced a resurgence in my eyes since it was released. The lyrics are simplistic, yet somewhat controversial because of it. This will end up as one of 2011's biggest singles and represents a shift in Gaga's music to something more universal and stadium ready. 10/10  3. Government Hooker - A departure from the first two tracks, this brittle number uses a simple casio beat as its base, upon which Gaga vamps and yells. It's rather experimental to be placed so early in the running order, but rewards with repeated listens. 10/10  4. Judas - The second single, which should have been a much bigger hit than it was. Essentially Bad Romance Pt. II, this improved the more I listened to it. Deceptively simple, yet with enough staying power to match that thunderous beat. 10/10  5. Americano - A complete shift in town, this Mexican-inspired track is probably the most theatrical on here. It's great (and slightly mental) in its own right, but I find myself skipping it in the context of the album. 8/10  6. Hair - The first of several rock/pop/dance hybrids, this is anenormous stadium belter with a similar message to the title track. As a song, it's even more successful. One of the best melodies on the album, with jackhammer production and a message that busts through the silliness of the lyrics. 10/10  7. Scheiße - One of the definite standouts, this pulsing club track segues between spoken German and English. It has one of the simplest melodies, but a wicked chorus and a general sense of craziness that pulls you back for more. 10/10  8. Bloody Mary - A demented semi-ballad with some truly unique production. This is that \\"avante garde\\" piece on the album, and comes just in time to slow things down a bit. 10/10  9. Black Jesus + Amen Fashion - The first of the deluxe version's three bonus tracks, and also my favorite. Moves between autobiographical lyrics and dance music nonsense, but benefits by fantastic, understated production and a great melody. 10/10  10. Bad Kids - Another standout. This was one of my initial favorites, and remains so. I love the use of guitar and the surging verses. Very 80's, but in the best way possible. 10/10  11. Fashion Of His Love - Even more 80's. The production's too cluttered, and this sounds far more like Madonna than the title track, but it's still pleasant filler. 8/10  12. Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) - A psychedelic, bombastic arena rocker that's more than a little silly. It's the kind of sound that I'd hoped she'd attempt, yet falls just a little short of what I think is possible. It's almost too brash and chaotic and could do with some finessing. Still, it's by no means a song to skip. 9/10  13. Heavy Metal Lover - Back to straight-up dance pop, though with a softer, more European flavor this time around. It doesn't stand out much amongst everything else on here, but it's a great track nonetheless. 9/10  14. Electric Chapel - This sounds a lot like Billy Idol's White Wedding, which is a huge complement. The synth/guitar combo is exactly the sound she's pushing throughout the album, and this is one of the best examples of that. An instant hit. 10/10  15. The Queen - The last \\"bonus track,\\" and probably the weakest. I like the melody, but the lyrics are pretty weak. I'm not sure why \\"b*tch\\" is censored in the bridge, as it sounds quite strange to me. The song does provide a fantastic segue into the next one, though. 8/10  16. Yoü And I - The only non-electronic track on the album, though it's given full stadium-stomper power ballad production thanks to Mutt Lange. It would be a great song no matter how it was produced, even though it feels a little out of place here. 9/10  17. The Edge Of Glory - Quite possibly Gaga's best song to date. This encompasses everything that works about this album in one track. The production is stellar, but it's the anthemic melody that really sets this apart. It's hard to imagine a better US single this year. 10/10  Album Grade: 9.5/10
B002ZG980U|5.0|I'm not going to give anything away. I won't mention any plot details at all. I'll just say you have to turn off your phone, send the kids to grandma's, and pay attention to this movie to follow it. If you do, you will be taken on a mind-stretching journey. There is so much garbage out there these days that does nothing but wow you with special effects (or try to). It's great to see the special effects backed up by superb writing and at least one deep character. Excellent all around.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 10/4/11**  In addition to loving their debut back in the 90's, I've always taken these guys more seriously than most. Europop is a genre just like any other, and Aqua know how to use it to its best effect. I'm happy to say that, after more than a decade away, this new album is very, very good pop. It will definitely be in my top ten of the year, possibly quite high.  1. Playmate to Jesus - I misjudged this song at first, thinking that the chorus melody was too obvious. But as I've listened to it more, the production flourishes have won me over. This is one of their best midtempos. 9/10  2. Dirty Little Popsong - It's odd that this is so early in the running order because I think it's my least favorite track. It just feels too predictable. It's a solid dance track, for sure, but doesn't have anything new to offer. 7/10  3. Kill Myself - Now we're talking! This is the type of mature, soaring pop I hoped they'd record. The verses are beautiful (Lene really shows her range), but it's that blockbuster chorus that really gets you. Instant hit, even with the dark subject matter. 10/10  4. Like A Robot - When I first heard this, I couldn't stop laughing. The filthy bluntness of the hook seems shocking at first, but it's totally in keeping with the band's desire to subvert pop music. And luckily, this doesn't rest on the novelty of the chorus. The melody's just as strong. 10/10  5. Viva Las Vegas - Melodically, I love it. Where it loses a point is the lyrics, which never break out of novelty territory. But the production and hooks are so good that it's still a standout. 9/10  6. No Party Patrol - This is such an interesting track. On the surface, it's about a sort of apocalyptic party (more and more common subject matter these days), but I can't help but think it also functions as a critique of America's political parties' inability to deal with environmental issues. Maybe I'm reading between the lines too much, but thethought makes this a very unique track. Melodically, it's ace. 10/10  7. Come 'n Get It - A midtempo that hearkens back to their 90's days. It's definitely filler, but very enjoyable nonetheless. I like the retro vibe it gives off. 8/10  8. Sucker For A Superstar - One of the rockier tracks on the album, this is a highly infectious commentary on groupies (I wonder if Aqua has groupies?). Honestly, though, it's all about that chorus. It's gargantuan. 10/10  9. Be My Saviour Tonight - A bit of a departure, and one of the more mature sounding tracks on the album. It's all string sections, heavy beats (it gets crazy toward the end), and a soaring hook. It's grown on me immensely. 9/10  10. How R U Doin? - The album's first single, which is kind of crazy because it's not the strongest track. It's fairly straightforward electro-pop. Great beat, stupid lyrics. But it's fun! 9/10  11. If The World Didn't Suck (We Would All Fall Off) - I just love this. It's as close to rock music as the band's ever come, with pensive verses and stadium-sized, anthemic choruses. It's got a great build to it. A fantastic way to end the album, and one of the strongest tracks they've recorded. 10/10  Album Grade: 9.2/10

B004LWZW4W|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 8/11/11**  Okay, so I went from \\"why did this movie need to be made?\\" to \\"this actually looks pretty good\\" in the past few weeks, but now after seeing it I'm leaning more towards my initial impressions.  A lot of critics and viewers have seemed surprised that Rise of the Apes is as good as it is. That was part of the reason I started getting excited to watch it. And I think it is that good... for awhile. The first third is totally solid, setting up an ethical conflict with a lot of potential. Even more than that, the special effects are to be applauded. They're easily the best thing about the film. The motion capture technology (and acting work of Andy Serkis, who helped bring the apes alive) is nothing short of astounding. These creatures definitely don't feel digital, particularly the main ape, Cesar. In fact, he gives the central, most memorable performance in the film.  The problems start to appear in the sluggish second act. To me, at least, the inciting incident came a little too late and the aftermath (involving a horrible animal \\"shelter\\") eats up much of the movie (too much, imo). Sidenote: If you're a Tom Felton (aka Draco Malfoy) fan, it's kind of fun to watch him attempt an American accent (which he sort of succeeds with). Then we get to the conclusion, which is where I finally made up my mind about the movie. The problem is, it's so inevitable that you're just waiting for it to come. And when it finally does, I was left a little underwhelmed. I mean, once you see the movie, you'll understand why Cesar was so angry that he needed to lash out at the humans (you'll be right there with him, trust me), but the whole \\"ape uprising\\" seemed a little drastic and out-of-nowhere to me. I don't know, maybe it was just me.  Even with all of these nitpicks, I'm still mildly recommending the movie. The opening third (and the effects) are so good that it makes it a solid rental. I don't think I'll ever watch it again, though.

B005TZFZJC|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/19/11**  Rihanna has never been cooler. From the styling to the distillation of sounds on her sixth album, I'm a big fan of this era in her career. Though there's a clunker or two, and the tracks could do with some reshuffling, this could easily end up as my favorite Rihanna album.  1. You Da One - This track suffers greatly from being the opener, where it's completely out of place. Looking past that, it's a solid mid-tempo reggae flavored song. We've heard this before from Rihanna, but there's no one better when it comes to this kind of stuff. 8/10  2. Where Have You Been - Now we're talking! This is the first heavy dance track on the album. I'm convinced she should do an entire album with Calvin Harris. It's such a great match. The melody is just soaring, too. 10/10  3. We Found Love - And when we're on the topic of \\"soaring,\\" this single pretty much defines the term. It's well on its way to becoming my favorite Rihanna track. So simple, but so incredibly effective. 10/10  4. Talk That Talk (ft. Jay-Z) - I could do without the Jay-Z bits, which go on a bit too long, but other than that, I'm a huge fan of this. I love the simple, almost orchestral sounding beat. Seems like an obvious single choice. 9/10  5. Cockiness (I Love It) - This approaches MIA levels of bonkers. I should hate it. It's near atonal at parts, but the craziness just works wonders. It also ushers in the album's \\"dirty\\" sequence. The next few songs are easily her most sexual work. 10/10  6. Birthday Cake - The most pointless track she's ever done. It's not a full song, but not an interlude either. It just sort of goes nowhere until it fades out, totally screwing up the sequence in the process. I don't understand the logic behind this. 7/10  7. We All Want Love - Of the full songs, this is probably the only clunker. It's pleasant enough, but just so straightforward and anonymous. The only \\"filler\\" track on the album, though it would probablysound better toward the end of the album. 7/10  8. Drunk On Love - A big belter with a Te Amo-esque beat. Not single worthy, but an excellent album track. 9/10  9. Roc Me Out - One of the album's best songs, and probably should have been the first on the cd. It's like SOS meets Shut Up And Drive meets Rude Boy, but might be better than all three. The chorus is massive. 10/10  10. Watch 'N Learn - Another favorite. The playful sexuality and lush midtempo production reminds me a bit of Janet Jackson. There's something about the seesaw melody that's so addictive. 10/10  11. Farewell - The album's big ballad. Think along the lines of the last few tracks on Rated R. The lyrics are a little clumsy, but the production is beautiful and I love how she didn't hold back on the drama. 9/10  Album Grade: 9.0/10
0312323867|5.0|I love this book! What a talented author, she really knows how to bring you into her books and make you feel what the characters are feeling.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/17/09**  Coming off of such a massive debut success, Lady Gaga had a lot to prove with her second album. Luckily, she's more than up to the task, eclipsing her debut in every way possible. The Fame Monster is her official arrival, a declaration that she's in this for the long run.  1. Bad Romance - Her best single to date, and surely one of the defining singles of her career, this takes everything that was wonderful about her older songs and amps it up, adding a rock edge and multiplying the hooks by ten. Gutsy, dramatic and undeniably catchy, this is an absolute masterpiece. 10/10  2. Alejandro - Slowing down the tempo, Alejandro goes for a Middle Eastern/Latin American Ace Of Base pop sound. It's a surprising detour, but one that's an absolute success and displays Gaga's ample pop skills. The chorus is especially addictive. 10/10  3. Monster - One of the many highlights, this uptempo features some of the best lyrics on the album, and a brilliant spoken intro that sets the tone for the dark, tongue-in-cheek feel of the song. The drums in the verses are a personal highlight, as is the \\"he ate my heart\\" refrain. 10/10  4. Speechless - Her best and most dramatic ballad to date, this showstopper leaps right out of the seventies (think Bowie, Queen, etc) and cuts the album in half, sounding like nothing else on it. Her vocal talent is certainly highlighted here, as are her skills on the piano. This feels very much like the type of song Gaga feels most comfortable writing. 10/10  5. Dance In The Dark - The big Madonna moment of the album, this track even has a Vogue-style spoken middle eight. Probably the most straightforward dance track on the album, the synths are gorgeous and the beat is huge (so huge, in fact, that it often seems to fuzz up coming out of my speakers). 10/10  6. Telephone (ft. Beyonce) - Originally written for Britney Spears, this is like a Britney song on steroids. Of all the tracks, it's theone that caters most to radio's taste, but this is not a bad thing when the sound is so mammoth. Beyonce's verse isn't all that necessary, though it does add some urgency to the song. 10/10  7. So Happy I Could Die - The only song on the album approaching filler. Of course, Lady Gaga's filler is better than most artists' singles, but I still wish this was just a little bit stronger. It's a midtempo, synth-driven \\"lay in the sunshine\\" type of track. Pretty, but just not as strong as the others. 9/10  8. Teeth - Now this is really left-field. Probably the only track she's recorded that actually matches her crazy image, this theatrical stomper mixes elements of big-band, swamp rock and Broadway musical. It sounds like nothing else she's ever done. \\"Take a bite of my bad girl meat.\\" Brilliant. 10/10  Album Grade: 9.9/10
B006A819AG|2.0|The Roots are a very frustrating group when it comes to recorded albums (live is a never miss).  Recorded...you either get pure fire like Illadelph & The Tipping Point or you get some half azzed weird crap with a few dope beats and verses mixed in (like Phrenology).  This album is in the ladder column and won't be getting much play in my rotation.
B0030BYWKU|2.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 3/2/10**  As soon as Chris Brown's Forever hit it big, I knew that the same swooshy, synthy r&b sound would be ubiquitous in years to come. Now Jason Derulo's made an entire album of the stuff, and despite being pretty concise compared to other albums of this genre, it's certainly a mixed bag.  1. Whatcha Say - It's hard to accurately review this, since so much (aka: the best part) is borrowed from the Imogen Heap song. Without the lengthy sample, this would be pretty boring. Luckily, the hook transforms this into something better. Annoyingly, this begins the trend of Jason singing his name over the beginning of almost every track. 8/10  2. Ridin' Solo - Autotune to the max! Beyond that, though, the uptempo hook is ridiculously catchy. The verses less so. His voice sounds so strange here, but it gets high marks for that chorus. 7/10  3. In My Head - The second single, and one of the strongest tracks on the album. It's derivative in so many ways and sounds like so much already out there, but the melody is dangerously catchy. 8/10  4. The Sky's The Limit - This adheres to that Forever sound I mentioned earlier. Swooping atmospheric synths build up to a chorus that should be stronger than it is. Still, I'm happy to see another reasonably strong uptempo. 7/10  5. What If - Beginning with a ridiculously dramatic spoken intro, this is where the album takes a potentially dangerous turn into the banal. It's an average r&b ballad with one catchy bit in the chorus. Otherwise, completely forgettable and too overproduced for its own good. 5/10  6. Love Hangover - Thankfully, we're back to uptempo territory here. This is really pretty fantastic... probably my favorite track on the album. Everything works here. It's a great combo of dance/synth elements and straightforward r&b. 9/10  7. Encore - The last strong(ish) track of the album (though it begins with him singing is name again). His vocals are pretty strong here and I love the drums in the verses. The chorus is less than spectacular, though, which stops this from being a standout. 6/10  8. Fallen - Boring stuff. The lyrics are stupid and the melody goes nowhere. It's instantly forgettable. 4/10  9. Blind - A big ballad to end the (short) album, and it's nothing to write home about. The chorus is a letdown, yet again. It just stops the song from going anywhere. 4/10  Album Grade: 6.4/10

B001UV4XIS|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 7/15/11**  There is no precedent for this. I can't think of any movie series that has been so long lasting with the same actors, or any other series where we have literally been able to watch the actors grow from children to young adults. It's been ten years now, and because of this, it's nearly impossible to review Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows Pt. II. It's such an exhausting, emotionally satisfying and bittersweet experience for so many people. It's not even really a film anymore. It's the end, the last bit of Potter as it exists now.  Needless to say, I loved the movie. LOVED it. It was never going to capture every detail of the book, but I can't imagine a better capper to this always consistent series. Though largely jettisoning heavy plot for a simple, balls-to-the-wall war/sacrifice story, the movie manages to be the most emotional, gasp-inducing entry yet. Just like the book, this is dark, resonant stuff. I think every Potter fan will be satisfied, and there is no shortage of clap-and-cheer moments... payoffs that only a series of this length can properly produce.  And above all, it's the characters. It's always been the characters, of course, but I can't think of another movie where I've felt more engrossed in the good vs. evil conflict. Sure, I already knew how it was gonna end, but the stakes were HIGH. Crazy high, and shiver-inducing at moments. It's in the expressions of the actors, the filters used in the cinematography and the swell of the music. Fictionalized wars don't mean a whole lot if you don't care about the people fighting. And in DH2, we not only care about the people, but we care about the place, too. Hogwarts has become iconic, as have the hills and valleys surrounding it. To see the castle as a war zone is devastating. To see what happens in the Forbidden Forest later is even more so.  But then there's the ending. It's pretty perfect. Part of me wishes that in a decade or so we'd get a continuation. The rest of me says, don't ruin a good thing.

B005OLNOW6|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 9/10/10**  Hurts come onto the scene with raised expectations. It's hard for any band to live up to \\"best of '10\\" press before they've even got an album out. Add to that their stellar reputation from now-defunct pop band Daggers and this album carries with it more baggage than any other this year. To its credit, it offers exactly the type of sound we'd expect from Hurts. That's both a good thing and a bad thing.  1. Silver Lining - A slightly aggressive midtempo that goes big on the drama but a little soft on the melody. The chorus just doesn't soar the way that their best songs do. Would've worked better in a different track position on the album. 8/10  2. Wonderful Life - The single that really defines the Hurts sound. It's moody without being dragged down by a plodding sound. I love the storytelling in the lyrics and the hook is incredibly strong. 10/10  3. Blood, Tears & Gold - A big, lighters-in-the-air ballad that's totally misplaced this early in the album. It's more of a \\"second half\\" song, if you know what I mean. Still, one of their best ballads. 9/10  4. Sunday - The kind of soaring uptempo that I hoped would appear at least once on this album. The orchestral flourishes transform this into something quite special. 10/10  5. Stay - Another winner, and the best ballad on the album. If this isn't a hit single, I'll be surprised. It's one of those songs you hear for the first time and know it'll be big. Pop magic. 10/10  6. Illuminated - I've never been very fond of this track. It's one of the moodier songs, but comes and goes without really doing anything. I think I'm in the minority on this one, though. 7/10  7. Evelyn - An old Daggers song, this has been augmented into something completely over-the-top. It builds and builds until exploding in a heavy ending. A perfect example of what Hurts should be about. 9/10  8. Better Than Love - Another Daggers song, and this one hasn't been changed much from theoriginal. It's one of the few uptempos on here (they could've done with more) and definitely a highlight. It's all dramatic, swirling synths. 10/10  9. Devotion (ft. Kylie Minogue) - A moody piece that sounds very similar to Silver Lining, except it's miles better. It's nice hearing Minogue on a dark track like this again. Future single, for sure. It would be a great Winter release. 9/10  10. Unspoken - This has improved so much from the original demo. I love the kitchen sink production, though I'm guessing it won't be to everyone's taste. Like Evelyn, this builds and builds until it becomes something quite anthemic. 9/10  11. The Water - A quiet closer with symphonic backing. The lyrics are nice but the melody's not one of the stronger on the album. Atmospheric, but not quite as affecting as it could have been. 7/10  Album Grade: 8.9/10

B003K025V4|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 6/25/10**  Ah, teen pop. I approach these albums with lowered expectations but am often happy when they offer more than I expected. Miley Cyrus has been quite consistent this way, no matter the genre. The music is always better than it has to be, and you get the sense (whether right or wrong) that she's actually got some say in what she performs. In other words, it's convincing. It probably doesn't hurt that she's getting the best writers and producers. Still, Can't Be Tamed is a solid pop album, another to add to her solid pop career.  1. Liberty Walk - Ushers in her new phase of Gaga-esque dance pop with a chanty verse, big chorus and some great processed drums. I'm not sure if it's the perfect album opener, but as a declaration of intent it's pretty damn good. 9/10  2. Who Owns My Heart - Delving even further into dance/club sounds, this is another strong, melody-driven song written about the pitfalls of fame. The chorus is as instant as it gets, but the pulsing beat stays with you. 9/10  3. Can't Be Tamed - It seems to have split listeners' opinions down the middle, but I still think it's a flawless 2010 pop single. Sure, it follows trends, but it's tight, performed well and has a great middle eight. 10/10  4. Every Rose Has Its Thorn - As with her Cyndi Lauper cover a few years ago, this shouldn't work. But it turns out that Cyrus's raspy vocals fit the song perfectly. The production cheapens a bit after the first chorus, but it's still a strong version of the song. 9/10  5. Two More Lonely People - Combines a galloping beat with a sugary pop melody to stunning effect. The surging middle eight is all too fleeting. It's exactly the kind of song I'd like to see more of in the U.S. 10/10  6. Forgiveness And Love - A slow, Beatle-esque ballad. It's an odd choice for Cyrus (almost too grown-up?), but the melody's nice. Never really gets beyond \\"nice,\\" but that's okay. 7/10  7. Permanent December - My favorite song on the album, an anthemic club track that's got more vocoder on it than an army of Katy Perrys. But it doesn't matter when the chorus is so good. In fact, in this case the stupid lyrics don't even matter. Get this on the radio! 10/10  8. Stay - The strongest ballad on the album, it's a gentle, piano-led track that's similar in sound to Cyrus' own Goodbye. 9/10  9. Scars - A rockier, uptempo track, though it gets a little lost in the shuffle for me. It's adequately sung and produced, but not very original. 7/10  10. Take Me Along - Got a little bit of Coldplay grandeur to it, with an extended piano intro and some anthem-in-waiting choruses. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite gel. Feels too serious without a serious melody to support it. 7/10  11. Robot - A big, aggressive rocker with a vitriolic chorus sung by what sounds like a hundred Mileys. Usually these \\"angry about fame\\" tracks fall short, but the sound here is so massive that it works. It's all about that high note in the chorus, though. 9/10  12. My Heart Beats For Love - A hymnal closing ballad with the trademark Tedder-drums (though I don't think he produced this). The melody's quite good, if a bit repetitive. 8/10  Album Grade: 8.7/10

B004KPLZKA|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/16/11**  Post X-Factor albums are always an interesting prospect. More a chance to establish an artist's sound and image than an actual, cohesive album, they're best judged on their own standards. And using this criteria, Cher Lloyd's debut is definitely a success. Room for growth, but a success nonetheless.  1. Grow Up - A good, extremely catchy opening. The melody in the chorus reminds me of the Toys R Us jingle, which cracks me up (and is even funnier since Lloyd samples a lot throughout this album). The cameo from Busta Rhymes is also a nice little trip back to the 90's. 8/10  2. Want U Back - If this isn't a single, Lloyd's management are crazy. From the very first listen, it's a bonafide smash. The grunting noises totally make it. 10/10  3. With Ur Love - This is the track that made me come around to Cher's music career. It's laidback, subtly addictive and very cool. it wouldn't make a bad US single, either. Mike Posner's sort of extraneous, but doesn't detract. 10/10  4. Swagger Jagger - This fits much better in the context of the album, though the choice of sample still irks me. The production is great, though. A guilty pleasure. 8/10  5. Beautiful People - The last perfect track on the album. This is a great ballad and suits Lloyd's voice very well. It works alright as a duet with Carolina Liar, but probably would have been just as effective if she sang it alone. 10/10  6. Playa Boi - This song succeeds because of its excellent sample. That being said, the original song is miles more creative. I wish she would have just done a straight cover rather than augment it with some pretty lame lyrics. Still, that chorus melody is always welcome. 9/10  7. Superhero - A more laidback facet of Cher's sound, this has a very catchy melody and some nice lyrics. Even so, it's the first track to feel slightly underwhelming. 8/10  8. Over The Moon - A cutesy, nursery-rhyme sounding chorus battles with harder edged, rapped verses. It works surprisingly well, though the hook can quickly go from endearing to irritating. 8/10  9. Dub On The Track - The hardest track on the album, this is pretty much rap, dubstep, grime... all of that stuff thrown together. It's Cher's \\"street\\" side. It goes on too long, but it's not bad. 8/10  10. End Up Here - My least favorite track. That's not to say it's bad, but it certainly doesn't do anything interesting. It's pretty much the standard midtempo post-Ryan-Tedder pop/r&b track. Nothing more, nothing less. 7/10  Album Grade: 8.6/10
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is very good for those moments when u r bored.  plus u get rewarded.from playing it cool cool
B0036EBARO|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 3/19/10**  I love that all these artists are finally rediscovering what I call the \\"Van Halen synth.\\" Goldfrapp change directions pretty drastically between albums and this is my favorite iteration yet. I only wish every song adhered to the upbeat synthpop of first single Rocket.  1. Rocket - One of their best singles to date, this puts a smile on my face every time I hear it. From the bubbling synths to the simple, cheeky chorus, it's a reinvention and kicks the album off in the best possible way. 10/10  2. Believer - A little more subdued than the last track, this is still a totally impressive pastiche of 80's synthpop. It feels more like some of their older stuff. 9/10  3. Alive - My favorite track on the album. It's a mix of ELO, Scissor Sisters and every cheesy 80's musical out there. It's one of the only tracks to feature guitar prominently and feels meatier for it. Plus, the sparkling sound effects after the chorus are pretty ballsy. 10/10  4. Dreaming - Another very 80's sounding song. It's sort of a midtempo verging on uptempo with a fantastic moody melody. There's a stunning instrumental outro as well. 9/10  5. Head First - This feels very Abba in some parts. It's the first track resembling a ballad and manages to be both dreamlike and folksy at the same time. There are some gorgeous, sweeping synths throughout. 9/10  6. Hunt - This one, which would be a standout on other Goldfrapp albums, suffers because it doesn't fit tonally with the rest of the tracks. It's not a bad song, for sure, but changes the energy of the album. 8/10  7. Shiny And Warm - More uptempo, but it lacks a hook that's as strong as the other tracks. It feels more like a leftover from a few years ago than a new track. Again, it clashes with the rest of the album. 7/10  8. I Wanna Life - Here we're back to the straight-up 80's sound, which makes me think that this would have fit better towards the beginning of the album. It sticks outlike a sore thumb after the previous two tracks. It's a very welcome change. 10/10  9. Voicething - A very pretty sound collage with vocals but no lyrics. It's a beautiful closer to the album, though I can't say that it adds much to the overall package. 8/10  Album Grade: 8.9/10
B005I6EVUG|5.0|love my Kindle fire case, my daughter has a \\"nook\\" and wanted to  trade my case for hers.  Got the red one, is pretty, stylish,and  well made.  couldn't be happier with it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was so incredible I don't think any game could top this it is veary veary. awesome. do yeah. I loved it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome app if your bored at work. helps kills many hours. glad I got this app. definitely recommend it for people like me with short attention spans
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|This was purchased for my three year old cousin. He absolutely loved it and would not do anything but take pictures the rest of the day! The picture quality isn't great, but what three year old really cares? He just loved having his own camera and we loved him not wanting ours!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I'm not a big fan of boxing but I'm a sucker for the \\"underdog wins\\" movies....and this is the ultimate underdog-winner movie. I actually found myself yelling for Atom in his fights, especially that last fight! The action brought out a lot of emotion in me....my favorite scene was the Hugh Jackman shadow-boxing jump kick punch!! A thing of beauty to see! Another favorite part of the movie was Max & Atom \\"dancing\\"....awesome! This movie is a definite keeper and will be one of those movies that you watch again & again. Heck, I got the movie in the mail yesterday (Friday) and have already watched it 3 times!  I couldn't recommend it more than that.
B0063GORYU|1.0|I cant get it because is required a credit card so I think is not free why is asking for credit card
1594744769|5.0|I absolutely loved this book's creative aspect of being based on old/vintage photographs with a grand story built upon them. The images were excellent and the story even better. This book has such great originality that seems so rare these days. I could not put the book down. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in old photographs, human oddities, or epic adventures by young people discovering the truth about reality and where they belong.
B00632HWOG|5.0|You can scroll to see all of your emails (I don't know why other people are complaining). I believe the best part is if you have downloaded your emails, you can still read them. A must have for Yahoo users.
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging but a lot of fun. has hints to give you an idea how it works.probably my favorite app.this is a good logic game with a little twist.
0439023491|2.0|The first book of the Hunger Games is excellent.  I highly recommend it.  The second book is largely a reiteration of the first book with a slightly, and I mean slightly, different plot.  The third book is horrid.  I was enormously dissapointed with this series.  If she had left it as a single book it would be phenomenal, though slightly duplicative of Ender's Game.  If you did love the first book, pick up the title I just mentioned.  It is also fabulous.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|World's greatest book from The Greatest the world should know. Easy to use app, making it uber-convenient to receive the Word.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Looks great, protects my Kindle and makes it easy to read and use anywhere. Just what I was looking for at a resonable price.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This game is pretty fun but its very annoying that you have to unlock all the different levels and you have to pay for all the different levels and if you want to have more coins you have to pay for it with real.$$$$$$
B0068TL23G|5.0|Unique puzzle game idea that isn't based on dumb luck like some out there.  Lacking a timer to compare runs with, but I think that makes it more relaxing to play than stressful even on the harder maps.  Reasonable permissions, worth checking out.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|FIRST SAW THIS AT MIDNIGHT WHEN IT WAS RELEASED MANY, MANY YEARS AGO...MAYBE 1984?  A MASTERPIECE! BRUTAL AND PSYCHEDELIC, BUT A MASTERPIECE...
B00008BRB5|5.0|The Police's fifth (and final) studio album Synchronicity was released in June of 1983.<br />Following the success of 1981's Ghost in the Machine, the pressure was on The Police to deliver an album as successful as its prececessor. Before they went to make Synchronicity, bass player/singer/songwriter Sting starred in the film Brimstone and Treacle, guitarist Andy Summers made an album with King Crimson mastermind Robert Fripp and drummer Stewart Copeland appeared on Genesis guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford's second solo album Acting Very Strange and also did the film score to Rumble Fish. With projects out of the way, The Police (again with Hugh Padgham co-producing and engineering) went back to AIR Studios in Montserrat and Le Studio in Canada to record Synchronicity (which was named after the Carl Jung book Synchronicity which intrigued Sting and he loved the title so much that he named the album after that phrase). What was contained in the album was classic after classic, as I found out when I first got this album on vinyl in October of 1983 (with one of its 20 someodd album cover configurations).<br />We open with the fast paced rocker \\"Synchronicity 1\\" which has a breathless synthesizer sequence which, along with Stewart's drumming and Andy's 12-string guitar drives the song which establishes the lyrical themes of the album. Next is \\"Walking In Your Footsteps\\" which has African-tinged rhythms and great guitar effects with lyrics that speak of prehistoric man. Next is \\"O My God\\" which has jazz/reggae influence and sounds like early Police. Also includes Sting's wild sax and great playing by the band. Next is Andy Summers' rocker \\"Mother\\" which has some Egyptian tones and also Andy on vocal capturing the mood of a crazed man who sees his mother in all women. Next is Stewart Copeland's \\"Miss Gradenko\\" which has a Caribbean/reggae feel and a catchy chorus with Sting and Stewart on dual vocals. We end the first side with \\"Synchronicity 2\\" which is a driving, forceful rocker. This was a top 20 hit in late 1983 in the States. Lyrically continuing where Part 1 left off but musically stronger and famed for its \\"many miles away\\" refrain.<br />Side Two begins with the band's only US #1 hit out of the ballad \\"Every Breath You Take\\". This song is actually about a stalker but many people got married and/or made love to this song and became the rightful pop masterpiece that it is. Next was the second US Top 10 single \\"King Of Pain\\". The track is driven by keyboards and guitars and a great rocker. Lyrically, it illustrates the album's theme contrasting the cruelty of nature with the cruelty toward humans. Next was the final US Top 10 hit from the album entitled \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\". It's a strong reggae-influenced ballad with excellent playing by all three Police members and Sting singing lyrics about relationship matters and how it applies to synchronicity. We closed the original vinyl record (and the real album closer to me and those who had on vinyl) entitled \\"Tea In The Sahara\\". This is a subdued, poignant African/reggae tinged track. Lyrically is a love song but musically is great.<br />On the cassette and CD issues of the album was the flip side to \\"Every Breath You Take\\" entitled \\"Murder By Numbers\\" (written by Sting and Andy Summers) and is a great song but I see as like \\"Her Majesty\\" on The Beatles' Abbey Road, an afterthought.<br />Synchronicity would become The Police's only #1 album in the US where it reigned for 15 weeks (it ended the late Michael Jackson's Thriller's reign at #1 and would only be displaced by Quiet Riot's Metal Health) and has sold nearly 10 million copies in the US alone. The album would be The Police's swan song as the band would break up in spring of 1984 after the record breaking tour in support of the album as they realized they wouldn't top what they did.<br />The remastered CD was done by Bob Ludwig who did the mastering on the original LP and I give the edge to the vinyl album but theCD is still excellent (though the best CD issue is arguably the MFSL version).<br />RECOMMENDED!hough the best CD issue is arguably the MFSL version).  RECOMMENDED!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|watched with my 10-year old and 16-year old and they both enjoyed the cave, it was great to hear about cave bears and other past life, amazing that such a place was preserved given all the destruction that typically occurs in these environments
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor was the best superhero movie of 2011, in my opinion, and there were quite a few to compete with it.  It was amazing in 3D in the movie theater.  The movie looks great on Blu-Ray at home.  I am a huge Natalie Portman fan, and her performance does not disappoint.  There are also a lot of other great performances in the film, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin.  I highly recommend this film, and I'm looking forward to the advancement of the story in the upcoming Avengers film this summer.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is an ok game, but in my personal opinion, I prefer all the levels unlocked first, and less ads
0307959856|5.0|THis is a masterfully written return to Pride and Prejudice. It seamlessly picks up the narrative 6 years after the closing events of Austen`s novel.The characters remain true and the events unfold in an entirely believable way. The language is completely consistent with Austen`s voice and the style flows. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is okay if you are really board. it has a lot of mini games in this app. a lot of them takes awhile to get ahold of.
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This kindle sleeve does exactly what I want it to.  It protects the kindle, keeps it clean and looks very attractive too.  It does have to be removed when you use your kindle so you have to have a place to put it while you are reading.  But, for me that is no problem.  It doesn't take up much space and can easily be placed in a regular size purse or tote bag.  And I suspect that you can use the kindle while holding the case with the kindle on top, although I have never done that.  They are both very lightweight.
B002BWP49C|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS JUST AS BEST AS OTHER TWILIGHT MOVIE THE 1 TO 3, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE PART 2 OF BREAKING DAWN, MY GOD WHY DO WE NEED TO WAIT AS LONG AS THIS CAN'T THEY JUST MAKE THE PART 2 FASTER SO WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT LONGER, LOL
B00009PBRP|4.0|I love this movie and could not find a better deal, however, make sure you pay attention to the country code. I did not and only looked at the price. I figured there was something I missed since I got this so cheap. It will not play in the USA. It would be nice if Amazon would use the recognizing abilities they have to notice the country you are ordering from and let that country be at the top of the search results. This movie is doing me no good since I cannot watch it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|loved this on Atari, upgrades add depth to an already solid game, touch pad is a welcome change from the roller ball also
0439023521|1.0|I must admit I was a little curious to find out why the Hunger Games series was selling so well.  After reading the first book, I still have not quenched my curiosity.  The book, if it can be called that, is so poorly written I had difficulty finding the story in it.  Incomplete sentences, horrific structure, poorly thought out metaphors, and lace of descriptive prose are just a few of the completely offensive \\"styling\\" of Suzanne Collins writing.  I wonder if she ever took a creative writing or literature class at all!  How an editor could even stomach being associated with her, let alone a publisher, is beyond my comprehension.  Perhaps the bright side of the mystery of her success is that we can clearly see that capitalism is still alive and well.  Throw enough money at promoting a book and it sells.  The down side is that over four thousand \\"readers\\" gave her shining reviews.  I weep for the future of literature.  Suzanne Collins should sell her raw manuscripts to someone who actually knows how to write a proper story.  I can only hope that I run out of firewood this winter so I can use her books to heat my home.
0307454541|1.0|HATED IT! I don't get what all the fuss is about!  When I picked it up I had no clue what it was about. Violence against women, 600 pages of boring detail leading to an unexciting ending, Swedish names of things that all sound alike and are annoying to try to keep straight, poor translation into English, and SPOILER ALERT: a big part of the plot depends on not two, but three somewhat-related women looking so EXACTLY alike as to evade the crime being solved for 40 yrs, come on! NOT reading others in this trilogy OR seeing the movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's so fun and easy to play. and it's kind of cool having the option to play a random or winning deal. definitely recommend this app.
B000002L99|4.0|nah, just kidding. citing the opening spoken line in the song 'inside', imho one of the standouts on the '5150' album. 'good enough' is a strong opener. it's an ode to america's fave, the hamburger! great enegetic and guitar driven (i myself have never been a huge fan of the prior dlr fronted release, 1984. too many keyboards on that for my taste). 'why can't this be love' brings me back to the days when i taped the song from my best friend's cassette(which he had taped off of the radio-lol)best memory about that song is me driving and listening to it and my arm is hanging out the window. i turn a corner, hagar starts that vocal scat thing he does on that song (\\"bi-dee-bi-dee-bi-bi-bidi\\") and SPLAT! a bird crapped on my arm!'get up' is another great rocker, one of the tracks that makes it a much better listen than 1984. Eddie really rocks out on guitar on that one, or is that sammy's guitar? anyway, you get the picture, this is another strong tune on this release. 'dreams' was the theme song for the blue angels. this sounds a little bit too eighties and keyboardy for my tastes(not that there's anything wrong with some cool seventies or sixties sounding keyboards. just the eighties keyboard sound never did it for me, so i usually skip 'dreams' when i listen to this album. ditto for the insipid ballad 'love walks in', which is no doubt what the wikipedia entry for this album refers to when describing the album's content (\\"The album was notable for a number of love songs and ballads\\"). I don't really know what wikipedia is talkin bout. this album definitely is top heavy on straighforward rock n roll except for the aforementioned synth driven ballads, which qualify as one hundred percent pure poopy drivel. on the other hand, 'summer nights', a nice mid tempo rocker, is one of my favourite numbers on 5150. 'summer nights' has a really cool guitar intro and a great spot on vocal by mr hagar. 'best of both worlds' is a decent track with is a little reminiscent of some of hagar's stylings in his prior career as a solo artist and the title track is decent enough. all in all, this may be one of the best purchases you could make for your van halen collection. takes me way back to a really fun time in my life.agar's stylings in his prior career as a solo artist and the title track is decent enough. all in all, this may be one of the best purchases you could make for your van halen collection. takes me way back to a really fun time in my life.
B002RI9X8S|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a tremendous story, set in the depression of the 1930's.  Whilst a great book, it is not an easy read by any means.  The dialogue of the characters is embedded in local accented English, where words are shortened and abbreviated with apostrophes.<br /><br />The Joad family's struggles as they are cast out from their home and search for a better future in California is heartbreaking, as they are just a small, insignificant dot amongst the hundreds of thousands of other souls trying to do the same thing.  Be prepared to suffer with them, as you are drawn inexorably into their world.<br /><br />If I have one complaint about the book, is that it is never fully resolved.  Then again, it never can be, as to do so would take many books.  So, as a result, the book concludes at the end of an episode in their lives, so it is left, in my opinion, incomplete.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love love this app!!! the games are really nice.  the only down side is that is has. is that adds pop up sometimes after games and that can get annoying.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good way to make time go by and some of the games are really fun when you get into it
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Even for free, this wasn't worth downloading.  The games are stupid and hard.  You only get a few to start with, then have to earn points to receive more. There are 1-2 games that are fun, but even the kids didn't want to bother.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is really good if you haven't seen it. The cool part about the blu-ray are the scenes shot with IMAX. During those scenes, the movie goes from letterbox to filling up every pixel on your HDTV. It's friggin' badass.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|This thing looks great, until you open it. The green plastic that holds the disks comes apart in my hands, the disks themselves came shuffled around, and there is no guide beyond the episode listings on the disks for what is what. However, if you're looking for a cheap grouping of all that TNG you've been wanting forever, and this comes up for more than half-off like last Black Friday, there's nothing wrong with grabbing it.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I absolutely love my Kindle Microshell Folio. I am very satisfied with its function. I feel very comfortable putting my Fire in my purse or backpack when on the go because the shell covers the unit nicely. I haven't had any scratches or damage to my Fire. I am very satisfied. The only thing I would suggest to better the product is to offer it in more colors. If I could have had a purple one, I would have really liked that. The Pink was the next best option for me. I reccomend this product to other Fire owners.
B001HN6918|4.0|Jack Black is back as a Panda. If you like how that sounds, rent or buy this. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one. The villain isn't as interesting, and several bits are just stupid, but minor problems associated with movies made for kids aside, I liked this movie more than the original. Loved that the super-style is tai-chi :)
0545128285|4.0|the stoires are not just for the wizarding world, they are for our world too. they are not just for children, grown-ups can learn from them also.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Parts of this movie reminded me a great deal of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and those where the parts that appealed to me most. Everything else varied between weak, under explained, and \\"good.\\" For example, the choice of making the major female character a lizard and then sticking her in a wig bugged me the entire movie. What's wrong with a lizard being bald? Still, a good movie, though I question how much a child could get out of it that isn't pure fluff.
B0055SWM08|5.0|quality game.  this game has a very serene feel to it so it is perfect for anyone who just wants to mellow out and the levels are challenging enough to not make you fall asleep.  overall this game is worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone who loves puzzle games.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I feel the reason most people have a problem with this movie may be out dated blue ray player and tvs I use a ps3 for all my movie so it is always up to date on soft wear . I had no problem with the movie looked wonderfull on my samesung tv 240hrz quality was perfect . Video looks much better the on the original dvd or by far vhs. I use a denon amp and klipch speakers for soround sound and it sounds great much better then original. That is why I believe people are using out dated products . Hope this review helps

B0029QRA1U|3.0|The actual turntable works fine, I have no problems. The software that comes with it is pretty generic, but the thing that irks me most is that I am forced to use iTunes! Pretty stupid. Perhaps they can get some software upgrades to help their hardware.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I've never seen any other product, but I own the blu ray boxed set titled on Amazon as \\"Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]. The only criticism I have of the production is that the extended versions of episodes are often on another disc, and you have to be careful or you end up watching the originally aired version before realizing there's a longer one. The episode list is laid out on each DVD jacket, so you can always look ahead to see if there is a longer version, but it's easy to forget since most don't have extended versions. I highly recommend the product and the series.

B00005N6KG|4.0|I've tried other brands of vertical in-the-ears, but found these to be the most comfortable (they're especially lightweight) and have the best sound quality. I use them all the time when hiking or biking (they fit under my helmet fine). I've bought 5 or 6 of them over the last few years because within 6 months to a year, one of the channels always dies (same with other brands). Wish they had a built in volume control; I've had some with built-in controls but they're hard to find. Overall, if you don't like the feel of ear buds, this is a nice alternative.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|Its definitely worth the cost. very accurate, use it everyday. I have no complaints! Has an analog clock that displays the temperature &amp; percentage of precipitation for every hour of that day.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I used to get upset over movies that departed from the mythology created in the comic books. I mean there are certain things that are supposed to be sacred to the comic book world (like keep your hands off of Watchmen). But then I got a little older and a little wiser and read more comic books. I realized that comics are not a static medium. They change, origins stories change. Foundational aspects of the characters change. What matters at the end of the day is, \\"was it a good story?\\"  X-Men: First Class is a great story and worth watching. The acting is, for the most part, decent. I've never been a fan of January Jones and this movie did little to change my mind on that count. The chemistry between MacAvoy  and Fassbender, however, is fantastic. The special effects are okay. There are a few scenes that are a little rough to watch.  It's not really an action movie (which might be why the CGI is a little shoddy at times). I mean there is plenty of action, but that's not really what the movie is about. This is a movie about identity and friendship. While it gets a bit heavy handed at times, on the whole those themes are well discussed and necessary in a world that is becoming increasingly polarized.  Even if you didn't like the previous X-Men films (and perhaps especially if you didn't like them) this is a movie well worth watching.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|Martin had prepared us to expect that this would be the final book in the series. This was where all those divergent story lines where drawn together. Instead what we got was a clumsy, although at times entertaining, restart. In many ways It feels as if Martin, flush with the success of the HBO series, decided that he wanted the series to go a bit further. So instead of ending the many stories he's put out there, he added new characters and put new plot lines in motion.<br /><br />A Dance With Dragons has everything that the other books had in terms of the quality of writing, but it I've started to wonder, when does a Song of Ice and Fire end?

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I just downloaded this app for the Kindle Fire. It took me about 30 seconds to locate the radar feature. It's located under the maps section of the app (another feature that someone says does not exist on the Kindle, but it seems to be there on mine). You have to select &quot;layers&quot; and then radar. Tada! This is a great weather app, you just have to take the time to actually look through all the features.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I'm a little embarrassed to say that I don't really understand why the book is called Bossypants.  There are a few bossy references, but her stories don't make her sound bossy to me and since it's about her, I kind of thought they would.  In any case, I love Tina and I really enjoyed her book.  I was surprised, inspired, amused, and even sometimes touched by it.  There is a chapter in the book in which she fires back at random web comments about her that the writers probably never considered (or cared) that she might see.  They probably don't even know they were quoted in her book.  I had mixed emotions here, because I was like \\"Go Girl - get 'em\\" and then a part of me felt a little sad for her because I realize some part of her is hurt by the judgement of these strangers.  If you like Tina and you like autobiographies, it's a good one to pick up, especially for strong women.

0061997811|5.0|My eleven-year-old daughter loved this activity book.  It is loaded with well-thought-out activities and information on how the movies were created.  The entire book was loaded with what I have come to expect from a J.K.Rowling product - hands-on, up-to-date information that is perfectly suited for whichever age group she is aiming at.  I am a complete fan of this author and the people she has chosen as her crew.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to upgrade my DVDs of the first two movies to blu-ray, and I didn't yet have the third one.  I'm glad I did!  Besides the fact that these movies look amazing in 1080p, I think the best thing about this product is the fact that it offers the entire Trilogy in one set-for an amazing price!  It would actually cost somewhere around $20 MORE to buy them all separately.  This set includes just the movies without all the special features the 2 disc versions offer.  The box itself the movies are encased in is nothing fancy either.  But if you don't care about that (like me) then this is the way to go!

B0057R5XRG|5.0|The Seller:  I have ordered from this seller once before, and I'm glad I did again.  Again the delivery was fast-I got the package about three or four days earlier than expected-and the condition was great!  The Product:  The third movie looked/sounded great, of course.  That is to be expected, since it was released in 2001.  The first two JP movies left something to be desired as far as picture quality (The 1080p resolution revealed much graininess in certain shots.)  I think the movies could've benefitted greatly from a frame by frame digital restoration, like the treatment the Star Wars movies received.  Don't get me wrong, though-the picture quality in blu-ray looks WORLDS better than on DVD!  As far as sound quality though, that is where these blu-ray transfers SHINED!  These movies are great movies for score and sound anyway, but these blu-ray sound mixes are breathtaking!  In scenes like when the T-Rex breaks loose in JP, or the raptor scenes in The Lost World, it feels like you are THERE in the scene!  Also there are some great extras on here to enjoy, some new and some old!
B0036TGT3E|4.0|I fell in love with this movie when it first came out. It has some really nice special features that are on both the DVD and the blu-ray. I like having both DVD and blu-ray.  The quality is excellent on both. If you love the movie, I would highly recommend this.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game doesn't start off with that big of a challenge, but once it picks up it gets pretty tough pretty fast.

There are the additional scenes and behind the scenes features that are very interesting. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter movies, this is worth getting.

The Elgar seems to have been written ahead of it's time and is greatly innovative.

0062011847|4.0|Words are tricky, complicated things -- even the seemingly simple ones. Take the tile of Terry Pratchett's newest Discworld novel: SNUFF. Snuff could be a noun (a form of tobacco), a verb (to eliminate a flame, or a person), an adjective (a kind of unsavory entertainment incorporating such eliminations), or even more. Given Pratchett's surface British gentility, one might presume that this SNUFF is probably not adjectival, but presuming any more than that could be dangerous.<br /><br />This particular SNUFF is the eighth \\"Night Watch\\" novel, which more and more are concentrating on the aging, crotchety Samuel Vimes (now Commander of a force greatly expanded from the one he captained back in 1989's [[ASIN:0061020648 Guards! Guards!]]), much as the Lancre books focused down on the even more aged and crotchety Granny Weatherwax and even the Unseen University books came to feature the aged Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully and the crotchety Librarian. This time out, Vimes is officially on vacation, having been almost forcibly removed by his wife, Lady Sybil, to her family's ancient rural demesne, the Hall [1] to spend time away from work with her, their son Young Sam, and the great outdoors.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't happen that way -- even Pratchett would be hard-pressed to spin a four-hundred page book out of a quiet, relaxing vacation -- as the countryside turns out to be as full of mischief and malice as Vimes's beloved Ankh-Morpork. (Pratchett's narration bangs a bit too hard on this theme, particularly for someone who has already written a dozen novels in this very series about nasty things happening in quiet rural places like Lancre, but it is his theme this time out, so he's entitled to bang on it as hard as he wants.) Continuing one of the larger themes of the later Discworld series -- that all sapient creatures are brothers, and should be treated with respect and dignity -- SNUFF also adds another superficially unsavory race, the goblins, to the ranks of the blessed, following dwarves, trolls, zombies, Igors, Nac Mac Feegle, gnomes, vampires,  golems, and whatever Nobby Nobbs is.<br /><br />The goblins have been badly mistreated by the usual forces of repression in Pratchett -- petty bullies, the hereditary aristocracy, and the general unthinking prejudice of people who have not been yet exposed to Discworld protagonists -- and do not seem to have any legal rights whatsoever as the novel begins. They're also servile, cringing, little creatures that live in dirty holes in the ground and obsessively collect their own bodily secretions, so it's fairly easy to see how they came to be so repressed -- but, as SNUFF goes along, we meet the necessary heroic gnome, Stinky, and also learn of the hidden depths (mostly artistic, this time out, though there's also the usual Pratchett \\"this race slots in amazingly well to a particular job in the growing detailed division of labor\\" moment) which gnomes, surprisingly to everyone, possess.<br /><br />There's only a little business with the rest of the Watch along the way -- Carrot and Angua are almost completely absent, and Nobby and Fred Colon appear primarily as a bad example and a plot element, respectively. The crazed maniacal wild-man this time out is Wee Mad Arthur, the guardsman who recently learned that he's a Feegle, and the cold, collected purveyor of violence is Vimes's gentleman's gentleman, Willikins. Oh, and Young Sam is obsessed with what he calls \\"poo,\\" and may grow up to be a world-renowned expert in the stuff, if Pratchett follows up.<br /><br />SNUFF does not entirely run to formula -- the Discworld books don't have a formula, exactly, but they do have a medium-sized Chinese menu of flavors and themes that nearly always appear -- but it rattles down well-worn ruts that are very familiar from the prior Discworld books, and goes to the places that Pratchett's regular readers will expect. It does so well, and is thoroughly professional end entertaining along the way,but there's nothing particularly surprising here: Pratchett is telling the same kind of story he's been telling for about twenty-five years, with the same kind of jokes (somewhat fewer this time out, and much less poke-you-in-the-ribs, check-out-this-joke nudging), the same lessons, the same kind of characters (even the ones who aren't series regulars), and the same joys. Considering the vast audience for the Discworld stories -- and I'm definitely among them; Pratchett is as dependably wonderful in his sphere as P.G. Wodehouse and Donald Westlake were in theirs -- that's probably a positive thing, all in all.<br /><br />[1] It may have a more official name -- as may the requisite small hamlet that it's picturesquely near -- but that name is so rarely used in Snuff that I could neither remember nor find it.Pratchett is telling the same kind of story he's been telling for about twenty-five years, with the same kind of jokes (somewhat fewer this time out, and much less poke-you-in-the-ribs, check-out-this-joke nudging), the same lessons, the same kind of characters (even the ones who aren't series regulars), and the same joys.

B005I6EU7U|4.0|When looking for a cover for my new Kindle Fire, I was drawn to this one because of the look of a an actual book. When I received it, I was not disappointed.  It has the look and feel of a real book cover.  I have received several complements on it and the straps hold the kindle securely in place.  The inside pocket allows me to keep a microfiber cloth with the kindle to clean the face of it when needed.  The only draw back is that the straps cover the speakers at the top of kindle.  While this is not a problem for me in that if I'm listening to music or a video, I use headphones, it may be for others.
0143119680|4.0|Rated 3.5/5  Summary:  Diana has spent her life denying her powers.  She is a witch, from a long line of powerful witches.  But her parents were murdered when she was a child because of their powers, and the she refuses to let her own life go down the same path.  Now in her late twenties, Diana is a historian at Oxford.  She studies alchemy, and is an expert in her field.  During a typical day of research, Diana discovers that one of the texts she has pulled from library is bespelled.  Somehow, without intending to, Diana both breaks and re-spells the book before returning it to the archives.  The burst of magic that Diana has mistakenly released is noticed by the supernatural community.  Suddenly, the library is overwhelmed with witches, vampires, and demons.  But the most notable addition is a stunningly attractive vampire named Matthew.  Although vampires and witches do not mingle, Diana begins to trust Matthew after he saves her life several times.  Their friendship gradually becomes a budding romance, which then leads to marriage, which is strictly forbidden between species.  Due to Diana's connection to the magical book, as well as the couple's forbidden romance, Diana and Matthew become outlaws.  Diana has no choice but to begin using her powers, and they both must find a way to safely hide while they unravel the secrets of the magic text.  With the help of their families, Diana and Matthew finally make their escape.  Review:  If only this book had been 300 pages instead of 579 pages.  It was just simply too long for the straightforward storyline.  The author spends soooo much time talking about things that have very little to do with moving the story forward.  Deborah Harkness has spent the better part of 3 decades as a scholar of history in some of the world's most prestigious libraries.  Her knowledge and expertise is impressive and clearly evident throughout this novel.  Early in this book, I really enjoyed the added detail she contributed to the story from her own background.  For example, I knew nothing about All Souls College at Oxford before Harkness mentioned it in this book.  I immediately went on All Soul's website to learn all about the college and its history.  This kind of inspiration is one of my favorite things about reading.  I loved this part of the book.  However, in this book, the detail eventually overwhelmed the plot.  I wanted to know how Diana and Matthew were going to survive attacks from the supernatural community, but I didn't need a detailed description of the wine's bouquet every time they opened a bottle.  (Turns out that Harkness is also a wine blogger.)  Get my point?  Eventually, there were so many long stretches of inactivity that I started to get bored.  The last few chapters were especially dull.  And one more thing... I don't care how the author wants to spin the fact that this married couple - who is madly in love - doesn't/won't consummate their marriage, well... it was just weirdly ridiculous.  Neither character was a virgin, so it wasn't about saving themselves.  And they are MARRIED for crying out loud.  What the heck?  The fact that they chose to put the brakes on their intimacy before it went anywhere definitely did not help the romantic thread.  I think this book will appeal to readers who prefer to slowly savor a book rather than dive into the deep end.  The supernatural elements were interesting, I loved the ties to world history, and the characters were nicely developed.  It was just a little too slowly paced for my taste.  I wanted a little less filler and a little more sticking to the plot.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Santa Claus brought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas. However, he let me choose the cover. After comparing other Fire covers I decided to buy the Marware MicroShell. They have a video demonstrating how it works and looks and I think that helped me finally decide. The price is the best of all covers offered from other companies as well.  Now that I've had it for about 3 weeks I love it. On my lunch hour I can read \\"hands-free\\" by using the back slot for landscape view. There is an elastic strap on the back that helps me hold onto it while reading in vertical view.  I like it as well for not  adding more weight to the Fire and for all the colors you can choose from.  Buy it! I did!

B001U3Y5XE|1.0|My daughters (5, 6, 7) love building with Legos and we love creative games.  We don't like this game though.  The directions are vague so we ended up just making up rules.  Although the premise is great (like Pictionary with Legos), they ask you to build objects for which they do not provide the correct Legos at all!  The objects they want you to build (even at the Easy level) are complicated and some are impossible given the selection of Legos.  It is a slow game while kids try in vain to build object after object, getting more and more frustrated. I have never written an Amazon review before but this game drove me to it.  Lego could have done this game well but the didn't.  Big Disappointment!

The most extraordinary thing about Q's life, is that he had the good fortune to grow up living next to one Margo Roth Spiegelman. A larger than life girl who's adventures are the stuff of legend. One night, Margo enlists Q to help her carry out her biggest adventure yet; a meticulously planned out night of revenge. Upon returning home the next morning, Q feels more alive then ever, and is hopeful for a future that might include Margo. But there is anther side to the girl that seems so full of life.

And there were many times when I wished I could kick Margo Roth Spiegelman's butt. But, in the end....I absolutely loved this book.<br /><br />There are definite similarities between this book and Green's first novel Looking for Alaska. Both main characters are obsessed with a girl...or in actuality the IDEA of a girl, and both go in search of answers to the girls underlying mysteries. But having similar plot elements in this case isn't a bad thing, and Miles and Q are two totally different characters, which makes both stories work so well in their own ways.<br /><br />I can count on one hand the times that a book has made me cry. This book made me cry. The last 3 pages were my complete undoing. One second I was fine, and the next....sobbing. In fact, after I finished the book I left it on my couch and went and got ready for bed (at 4am...after staying up all night to finish a book I had started that evening), and when I returned to put the book back on the book shelf, I looked at the cover...and i started crying AGAIN.<br /><br />John Green...you are an evil, evil man. How do you manage to create these characters...these beautifully flawed, quirky characters...that just come alive off the page, and find a permanent home inside my brain?<br /><br />And one final note: The last line of the book...the final sentence...hands down my favorite closing line of any book I have ever read.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Along with Looking For Alaska, Paper Towns is now firmly nestled on my Favorite Books of All Time shelf.and got ready for bed (at 4am...after staying up all night to finish a book I had started that evening), and when I returned to put the book back on the book shelf, I looked at the cover...and i started crying AGAIN.

B006P0FD4W|3.0|i saw this film on its premiere in the theaters and honestly, i was very disappointed, but exhilarated at the same time. for one thing, keep in mind that if you have seen the first two films and are from a generation of movie goers who have 'seen it all' that, unless there is perverse graphic violence and gratuitous amounts of flesh with a twisted sense of humor thrown in, you will laugh this one off. for one, it's all been done before. two, there was so much hype surrounding this film that unless it went from 0 - 60 in 4 seconds, it didn't live up to its expectations. as a film, in regards to the story line and acting, yeah, it's weak. the whole 'found footage' element is getting rediculous. and because this franchise is trying to mill out as much product as it can to capitalize on the name, the entire project feels rushed and contrived. as for the film as a whole....  for one, the single most annoying thing about this flick is the fact that so many scenes, scenes depicted in the trailer, did not even make the final cut. there is controversy surrounding these decisions, but as a movie goer expecting to see what was advertised, it is gravely disappointing to wait to see what seems like a scarey part in the previews to not even take place in the actual film. lame,  inexcusable, and downright false advertising, if you ask me. two, i didn't exactly have a stop watch going but i swear, in the theater, this felt like the shortest major motion picture of all time.  if it lasted 1 hour and 10 mins that is a generous estimate. is there any merit to this film?? you betcha...  although they keep repeating a lot of the same scares, at least this time they do it with a little twist. instead of the stationary video camera from the other two offerings,  they rig it up to an oscilating fan that pans side to side which was a cool effect. also, there absolutely are some good creeps and scares in this and without a doubt, the ending is a major shock and scare (getting goosebumps eventhinking about it). trust me, there are definitely some good frights in this film but as i said, if you think good horror is seeing someone disembowled and than fileted on a grill, you won't like it. (knowing that kids today think they are above anything remotely supernatural and that it could never be contrived as frightening is the real horror in this society to me)  if you enjoyed the first two films, i'm sure you will like it...just don't expect to see exactly what you saw in the previews because it's not here. i haven't yet gotten this on dvd so there may be some 'deleted scenes' bonus but, those scenes still were not in the true film and as i said, it is majorly annoying. if you haven't seen any of these films and especially if you didn't like them, i don't see how this film will change your mind on paranormal activity. as i said, there are definitely some cool and genuine scares but as a whole, it falls short.

It felt purposefully incomplete and/or flat.  I think the animation will appeal to anyone who loved The Animatrix.  The plot/story, what there is of one, is car racing and all that entails from betting, crashes, to fixed races. Enter race.  Win race.  That's it.  Not too taxing or hard to understand.  The race scenes were fun to watch.  There are a lot of \\"nationalities\\" in Redline which I appreciate.  They were interesting to look at not unlike the bar in Star Wars.  The voice acting led by the fantastic Takuya Kimura is great.  As a fan of anime (and Taku), I'm glad I watched this, but I'd never recommend it to anyone.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I had found this app sometime last year and was using it in conjunction with Weatherbug.  I was using both apps (Weatherbug for the radar), but soon dropped Weatherbug because I saw no need to have 2 apps that basically did the same thing.  I have been very happy with this app and have had no issue with it whatsoever.  So what if the radar was a little slower, it works just as well.  Awesome work devs.<br /><br />I have this on my EVO 4G running CM7.
B00664AM5C|3.0|Good story line and the extra features are very educational.  Slow at times and some of the characters are not believable and could have been left out.  Overall a good movie when nothing else is on.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app does what it claims very nicely. I was looking for the temp and day or week forecast and it does so and accurately as well.
B003L77G8I|3.0|The mystery portion of the shows are fine. We have the usual high-quality, inventive murder/situation to resolve. However, the personnel development, or is it redevelopment, of the characters is cloying and annoying. It's turning into a real \\"chick-flick\\" series and not in a good way. Probably no more Bones in our viewing future.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|If cable TV crime shows had a template for success then 'Boardwalk Empire' hits on every mark. The high-production values, the strong writing and performances, a more than decent amount of nudity and violence, this show has everything you'd expect from a big-budget production on HBO. Unfortunately Boardwalk Empire doesn't do a whole lot different either and at times it stumbles for it's own identity.<br /><br />If there's one time period I'll always find engaging it's the roaring 20's and 'Boardwalk Empire's' setting in Atlantic City as Prohibition comes into effect is an engaging one. Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Thompson is the county treasurer  who has his hands in politics and bootlegging. His driver, Jimmy Darmody is a 22 year old WWI vet who's adjusting to life at home and wants to have more power and status with Nucky. Both these characters run into prohibition agent Nelson Van Alden who's religious beliefs fuel his determination (and brutality) to bring law and order. The overall plot sees these characters forming alliances and relationships, making power-plays and questioning their own actions. This season stays interesting to watch and certainly kicks things into gear in it's final episodes but I can't say there's anything in the character or story developments that I haven't seen in shows like Deadwood, Rome or Brotherhood.<br /><br />While the narrative may not be that original the performances go a long way to selling the stories. Steve Buscemi has always been an excellent actor and he's terrific playing the morally ambiguous Nucky. Kelly Macdonald matches him as Margaret Schroeder, an Irish mother who comes to Nucky for help and ends up getting sucked into his world. Van Alden seems an easy target and not that convincing as an antagnonist but Michael Shannon raises him above the usual religious cop archetype and is always fun to watch. It took a few episodes to warm up to Michael Pitt as Jimmy, which I could blame on him being a distant character but at the end I'm very interested to see what the show does with his character.<br /><br />Along with the outstanding set pieces which draw you into 'Boardwalk Empire's' time period, the music stands as the show's greatest accomplishment! The opening is easily HBO's best theme and while the music may seem a little out-of place (most of it's re-recorded) but it's always rousing and really brings the show to life.<br /><br />Boardwalk Empire' may not do anything new for HBO (or crime-drama in general) but what it DOES do it does well. I think as long as your expectations are level with what this show's offering 'Boardwalk Empire' is well worth your time.ed to see what the show does with his character.

B005K17RU0|4.0|the app got up and running in no time and works great.  the only reason for the four star rating is because I'm still not certain about the actual accuracy of the weather forecasts yet.

B006MQRLSA|3.0|I'm a baseball fan and enjoy sports movies, but I still found Moneyball to be a bit slow. It also felt like it was leading up a big end climax, but then they lose and the movie basically ends. Obviously the movie is based on real events so they cant just make it all up at the end, but it still feels like it was missing something.<br /><br />Brad Pitt did a good job as Billy Beane. Jonah Hill did ok, but most people probably don't realize that his character is made up. The real person went by a different name, was in good shape, and refused to have himself in the movie so they pulled a handful of people together to create the one character played by Jonah Hill who is portrayed as some nerdy, overweight office worker.<br /><br />Sabermetrics is the holy grail to some and something horrible evil to others depending on who is talking about it. The movie tries to stay out of that argument and stick with what specifically happended to Oakland.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Billy Beane still has yet to win with Oakland even up this day.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is decent, but not a Oscar winner.
0786958731|4.0|While the Starter Set for D&D 4E did a decent job of simplifying the game to make it more family friendly, it still required planning and prep time to DM that made it difficult to find time to actually play together. This board game variant solves that problem by completely removing the need for a DM with a creative card-based spin on AI and randomized dungeons, and an emphasis on teamwork that keeps it from being a straight-forward hack-and-slash experience. My 11yo and 9yo enjoy it, and it's easy enough to set up and get a game going in ~10 minutes that it doesn't require scheduling playtime in advance.

037571457X|5.0|Very original format: telling the story of a revolution, a major event in world history, through a graphic story about a little girl coming of age. She is from a middle class family in Tehran and tells us about the fall of the Shah and the rise of the islamic republic thourgh the eyes of a child. A child who is very aware of what is going on around her and is not afraid to speak up. Through the microstory of her family, her school, her relatives and neighbors we learn a lot about everyday life in Tehran in that period.<br /><br />The book ends with her departure for Austria in 1983 where her parents sent her to be safe from the dangers of war with Iraq and of internal repression. I am looking forward to reading the sequel [[ASIN:0224074407 Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return]]<br /><br />PS I am not sure why the author chose the title Persepolis for this book, does anyone know?
B002ZG99TK|3.0|This movie although action packed is definitely not for someone, such as myself, who work in the rail industry. It's filled with things that just don't happen and you will find yourself critiquing the entire movie. With that said railroaders enjoy it for what it is... an action movie.
B000002U88|2.0|I love this album.  Growing up it was one of my favorite to listen to.  When I saw it was remastered I got really excited.  However, I agree with an earlier reviewer that the sound quality is poor.  Either it wasn't remastered or they did a lousy job.  I own over 400 CDs and I'd say this is in the bottom 10% in terms of sound quality.
B001VS46DC|5.0|Very relaxing. Excellent views of Rio. Bonus features were very nice in learning more about the artist. If you like Bossa Nova music (Girl From Ipanema, etc.) you'll love this.

0762777931|4.0|I'll just start out, like many others, and say that the language in this book was unnecessary, hence 4 stars.  I had to read this when my kids weren't around, as I was afraid they'd see a \\"dirty\\" word or 2.  Not the example I'm hoping to teach!  As far as nutrition is concerned, 5 stars.  I felt like the author had really done her research well, and anyone who battles cancer and does so without mainstream treatments have my utmost respect!!  The author certainly has a vitality about her and due credit given to her nutrition.  I have started juicing recently and love that, however, being vegetarian/vegan as the author is, is not in the cards for me.  I limit animal protein and will leave it at that.  Overall, this is a good, easy read and is motivational enough to make even the anti-good nutrition camps start to eat a bit better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so dang amazing. i love it. i play it all the time and everyday!! I LOVE IT!!!
0071762345|5.0|I had been asked to start doing the social media marketing for my best friends business and though I had done quite a bit already thought it would be a good idea to read up on it.  I have read a few different books at this point and would have to say this is my favorite thus far.  It helped me a lot and then when I e-mailed him with a question (like he says you can do in the begging of the book) he responded to me with a great idea in just a few days.  I have to say I really appreciated that a lot.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|My buddy turned me on to this item at work. i tried his and ordered mine a week later and I'm glad i did! I was looking for something to give my old samsung T10 mp3 player a lil' more kick and this was perfect! it is a little smaller than box of tic tacs and charges by usb or wall outlet(wall outlet adapter not included)I have sony earbuds and the samsung just wasn't loud enough for me and i wanted my music loud when i cut the lawn on my riding mower. Nice crisp sound with alittle more punch! I never heard of Fiio but I'm sure they will be big. For under $30, a great product i highly recommend the E6.<br />UPDATE...... I purchased mine in December of 2011. As of today it is still going strong. My buddy's E6 died and wouldn't take charge. He bought his almost a year before I did. Got our moneys worth.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I just didn't expect to love this album so much, but I do.  Commitment was Seal's most lackluster album as a whole, although, it had several great songs on it.  But it was a letdown after the two albums before it, System and Seal IV, which I loved both and showcased Seal's great songwriting and unique vocals were still continuing from his three brilliant albums from the '90s.  This Soul 2 album is Seal back to fine form.  He is simply amazing on this album vocally.  I am a longtime fan and always have one of his albums in rotaton, and to get another album from him so soon this fantastic is a gift.  Wishing On a Star, Ooh, Baby, I'll Be Around, Love Don't Live Here Anymore are standouts for me.  The album sounds fresh.  I forget it is a covers album.  Trevor Horn and Seal back together.  Happy times ahead for Seal fans.
B000003TAB|5.0|The reason this is often overlooked by the average rock fan is because Nirvana's record label barely promoted it at all and only released one single off of it (that single being \\"Sliver\\"). I think that this album in a way represents all aspects and sounds of Nirvana. None of the songs are bad, but some of them may not resonate with certain parts of the band's fanbase. The best way to breakdown the songs, since all the songs are good in their own right, is to identify each song here to one of Nirvana's studio albums:<br /><br />Bleach: Downer, Stain, Beeswax, Mexican Seafood, Hairspray Queen, Aero Zeppelin, Big Long Now<br /><br />Nevermind: Dive, Sliver, Been a Son, Molly's Lips, Son of A Gun, New Wave Polly, Aneurysm<br /><br />In Utero: Turnaround<br /><br />With the exception of the last comparison, all those songs were recorded during the same time period. The bottom line is that this is Nirvana at their most raw, experimental, and punk rock for the most part of the album. Don't miss it because I've never heard anything like it since this album and it's a great album.<br /><br />BUY IT.
B005J29HCQ|1.0|Aweful, painful sound. I can't imagine why so many good reviews. It sounds like what they would have produced just noodling around in the studio one day. 'Wind chimes' put me over the edge - ughh......
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I have to say this was quite a funny book.  And I should've written my review this morning when I had all this fun stuff to say, instead of waiting until after a day of work when my brain is fried! Tina has had an interesting life with a good family and interesting friends.  If you enjoy strong women who admit their faults, learn from them, and laugh about them then read this book.  You will laugh a bit and you will probably learn a few things as well.
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|I bought these DvDs really cheap.  I have been a fan of Doctor Who for a long time now.  The DvDs do have points where they skip but nothing too bad.  It is still enjoyable and does not interfere.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I'll keep this simple. This book was a page turner. I was flooded with so many emotions throughout, especially at the end. Highly recommend.
B005M2A4D4|3.0|My box is slightly damaged, which is not much of a problem.  The DvD's skip at points causing small irritations.  There are about three skips between all the discs.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting it gets so hard n i luv tha cute little story's showing the pigs messing wit the birds
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This by far is one of the best movies period, people miss the point on it though. George isn't a born loser as some have suggested, this movie shows us through George, how many people one man or one person really can effect. IT IS GEORGE WHO HAS TO LEARN THE LESSON, he has to watch his brother become a war hero. His highschool friends go off and become sucessful business men and women, while all of his plans are put on hold so he can run the \\"Baily building and loan\\" even after he gets married and has a couple of kids, he still doesn't feel like he's accomplishing anything in life. This all comes to ahead when his uncle misplaces eight thousand dollars, which is now in Potter's hands. George goes home, and it's the straw that broke the camel's back. He goes crazy, and runs out of the house. Eventually he finds himself at the bridge outside of town, contemplating suicide. When his guardian angel shows up, causing George to jump in and rescue him, while they're in the rescue station, George states that he wishes he'd never been born, because in his mind as he states. Everybody would've been much happier, the angel grants his wish. And George gets to see how things would been around town, without him, His brother would be dead, since he wasn't there to save him from falling in the frozen pond. Mary never got married, and became and old maid, and Potter controls everything. No Bailey building and loan, George ends back at the bridge and wishes that he had been born. Which is granted to him, George is now resigned to the fact that yes he can make a difference. He even expects to go to jail over the lost eight thousand dollars, but Mary has been praying for him. And has gone out to talk to friends, and at the end the money is raised. This movie shows that what you do in life, no matter how small. Is important, and you impact more people than you realize. Even if you think you don't, George's problem was that he saw wasn't doing, or didn't have. And couldn't see the friends he had, and had to humble himself to ask for their help, an awsome awsome movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Truly enjoy playing this game.  Works really good on my tablet.  Just like the version you get on the PC but better.  Definitely worth getting.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok when u need to pass time. the graphics aren't the greatest, they are kind of old school though.
0446547654|5.0|This book started off slow and it goes back and forth between characters.  You must keep up with the story or you will find yourself lost.  You will not want to put it down.  It's very suspenseful and has a lot of action throughout. The ending will surprise you as the complete book will surprise you. I'm a Nicholas Sparks fan and I have to say this is one of his best books so far.  It's definitely a must read and worth every penny spent.
B000OW77UU|5.0|A truly inspiring movie and a most watch especially if you are feeling down. It remains us that no matter how bad things seems, you should never give up on your dream.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of my most recommended books when someone asks me for suggestions on what to read--and even when they don't! I have bought this book as a gift more than any other in the last few years since its publication. It is at or near the top of my all-time favorites list. I found myself both laughing and crying as the story progressed. I expected a few tears, considering the time frame of the novel, but I found Death's narration to be surprisingly witty and comical at times. Who'd have thunk that Death would be so personable! The only complaint I had with the book is that sometimes Death reveals more than I'd like him to before something happens rather than telling the story chronologically. That's a small quibble, though, and certainly not enough to detract from the overall pleasure I had in reading the book. Highly recommended, especially for anyone interested in this era in history.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This sleeve is very cool. I got it to carry my Kindle Fire around in as we have to travel 1x a week to the VA hospital. It is convienent with the leather carry strap and a 3/4 zipper. I got a stain on it and it was easily cleaned with a baby wet wipe, then it dried with no stain visible. It has kept my Kindle protected well. I tend to use the Kindle in the bathtub while I soak and the sleeve protects it when its in the bathroom floor. I would reccomend this sleeve again to anyone.

B004L49K20|4.0|Astronaut was a great album, but this one is just amazing in the way how they brought back to life and into the mainstream their old New Wave original sound and marketed it well enough to be accepted 20 years later. That's vintage baby! Vintage sound. What else can you call it.  Kuddos to Duran Duran for pulling it off and hope to hear more like it.
B006O3MU96|1.0|This game is HORRIBLE!!!!! You don't jump very high at all!! Your ammo doesn't really even aim at the bugs. The things to jump on are WAYYYYY too small. It's almost like the winter theme on the original DoodleJump. It is a complete waste of 99 cents!!!!
B005BJ7Y54|3.0|This is a pretty good band, but I quickly get tired of Chris Owens' vocals. While they hit the mark on a couple tunes, there needs to be a bit more urgency and power on some others. Good songs, though.

0307949508|5.0|Whereas some readers liked the original novel \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" a bit more than the sequel, others seem to like \\"Played with Fire\\" more than \\"Dragon Tattoo.\\" I loved them both; however, even though I gave \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" five stars, I, as some, liked the sequel even more. I had the same reaction to \\"Fire\\" as I had with the first: \\"the book just kept getting better!\\"<br /><br />As original and well crafted as the \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" was, I felt that the plot of \\"Fire\\" was even more complex and intertwined. Some readers feel that \\"Larsson's \\"Fire\\" lags a little during the mid-section in which criminal investigation procedure grinds along ...\\" but I feel that Larsson has carefully crafted clues throughout the novel and laid layer after layer of intriguing plot elements. As soon as one revelation is revealed, he opens another door (or two) and takes the reader down more baffling roads and experiences. Additionally, Larrson continues to develop the characterization, especially of Lisbeth and Mikael, and continues to intertwine their stories in a manner that is both frustrating and intriguing. The powerful storytelling ability of Larrson makes the reader savor every moment spent on the book; as a good wine, the reader will be left \\"wanting\\" at the conclusion. I am getting a can of \\"wasp spray\\" and the third book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" as soon as possible.<br /><br />An additional note, I didn't find that you needed to have read \\"The Dragon Tattoo\\" first, but it certainly would keep the continuity of the stories more logical. Certainly, however, read \\"Hornet's Nest\\" last!

B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is very challenging and difficult after you get to a certain point. There should be a retry option in order to replay levels faster, but I think this is a great game.  I personally think that reviews should be able to be rated as to whether or not they are helpful and after too many unhelpful reviews you are permanantly banned from posting reviews.
B001TKMAGW|5.0|Successful bands like Black Sabbath often have multiple versions of everything in their catalog released by record labels who know the group's fanbase will provide them a profit no matter what the quality of the release.  So with a Deluxe Edition like this, the main question is, is it worth it?  My answer is absolutely yes, but I'll list some highlights and you can judge for yourself.<br /><br />--The sound on Disc 1, the original album, is crisp and clear.<br />--Evil Woman follows N.I.B., a song replaced on most copies of the CD by Wicked World.<br />*Bonus Disc*<br />--Starts with Wicked World, so both songs find their place.<br />--Studio outtake of Black Sabbath features some variations on the vocals by Ozzy, including the line, \\"Look over your shoulder, Satan is there,\\" that was changed before the album's release.  Also, some of the vocals are more aggressive, and Ozzy's screams of, \\"Noooo!!!\\" are more intense.  I'm sure this version scared some label executives.<br />--Black Sabbath instrumental version.  I love hearing these songs with no vocals, making all of the instrumentation more discernable.  I usually hear some guitar or drum part I'd never noticed before.<br />--Studio outtakes of The Wizard, Behind the Wall of Sleep, Sleeping Village, and Warning, Part 1.  Even though these match almost exactly with the original versions, you hear Ozzy's voice with no studio effects added.  The vocals sound a bit more raw and live, since....they're raw and live.<br />--The alternate version of Evil Woman might be my favorite gem of this release.  It's a more ambitious take on this cover tune, complete with a flute that's heard throughout the song.  This is a real keeper, much like the Master of Reality Deluxe offering of Lord of this World with piano and slide bar.<br />--A 20-page booklet with a long article on the band's early history and tons of old pics.<br />--Awesome packaging, with fold-out digipack and more vintage pics.<br /><br />Even with all these great qualities, it's not completely perfect.  My only two tiny complaints are that, first, the CD I got did not come with a plastic Deluxe Edition slipcase over the digipack, but a Deluxe Edition sticker wrapped around it, which had to be removed to get to the CD's.  Also, the song N.I.B. is listed on Disc 2 as instrumental, but it definitely has vocals, so this was probably meant to be labeled as a studio outtake, which is what it is.  Do these little nitpicks take away from the value of this edition?  Not to me.  The positives far outweigh the negatives, and I'm thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  This one is a must-have for anyone who follows Black Sabbath closely and cherishes any old, unreleased recordings of the godfathers of metal.  Very well done!qualities, it's not completely perfect.

She only gave the whole issue like 1 sentence! It was almost like Suzanne got tired of being an author.<br />#2, Why did she have to make Gail so war-hungry and almost repulsive?<br />#3, WTF is up with making Peeta want to kill Katniss?! I mean, what did that add to the book except negativity? Come on now, most readers wanted some juicy love triangle stuff and all we got was disappointment.<br />#4-and the biggest disappointment in the book: WTF is up with the ending? The afterthought (for lack of a better word) that shows us that Katniss is dead inside and doesn't even really love her children or husband?!

B004A8ZWVK|2.0|Okay..I didnt exactly hate it, but I was let down as, tho i should know better, I expected this to be different from the overly produced overly hyped style of films today. It started off slow but promising, but it quickly turned into a cliche. The 2 main \\"maids\\" were just fine in their roles, but in contrast, almost everyone else seems cartoon like. The synopsis of this film sounds great, but, if I want to see something involving the civil rights era, I will watch a documentary, or \\"A Raisin In The Sun\\", with its amazing acting and modest look. I admittedly am NOT a fan of films where the production values are so \\"perfect\\" that it becomes Disneyesque, and the desire to get it authentic and \\"real\\" actually has the opposite effect. Okay..I'm going to say it, I greatly disliked this film, the several good performances aside. It's of the Oprah/Color Purple school, that beats you over the head with a huge budget, sweeping emotions, schmaltz, and sweeping score to accompany it all. Sorry, but this just leaves me cold. I much prefer indie, \\"little\\" films, where the message and the ability to genuinely amuse or move you is much more possible, at least to me. OH!!..and, I could have come up with 10 better, funnier ways to express the fired maids frustration and anger at being unjustly dismissed, rather than the vulgar, gross, juvenile, predictable making of a pie made out of her own crap..I found that not only gross but it had the opposite effect on me, I found it non sympathetic and demoralizing to her character. STUPID. As far as the popularity of this film, well..there's 2 possible explanations: Either I am not only hopelessly behind the times but also have lousy taste, Or: The masses are asses. I'm leaning towards the latter but that's just me.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|Hollywood has tried so hard to make a star out of Emma Roberts, but it's another Emma - Emma Stone - who will win the day.  Her story starts here at Easy A, a smart, surprisingly good film from director Will Gluck.  Gluck's made a film that will appeal to a number of different demographics without insulting or boring the others.  Ms. Stone is winning and compelling here (feisty and clearly whip-smart), but it was the whole ensemble - especially the adults - that endeared me to this film.  Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson win - hands-down - best parents of teen protagonist.  They're a hoot together turning what could be banal scenes into small, comedic masterpieces.  Tucci - polling the family for a selection for that night's DVD watching - says he wants to \\"cross watching 'The Bucket List' off of my bucket list.\\"  Clarkson - ostensibly meant to be counseling Stone's Olive on the birds and bees - is suddenly regaling her daughter with tales of her limber, youthful body and its relation to her popularity.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church - so good in everything he does with that deadpan delivery - is superb here again as Olive's teacher/quasi-counselor.  God knows Olive's not getting the counseling she needs from the school's real holder of that title, Lisa Kudrow (who's also Haden Church's character's wife).  It's also interesting to see Amanda Bynes, typically in Stone's role as the adorable lead (see, most notably the very good [[ASIN:B002GOAH1U What a Girl Wants (Keepcase)]] with Colin Firth), cast smartly against type here as the Mean Girl.
1451648537|5.0|In 2006, before the iPad and iCloud, American Heritage magazine published historian James Gordon Steele's list of the top 100 most influential Americans in history. Steele's list included the typical names that Americans usually associate with greatness, such as Henry Ford, Tomas Edison, and George Washington. Those names, expectedly, were welcomed and celebrated.  It was the name of a man that Steele listed as the ninth most influential American in history, behind Albert Einstein, that invoked debate and outcry from the public. The man ranked as the ninth most influential person in American History - ahead of FDR, who was listed as number fourteen - was a man named Steven Paul Jobs, better known as Steve Jobs, a computer and marketing genius who is credited with ushering in one of the greatest technological revolutions in American History. Who was Steve Jobs and what did he do in order to warrant a ranking ahead of FDR?<br /><br />This book by Walter Isaacson explores that question. Steve Jobs was a multidimensional individual, with a feisty and unwavering vision. Isaacson writes, \\"More than anyone else of his time, he made products that were completely innovative, combining the power of poetry and processors. With a ferocity that could make working with him as unsettling as it was inspiring, he also built the world's most creative company. And he was able to infuse into its DNA the design sensibilities, perfectionism, and imagination that make it likely to be, even decades from now, the company that thrives best at the intersection of artistry and technology.\\" Indeed, one gets the sense that Steve Jobs' brilliance came from his ability to connect the divide between the arts and technology.<br /><br />Furthermore, Isaacson does a great job of separating the man from the products. Yes, the products are great and have revolutionized the world, but the man behind the products was as flawed and pernicious as all the products he criticized. The legacy of the book is that the reader gets the whole picture of Jobs. Some books focus almost exclusively on the products he has created, while others fawn his leadership skills and vision. This book gives the reader all of it.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson has written a book that, if given the chance, Jobs would approve of. This book is elegantly written and structured, just like the products Apple has produced. It is a great read about the life of a man who made insanely great products. I wholeheartedly recommend it!e whole picture of Jobs. Some books focus almost exclusively on the products he has created, while others fawn his leadership skills and vision.

B0068TL23G|3.0|At first glance this is a very interesting puzzle game, but after playing with it for a while I have discovered some very serious flaws in both the game logic and the application itself.  On my Kindle Fire it tends to lock up about every other time I load it, causing me to have to shut down and restart my Fire before it will run. The game itself has several problems with documentation - the settings page has no help at all and is quite cryptic.  There is no clear way to reset the game except for uninstalling it and reinstalling it.  The game does not allow you to keep scores for different people.  One of the most annoying problems is that, if you get a hint (which uses up hint points), the game does NOT remember this so if you need the same hint again it uses up more hint points for the same hint, which is rediculous.  This could be a very good game but it needs work.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I was promoting the movie before I actually viewed it. I have all of Sherwood's movies and have truly been blessed by their messages. This particular movie has a timely message that reflects the condition of society and the urgency of our correction of this condition as a matter of biblical and social responsibility. Because it focuses on how to \\"walk out\\" the Christian journey in critically important areas, it's a message for everyone. For example, many who claim to be Christians often grieve as non-believers upon the death of a loved one. In this movie, the grieving are given practical steps to maneuver through the grieving process and the critical decisions required to progress toward acceptance and healing. Sherwood is to be applauded for continuing to follow God's leading as they witness to the masses through their movies. The movie is not for the \\"religious\\" or the \\"Christian\\", it's for everyone. It presents \\"real life\\" circumstances and a Godly approach to living as believers in this fallen world. Those who expess disdain do so with any and everything that does not line up exactly with their beliefs.
0316098337|5.0|One of my common gripes as an avid reader is that there are so many books out there that are utterly familiar. The concepts are essentially the same, so the best you can hope for is a clever author who will put a new twist on an old classic. My favorite thing about Room is that it feels totally original.<br /><br />Jack is five years old, and the only life he has ever known is Room--an 11x11 space that Jack has never been outside. The only people he has ever had contact with are his mother and Old Nick (his father and the man holding them captive). For Jack's mother Room is a prison cell she and her son need to escape, but for Jack it's home. She tells him about the Outside, but for him it only exists in theory. Stories about the real world are like fairy tales for young Jack. But all this comes to an end when Jack and his mother escape, and Jack is thrust into a world he doesn't understand or even want to be a part of.<br /><br />Emma Donoghue tells the story through Jack's eyes, and her commitment to understanding his worldview and conveying it to the reader is astonishing. To be honest, though, there were many times I longed for Donoghue to change points of view. I desperately wanted to hear the mother's story--to see through her eyes and understand what she had been through. How does a woman who has been kidnapped and held prisoner for years find the strength to carry on? How does she accept having a child in such harrowing circumstances--especially considering that the father is the man responsible for her torment? Where does she find such incredible reserves of strength and resilience? Because Jack is a child he doesn't understand the fierce maternal instincts at play, or how extraordinary the protective bond between them is. His mother's story is hinted at but not entirely told.<br /><br />Having said that, I understand why Donoghue chose to stick with Jack's point of view. Jack's narrative is the very reason Room is so compelling, and why it feels so original. It wouldn't be the same otherwise, because anyone familiar with Tarzan or The Jungle Book knows the truth is that the story isn't entirely original. Donoghue is just an exceedingly clever author putting an incredible twist on a familiar story.<br /><br />But while the narrative is exceptional, the plot is somewhat flawed. In order to tell the story she wants to tell, Donoghue has to incorporate a lot of plot twists that feel forced. It's as if she keeps asking herself \\"what would Jack do or feel if ...\\" then contriving a scenario that would answer that question--plausible or not. I'm willing to forgive this in Donoghue's case, however, because the journey is worth suspending a little belief.<br /><br />Grade: A-erwise, because anyone familiar with Tarzan or The Jungle Book knows the truth is that the story isn't entirely original.

B00004Y6O7|5.0|It might be the shortest VH album, but it's easily their best.  Every song kicks a__, with \\"Mean Streets\\" being the best song they ever recorded.  An absolutely timeless hard rock album.  Hopefully their new disc in 2012 will spark some younger folks to go back and buy their back catalog.  Start with VH1, then skip right to this one.  I love all their old stuff, but you just can't go wrong with this one and the first album.  Oh yeah, you also must buy Roth's \\"Eat 'Em & Smile.\\"  Totally killer album!  I personally feel Steve Vai can run circles around EVH, mainly due to Eddie squandering his talent via Jack Daniels.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I have the recent Pink Floyd big box set and thought about this purchase for a long time.  I bought the DSOtM on iTunes a couple years ago (2003 remaster).  To a certain extent I see what many people here are complaining about, buying an album 3 or 4 times is enough to get anyone upset.  These are the same people, like myself, that have bought the cassette, album then the CD, maybe even an online version for the same recording.  My main drive for this version was to purchase a Multichannel version that was perviously only available on SA-CD (Super audio CD)  This box includes a quad and a 5.1 mix.  I am currently listening to the 2011 remaster and I must say it is nothing short of unbelievable.  I plan on listening to the DVD quad mix next, I have not heard that version in 30 years.  The clarity and nuances you hear in the remastered 2011 version is nothing short of amazing, it exposes Pink Floyd's musical genius.  As far as the other items in the box, look at the listing, they are nothing to write home about.  Some neat stuff but nothing anyone would buy this box set specifically for.  Personally I would rather pay less and just get the discs.  I would also not feel cheated if they had included a rebate for the 3 box sets when you bought the Big box of Pink Floyd.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|Thank heavens for the current decade which seems to offer films for people with intellectual curiosity. \\"Anonymous\\" clearly leads the pack, but we also have the story of Freud vs. Jung well told in \\"A Dangerous Method\\" spy thriller \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\", the high finance \\"Margin Call\\" and Ralph Fiennes' tour d'force \\"Coriolanus\\".<br /><br />\\"Anonymous\\" gives us the popular theory that Will Shakespeare was not the author of the works which bear his name. The film stars Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford, Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth, Rafe Spall as Shakespeare, and Sebastian Armesto as Ben Johnson. To the average viewer only Redgrave's name will be familiar.<br /><br />Welsh born Rhys Ifans is probably best known for his role as Spike in \\"Notting Hill\\" (1999) and as Xenophilius Lovegood in \\"Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows\\" (2010), although he won a BAFTA for \\"Not Only But Always\\", a 2004 TV movie. His performance here is great, showing great maturity compared to some of his earlier films.<br /><br />Rafe Spall is best known to British TV viewers although he did appear in several films including a role as Jonathan Harker in a 2006 version of \\"Dracula\\" and played Noel in \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" (2004).<br /><br />German born Roland Emmerich produced and directed the film. Emmerich is best known for his work as writer and director of the block buster hit \\"Independence Day\\" (1996) as well as \\"Stargate\\" (1994), \\"Godzilla\\" (1998), \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" (2004). \\"Anonymous\\" is a clear change of pace for Emmerich, however, it handles it very well.<br /><br />There's lots of material for those who are interested in Shakespeare and his plays, plus a secondary plot about politics (almost mandatory in any British film) as well as fabled stories about the sexcapades of the Virgin Queen.<br /><br />BTW - Redgrave does a great job as the Queen, but my personal favorite remains Bette Davis.<br /><br />The costumes, photography (and new CGI technology) and scenery are breath taking, giving us the feeling that we are really in 17th Century England.<br /><br />The film earned over $1 million in its opening weekend in the US in October 2011, which is a poor showing given the $30 million budget.

B0036S4C6G|3.0|I was intrigued to find an award winning novel by a great author. Unfortunately I feel as if this one fell short of a previous novel of hers I read: Look at Me. This book should be read when you have nothing else to worry about, or when you are not reading other novels (maybe it was just me?) I found The characters and their lives become lost in my day to day as I had to go back to see where they came from. While I appreciate Egan's writing style, I did not enjoy the many plots that came about in the book. I was hoping for something more like her former book I read :(
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Yes, Brutus and Cassius and Cicero; Pompey Magnus, and a cast of thousands, brought to life in brilliant form in this masterpiece of historical period drama. No, you may not watch this series with your children, as language, sex and violence are as prolific as they are explicit, but this is, after all, Rome, or a piece of it.  This beautifully photographed, remarkably scored masterwork covers the rise to power of Gaius Julius Ceasar (Ceasar Augustus) and the accession of Octavian Ceasar, which would usher in 37 years of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  What is more remarkable than the breath-taking accuracy of the art direction and production design, is the plain, old-fashioned, walloping story telling by which means the proposed personalities of these great and ancient legends are brought to believable life in a non-stop marvel of entertainment.  Not for the faint of heart, but a must own for lovers of Roman epics, history, and seminal performances by a flawless cast.

This game, on the other hand, focuses on the puzzle itself and does not rely on you having the latest and greatest phone to have a fun time.<br /><br />It is non-intrusive, plays any time and any where.  Not to mention the small file size to allow downloading within seconds in 3G.  Very well made.  Kudos to the maker of this game.  And for those of you smart ones, there are a few of the stages which you can get better than 5 stars, and you'll get GREEN stars instead of YELLOW ones.<br /><br />I do however agree that the GUI can use some fine-tuning as some of the control and options are not obvious.

I thought it captured the 50s beautifully, but it wasn't even clear at first which character had died. Is Sean Penn supposed to resemble Jack? Big ears?   Honestly, I think I need to watch it a second time.    I lost my brother when he was 18 and I was 15. The pain you feel really does follow you through your life. Jack was a bully to his brother, too. Was it because the brother was so much like the dad? Artist and musician.    Everything went back to the water. The origin of life?    Mayne a little too obscure and I thought the black screening was a little long. Kept thinking it was my ROKU....

B00020X88O|4.0|Two kind of movies have always intrigued me: the ones that get universal praise from critics, and those that gets universally panned. And from experience, the ones that get praise sometimes do not deserve the accolades showered to them and the ones that gets panned are being bad-mouthed because of herd mentality. Since everyone says it sucks, hence it became the cool thing to do. There must be something wrong with you if you say otherwise.  \\"Showgirls\\" is one of these movies that have been called one of the worst movies ever made and if so, it is strangely compelling and I cannot take my eyes off it, and in the end, was thoroughly entertained by it.  Elizabeth Berkeley, fresh from her TV sitcom success at Saved By the Bell, caused an uproar at the time playing the lead character Nomi, as she was required to be topless (and even stark naked) in a lot of scenes. The plot is simple enough: Nomi is a drifter with a mysterious past who hitch-hiked to Las Vegas and in true Eve Harrington fashion, literally clawed and slept her way to the top in a Vegas show called Goddess. However, standing in her way is the resident Bisexaul Dragon Lady Cristal Connors played by the sinuous and hypnotic Gina Gershon.  So, is Showgirls really that BAD? The answer is a resounding NO. It is in fact, an entertaining satire of sorts of the backstage politics and catfights of the entertainment industry in Las Vegas. Its unsavory reputation stems from the fact that it features tons of nudity and you know how high-browed critics are: What self-respecting critic would admit to liking a film filled with T & A?  The way the studio promoted Showgirls also set it up for universal disdain by proudly advertising its NC-rating and the trailers bragging that it is the most controversial film of the year and that you will see something beyond your wildest dreams and fantasies (and you know you are going to be let down).  If you can get past the nudity (and believe me, once the initial shock of seeing women's boobs wore off, it is no big deal), Elizabeth Berkeley and co. actually delivered some credible performances. I especially like Gina Gershon's Cristal, she's Margo Channing, Alexis Carrington and Joan Crawford's Queen Bee all rolled into one serpentine package, and who doesn't like a bitch diva? On the flip-side, the Glenn Plummer character, the self-righteous and ultimately hypocritical James is almost like an afterthought: his role had no bearing on the choices Nomi made and also had no effect on the outcome of the film. If you edited all his scenes out, it wouldn't hurt the film at all, but improved it.  In retrospect, it is fitting that Showgirls have gone on to become a cult classic and what many now admit to as a \\"guilty pleasure\\".  As they say: Enjoy the guilt.
1935597760|3.0|This book started out very well. I had such high hopes for poor old Jamie & down-trodden Lydia. Both of them seemed such sympathetic characters - how could you not cheer for them? The writing was good and I found the Irish historical aspects interesting. The chapters portraying the orphanage and the children therein were unbelievably shocking and sad and a bit gruesome, but I think most probably true to life. I was going along nicely enjoying the book and then the end came. It was so awful to me that I wanted to rip the book up and toss it out.  Maybe I shouldn't blame a book simply because the ending didn't come out the way I wanted it to, but in this case I do. What a dreadful ending. It spoiled the whole book for me. Read it only if you don't mind awful endings. This one will not leave you with a smile.

B0069GRIHW|3.0|I have mixed emotions on this one, on one hand it's a solid Doors album, then again, it's back to the original version of the album before the remixed version came out, I was never really a fan of those new versions of the albums. So that is a plus here, the negative is they left off the 2 bonus tracks that were on the remixed version of this album. Then we get the alternate takes or versions on the second CD. Well, \\"Rock Me\\" is nothing new, had that for years in my collection & the new find \\"She Smells So Nice\\" is just \\"nice\\" and nothing special about it. The highlights of CD 2 is the other versions from the album. Then to make matters more weird and to add a few bucks to the bonfire they add this to it:<br /><br />iTunes mp3 bonus tracks:<br /><br />10. LA Woman (take 1)<br />11. Crawling King Snake (Run through and studio chatter)<br /><br />Amazon mp3 bonus tracks:<br /><br />10. Love Her Madly (Take 1) 3:38<br />11. Changeling (Take 9) 5:28<br /><br />I mean really, these could have been added to this CD collection as well.<br /><br />So in conclusion, If your a collector, get it, plus the bonus tracks as I did on on the physical release. As a everyday fan, it worth a listen too, but my 3 stars is because of the way this released. It could have been the ultimate \\"L.A. Woman\\" album. Just disappointed in that respect. Drop by my website sometime and say \\"Hi\\" at \\"JudeMac Forever\\", google it.

I agree that the author had plenty of references to mythologies of different cultures; while one reader didn't like that aspect of the book, I thought it was fabulous the way the author made it all work together.  It was like a giant (albeit fictitious) explanation of how all myths are connected.  Why didn't I think I'd like the book?  I'm 46.  Most of the books I see teens reading (such as the whole Twilight series) bore me after the first page.  Been there, done that, yearned for him and he broke my heart... yadda, yadda, yadda.  This book was different. I think boys and girls (and adults!) alike will love it!  I can't wait to read the next one!

B005I6EU48|5.0|The Verso Prologue Case Cover is very nice--the photo on Amazon does not do it justice. The outisde looks and feels like a very old book. In fact, I had it laying on my coffee table and a friend asked me what old book I was currently reading. When I said it was a cover for my Kindle Fire, he couldn't believe it and insisted it was a book until I opened the cover and showed him the Kindle. The inside feels like velvet and there is a little pocket on the left-hand side for a slip or two of paper. I would highly recommend this cover.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun but a little dull but still worth it. it is slow paced but surprisingly entertaining. Spoiler Alert. Level two is two hard it should be switched with level 4.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I actually tried to put off reading this book because I knew it was the final in the series and I was not yet ready to let it go. But my need to read it won out and I am sad to say I finished the book. I loved it as much as I loved the other two books. EL has really created some amazing characters in this book, especially the two leads, Christian and Anastasia. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I have to say I loved the bonus we got at the end. Do yourself a favor and read this series, you will be glad you did. I can't wait to see what this author creates next. I'm in!<br /><br />Lori Pescatore
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a fun awesome game. I'm always playing on this app. need to waste time? play this game. Deffinetly worth it plus its free!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very pleased with it.  It does what it is supposed to do.  No need to spend more for leather or more expensive one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|can be very addictive :) and the points buys new games and if you try a lot of time you get points and you can play the game you finished over again to continue to gain points
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Syncs well with google calendar. Had it running in 5 minutes. It does exactly what I need and I don't need to be on wi-fi on my Kindle Fire to edit or view appointments.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's free people!!! works just fine and is a lot of fun. It passes time when I'm really bored.  I recommend you at least try it.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I like these movies and the blu-ray format is awesome, and I am pleased with the price as well. The only disadvantage is that they do not have many additional features but if you don´t mind that, they are good for you!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reminds me of the Atari missile command game many years ago but with a better controller using - the touchscreen. a fun game.
B000002H4C|5.0|... as is defined today. By music. OTOH, if you read the comic, you'll understand. But this album absolutely rocks and defines the late 70's. Should be a part of everyone's 70's collection.
0439796644|5.0|This story is written from the perspective of Joey, the horse. It is a moving and gentle story, even during the war.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this speedlight before purchasing the Nikon P7000 because I knew I wanted a Nikon with a hot shoe.  I went on a trip to California last year, and I forgot my point and shoot. I love my D90, but attaching my rather bulky SB-600 adds so much weight to the already hefty D90. Attaching this speedlight helped reduce the bulk when I was doing some sightseeing. This speedlight, however, is perfect for the P7000 (or P7100). It doesn't tip over the camera when you attach it (unlike attaching an SB-600 or bigger), and it gives you that soft light that you want because you can angle the flash up to 90 degrees. If you have a P7000 or P7100, this will help you with your indoor photography.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is a wonderful read. Fey's perspective on the various milestones in life we all find familiar is unique and witty. Every page made me laugh out loud!
B0042U94UQ|3.0|my granddaughters love this movie and if they play it one more time at their other grandparents home, it might disappear.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever I had a blast playing this cool origanal game I think it really fun get this game is so much fun
B000YAA68C|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she is very happy with it.  she loves this movie and it is one of her favorites.
0714843377|5.0|Paul Arden's books are among my favorites.<br /><br />Each time I feel the need for a moral boost, I reach out for \\"It's not how good you are ...\\" and the companion book \\" whatever you think, think the opposite.\\"<br /><br />Both books contain a collection of aphorism on business and creativity, nicely illustrated.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers complain about this book . . . It's true that the author has a style that's polarizing -- but it's part of the jolt. This book is a kick in the pants, not an in-depth essay.<br /><br />One-liners books (or books with quotes) are here to give instant rush of inspiration -- not help solve complex problem. In this context, this book works very nicely.<br /><br />The first four pages pack serious punch -- they suggest that no matter where we start, it's up to us to make it happen. Arden destroys the idea that \\"if only we were different\\" we could succeed in our life. I found this very honest and refreshing.<br /><br />Pros: fun, fast read, inspiring.<br />Cons: short, fast read<br /><br />If you look for something in the same genre, I also recommend [[ASIN:1480287725 You Are a Circle: A Visual Meditation for the Creative Mind]]
B001EYGOEM|5.0|My grandaughter loves this cd and so do i.  taylor has a great voice and great lyrics.  i would buy this again.
0062060554|5.0|All I can say is I LOVE this book.  I could barely put it down to eat.  I read it over the course of a weekend and I enjoyed it from the first page to the last.  Read it, you won't regret it!!
B003ZDZ22U|5.0|My granddaughter was so excited to receive this for Christmas.  It had been on her wish list and she couldn't believe she actually got it.
B004LUS390|4.0|I like to take pica off the Internet and see if I can draw them except thecolor picker didn't work so I could do any of that.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Demi Lovato cd was a big hit with my granddaughter.  she loves to listen to the cd and do various dances to the songs.
B0053TWV46|5.0|Once again another excellant product purchased by my daughter for herself and her family. As she was unable to purchase this version here in Australia, she was pleased she found a dvd player with which she could watch dvd's from America. The dvd and packaging are as usual escellant quality. Thank you once again, Amazon.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|Another great hit for Christmas for my granddaughter.  She got so many of her requested cd's that she smiled all night long.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun game. really additive. I would have liked it if you didn't unlock games. other than that, I'm pretty satiasfied
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Taylor Swift is a great roll model for kids and her music doesn't make me cringe.  We need more like her.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|OK, nothing ever IS perfect. I am very pleased overall, with the performance of this app on my Kindle Fire. Only complaints are that manuevering the mouse on the screen is somewhat awkward and takes some getting used to but it's OK. The other thing is that some video playback is a little jumpy but that's about it.<br /><br />One other note: it is very important that you make sure the streaming computer's settings are configurated so that it's \\"always on\\" (at least when it's connected to a power source.)  Otherwise, splashtop on the mobile device will not be able to detect a signal from the streaming computer while it's in \\"sleep\\" or \\"hibernating.\\"<br /><br />Again, I am very pleased with this app overall.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Another hit with my granddaughter.  This as well as the other cds she got for Christmas were big hits and made her very happy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games cool. I play it a lot. just downloaded it so I'm still trying to beat all the levels. I play it a lot.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|After listening to this cd with my granddaughter and all of the others she got for Christmas, i have to admit, i like selena gomez!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is inexpensive. It looks neat. It has clear installation instructions and even includes a little shoe-horn or guitar-pick looking piece of plastic to slide the phone into the case. It also includes a cleaning cloth. It exceeds expectations in every way.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I usually feel distracted while watching an animated film. I rarely \\"want\\" to watch one. When I do view one I will because someone else is or very highly recommends it and hands me their copy. I had heard Despicable Me was adorable and funny etc. etc. about thirty times. But I waited quite awhile before renting it.<br /><br />I was utterly charmed. Very Mad-Magazine spyesque with a sweet, sweet addition of charming, heart-warming characters to soften the despicability and cartoon violence of the whole premise. I loved this film and the characters. Completely.
0545305497|5.0|I was very pleased with the product and the service.  I received all three books within the time frame I was given.  Actually, received two of the books before the time given.  Very satisfied.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are fun and easy to play. You earn coins for each game you play so you can purchase more games. Just remember to not update when it asks or you will start over.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever brought. I love how you can choose the type of Bible you want to read. For example: KING JAMES VERSION
B00004WC6J|4.0|Just a few things to consider maybe not emphasized enough. First, I want to tell you I got into Japan when I was 15, having taken a chance on buying \\"Gentlemen Take Polaroids\\" after seeing a striking picture of the band and reading the titles of the songs thinking they sounded more artistically in line with where my interests were headed. I immediately grafted onto Sylvian's voice with the music reminding me of David Bowie and Roxy Music. That same week I was getting a ride in my mom and dad's cool 1969 Plymouth Roadrunner and a brand new song started on the KITS San Francisco radio station I listened to religiously, that instantly grabbed my attention. When the voice started it didn't immediately clue me into it being the voice of Japan, but then I recognized how deep and artistic the lyrics were and said out loud to my dad, \\"...hey, I think this might be David Sylvian\\". Somehow, I was right. The next day, I went to Rasputin's Records in Berkeley, on BART, and purchased David Sylvian's \\"Red Guitar\\" Single backed with the amazing \\"Forbidden Colours\\" B-side, and brought it over to John, my closest friend, and it was love at first hear for the both of us. We bought all of his music everywhere we could go. Many friends and girlfriends soon followed. So, fast-forward to now, Sylvian's had a world of different incarnations. \\"Everything & Nothing\\" has pieces of nearly every style he'd done up until that point (2000). It is a great collection, though far from perfect, missing many of his best songs. Although I listen to mainly newer, cutting-edge artists in the indie and electronica genres, I always come back to Sylvian and his best work. This collection has some of it + rarities, as stated in other reviews here. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW is his best work is \\"Brilliant Trees\\", his 1st solo album and \\"Secrets Of The Beehive\\", his 3rd. If you need another recommendation, \\"Gone To Earth\\" is also great but not quite as well-produced with a more ballad-feel with the 2nd half beinginstrumentals you may only appreciate after familiarity with his best vocal albums. If you really want the best introduction to his work, go purchase \\"Secrets Of The Beehive\\", probably most fans overall favorite. If, like me, you want to start at the proper beginning, then start with \\"Brilliant Trees\\" which is just incredible from beginning to end but may at first be more challenging than \\"Secrets Of The Beehive\\". For those who are entranced with catchy, spiritually deep, lyrically artistic, and sometimes melodically challenging music. Sylvian somehow infuses influences from art heroes like Jean Cocteau and Picasso, with acoustic guitars, synthesizers, piano and wood instruments, jazz and pop music, and all with a somewhat indie-related style never feeling false or like it's trying too hard, into timeless, memorable, masterpieces.<br />And you never know who it will ensnare.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|Combining the themes of \\"Glory\\" with \\"Memphis Belle\\", this film tells, what is now, the well-known and still inspiring story of the 332nd Fighter Group, the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Although fighting in a segregated armed forces and judged inferior by the racism of the era, the Airmen compiled one of the more enviable fighting records of the USAAF. Although most of their missions involved the un-sexy work of providing cover for heavy bomber raids, only 25 bombers were lost during the hundreds of missions during which they were stewarded by the 332nd.<br /><br />The film itself must be judged in two categories, the acting and the action scenes. The latter win out as the aerial battle scenes at times take your breath away and look realistic enough to make you feel like a wingman. Anyone who loves WWII aircraft will thrill to see the Me-262, the first operational jet fighter, mixing it up with the P-51's of the Red Tails. And, as a point of interest, the Red Tails DID destroy a German warship as depicted in the film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie deserves the blasting it has gotten over the wooden acting and rote screenplay. Everyone is a tad too heroic (Cuba Gooding Jr. looks ready to break his teeth by the way he clamps his pipe) and the white airmen are a bit too solicitous for the realities of the 1940's. Despite his billing, Bryan Cranston is virtually non-existent, although David Oyelowo projects some fine stage presence. There are enough cast members present from \\"The Wire\\" (Andre Royo, Tristan Wilds) to make you wish that Omar Little would appear, in his own plane (with its own markings) and possibly shooting both Americans and Germans out of the sky in his unique anarchic way.<br /><br />Speaking of Germans, the Messerschmitts are led by a stereotypically evil Nazi who just before his demise, utters (so help me, god) \\"DIE, YOU FOOLISH AFRICAN!\\" one of the strangest lines ever put to celluloid. Go see \\"Red Tails\\" with profoundly low expectations and you won't be disappointed. At least, you'll see some cool flying scenes.you'll see some cool flying scenes.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie last night with my wife.  We enjoyed it and I'm sure we'll watch it again.  The fact that I was uncomfortable at times with the more overtly religious scenes is okay.  That discomfort leads to reflection and perhaps a change of heart and life.  We cried and laughed and I'm just not sure why some people are so uptight about the technical aspects of the film.  Who really cares?  Lighten up a little.  Who wouldn't enjoy Javier's call to his wife at 10:10 AM ... what a great scene!  Sadly it is true that Jesus has suffered more at the hands of His friends than his enemies. Who does not recoil in horror when another prominent Christian is paraded before the public in flagrante delicto?  Perhaps if there weren't so many mediocre Christians there wouldn't be so many ardent atheists.  A movie like this inspires good Christians to become as good as they can be.  It makes the tepid uncomfortable in their lukewarmness.  It makes the irrational \\"rationalists\\" angry enough to spend more time thinking about how much they hate the God they don't believe in.  Sounds like a  great film to me.  I'll gladly buy a copy or two of this and future films  by these artists and be glad my money was so well spent.  All the best!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is the deepest and most interesting plot a DS game can have. I was surprised, disgusted, and even brought to tears (of happiness).  **** This is a graphic adventure, not an 'action' game. No fighting or anything. Most of the game is READING!!! There are puzzles... and you get a TON of hints if you need them. ****  90% Reading/Talking, 9% Playing/Puzzles, 1% Morphic Resonance... ;)  100% Beauty.
B005D63RQK|5.0|I'm late to the \\"Breaking Bad\\" scene.  This series is absolutely fantastic.  I can't even adequately describe this show except to say that you will become completely engaged and pretty much addicted.  Even though I'm not a fan of bloody scenes, I'm not even disturbed by the ones presented in this show.  I watched all the seasons in one week and, by golly, I'm ready for more.  Each season just gets better and better.  There is nothing predictable about the show and it's hard to decide who you should be applauding and who you should be condemning.  Breaking Bad, you had me at hello. I *heart* you.
0765365278|5.0|This book is amazing with the only major downside being that I will have to wait to 2013 for the second book.  Excellent character and world development. Can't wait for the rest of the books to get finished.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game and me being able to change the color of the background and the back of the cards make it even better.
B0068TL23G|5.0|I could not decide between 4 or 5 stars. I was thinking 4 because as others say the ui (user interface) can use some work. I'm really enjoying the game though, I can't stop playing I seem to be addicted, so in my opinion that makes up for the bad ui.  where the ui needs to be fixed is the button to undo the last line you drew &amp; the button to get to the next level. Both need to be a bit larger. The next level button need to be larger so people notice it. The undo button  seems to need more sensitivity, which I think would be fixed if the button were larger.  In my opinion, the fun game play over-rules those 2 negatives.
B004J88SGC|5.0|This concert has given me a new, profound respect for Billy Joel;it's just incredible......magic.....I listen/watch over & over again!!!  Highly recommend!
1451627289|5.0|I LOVED 11/22/63!! I could not put it down.  King's \\"almost\\" dedication to Jack Finney was the icing on the cake.  Time and Again by Jack Finney is essential reading for anyone who likes time-travel stories.  King is right when he calls it \\"THE great time travel story.\\" And I'm thrilled that King is a fan of one of my favorite books of all time.  (And WHEN are they going to get around to making a movie out of that one??)  Thank you Stephen King for another fascinating story.  You're the best!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Purchased the cover to protect my new kndlefire. It was delivered two days after I ordered it online. It fits perfectly and can be set up as a stand for viewing on your table.
B0068TL23G|4.0|As soon as I saw the screenshot, I knew exactly was the goal was and that it would be a challenge.  This is another great game that makes you actually think.  It's like layout out circuit paths on a PCB board.  But even if you're not an electrical engineer, it's still fun.  The game could use some tweaks, like removing a certain line or adjusting it instead of having to \\"undo\\" multiple times.
B00009RAJH|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 classic is often over shadowed by the bohemoth success of Rumours.  This is without a doubt one of the most significant reinventions in rock and roll history.  Gone is the hard driving blues rock fleetwood mac led by the guitar god Peter Green (a fabulous line up in its own right), here is the laid back west coast stylings of a band that would come to dominate the mid 70's with thier california sound.  It all began while Mick Fleetwood was hanging out with his buddy kieth olsen a music engineer. Olsen played a song from an album by a then unknown Buckingham Nicks.  Mick loved what he heard and later asked Buckingham to join the band.  Buckingham only agreed to join if his then girlfriend Stevie could join.  The rest is music history.  This album is a bit lighter and more optimistic than rumours.  The song writing is still outstanding each player handling their parts flawlessly.  Obvious highlights would be Say You Love Me, Rhiannon, and Over My Head (all charting). There is more than just the hits that make this album great.  Crystal was written by Nicks but sung by Buckingham.  It is a gorgeous pastoral number that evokes such a peacful mood with its soft melodies.  World turning is a bit of a tribute to the sound of the orginal fleetwood mac.  Its a stomping blues rock number with both Linday Buckingham and Chritine Mcvie providing vocals. And then thiers the fan favorite Landslide, a song that wasnt releasd as a single until 1998 putting fleetwood mac back on the charts nearly 3 decades after its initial release.  The album deservedly reached number one on the charts.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|this movie is awesome. liam neeson is an outstanding actor. thats the main reason i went and saw this movie. i thought that it was made very well. the only thing i can complain about the film is the ending it is not what you think. but all in all it was awesome and it kept you at the edge of your seat. i also like how realistic the film was. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
0062060554|2.0|The essence of a novel is the lie that tells the truth -- or what comes from the author's imagination is so compelling and convincing that you completely suspend disbelief.  The tale is so good you don't care if it strains reality to the breaking point.  Well, maybe.  But not this book.<br /><br />Author SJ Watson claimed he wrote the story based on the case of a real amnesiac -- someone who truly woke up each morning not remembering anything about their past or their relationships.  His character, Christine Lucas, is such an amnesiac who reconstructs her life daily by reading her journal (which was only started a few weeks before the book opens), but by the end of each day has become a fully formed and functional person again -- with lots of memories flooding back.  But then she always has a \\"reset\\" overnight and starts all over.  And over.  And over.  (You get the point -- the reader is getting BORED with this premise, and endless descriptions of same.  Plus who she lives with, and what happened to her son etc etc etc.)  I'm glad I didn't try to count the number of times a character said \\"I'm sorry\\" in the book.<br /><br />While rated as a thriller -- the book takes four fifths of its length to get to anything remotely \\"thrilling\\".  I kept expecting and wanting some juicy clues early on, but there were none. Each time you thought there was a clue, the author explained it away immediately, or over-analyzed it to the point of absurdity.  Then, near the end, when things are finally heating up with some real suspense, -- just like an old-fashioned cartoon, the author cuts to a new scene, with no continuity or connectivity, or an explanation. Maybe even he couldn't figure it out.<br /><br />There are many things about this book I question:  (1) why would a mental hospital release a patient to someone who did not prove their identity  (2) Christine would be so incapacitated by her memory losses she would need 24-hour attendance, at home.  She couldn't be left alone to shop, cook, and wash windows like a \\"normal\\" person while her spouse went off to work.  (3) why was she so strong, determined and independent and yet so completely physically helpless when confronted with danger?  (4) if 8 hours of sleep erased her memory why didn't the doctors have her wake up every 2 hours?  (5) why didn't she have continuity of care between the mental hospital and home rather than finding a brand new doctor?  And lots of other problems, except to list these would create spoilers.<br /><br />I listened to this book through to the end, but my final reaction was bleah!  A true mental case history would have been way more interesting and thrilling than this piece of baloney.ke a \\"normal\\" person while her spouse went off to work.

In addition to the clock and weather, I love following earthquake activity around the world and since I am an avid golfer, it is easy to get an accurate forecast before heading out to my favorite course. Thanks for such a useful and beautiful app!!
1600597963|5.0|This book is wonderful!!! It has pretty illustrations and easy to learn instructions. I just finished a necklace using stack stitch. It came out perfect. This book helps anyone learn how to make lovely necklaces.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I'm not even kidding. I love it. Visually, it is incredibly exciting. Sure, the story is simple, but you're watching this for the action, and believe me, there's plenty of it. The animation is beyond top-notch. This is how it should be done!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game or more collection of games is just addicting enough to be addicting in a good way as in short but engaging. Overall a good download for wasting time. could be a bit more sensitive and responsive though to motion and a little less designed to introduce ads and purchasing options. For example, points values earned go down after a certain point.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|I like the sleeve because it is small and compact with snug lining.  I am handicapped and could use a more typical/traditional handle for carrying. Having identified that small detail, I must quickly point out that it otherwise meets all my needs/expectations.
0823015033|5.0|This book is literally overflowing with techniques, tips, tricks, etc. I think I became a better sculptor just by skimming through it. The ease at which Katherine Dewey leads you through the sculpting process is a great asset to have for someone who's just starting out. The amount of detail and depth you can get in a figure just by using a little know-how and some handmade tools is unreal. One of the most impressive things about the book is that it goes into ways to mold your figures to change gender, age, weight, and especially race. A few extra centimeters of clay can make a huge difference and you can tackle it all fearlessly with this book.

B000NA2BEU|3.0|I just re-watched Season 3 and decided to write a review.  I lauded Veronica Mars (Season 1 & 2) as one of the best shows of the decade.  It was new, vibrant, interesting and exciting.  Third season is merely average....which is a long way to fall.<br /><br />The third season followed Veronica to college...maybe the change of scenery was part of the problem.  While the change of scenery should open up new opportunities, it didn't help this show.<br /><br />First the good:<br />- Keith Mars.  Veronica lives at home and commutes to college so we still involvement from her father.  He is funny, intelligent, and excellantly played charater and that continues through out the entire series including this season.<br />- Veronica Mars.  I have read a number of reviews that said Veronica changed dramatically this season...I didn't see it at all.  She is still the same intelligent, wise-cracking, compassionate, trouble-seeking girl she always was.<br />- Their relationship...at the heart of Veronica Mars has always been the relationship between her and Keith.  It has created laughs and drama through every season.<br />- The Season 4 proposal.  I had heard about the proposal to have Veronica go to the FBI in Season 4 but to actually she the introduction to that in the DVD extras is pretty cool.<br /><br />The Neutral:<br />- I am not opposed to the introduction of new characters and going to college provide this opportunity.  Some of the new characters worked better than others but with more time, some would have been fleshed out more and others would have fallen by the wayside.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Keeping all the old characters...don't get me wrong, I love Wallace, Mac, Weevil, Logan, and Dick...but with the introduction of the new characters some of the old ones were stripped of real development.  Mac was there for...?  I actually don't know other than her romance with new characters she served no real purpose and those relationship times could have been used to buildthe new characters.  Weevil was one of my favorite characters in the first two seasons but his role in the third felt forced and there was no real development of him.  Wallace also was relegated to a smaller role.  The college story line could have easily seen Mac go away to another school and Weevil being a guest star for a few episodes when he was needed rather than how poorly they were used is the third season.<br />- I understand the one-off mysteries at the end of the season were made because the network ordered additional episodes...but it felt unnessary and did little for the series or characters.<br />- I didn't like the multiple main story arc this year...while the rape story was good.  The deans murder was a weaker story.  You are never really emotionally invested in the dean, his wife, her ex-husband, etc.  Without caring at all about the people involved as suspects it makes it harder to care what happens and who is guilty (although the actual murderer is more interesting character).
B005QF0GIK|5.0|\\" Weather\\" is undoubtedly the finest disc MeShell has ever made. PERIOD! If Meshell doesn't win a grammy for this brilliant work of art,  at least ONE,I'm going to flour bomb the grammy commitee. ' Nuff said!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I don't mean to steep huge praise the show can't possibly live up to but TV in general has gotten soboring, mundane, predictable, and cookie-cutter.  In the midst of bad reality TV, Veronica Mars (especially the first season) was an amazing light.  The series follows Veronica Mars.  She is high school student and the daughter of a PI, who used to be the sherrif.  She is a student at the fictional Neptune High.  School that features the kids of the ultra rich and the kids of the ultra riches servants.  Veronica was accepted by the rich cool clique even if she wasn't rich when her father was sherrif...but he lost his job when he took a moral stance on a case that investigated the murder of Veronica's best friend.  We join the story when her former circle of friends has turned against her...  Veronica works as a PI in her own right investigating cases for other students.  Most episodes involve both a case that will wrap up in a single episode and clues to the season long mystery of who really killed her friend.  She does all of this while also navigating the confusing time of being in high school...from dating relationships to date rape, gangs to racism, the cruelty of teens to friendship are all explored in this show.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Movie arrived in great shape...Only took a short 2 days to receive it...One of the best movies I have seen in a while
B000FL7CAK|5.0|When I reviewed Season 1, I made the claim that Veronica Mars was one of the best shows of the decade.  I stand by that claim.  I went back to watch my DVD's recently and still enjoyed almost every minute.<br /><br />Veronica Mars is a high school girl and a part-time PI.  Last season, she investigated the murder of her best friends Lily (I strongly recommend starting with the series from the beginning especially at these new lower prices).  This time out the town is still reeling from finding out one of their rich and elite was a murder...and Veronica has to deal with the backlash of unearthing this fact.  This time around she investigates a bomb on a school bus that killed a number of students.<br /><br />The series still follows the format that worked so well last time out.  Most episodes involve both a case that is wrapped up in the single episode as well as an investigating clues to the season long mystery.<br /><br />For those of you who missed this outstanding series the first time around, I recommend you check it out.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a great free addictive version of solitaire! the ads before each game are only mildly annoying. I am playing it on kindle fire.
0439023513|2.0|I have started this review a number of times.  I just couldn't figure out how to put into words what I has feeling.  I absolutely loved [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] and [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].  I went so far as to call the Hunger Games on of the best books written since Harry Potter.  So I struggled on how to word my disappointment.  Some spoilers below:  The Mockingjay picks up after Catching Fire.  Katniss is back in District 13 in their undergraound lair where the rebellion is being planned.  Peeta was captured is still in the district.  Katniss is healing from her physical injuries.  But the Katniss of the first two books seems dead and gone.  In her place is a broody, withdrawn, mopey girl.  What I loved about Katniss was that she often times would take action with little thought.  Her family and friends her a driving force in her life...she joined the Hunger Games to protect her sister, she worried about Gale's safety and feelings, as well as Peeta's, and while her relationship with her mother was hard, there was a caring beneath it.  So Katniss hides in a closet...that's right, she has no interest in planning the rebellion that might save Peeta, she has no intrest in talking to Gale or her sister?  Where is the old Katniss?  The rebellion decides to save Peeta to stop her moping...putting at risk soldiers, including Katniss' friends just to make her happy.  And when Peeta comes back, he is mentally broken and tries to kill her....so what does Katniss do, she mopes around ignoring her friends and family and start filming PSA messages for the rebels?  I will skip ahead a little and say she finally wants to get out of District 13.  She is sent to a district still battling with the capitals forces...but Katniss hides in the background because she is too valuable to be hurt.  The Katniss we met at the Hunger Games used to go hunting and supply food for her family and many in District 12 despite it being against the law and punishable by death....so now Katniss is ok with others doing the fighting while she hides in the background?  When she finally decides she won't take it anymore and wants to fight, she is put in a military group that is for show rather than one actually fighting...and finally we start to see a glimer of the old Katniss as she starts planning on how to make it through the Capital by herself to end this war and kill the president....  To sum up the rest of the book (and my complaints, Peeta is assigned to same unit as Katniss.  Even if you want to play with the mental game Collins seems to want you to, it makes little sense.  Collins want you to believe that the president of District 13 has assigned Peeta to the team to kill Katniss because Katniss is a political threat to her.  If we go down this path of thinking, why did she have her people work to get Peeta sane again in the first place?  And wouldn't that be political suicide for her anyway.  Everyone knows Peeta was crazy and tried to kill Katniss...the president assigning the murderer of the country's hero to the same unit would be obvious to everyone.  Finnegan died quickly and anticlimatic.  This was a survivor of 2 Hunger Games who was a strong warrior.  He also became a fairly big character in the books.  I wasn't expecting every character to make it through the war but his death just seemed quick and anticlimatic in every way.  The idea that Primm was sent to be a front line medic when she was so young makes no sense.  Wouldn't her mother have been sent first?  I understand that this is the conspiracy theory but the idea alone is implausible...also to kill the children to turn public opinion against the president seems like an idea full of holes...so then for this idea to work, the rebellion had to have round all the children in the capital, placed them infront of the presidents house, had rebelion members dressed as guards to keep the kids there...it is the only way the plan could work...all while the president and capital guards didn't notice and done without tripping any traps?  Uhmmm...ok  Finally, since the first book the idea of the love triangle has been a undercurrent.  So instead of making Katniss choose, she is exiled to District 12...Gale becomes a politician in District 2 and never calls or visits and Peeta is sent to District 12 to...so her choice is a matter of conveinence and availability?  It was just not a good ending to a series that had so much promise.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I initially picked up this book because of it's cover art and title. I'm not one to be influenced by the title when looking for a good book to read or judge a book by its cover, but this book drew me in. I read the flap summary and I was hooked. I had to read it. To say this book is an enjoyable book with unique and personable characters and an interesting plot with mystery, plot twists, and magic would be a gross understatement. Ms. Morgenstern weaved such a wondrous and magical world-within-a-world that it seemed very plausible and I got lost in the glamour of her world. The concept of the book was very intriguing and new, and I've never heard of or read anything like it. This book had everything I tend to go for in books: magic, wonder, history, love, and mystery. I can say with absolute certainty that I have fallen under the spell of Night Circus and Erin Morgenstern. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to discover a new world. I've never wanted to visit a circus more than I do now, particularly a night circus.
0195170776|4.0|There is not much to say about this dictionary. It's a real good dictionary. Very helpful when a needed it.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have a myriad of various gadgets and it's kind of hard to keep track of what's charged and what not when going on a trip.  The battery pack here is excellent, I bought it not sure how helpful it would be, but it charged 3 cell phones (galaxy nexus and samsung s2, and a nokia e72) and ipod touch for me fully without issues during testing.  I also tested it on TomTom GPS, another MP3 player, couple different cameras, and everything worked great.  Going on a trip between myself and my wife we'll have couple kindles, 3 cell phones, ipod, camera, and a few other things, and having this during flight or when going around sight seeing is extremely helpful.  Having dual USB ports does not hurt.  Now, the main thing.  Price is excellent for amount of battery power, and there are two full USB ports (one at 2a and one at 0.6a). So couldn't be happier with the product right now.  Time will tell how it holds up over next couple trips and heavier usage.  Oh, and one note, don't expect it to work with Asus Transformer Prime and some other tablets, as USB port does not provide enough power draw (not enough voltage I believe).  That's the only draw back, but it's the same across all the portable external battery packs that I have seen.  iPad/iPad2 though should work (if slowly).  Unless you upgrade to laptop level battery extender, it's going to be the same with any other similar device.  Edit: I checked and you need 15v at 1.2amps for Asus Transformer.  iPad can go at 5v but will charge really slowly.

8862937148|4.0|I originally bought this product as a gift for my sister, who raves about her Moleskine weekly notebooks.  After receiving it, however, I realized it was smaller than the one she had been using so gave it to my son and bought her a larger version.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to buy it online so went to a bricks-and-mortar store.  My sister loves the format and says she likes keeping receipts and lists in the pocket.  My son says he has found the format very useful for organizing his school schedule and likes the smaller size for carrying around in his backpack.

B001V7UXG2|1.0|No closed captioning is not \\"some picayune reason\\" (as a commenter on a previous review said) for giving this product 1 star. After all, this is a product review, and that includes the whole product, not just a portion of it. (Incidentally, it is not just the hearing impaired who would benefit from the closed captioning. Basically anyone who has a hard time understanding foreign accents would benefit.) I watched one episode. I understood extremely little. Subtitles would have helped immensely.

B001IB63KQ|3.0|It's not bad, per say, but...it's just not the Hayley Williams I'm used to hearing.<br /><br />She sounds much more deep & throaty than the studio recordings...and hey, if I was on tour, I totally would lower it an octave, too! Singing at studio level on tour would wreck her voice. But regardless of excuse, the result is the same: her voice comes off more like a Lady Gaga or an Amy Lee on this recording.<br /><br />Judging by the wild screaming on the CD, I'm assuming that the keyshift didn't bother the audience at all. And why would it? They're there, right by the stage. But as for me, I am listening to their screaming voices. All the time. And I'm not getting any of the perks, like the smoke or the visuals. And some of the BEST parts of the song, where Hayley Williams usually wails, she lets the audience fill in. Spoiler: they sound like hundreds of children, lacking in depth and substance.<br /><br />I'm sure it would mean more to me if I was there! And I haven't even watched the DVD yet. But so far, I am not impressed with this CD.<br /><br />I still love the band! Buy their CDs. Hayley can sing. Oh MAN, Hayley can sing! Her audience, however, can't.

1439102732|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I loved the 360 degree view of the issues involved in the story.
0307593312|5.0|At its simplest level this book is a love story.  The novel takes place in 1984 and the alternate reality of 1Q84. There are multiple references to George Orewell's book, 1984. It was the future for Orwell, the past for Murakami and the present for the characters. You won't find Big Brother here, nor a totalitarian society that seeks to control your every thought. So why there reference.  1984 caused a paradigm shift for most people when it was published. Not that the idea of influencing people through information was new, but it was put out there without subtlety. There was no guessing what the author was getting at, no innuendo. People and popular culture saw the world differently after publication. It appears to me that Murakami is concerned with perception, shared and private.  Add a good dose of karma and fate, cults, and various people doing good by spying, manipulation and murder and you have the framework of the book. In many ways, after being a love story, it is a morality play. You are invested in the good guys, even though Aomame (the female lead,) has murdered multiple people and Tengo (the male lead,) has ghost written a book that wins a major award. Ushikawa, an investigator hired by the cult, is ugly, outside and in. He may be the most honest of the bunch.  The three main characters all enter a reality where there are two visible moons in the sky. They share this reality, coming to it at different times while sharing the world with those who only see one moon. Stephen Hawking in his books has stated that if there are multiple outcomes that can exist from any event then all those outcomes exist at the same time. It is often expressed as there being parallel universes. This is not quite right in regards to this book. Simultaneous  Universe might be a better term as you do not have to leave one to occupy the other.  When reading a translation it cannot be said that each word matters, though with this book it can be said that each sentence matters. It isa long book, a thousand pages or so depending on the edition. When I found myself hurrying to get to the next page, I forced myself to go back and read those pages again. I do not feel I would have enjoyed it as much if I did not. Though, as far as the storyline is concerned, it does not support such a lengthy book, the textures and tones it expresses require it. If you wish it to, the book can exist on many layers at the same time. If you enjoy reading Thomas Pychon and Neal Stephenson then I believe you will enjoy reading this.
B001AMNL2Q|1.0|I watched Full Metal Jacket after watching Platoon and Apocalypse Now.  All I can think is that Kubrick must have had a low budget to spend half the movie focused on boot camp.  How can this movie be voted in the top five or top ten war movies when there are so many other better ones out there?  Pearl Harbor, Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan ...............  Save your money.

0143119680|3.0|An entertaining, readable novel which grows more and more hoaky as the reader goes on.  Our heroine, a brainy historian of the highest regard sits quietly in Bodleian working on her latest project when a mysterious book with supernatual powers presents itself to her. So begins the story of Diana Bishop, reluctant witch who refuses to use her powers and a cast of supernatual characters. Diana is then stalked and eventually wooed by her  Matthew Clairmont who happens to be the hottest castle owning, yoga practicing  vampire around. As the story unfolds over 592 pages, Our couple face numerous hurdles to consummate their love and discover the mystery behind the witchy book which Diana can't make reappear again. Diana's powers grow ever stronger and more amazing as she slowly claims her birthright as an extraordinary witch.  She has witch wind, rain, heat you name it everything but the kitchen sink.  If you can suspend your disbelief, you can enjoy a tender love story and the story of a woman coming into her own power.  I just wish that author Deborah Harkness, had focused the story more about those attributes and less the fantastical, ridiculous set of powers that are flung around by our heroine. Oh well, I will continue waiting for a book, that includes supernatural characters but is also well written.  The last one I read was The Historian.  An excellent novel with some real writing chops. In the meantime I am grateful to Ms. Harkness for writing a novel that was entertaining if just a little bit over the top.

B000XR4OC0|3.0|These shoes are comfortable and cute and they serve a good purpose, sure. HOWEVER. Me and my sister both got these shoes in spring of last year, and two months later, we both had giant holes on the side of each of our shoes near the big toes. To the point where we couldn't wear them anymore. Our feet would come OUT of the shoes through the holes. It's super annoying and inconvenient. I really wish the fabric was more durable...Then I'd buy the crap out of these things. I'd buy one in every color. Sadly...I won't be purchasing anymore TOMS.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|Survival movies seem to be pretty rare these days, which makes each new one a treat to see, especially when they feature grade A stars (Liam Neeson in this instance) taking on the title theme monster or element (in this case, vicious wolves).  And while the film may veer into some cliches we've seen many times before, it manages to be an effective thriller that grips you until the very end.  \\"The Grey\\" follows Ottway, a hunter tasked with keeping Alaskan pipeline workers safe from hostile wildlife.  It's a lonely, hard job, and things only get worse, for while flying out to another job, Ottway is caught up in a plane crash that leaves him and a few other survivors deep in the frozen heart of Alaska.  Now he must rally the others, and fight to survive not only the elements, but a pack of wolves hell-bent on taking them out as well.  What struck me most about \\"The Grey\\" is how grim it is.  This isn't an uplifting story of people banding together to overcome adversity; this is a film about desperate men out of their element, where death can strike at any time, and they're the ones at the bottom of the food chain.  And while it seems to make for a very despair-filled film, it works.  You're sucked into a situation that feels completely real, from the bare minimum use of CGI (when Neeson is freezing out in the snow-filled plains, it's real, and not a studio), to the danger of the ever-present wolves, and the way the survivors react.  In fact, a nice surprise of the film is the little character moments that pop up throughout the film, such as a hate-filled rant against God, to a moving scene at the side of a river that I won't ruin here.  Neeson himself turns in a fantastic performance of a world-weary man who is forced to take charge of a bad situation, with only his knowledge of the wild to help him.  He's not an action hero, or a macho-body builder, but an ordinary, middle-aged man who's tired of life, and it works wonderfully.  But while \\"The Grey\\" works very well onall fronts, it does fall into the standard cliche of \\"picking off the survivors one by one,\\" which leads the viewer to wonder if the film will defy the stereotype of having one lone survivor by the end of the film.  In addition, it's disappointing that, for having such a strong and gripping story, the film has a very weak ending that made me feel cheated.  Still, despite it's two flaws, \\"The Grey\\" is a gripping survival film that feels completely realistic in every way: not once are you asked to suspend your disbelief, because the need never arises.  The characters are strong and believable, and the film has a visceral punch that grabs hold, and doesn't let go.  For fans of survival films, \\"The Grey\\" comes highly recommended.  Oh, and one last thing: be sure to stay through the credits, as there's a scene afterwards.

B0052GACNM|5.0|This CD just melts my bones...it is so relaxing. Tony Bennett brings out the best in all of the other singers in the duets.

Worth every penny.
0316017930|1.0|Its quite appalling how many people take anything written to be true. Gladwell weaves  amazing stories, and you the reader will go \\"Aaah, I didnt know it was like that..but of course, it  makes a lot of sense now that I think about it.\\" But taking Gladwell's hypothesises about the world  and making simple tests of their observable consequences (other than of the particular  phenomonen he is trying to explain) often shows that they are false.  Never does he bother to do any such comprehensive testing, but instead pick out some examples that seems to fit, ignoring all others.  As an example, he starts off by saying that most Canadian hockey players are born early in the year, because they  are then a bit bigger than the others playing in that age-group, and therefore stand out more  and get picked out for special training. The \\"proof\\" is the rooster for one or two teams in the history  of ice-hockey having many players born early in the year. But wouldn't a plot including the birthdates of  ALL successful Canadian hockey players be more solid proof? Of course it would! Why is it not  included? Because such a plot shows the effect to be small! Try if yourself, collect birthdates of  currently active Canadian players, the distribution comes out quite flat. (I did it for about 400 players  currently active in the NHL, its essentially flat (see also comments below).  It is tragic that 95% of readers of this book give it 5 stars, never thinking to critically assess what  it written, which can be done with 10 minutes of internet research.

B001LRJH0U|1.0|A 55-year-old gun-toting tough-guy Ed Harris? A plastic-surgery-faced 45-year old Renee Zellweger? Aging Hollywood actors ambling through a lame script? Aging bad guys too? Don't middle-aged men get wise (or get shot) and give up roaming from town to town as hired killers?<br /><br />So what happened with this film? I suppose we get what we pay for. And seeing how I borrowed this DVD free from the public library, maybe I should not be so choosy? Perhaps a general problem is that with illegal downloads, $1 DVD rentals, and free films from libraries, that there is not sufficient capital to make quality movies. So, what happens is that aging film stars -- who have the money to make a film project -- spend their savings to keep themselves busy before a camera. They cast the film; they write the screenplay; they hire the cinematographers. And what's missing is somebody with authority to tell them \\"no\\" -- it does not make sense to have 55+ year old gunslingers. Consider that one screenwriting choice was to have a character consistently forget the second-through fourth vowels of rather sophisticated SAT-level words (and then have the sidekick complete the word!) When did these gunslingers get so literate? If they had gone to college, then why have they chosen to go out west? Luckily the audience was spared love scenes between Harris and Zellweger. Still, in the haste, the \\"set\\" looks Hollywood-ized, with phony store names, with one small stub tree growing, but with everything else so dry, how did that one tree get water? My guess: the tree was plastic.<br /><br />Ed Harris remains a considerable talent but might find better use behind the camera, and cast youngins so the next film will not be loosa crappa.<br /><br />tom sulcer<br />author of<br />\\"The Second Constitution of the United States\\"<br />(free on web: google title plus my last name)
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I enjoyed the movie for its handling of a serious subject with some wonderful humor tucked in when we least expected it. I had read the book before we saw the movie and was extremely pleased at how closely it followed the book.

0439023521|1.0|I read the first two books of this trilogy (I am an adult, 40-something years old) several months ago and am still horrified by the plot/premise of this trilogy.  The only reason I finished the two is to find out how the heroine/hero fared in their horrible world of despicable laws made by all the adults.  The events are horrific, these kids fighting - literally - to the death so that they can live.  It does portray quite well how a socialistic society works, which is good for our youth to see (as the are no longer exposed to our history found in the events during and leading up to WWII).  I think we are doing a disservice to our youth and their future by mass-marketing and pushing books of this type on younger and younger children.  Once read, these thoughts cannot be \\"erased\\" from someone's mind and imagination.  My advice :  read it before your kids do - then decide if you want to fill your offsprings' minds with these horrific images and ideas.  I read the online reviews of the last of the trilogy, and was dismayed by the ending, as it was not happy (actually, nothing in these books is happy).  I threw them away (not even in the recycle bin - they weren't worthy of that!)
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I bought the ad free version and for .99, it's worth it. After I first bought this, I tried out the first stage, got frustrated about 5 levels in, and went back to plain ole Angry Birds. After I got better at it, I went back to Rio with my new AB skills (I wish there was a way to extract some money from building AB skills, because it's so addictive, I find it VERY hard to put down my kindle fire, even if I'm closing in on a deadline).  Also, I feel like trying the level over and over and over more than AB, because if you don't set all the little birds free (that's not every stage, but it's in there for 1/3 of them) instead of the green pig face  with \\"LEVEL FAILED\\" the screen that comes up when you fail is a little bird in a cage, with a sad look on its face, and a single teardrop coming from his big eyes. It can give you a guilt trip when don't complete the level and keep getting the lonely, homesick bird.<br /><br />That's not so bad, but I took a star off because I could really do without the monkeys that laugh (not unlike a recording of six Johnny Knoxvilles laughing hysterically, but sped up, overlapping, and played at a higher pitch) when you miss them, or hit them but not hard enough. Probably related to the fact I had a headache when I played the first monkey stage --I put the sound on the lowest notch possible after 20 minutes or so and it still grated on my nerves. When you fail the level, they kick it up a couple notches and sound REALLY demented and obnoxious. I still turn the sound off completely now if it's a monkey stage. In the later stages, if you don't hit them just right, they sort of shake themselves off and stand up again. Also maybe another reason to not get too deeply into the game when you're in an irritable mood. On the plus side, they do make a really satisfying screech when you do manage to knock them over or off their tree, plus their arms and legs flail around.<br /><br />AB Rio I kind of had to develop a taste for (unlike AB where five minutes in, I was immediately addicted), and it seems harder to me, but the stages are different enough that it stays interesting. There's no 'golden egg' bonus games to get rewarded for, but if you get the the end of the level, there's a boss to fight, even a runway chase. Probably more challenging, and you really can't go wrong with the price.<br /><br /> Apparently there's a hi-def version, but playing this on my new Fire, everything is well-lit and crisp. There's a \\"Carnival\\" stage where the makers really stepped it up when it comes to elaborate, bright colors, parade floats, a big stadium crowd, etc. And yes, I have an English degree and am well over 30. I usually only write thoughtful reviews for movies and books (or to warn other women to avoid a useless product in 'Health and Beauty' like the plague), but hey, I needed to charge up my Kindle Fire so I can finish the final stage! Might as well get a review in while I'm waiting...minutes in, I was immediately addicted), and it seems harder to me, but the stages are different enough that it stays interesting.

B000002RXS|5.0|Returning to this recording after a good few years has been an interesting experience. First of all, I find Prêtre's conducting to be better than I had remembered. It is - surprise, surprise - very French, as is the whole performance: fleet, delicate and nuanced without quite the heft I'd like at key points - for example, the children's soldier chorus is far too polite for street urchins - but his approach is far preferable to turning the score into a verismo parody and the climax of the smuggler-gypsy quintet is thrilling - Prêtre whips up a storm. Similarly, the Entr'acte before Act 4 is full of life and colour, making quite an impact. As the French tradition in singing and performance becomes more and more diluted, a recording which is wholly Gallic with the exception of the two principal singers is increasingly valuable - and both Callas and Gedda were very conscientious, adaptable artists able to immerse themselves successfully in different idioms, as here. Both were excellent linguists and it shows.<br /><br />The sound was always good - typically EMI 60's, slightly peaky, eminently listenable; the acoustic of the Salle Wagram was rendered less reverberant with drapes to permit sufficient warmth.<br /><br />My admiration for Callas' Carmen increases with time. She cleverly exploits a potential flaw - the pronounced break between her two registers - to bewitching effect. Previous commentators such as the reliably perverse and wrong-headed Rodney Milnes have accused her Carmen of being all tigress with no allure; you have only to listen how subtly she effects certain key phrases such as \\"Je suis amoureuse\\" to give that the lie. A couple of sour top notes apart she sings with a smoky voice recast especially for the role: hard, cupped, with a trenchant lower register. She sometimes moves between notes with an enchanting \\"yodelling\\" effect and often goes for a sardonic, disingenuous under-statement. It is almost de rigeur to criticise her French yet she spoke the language fluently and lived in Paris from 1962 until her death. I'm a French speaker and I think she sounds pretty authentic when she delivers lines like , \\"l'on m'avait même dit de craindre pour ma vie\\" with real attention to the correct pronunciation of tricky vowel sounds as in \\"loin\\" and to the two French \\"r\\" sounds in \\"craindre\\".<br /><br />I have never been a big fan of Gedda - I find the voice fundamentally bleaty - but within that limitation he does a fine job, especially in the last act where he almost manages to transcend the lack of steel in his voice to convey Jos&eacute;'s manic passion - but he's no Jonas Kaufmann. Robert Massard is almost forgotten today but I always loved his neat, refined, expressive baritone - so very French and perhaps, like so many deceased French tenors, the last of a vocal genre.

0440217563|5.0|This is the third book in the Outlander Series.<br /><br />The read was very engaging and exciting.  I don't know how the lady does it.  She keeps you on the edge of your seat and flipping through pages in excitement for about 1000 pp.<br /><br />So much happens in this book that I just cannot possibly give a brief synopsis .  The book begins by alternating points of view and time between Jamie in the past with Claire, Brianna, and Roger in the present as Jamie lives it and the others are tracking him in the records left behind.<br /><br />In the intervening 20 years, Jamie lives an eventful life that will have consequences in the future.  People from both Jamie and Claire's pasts will play a part in their many adventures in this book.  Getting back together is the easy part it seems.  Betrayal, traitors, high sea adventure, pirates, voodoo and just staying one step ahead of the past endangers both of them.  This book's backdrop moves from Scotland to France to the West Indies and ends with a possible future in yet another place.<br /><br />This one moves along so much and many times Jamie and Claire are separated that it has a different feel than the first two.  It darts between Jamie and Claire's past while they are separated catching up those twenty years to Claire's present with Bree and Roger and finally to Jamie and Claire together in the past.  There is no difficulty keeping up with the changes as italics and separations are used.<br /><br />Characters are well written and there are the usual love to hate villains, apparent villains or mysterious people you don't know if their friend or foe, and new characters.  I enjoyed meeting Lord John Grey and look forward to his spinoff series.<br /><br />The historical detail is incredible especially when it deals with English, Scottish, French, and Caribbean cultures of the time.<br /><br />Naturally the very best part is the continued love affair of Jamie and Claire.  Absolutely love when they are center stage together.<br /><br />Great read!<br /><br />Update*************************************************************************************************<br />My audio review-<br />It took me three months to listen to this one, but it was one of the best listening experiences that I've had in the audio book world.  I love Davina Porter's narrating and it certainly didn't hurt that this is an impressive story.<br /><br />This was book three in the Outlander series.  It very much needs to be read in order.<br /><br />The story opens with a promise and a chance.  Claire the timetraveler had to leave her beloved Jamie behind on the eve of Culloden.  She assumed he died.  Until now.  Claire, Bri, and Roger hunt through the clues that lead them through the like of one James Fraser.  Meanwhile, Jamie survives Culloden, the starving and lean years, and then imprisonment.<br /><br />They've finally found him.  Claire can go back.  But what of leaving Bri?  Bri helps her find peace with the tumultuous decision to go back in time to Jamie.  And the adventure truly begins- a treasure, a kidnapping, secrets revealed, high seas, the deadly and mystical Caribbean, a shocking series of discovers, and so many emotional twists to the lives of Jamie and Claire.<br /><br />As I said, the narration was flawless in my eyes.  I was absolutely enchanted.<br /><br />The story itself was broadsweeping just as the ones that came before it.  This was not my first occasion with Voyager, but somehow listening to it gave it a fresh new feel and I appreciated the separation, reunion, and adventures all over again.  There are so many little interesting details, scenes with brilliant minor characters, agony, excitement, passion, suspense, and surprises.  It was an absolute pleasure to go again.<br /><br />Can't recommend the experience of the Outlander series on audio enough.*************************************************** My audio review- It took me three months to listen to this one, but it was one of the best listening experiences that I've had in the audio book world.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This bag is absolutely incredible. I've been using it for about a month now and really feel comfortable storing all of my gear inside. I have 5 lenses and 1 camera body, plus a lot of accessories. The padding on the walls feels durable and like it could protect my equipment. I wouldn't feel comfortable throwing my bag around like I would with a bookbag, but I also feel fairly certain it could protect it from long days of hiking and traveling.<br /><br />My biggest frustration, and also my favorite part, is that my gear is very snug. It's great because I know my lenses won't get knocked around, but it's really a puzzle to get everything to fit just right. For what it's worth, I have a 5D Mark II, 17-40mm, 28-135mm, 50mm, 100mm macro, 70-200mm, a 430 Speedlight, battery grip, and a rocket air blower. I've got a few other accessories that I throw in the outer pockets. I have to lay the 100mm on it's side which takes up a lot more room. In a pinch, I've left the 70-200mm attached to save a little bit of room.<br /><br />The side has clips for a tripod, which I actually use to attach my lens bags, and two velcro pockets that I store a business card holder and my phone in. My gorilla pod fits in one of the outer main pockets just fine.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with the bag, I'm just worried about my next move. When I buy a new lens or speedlight, where will I fit it? I could carry the 70-200mm externally, but that takes away the discreet factor when traveling.
B006RED4GA|4.0|A worthwhile slow building suspense.  You get to know and like the main characters which invests you in their fates.  Not a slasher or scare-a-minute type horror movie but well worth it.
B0034G4P9E|3.0|I thought this movie was rocky meets MMA, it sorta was but not that great. Maybe while watching this movie I forgot that it's Hollywood because (SPOILER ALERT) how do they have one guy not even break a sweat defeating his first three opponents(one hitter quitter) and then have him struggle and loose at the end. Also the training that the two main characters had leading up to the big tournament was almost non existent in the movie. The fights were real short, especially for the guy knocking them out with one blow. Unless you somehow can relate to this movie then definitely just rent it.

However, as evidence is collected and long-held family secrets come to the fore, as the trial intensifies, Andy and his wife have to come to grips with a personal trial of their own --a trial that could tear apart that marriage and life as they have known it.<br /><br />Landay tells this very powerful story largely through the excellent first person narrative of Andy Barber, as well as through parts of a Grand Jury transcript that are interspersed throughout the book in which Andy is testifying as a witness (the relevance and impact of which do not become evident until the very end). Further, Defending Jacob's powerfulness and intensity are exemplified through Landay's superior skills in delivering very credible characters and prose in such a way that I felt that I was a fourth member of the Barber family experiencing all of the complexity in, and fragility of, their lives.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is one of the rare books that keep you engrossed from the opening page to the last page -- and then haunts you after finishing it by challenging you to come to grips with questions such as: What would you do if this happened to your family? How would you handle it? Could you live with yourself later?<br /><br />Obvously, I was captivated by Defending Jacob and would highly recommend that you read it. However, be forewarned that Defending Jacob is not an \\"easy\\" read in that there will be times when you are likely to feel depressed as well as haunted by the types questions stated above.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has by far been the best and most functional Bible app I have run across. I only wish it had functionality if even limited without being connected. I have yet to find a kindle Bible of any sort with the same ease of usability and search function this one has. Love thereading and study programs too.
B00002N9ER|3.0|I bought this and put it on my flashlight  to try it out. When I took it off to install, both the brackets broke. Sadly, the QuickFist clamps don't fit my application. So I just ordered anther set.

0061992860|5.0|This mammoth general purpose survival manual is the leading benchmark standard for the modern survival manuals. The author, John \\"Lofty\\" Wiseman is a survival consultant, and a former member of the elite British 22 Special Air Service (SAS), a world renowned special operations unit. While serving in the SAS he was the primary Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) instructor, were he mastered his survival skills and instructor abilities. He served in the military for 26-years retiring in 1985 from the SAS. In 1986 he published his first edition/version of the \\"The SAS Survival Handbook\\" (published in 1986).  This manual is a tomb of survival information and covers all the fundamentals of survival (fire, shelter, water, food, navigation, etc.) in a highly illustrated and easy to understand format. The manual covers a host of topics for practically every situation (natural disasters, shipwrecks, nuclear attacks etc.). To make this book complete for most general survival situations I would incorporate a book on local edible plants and a book on primitive living like \\"Primitive Wilderness Living and Survival Skills\\" by McPherson. Additionally if you are looking for hands-on survival training, Wiseman runs the Trueways Survival School, and at this site he also has a survival DVD available. This manual would make a great addition to any personal survival library. I highly recommend this book to the experienced and inexperienced survival conscious individual.

B000002HRE|1.0|As bad as Load was, and it was BAD, this album somehow managed to be even worse.  Not that I was expecting much when I first got it, back when Metallica was still a band I cared about, the album title is basically saying \\"this is just a bunch of leftovers from the last album,\\" and the album art is just as horrific.  If you guys want people to actually buy your CD's, not just download them, maybe you should try putting actual artwork on the cover, not photos of semen and wombs.  Lovely, Metallica.  I remember first listening to this album, and just about crying by how saddened I was at the complete 180 this band that I'd loved had done.  Not to say that great bands can't change their sound and continue making great music.  Look at Radiohead's \\"Kid A,\\" their first album after \\"OK Computer.\\"  The music is entirely different, but still excellent.  This is just derivative garbage.  It must have taken them about 10 minutes to hammer out these songs.  Now, here we are 15 years later, and it's just as bad, if not worse than when I first heard it.  I honestly don't think I've ever heard a professional band with a strong history release two albums in a row that were anywhere NEAR as bad as the Load/Re-Load debacle.  I can't even listen to classic Metallica anymore without part of me thinking about 'em.  Pure crap.  PURE crap.
030788743X|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews of this book (some of them fair and balanced and helpful in giving a truly critical assessment), I feel compelled to offer an analysis that may help someone sitting on the fence about getting this book. (I have this fear that if I'd read all these negative reviews BEFORE buying the book I never would've given it a chance.)  In a nutshell, I think a minority of the reviewers here are WAY overthinking their reviews of this piece. They're holding this book to a standard it was never meant to fulfill. If you like books that are analogous to gristly meat that needs to be masticated for days in order to extract the nutrients, you will not like this book. It is not a perfectly-faceted jewel painstakingly crafted to be part of humanity's canon of Great Literature. Go read some Joyce, or Marquez, or Margaret Atwood (well, maybe not Margaret Atwood). This book is analogous to a tasty, satisfying candy bar. Fun to eat every lip-smacking bite, and you wish it'd been bigger when you're done. Too many of the negative reviews are taking this book out of the context in which it was written. It's like criticizing Airplane! for not having the artistry of Raging Bull. It's a book about '80s pop culture, for chrissakes. I can't imagine a less-literary topic on which to base a classic good guys vs. bad guys, treasure-questing, straightforward romance. Yeah, so the characters are not stereotype-busting case studies in human complexity with deep-seated flaws that change how you view yourself and others around you. If they had been it would've ruined the book. It's an adventure. Too much depth and complexity would get in the way.  I should add that I have a pretty eclectic literary diet and that I appreciate a deep book as much as any of these literary-minded wet blankets. It's just that I don't go into a convenience store hoping to find fair-trade, grass-fed, free-range organic milk. You gotta appreciate a book in context and adjust your expectations accordingly. If you want a quick-reading romp that's at once backward- and forward-looking, you won't be disappointed. If you were between the ages of 10 and 15 in 1980 you will get a huge dose of chuckle-worthy nostalgia here, especially if you played arcade video games. One reviewer criticized how so many of the '80s references went to too much length to explain themselves, but I'm sure this was an editorial decision to make the story more appealing to those who aren't aware of/don't remember everything about the '80s. (BTW, there were plenty of '80s references that weren't explained). The explanations didn't bother me in the least, especially when it came to Japanese-originated '80s pop culture. Since I'm American I didn't get exposed to much of that. I appreciated the explanation.  And then there were those who took some of the limited social commentary personally (ever read any Neal Stephenson? Maybe you'd better steer clear of him too). To me these 'rants' simply helped flesh out the hero's character while evincing an atmosphere of futility in everyday life a la Catch-22. Maybe you're religious or you get frustrated by technology and have to call tech support a lot. I'm sure you're still basically a good person and that the author wasn't criticizing you personally. He probably doesn't even know you exist. Lighten up.  One reviewer criticized the excessive use of 'pulling a rabbit out of a hat' plot devices. Yep, it's true. Fair criticism. A lot of the tight spots in the plot were resolved a bit too neatly. You could view these as plot cop-outs or cool ideas that save the day. But remember, the story takes place almost entirely inside a video game. Rabbits get pulled out of hats all the time in video games. Go with it. Enjoy it. Savor it. Revel in it.  I just finished reading this book for the third time in two months. I haven't done that with a book since I was a teenager... in the 1980s. If you're in your 40s and embarked on a typical life full of the attendant commitments and time sinks that entails, you'll understand the volumes of praise that speaks for this book.  Now I need to go cut some firewood before I involuntarily pick the thing up for a fourth reading.
0061148512|5.0|Sylvia Plath has been one of my favorite authors. This novel is just beautiful and dark at the same time looking into the soul of a girl that we can all relate to. The language is dark and disperse and somehow full of hope. Too bad Sylvia Plath did end up committing suicide at the age of 30. If she had lived and survived I think she would have been one of the most influential writers of all time.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I was very impressed with the story & how the advancements in science can get out of handle. These types of movies always pique my interest.
0761158820|5.0|This is such an awesome book!!!! The art is INCREDIBLE. Given, it is difficult for little hands... but for say... 24 year old hands... it's so much fun! I work with kids and I bring the monsters with me after I make them and the kids love it! (And there are so many in the book they work great for rewards or prizes for good work or behavior). I have to admit though, using the papertoy monsters with the kids, was a complete afterthought. I just really enjoyed making them!

0307959856|3.0|P.D. James is a meticulous and skillful writer, and in this sequel to \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" she clearly takes pleasure in her power to reproduce the cadences of Jane Austen's early 19th-century prose. The reader will share this pleasure; spending an afternoon in this book really does cause one to feel transported back to the world of the original (that is a kind of magic).  Unfortunately, \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" becomes consumed with such Austen-like detail and mood-setting to the expense of both the plot and, more surprisingly, the development of the characters (a whole chapter describing Bidwell, an elderly under-butler, polishing silver, followed by a second with Georgiana at the pianoforte come to mind). The pace is just a little too slow, and James finally lacks Austen's graceful light touch, which leavens such domestic detail in the original. Likewise, the moments of irony and social satire, while present, are too far and few between.  It also doesn't help that we are lacking the romantic suspense that keeps readers engaged in the original, with all its misunderstandings, twists, and reversals. (James tries to recreate that with the love triangle of Alveston, Georgiana, and Fitzwilliam here, but the outcome is really never in doubt.) Most troubling is that the full development and resolution of the \\"murder mystery\\" are left to the final pages of the novel rather than being built up slowly over its course.  Many readers here remark that this reprise of Austen is superior to others in the genre. I don't doubt that, and since I'm not familiar with the genre I can't comment. \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" is worth reading, but it doesn't stand up either to the original or to James's other mystery writing.

B000HF0KXU|1.0|I was streaming this at no charge through Amazon Prime and it still wasn't worth the price of admission.

Trite trash. Save your time and money...move on to your next choice.

B0068TL23G|5.0|This is a solid little game. A very simple concept, yet still challenging at times. Worth your money for a small challenge.
0817439390|5.0|I learned more from this book than a 12 hour 'beginners' class I attended.  A great starter book for beginning photographers.

B005ZKYXZI|3.0|Real Steel was the kind of sleeper hit that's a bit refreshing in this day and age of massive blockbuster extravaganzas. Granted that the film as a whole is a semi-cliche' mellowdrama with rock 'em sock 'em robots, but hey, there's just something about it that just makes you want to see it. Given that, it doesn't necessarily make Real Steel anything special, and contrary to a majority of viewer's reactions to it, is actually pretty overrated. Hugh Jackman stars as a down and out robot boxing manager that's stuck reconnecting with his estranged 11 year old son, all the while trying to climb back up the ranks of the robot boxing world. That's pretty much it in a nut shell, with Lost vet Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, and Kevin Durand along for the ride too. The effects are good and the film's action sequences are wonderful, but the overly predictable story and abundance of wanna-be-hipness really hurt the film. All in all, Real Steel isn't bad, but it's nowhere near as special as many have found it to be.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I just bought this game because I missed playing this on my iPod. However, when I try to open it, it shows a sand timer on the screen, then crashes. EVERY TIME!!! Great game, horrible software design. And yes, I downloaded it over Wi-Fi. Worst $3 ever spent. Wish I could rate zero stars.
B004EPZ08O|3.0|I have seen all of this series of movies over the years. The plot never changes only the faces of the victims. Innocent people targeted by fate to die, only to escape due to the premonition of one of the potential doomed souls. Sam Lawton (Nicholas D'Agosto) sees the death of most of his fellow workers occurring on a company planned team building outing. Due to his actions several survive what would have been certain death. Sammy's reward is to draw the attention of the police and the FBI as to how he foresaw the tragic event. Did he cause it?<br /><br />One by one the survivors are picked off in order as, \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated\\". The movie was action filled in some places and slow and boring in others. After 5 movies on the same topic the plot hasn't varied much and the director has tried to make up for a predictable plot with unique ways to die in overly graphic ways.<br /><br />The movie is very gory and bloody so if that bothers you then you should pass on this one. They also drop the F-bomb in this one so just be aware. Due to the graphic nature of this film and a little language children should not see this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great, whenever I'm bored I have like a bunch of games I can chose from, and getting the coins and challenging itself is so addictive :) its just amazing, and I would say to right away, get one of the 300,000 games cuz u get a lott of points from those, letting u get more games faster
B0068TL23G|4.0|thought provoking, interesting, fun. several stages in each of the many chapters. only issue I have- after I exit the game the background music doesnt stop. have to restart my HTC Droid Incredible 2
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this as an easy and quick place to go to check the weather.  I especially like that I can get a map or a quick video forecast.  I do wish they included the barometer,  though.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I was very pleased with my Adele 21 cd that I ordered and also pleased at the quickness of the delivery from Amazon.com.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  I am hooked on the Amazon site now.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|My son really wanted this one and I was hesitant.  I don't generally like the new generation of transformers.  They are exceedingly complex and very fragile.  I grew up with G1s (and the lack of rubber wheels on these toys still bugs me).<br /><br />However, this Bumblebee is one of my favorites of the new series.  I haven't been keeping up with all the 'classes' of transformer toys.  I know we have one of the earlier Ironhides that is super-hard to transform and is very fragile and the robot mode doesn't look all that good anyway.  But the mechtech Bumblebee is easy enough for a 5-year-old to transform him.  Both the car and robot modes look good, are tightly fitted (no loose or jiggly parts and no gaps), and the articulation is excellent.<br /><br />Besides that, this is the only modern transformer toy that I haven't had to do emergency repairs on with a limb coming off.  Very sturdy.<br /><br />I don't think it's quite as good as my G1 Skyfire and I just like the looks of the Tomahawk better, but that's the only reason it's my 3rd favorite.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. I just had to own this movie.Everytime this movie comes on I just can't help it I have to watch it. I CAN'T TURN THE CHANNEL. LOVE IT!
B006HGXGWU|5.0|The ending appears to be unambiguous. Throughout the movie, Curtis experiences visions telling him trouble is coming. He fears that he is succumbing to mental illness as his mother had. As the movie ends, his wife and daughter experience the same feeling of dread, knowing that trouble is indeed coming to the family. There's no escaping it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome. doesn't give u enough points towards the end but is still a awsome game and great at making time go by faster
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This Item was simple, basic, and serves as an awesome case. It was expensive as some of the others and I was super happy with the item!  recommended
0553582038|4.0|I just finished this fourth book, the 5th is on the way (can't wait!). I'm coming to this series late after first watching the HBO series, and I was instantly hooked. I devoured those first three books. The second and third in particular were amazing. This is now my favorite fantasy series behind LOTR.  I give this book a solid 4 stars. It was a little dry in parts, but always engaging. I still found myself flying through chapters to see what happens next. I couldn't put this down until 3:30 a.m. last night, after a full day of reading.  Some of the chapters seem superfluous, but they are always interesting. This is a wonderful fantasy world Martin created. This series is EPIC.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the plans the Bible app provides it's helping me read the whole Bible as well as deal with personal conflicts

B006WPSQVC|5.0|My husband and i just watched this movie. this was an excellent movie that i believe every man should watch. it brought tears to both of our eyes. we have watched the movie \\"fireproof\\" before we got married and recieved it as a gift. Even though \\"fireproof\\" was also a very good movie, this movie will most definitely be added to our movie collection. Very refreshing to see a movie with such strong values displayed. Thank you producers!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy the game selection. it helps me kill time when I cant fall asleep. keep up the great work!

B0054JZC6E|2.0|alternately mildly entertaining and terribly frustrating. chock full of ads. a rather blatant and brazen attempt to get you to sign up for other paid services

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Love this app, could be more colors and a bit of fine points to paint but this works pretty well!!! LOVE IT!
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Works as expected and does a fine job of recording from old vinyl. It take a little getting used to but if I can figure it out, anyone should.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have read all the books. I now own all the movies to this series . I got this for Christmas, so worth the money.
0156034026|3.0|The book by pretty fast. It is a pretty short reading depending on the reader. It took me no longer than a few hours.  The book overall was not very good to read. I would not recommend it for someone to read unless it is for a class.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This is an okay sharpener for cheap knives that say \\"Made in Pakistan, China, Japan, Mexico, etc, etc, but does a crappy jop of putting an edge on anything made of high quality steel, especially if it's a knife you would use for skinning or fileting.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Brilliant relaunch of the legendary tale of Sherlock Holmes. You don't have to be a fan of Holmes to enjoy this movie. It's a fantastic movie filled with action, suspense, mystery and wit. This movie brings to life the great mind of Holmes and the people around him. For those who love a baffling mystery, this movie will not disappoint!
B005KELQEU|4.0|Nice case easy to use, however one down side the way it's made you will always open it upside down.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Listen to this music and you will join the folksy Zombie Nation who cannot get enough of their charming and enticingly cutting-edge sound. If the Pogues were heroin addicts instead of drunks, they would be Mumford and Sons.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can't believe this was free! Don't wait a second to download this game to your Kindle Fire! I've played over 200 games already, and they have all played perfectly. There is one very brief ad before each game starts. With one touch, it's gone. Then it's Solitaire heaven! The graphics are perfect, the gameplay is perfect. Need I say more? Actually, I would have gladly PAID for this free game! Way to go MobilityWare!!!!
B004EPYZXK|1.0|WHY did they waste our time?? Bad movies always crop up now and then[ie--Killer Tomatoes] but this one seems to think its a serious contender---there are so many mysterious things about the moon that could have been used[see-'Someone Else is On The Moon']---instead they go the route of 'killer rocks'--I know they were low budget but this is just ridiculous.....
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent brain game! I enjoy the simple yet complex thinking required to play. I've just started but am captivated. Keep up the good work.

B005COO1X6|2.0|This was a so-so story that ended abruptly. What you end up with is a man-eating car, of unknown origin, that suddenly blasts back up into space when a killer magnifying glass is held up to it.  I was glad it was over.  I guess you could call it a blessing in disguise.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it. fun and easy to play. Easy to follow instructions. fun way to pass the time when you are waiting for your food to arrive.
B004132HZS|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is the ultimate Holmes, and his Watson brings new depth to the role. I enjoyed this for the superb acting, camera and editing work, shots of London, and inventive scripts. My 19-year-old son liked it so much he brought it back to college with him! Oh well-it was nice while it lasted!
B000SO7IO4|3.0|Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins both have very distinctive voices; you won't ever confuse them for someone else or vice versa. Ray Wilson does not have that kind of voice. He was probably not the best choice for a singer Mike and Tony could have made. Maybe he could have grown into the role, I don't know. Had the supporting tour made it to North America, I would have gone to judge but, sadly, that didn't happen. Secondly, It is clear that most of these songs are much longer than what what made it to disc. The fade outs are glaring and quite bothersome to my ear. It's as if I know an incredible 70's era instrumental passage is coming but the song fades out instead. This record does sound more like 'classic' Genesis than anything since perhaps Duke but ultimately, left me unsatisfied.
0440244412|4.0|I loved this series, but everyone is a critic.  I didn't give it 5 stars because this last book was way too long and it seemed like she rushed through the important stuff and lingered on the not so important.  I loved the ending, because she gave me an ending I didn't know I wanted.  It wasn't what I was hoping for, it wasn't a messy ending either, it felt just right.  I wish that there would have been more closure with Dani, but there wasn't.  My favorite thing about this book was that you never really knew who was who and what they were after until the end.  I love her Barron's character, I created a perfect image of him in my head with her descriptions.  She kept me captivated the whole way through from the very first book. I'm giving her four stars because I havent yet read any other story line that I've like more.  It has great potential I just don't think she reached it completely.  There were some inconsistencies ***SPOILER*** don't read any further its just difficult to explain with out spoiling it.  At one point Mac's mom says Barron loves her apple pies, but then in the end all of a sudden he doesn't eat, and even towards the beginning of the series he didn't.  Why all the drama with Mac?  Why couldn't she just ward off everything that got in her way?  I just didn't understand why she had to drag out the whole thing with her and Barrons, also why did she suddenly kill Darroc?  Her fast resolution to Barron's son was kind of weak, and the whole thing with Rowena was dumb too there where so many why's in the series and this last book just didn't seem to tie them all together neatly.  It felt rushed and not really thought through.

0439023483|5.0|Well, a really good friend kept telling me about The Hunger Game series and I just kept reading other things and doing my needlepoint...THEN.  I bought the first book The Hunger Games from Amazon and really, WOW.  I read the book in one day, well written, I couldn't put it down. The next day I bought the other two books.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this read.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series and now that they're all available in Blu-Ray I'll probably get the whole series.  It's fund to watch them develop over the years and the final one really put a nice cap on the series.<br /><br />That said, I'm not really crazy about the Ultra-violet digital copy.  In fact, the whole UV format should be re-examined.  I probably will not spend the money for the extra digital copy of the movie if it's going to be UV.  Won't load onto my iPod which I use frequently while traveling.  I can't see any advantage to using UV over a more iPod friendly format or even WMV, for which I already have a viewer and don't need to download any additional software for.  I simply won't pay for UV anymore.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is the best CD I've listened to in a while. Adele is extremely gifted with an incredible voice and every word comes straight from her heart. I'm surprised I haven't worn it out yet, as I listen to it constantly! Looking forward to following her career as I know she will be around for a long time.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|Many people consider this to be The Rolling Stones' best album.  I don't know if I'd go that far, but it certainly is a great, eclectic album.  Here it is in all it's glory, remastered with ten bonus tracks.  Just get it already!
B005LAIGGY|2.0|This movie is the kind of movie that all viewers should see while sitting in a hard-backed chair.  Not because of the subject matter, which deserves better treatment than this, but because the movie is so agonizingly slow with such an agonizingly shrill performance by the kid actor Thomas Horn, that your body might demand that you shut down your conscience thinking and seek refuge in sleep.  The hard-backed chair will make that difficult, and you will find yourself being bombarded by a one-tone performance by the lead actor.  This is a beautiful movie to watch with a terrific message, but the message simply is lost due to the bad acting.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is great.  So is Sandra Bullock.  However, their combined screen time works out to less than 12 minutes.  The theater I saw this in was 2/3 full, and I didn't hear much sniffling.  By the time the emotional payout finally arrived, it seemed as though most of the patrons were long since ready to leave the theater.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love palying this game it is so much fun. I play it all the time. I encourage you to buy this.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars except it never stops running and can't always access when out of signal range. I love that I can get the version I like and it's easy to find verses
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I am sure that this is a great game as I love games that keep!my mind working. For some reason though when I open the game its reaches half way while loading and just closes. Just for that reason I am only giving 3 stars. If I can figure out what is going on I will change the review.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I was in love with this case when I bought it. Showcases the beauty of the iPhone and 1 month after I bought my 4s, I dropped it 2 stories and the cased protected it. But it's 4 months later now and the case is yellowing... just looking dull, more yellow in some spots, quite brown in others. And I can't seem to get it clean. Going to try something in the same material, but not clear.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|I too was a little skeptical before I started to watch the pilot episode.  I found myself becoming very entranced with the interaction of the characters and plot development.  Katherine Mcphee is terrific in playing the demure girl next store who needs to get her sexy on! And she pulls off the sexy very well.  The musical numbers in the show were fresh and catchy.  I especially liked the song and dance rehearsal scene of \\"National Past Time\\".  It is exciting, sexy and so Marilyn!  I could see this show within a show about Marilyn Monroe becoming an actual Broadway musical in it's own right.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|If it wasn't t for the constant crashes this game would get five stars easily. There is a lot of variety to the levels, and the game itself is addicting.  My only other complaint is that occasionally it is difficult to tell which tiles are locked and which are free.  Fix the bugs for an easy two more stars!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. Started right up with only my zip code. I reccomend this to anyone who likes to see the weather report.

0385344325|4.0|Lee Child has taken a different approach to his series character, Jack Reacher, the former military cop who now wanders about the United States, earning enough money to get by and carrying no luggage except his portable toothbrush. In The Affair, Child tells us how Reacher got to be Reacher, going back in time to his last case while he was still an Army major.  It's 1997, and the Army is in the midst of covert action in Kosovo, sending Rangers out of the Fort Kelham military base near Carter Crossing, Mississippi on a regular basis. The mission is secret, but the town knows something is going on, because Rangers are in and out of the local bars and stores - indeed, the small town depends on them to keep going. The problem is that there's been a grotesque murder: a woman has had her throat slit, been drained of blood, and then posed in an alley as if she bled out there. Worse, and unknown to Reacher when he's assigned to the case, she's not the first.  The Army is concerned that someone on the base committed the murders. It sends an investigator directly to the base to conduct an investigation from the inside, but it also sends Reacher to Carter Crossing under cover, asking him to find out from that perspective just what's going on. Reacher, who has spent his entire adult life in the Army, has no clothing suitable for an undercover mission. He purchases a shirt, a pair of pants, some underwear - and that famous portable toothbrush - and he's set to go. Reacher doesn't buy more than the clothes he wears, leading him to the pattern he observes in all the other books: when a shirt or a pair of pants gets dirty or torn, he simply chucks them and buys new. It's a lot cheaper than having a wardrobe and a place to keep it, after all.  Once in Mississippi, though, the police chief - a stunningly gorgeous woman who used to be a Marine - makes Reacher for an undercover cop almost the second he sets foot on the streets of Carter Crossing. She all but orders him out of town until he comes up with some information she missed, at which point they become a team in most ways, even though they have opposite purposes: she wants the murderer to be on the Army base and not her problem, while Reacher wants to find that the murderer has no relationship to the Army whatsoever.  The investigation goes forward in the same, smart way most of Reacher's cases progress, including the random violence that seems a part of his life. And the random violence is followed by some carefully planned violence in which Reacher's lightning quick reactions save him from an ugly death, more than once. And Reacher has the romance - or, at least, the hot sex - that he seems to find waiting for him wherever he goes.  The origins of superheroes (and Reacher really is a superhero, even if he doesn't wear tights and a cape) are not always the best tales, but Child has turned out a strong entry in the series with this novel. The reader familiar with Reacher gets the delight of recognition when Reacher does the sort of thing he always does, seeing how this or that habit of his started up. And readers who haven't encountered Reacher before would find this novel a great place to start. It's a good story, well told, precisely what a reader hopes to find in a thriller.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is adficting and fun and never lets u down on a boring day so yea
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard about this series through some friends and was ready to be entertained when I downloaded them to my Kindle.  My hands began to cramp when I realized I had been reading for 5 hours.  Impossible to put down!  Descriptions and conversations so real, you become one of the characters. My 13 year old grandson's reading class used the first book IN CLASS, now he can't wait for the second and third book.  Sparking the interest of young individuals to read deserves a big high five in my book.
B006OB3K56|4.0|This is an artsy adult film about a socially inept man addicted to porn, particularly Internet porn. His NY apartment is furnished a bit Spartan. His boring life is interrupted when his sister, Carey Mulligan comes to stay. There is an awkward scene where he stares at her naked body while she showers. It is designed to show how dysfunctional and creepy Brandon has become in life, like the long drawn out subway scene. His sister is in a bad relationship and is as dysfunctional as Brandon. She is a nightclub singer. The suicidal Carey is desperate for intimacy as is hinted in so many scenes.<br /><br />Brandon's dysfunction is apparently from living a semi-isolated life on a computer. His obsession with casual sex, porn, and masturbation causes problems in his life which escalates as the film progresses. Brandon realizes he has issues and takes steps to resolve those issues, but has trouble moving forward toward a normal sexual relationship that involves intimacy and only compounds things.<br /><br />Fassbender and McQueen do an excellent job in capturing the character of Brandon as we see his despair, grief, and isolation. This is the type of film in which I had to watch the whole thing to decide if I liked it or not depending on the ending. After seeing the ending, I am still not sure, which is why I have opted to sit on the fence post at 3 stars. Oh wait! I will add a star for nudity...but I'm not a pervert.<br /><br />F-bomb sex, nudity and some full frontal nudity (Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, Mari-Ange Ramirez (first prostitute?),Nicole Beharie, Elizabeth Masucci, Hannah Ware (Internet girl?) DeeDee Luxe, Calamity Chang)
B0066W1AZK|1.0|also your comp play is zero fun to play against.  plays pure posititional defence, nearly impossible to win material from yet makes blatent opening errors on move three.  this app might be ok for beginners, but if you actually know how to play chess you might want something with a bit more substance
B0059XTUVI|2.0|It seems we can't just can't have a normal biographical movie anymore without flashbacks. The flashback style is done for the purpose of showing us how events in someone's past effected their later decisions. Seeing the retired senile Margaret Thatcher was really unnecessary to this film. Can you imagine a Reagan biography starting out with a senile Reagan not knowing he is no longer president and talking to dead people? Unfortunately the senility scenes are needed so we can get to know the character of Marget Thatcher because the main biography part is poorly done with an over abundance of \\"red meat\\" sound bites.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the film then employs this technique during the flashback so there is a flashback within the flashback.<br /><br />I liked the young Margaret Roberts (Alexandra Roach) growing up in a man's world where the expectations of women were to stay out of business and politics. Her bucking the system was inspirational and it would have been a better film had we seen more of this and less of Margaret thinking her husband was still alive.<br /><br />The meat of the film picks up when she is the Education Secretary of the conservative party. England is facing a union strike crippling the nation. Marget doesn't like her party's leadership and decides to run for the leader of the Conservative Party. She correctly places herself in the hands of professions who tweak her for national appeal, including working on her shrill voice...but she keeps the pearls.<br /><br />The movie relates to today. England was in a recession and people couldn't pay their mortgage. Margret wanted to cut government spending in the midst of a recession contrary to everyone else, including her own party who worries about re-election. I expected to see a \\"Paid for by Ron Paul\\" after that speech.<br /><br />For me, the film becomes watchable when Thatcher has to weigh her decision to go to war over the Falkland Islands. Streep gives us some wonderful performances. But when I see Matthew Marsh miscast as Alexander Haig, I have to ask, \\"What were they thinking?\\"<br /><br />I went into this film thinking \\"5 stars\\" but reality set in as they killed this film on the editing floor. Horrifically edited and badly written. Whose idea was it really to have Streep walk around in an old house coat with messed up hair looking acting like Edith Bunker? The scenes of Streep moving through a crowd of faces, speaking her thoughts was another idea that failed. The soundtrack during the file footage scenes was terrible. Streep had a few strong scenes, but not enough to save this film. My advice: read the book.<br /><br />No f-bombs, no sex, brief nudity on file footage.But when I see Matthew Marsh miscast as Alexander Haig, I have to ask, \\"What were they thinking?\\"<br /><br />I went into this film thinking \\"5 stars\\" but reality set in as they killed this film on the editing floor.

B00000634J|5.0|John Lennon CD was received initially in a broken case. Seller quickly furnished a replacement case which also arrived broken. I requested a third case wrapped in a manner that the U.S. Post Office could not demolish it. Note that the first two cases were sufficiently wrapped but somehow the mail service was on a search and destroy mission on those two cases. Seller went above and beyond what I expected of them in this matter. I not only will purchase from seller in the future but I will check to see if seller is the party I will be buying from. I have nothing but praise for seller's handling of this purchase and the subsequent service seller offered regarding the replacement cases. I am enjoying the CD and I think of the seller every time I pop it into my CD player. You can bet these folks spell their name c-u-s-t-o-m-e-r  s-a-t-i-s-f-a-c-t-i-o-n. You are the best.
0156034026|5.0|This book was amazing!  It was thought-provoking, and the ending was brilliant. It makes for interesting discussion, and good book-club book.Ofcourse, buying at Amazon is the only way to go!
B002ZG997M|4.0|I actually liked this movie.  i wasn't sure what to expect, but I found it at least enjoyable.  Oldman, Washington, Kunis, all deliver and there are many other actors through-out the movie you will recognize.  Overall an enjoyable ride.  It is hard to figure what is going on, until the climax of the movie, which I think is somewhat unusual in today's movie-going experience.  It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you know at the beginning is Denzel is a man with a mission.  The mission is not revealed until about halfway through the movie and the final twist is reserved for the last few minutes.  Like I said, it was very good, and the rare keep you guessing model is definitely a plus!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the way this app syncs across my android phone, my Kindle Fire, my netbook and even my IPod Touch. This is the first app I've had that would do this. VERY convenient.
B003O86FMW|4.0|So thankful for my kindle- I could start this second book immediately.  Could not put it down. Can't wait to read the next one!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wasn't sure who I wanted Catniss to end up with before I started the third book, but by the end, I was pleased with the way it turned out.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Honestly, I think I enjoyed this book more than I should have. The title is what convinced me to get this book for my kindle. I'm in high school and can't help but be drawn to a book with a good bad boy, however, i wouldn't recomend it to anyone much older than myself. It makes sense that this book is self published. I never could find a solid plot line, the character of Abby was a bit...disorganized, and the character of Travis was just plain scary in a very appealing way. I would like to say, this was one of the best self published novels i have ever read, despite the occational typo and confusion in sentence structure. Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any young person who is into scandalous bad boy romance novels.

B000VUVGAW|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Here is a more sympathetic & human retelling of the Beowulf & Grendel story, actually a poem, written between the 8th & 11th century.<br /><br />Here Beowulf is a more kind & understanding protagonist. Grendel is a wronged antagonist, who looks very much human, but is a mutant or abomination in the eyes of humanity. Both are played as sympathetic characters. Gerard Butler does a fine job as Beowulf, as he plays his part as a multi dimensional personality, not just a one dimensional blood, fame & power lusting hero.<br /><br />Stellan Skarsgard, who looks remarkably like Geoffrey Rush in all that orange hair, does a fine job as the King, who has a secret to hide from Beowulf about Grendel, & only at the end is his hand forced & his humanity at stake for what he has done.<br /><br />A thoughtful, sincere retelling, \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" is highly recommended!
B004EPZ02A|2.0|If you like seeing a camera taped to a rotating fan for 70% of the movie...Then this movie is for you.  So many flaws also. It's 1988 and it looks to be filmed in HD.  The overall setting looked to be in todays world. The first two sucked, so I shouldn't be surprised this one does too. It brings absolutely nothing new.  Leaves unaswered questions that will probably wont get answered. The only thing that was good,  was the littlest girls acting. Two stars just for her.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like this game! I would so recommend this to you because I really enjoy playing it! Get this game!

B0012GMW0C|4.0|Nothing spectacular,revolutionary,unforgettable or very original. You will not hear this on classic rock radio stations. But you get some extraordinary musicianship and fantastic mosaic made of rock,blues,jazz...Put your headphones on and let it flow.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It goes without saying that the Harry Potter series of movies had all the elements<br />for great entertainment. The kids were good actors when this started and watching them mature into their talent is a treat we usually don't get except in television series.<br />I love the films. I couldn't believe what a steal this was to purchase all the movies at such a price. I love being able to watch anytime I want to dive back into Harry Potter's universe.<br /><br />I understand the Blue Ray version would have interviews, however I didn't see paying<br />for that when interviews are already available and will be again whenever the actors appear on television.
B00664AM5C|1.0|Movie is OK, but I buy Blu-rays labeled  \\"digital copy\\" so I can import to my ITunes library and sync to my IPAD and other IOS standalone devices to watch when traveling.  Ultraviolet does not work with ITunes - it is simply a streaming service - so unless you are connected via wi-fi or 3G - when you want to watch the movie - you are out of luck.  I sent an email to Ultraviolet asking for the ITUNES authorization code (they do exist - go to the Apple Blog related to Ultraviolet) and received the following response:  \\"UltraViolet works on iPhones and iPads and many more devices (Android phones/tablets, Windows PCs, Macs, etc.), but currently, the iTunes library does not support the listing of UltraViolet content.\\"  THIS IS NOT TRUE \\"DIGITAL COPY\\" - IT IS DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING.
B006BQNJR8|4.0|I am to this day a major fan of Robert E Howard's adventure tales.<br />I don't delude myself that my interpretation of that vision will ever translate to the screen.<br />Mr. Howard was not writing Hemingway or Shakespeare or Masterpiece Theatre.<br /><br />Hello! Barbarian hacking and slashing his way to the top of the food chain in<br />ancient civiliation where magic exists.<br /><br />The movie got such bad press before it was released it was doomed from the beginning.<br />This is strictly a movie for what some people consider mindless violence (the sword and sorcery adventure, long on sword).<br />The production values were better than expected, the plot was coherent and the actors played their parts. It was fast paced and I had fun cheering for the 'good' guy whose moral compass is stuck on revenge.<br />If you were looking for something more, try Masterpiece. I didn't find Arnold's versions of Conan any better than this. He just had bigger crowd scenes.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Those who want a smash-bang, high-adrenaline action flick, this movie is not for you.  It takes its time, and even the action is controlled and deliberate.  What it is, however, is start to finish riveting in a way that films with thousands of bullets and massive explosions can very rarely be...  beautifully shot and fantastically acted.  When the action does come, it's brutal and jarring in contrast to the reservedness of the rest of the film.  Packs a serious punch.  A must see for any true movie lover.
B006LG7O38|3.0|I enjoyed the location and the actor's performances.<br />However I thought it was short on scares and didn't build up any seriously tense moments.<br />I have to admit I liked the original one much better.
B004BLTNJI|4.0|This film is great for its visuals alone.  It's quite spooky.  I would not recommend it for young children.  The voice of Coraline is a little annoying but that's my only negative comment.  The story is very original and it has a nice little lesson in there too.  There are some rich characters that you will love and hate.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great to access your notes, pictures, articles, etc. from different computers.  easy to use and organize. generally just a good app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Have not unlocked all the games yet but happy with most I've played so far. A few of the games are a bit addictive so be prepared. There are a couple I don't like too much but I think it has more to do with my inability to get the hang of them.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was really disappointed with this series and found it one dimentional and not worth the hype. I know it's written for teenagers, but I was mostly bored throughout the series wishing to connect with the characters more. There are a lot of great ideas and I wish the author would've gotten into less detail with the characters aquiring food and more on the political plotting and storyline.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is so much fun. I'm addicted to these games, when I come home from work and school this is the first thing I do!

0439023521|4.0|everyone was raving about this book...not into mainstream or fiction in general..but i wanted to see what the hype was about. and it blew my rather low expectations out of the water. thought it was great. couldn't put it down!

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I loved it. sometimes the obstacles defy gravity when you hit them and they do not fall,but that kind've adds humorous to the game(can be annoying though).  it works great on my kindle.  once I started playing this app it was really hard to stop.  it also is a major stress reliever.  I totally recommend this app to anyone young or old as long as they can slide and tap their fingers on the screen.
1904994679|5.0|A wonderful book.  Very interesting.  The book makes fun to learn.  My grandson who is 7 sits and looks through this book for hours.  And tells me all about the things that are in there.
0446547654|3.0|I had high hopes when I opened The Best of Me. It had a lot of promise but, it quickly lost me as the last few Sparks books have. I quickly got bored with the predictability of Dawson's family, and other characters. Tuck could have been developed better. He was actually the best character. It had the same \\"ghost\\" storyline as in Safe Haven, which I didn't like. The ending felt rushed and totally unrealistic. I actually couldn't wait to finish this book and put it back on the shelf.

Greg has to be good because it is the holidays and he does not want to be on Santa`s naughty list. It is unfair because people who do not celebrate Christmas do not have to be worried about being naughty.  Now it has really gone far says Greg.  Guess what my mom found a doll from her childhood named Santa`s Scout.  It is a elf that reports how the children were acting. Well it is Christmas Eve and the Heffley family put on the ornaments while Manny was sleeping. When he woke up, he had a meltdown not because they did the tree without him it is because he did not get to put his ornament up first.  So we took down all the ornaments and put his on first. Well today I have to buy presents for the family at the holiday bazaar at school. When I got them their presents I had a little money leftover so I spent it on the best thing in the world according to Greg, chicken legs I got some and ate them like a pack of wolves, yum they were good. Well I need some money so we opened our own holiday bizarre. We could earn money but when we went to the newspaper the price that it would be for the add was ridiculous so that was a waste of time. The mom suggested you should make your own paper so we did. The next day we went around town trying to sell them but nobody bought them. We gave them out for free. After that we went to town to see if anybody was willing to buy a ad in the paper.But only one person did. So the next day we spent our money buying colored ink.But when the paper came out Tony was not very thrilled. Well, we started handing out the paper at school but that did not last very long. Principal Roy took one look at the paper and threw it out. So that did not work so we tried posters and here is what happened. We set them up on the school but it started raining so it left big green blobs on the school. We tried to scrub them off but a teacher spotted us. So the next day at school people were talking about the vandalism to the school. At noon they started calling people to the office. Good thing they only called the kids who would do that. All of the sudden they called me up. I had to tell the truth so I did. I had to scrub the paint off the wall. Well today Rodrick has to sleep in my room because we had a flood. We had to wait in till it dried, well today is Christmas. There was no presents under the tree so we looked in the garage and there they were so my Christmas was great.  I hoped you liked my review.
0525478817|5.0|Time Magazine called The Fault in Our Stars \\"Damn near genius.\\"They were almost correct, the book is pure genius. This book has so much emotion and is so well written that I honestly cannot recommend it enough. All I can say is that you need to read this book.
0062011847|5.0|it seems just a little wrong that he gets better and better and yet so many other authors seem to suck.  it's like he's unbalanced the curve so much that great stuff just keeps sliding his way filling up his mind to bursting. How is it possible to write to funny that every other page makes me laugh so hard I almost pee my pants?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i gave this game three stars because it is pretty fun and hard at the same time you should try this game
0060873027|5.0|I have to admit, I was concerned. The reviews of \\"Micro\\" seemed so lackluster that I was almost afraid to read it. I wondered if it would taint the memory of an author I really admire. Sure, I knew the reigns were handed off to Richard Preston--a notable author in his own right--but  as an author myself, I also know how difficult it would be to pick up someone else's work and not only finish it, but do it in a way that would please that author's fans. An author's voice is unique. To duplicate it would be like trying to duplicate someone's handwriting. So how well did Preston do?<br /><br />I think he did a fantastic job. \\"Micro\\" is a page-turner in every sense of the word. It has lots of fascinating cutting-edge science, plenty of action and intrigue, surprises, a villain you can despise, a scientific team working to solve problems--in short, all the things you expect from a Michael Crichton book. And yet, it was unique enough to stand on its own. To me, it felt like \\"Jurassic Park\\" on a microscopic scale. I mean that as a complement, of course, as \\"Park\\" was one of my favorite Crichton books.<br /><br />My only criticism would come early in the book. One of the characters reacts to a death in the family in a way that felt, to me, a little unauthentic. I can't imagine a real person acting the way he/she acted in similar circumstances. However, I also realize that his/her responses were part of the setup for the amazing stuff that comes later. And I can overlook a lot for what comes later. It is awesome.<br /><br />\\"Micro\\" is a worthy addition to the Crichton canon. Well done, Mr. Preston!
B006ZNRD06|1.0|This app is not worth downloading it does not play any videos.Don't buy it,stay away I tried so many times and never works.
B002KAOSEW|4.0|I was delaying reading this book because of the low ratings but finally read it last week. It is another great Reacher book by Child. Don't listen to these pro-war Republicans. As usual they don't want to hear what solders really feel about the war. In one interview Child said that he got lots of feedback from troops serving in Iraq and Afgan and that's what he included in this book.
B00000IQW5|5.0|\\"Always\\" is a reminder that life is about losing, letting go and about going on even though you don't want to. Entertainingly it touches your heart at times with sadness, brings up laughter just when you need it and reminds you of life yet to be lived.
B001HN690O|5.0|Marvelous! A wonderful followup to Kung Fu Panda. It very much joins the story of the Dragon Warrior with the Fantastic Five!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|A perfect beginning to the story! It shows how we built the changes we saw in Planet of the Apes. I knew I would enjoy the story but that made it all the better!
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Someone once said there is nothing new. It is just cowboys and aliens. Well that is the title. The title could be a bit misleading as the aliens could be the type that crosses the border.<br /><br />In any event this is a fun movie full of actions, surprises, romance, and gold. There is a lot of talent involved and a chance to notice one again how Harrison Ford can easily slip in to the tough old man parts.<br /><br />The film starts out great with rough and tough cowboys. One cannot remember who he is.  Or how he got his strange bracelet that he cannot seem to get off. Oh and I doubt it would be any surprise to say that somewhere down the ling aliens will get involved. Can't go in to too much detail as there are a lot of surprises, twists and turns.<br /><br />Be sure to watch all the DVD extras.
B002BWP49C|1.0|I do not see what everyone sees in this saga. I actually walked out of the theater before it was even finished. The characters are shallow, the story is predictable and the overall feel is one of a teenage soap opera. I am a huge fan of vampires and this is definitely not my cup of tea.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|This movie is very good for what it is. This is not Oscar material. You aren't watching The Hours or Revolutionary Road...This is a great funny movie that touches on reality. I loved it. I am buying it!  The jokes are funny and sometimes go extreme, but you should expect that in this movie before you even pick it up. Don't delude yourself. It is a comedy and leans on the raunchy side of comedy.  I mean honestly, who is rating this thing bad.  It touches on family dynamics, husband and wife issues, the \\"grass is greener\\" complex, lack of structure in life, overworking, etc. And it does it all while you are laughing out loud.  Give it a try.
B000JMLDCS|4.0|This book is intriguing to say the least. I really have a problem with the Catholic Orthodox religion, however, after reading this book I have a better understanding. My views have changed slightly for the better and I am intrigued to read more.
142311339X|4.0|When the Last Olympian ended I was content with the ending it ended nicely. Then I noticed that it said there would be a spin off series and I got a bit worried. After reading this book I was so happy with it's new characters like Piper, Leo, etc. It was an interesting book but I still prefer Grover, Annabelle, and  Percy any day. I hope they make a Sea of Monsters movie.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My microShell Folio cover fit the purpose that it was intended to fit.  It works perfectly and fits right into my bag.  The cover goes with me every where.
0385534639|4.0|Really good but it was a little slow at first but then it got more exciting. In the beginning I hated how it switched POV alot but i got used to it. Maybe I liked it because I love books about Circuses like Water For Elephants or Cirque Du Freak. Overall even though the characters weren't developed, there was too much romance, it's still a good read and I do recommend it. It's definatly worth all the publicity and hype. I do recommend checking it out before the Summit movie comes out.. I hear Erin Morgenstein is coming out with a sequel and more books.
078322947X|4.0|The Laserdisc of this movie is in its original widescreen glory. I highly recommend you find a buddy who is dumb enough (like me) to keep buying laserdiscs...<br /><br />I dreaded hearing that one of my all-time top 5 favorite films (The Wages of Fear) was remade in the seventies. But I was mistaken. Friedkin 'modernized' the concept - bringing the plot into the gritty, ugly seventies. The climax truck scene is just as good as the original and possibly even more tense.<br /><br />If you like nail-biting, almost documentary-type cinema check out this sleeper.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|Maybe this wasn't the worst movie but it certainly wasn't the worst it was far from it. Beastly is a story about some stuck up private school snot who becomes a Beast after insulting a witch. He needs to find someone who can truly love him. It's a good premise but it has been done before most notably in the amazing Disney classic movie Beauty and the Beast. It was an unnecessary remake. The acting of Vanessa Hudgens and Alex Pettyfar is very amateur.

0142410705|5.0|After reading Looking For Alaska I quickly became a nerdfighter and a big fan of John Green. John Green never disappoints and this is no exception. In An Abundance of Katherines we have a child prodigy and his Muslim friend as they go on a road trip of epic proportions. I don't want to give too much away because that would suck. This book is fun, very quick-paced and never dull. I recommend it for High School kids.
0142418471|4.0|I didn't know what this book was about at all.  So when I stumbled across a different point of view, I was a bit confused and even mildly irritated.  But I kept reading and I ended up really enjoying these two Wills along with the other characters (Tiny Cooper especially!)  The book was fun, hilarious, and moving.  The reason for one star off is because of the ending.  It was cheesy and the conclusion was a letdown.
B001TODO54|5.0|This book was so good.. Graceling takes place in the Seven Kingdoms. People who are Graced are people who have special abilities and they have two different colored eyes. These people are feared and avoided. Katsa is a graceling who is a killer until one day she refuses to do her uncle's bidding and she sets off on a journey with Po. The story is good but the ending was upsetting. Overall it's a good book and I reccomend it!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I really like the fit and feel of the case, I bought the white one so I was originally worried about it getting dirty. I'm happy to say this thing is sturdy. If it gets dirty I can wash it off with a wet wipe and its ok. the top of the cover has a soft backing where it hit the screen and is very stream line when its closed. The white case itself has a velvety feel to it which is nice as well as the outside of the cover. the cover which can be folded and used as a kickstand which is nice.  My only concern is how long the materials are going to last: the elastic band, the soft feel case itself, and the case cover. I'm a full time student and I'm hard on my cases which don't tend to hold up, for some reason. I'm really hoping this one can keep up with me and survive travels in my bag and still look decent.
0385737955|5.0|I am a big fan of the Maze Runner. It's a great read with tons of action and it has lots of cliff-hangers. It has been optioned for a movie and I hope a movie comes out soon! I recommend it for fans of the Hunger Games and Harry Potter. The whole idea of the Maze was brilliant :) Theresa and Thomas are great characters and I can't wait to read the Death Cure soon!
B005XRUPSC|3.0|I realize that Florence wrote most of Lungs in a tumultuous time of her life, but there was a certain life to that album that I feel she hasn't captured on Ceremonials. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good album. But it's just not as enjoyable to listen to, no matter how hard I try to really like it. Florence has taken the bright pop sounds and replaced them with over-the-top vocal stylings that showcase her range but make the album feel darker in a way I don't prefer.  Still worth buying and giving a good listen to.
B003QSI8MU|5.0|Lindsay Lohan used to be cute, small and hilarious in this remake of the 1970's Parent Trap. It's the story of two twins who switch places so their parents can meet each other again. This movie is so cute, funny, and the soundtrack will keep you humming for weeks. Everyone should see this great movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good time killer, never boring. ads arnt a problem . the games are all very different and don't repeat to.much
B0058VW36U|5.0|Playing Cut the Rope is always a treat. It's one of my favorite games in the world, it's simple, and addicting. It's quick, fun and it's a good time waster. It's so much better than ANGRY BIRDS.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|the app is very clean and wonderful to use.  the only thing i am sad is not featured is the ability to put lists into folders to sort them.. unless I have merely not found how to do that.. I find new things as I use it more and more :)
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Loved it. More good stuff touched by the hand of Steven Spielberg, what's not to like? Viewed very good via the Roku.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|For all of you people thinking about buying this for the digital copy and haven't heard, they are using a new system called ultraviolet.  You don't actually get a copy of anything, you have to sign up for 2 different programs(ultraviolet and flixster), it IS NOT compatible with itunes, and it will only work on your device if it has an internet connection.  If you want to put this on your ipod it won't work.  If you're travelling in the air it won't work.  If you don't have an internet connection it won't work.  Again if the digital copy is your main selling point do not buy this dvd, and boycott anything with Ultraviolet \\"digital copies\\"

0385344325|5.0|I have read most of Lee Childs Reacher series and find them exciting and fun, much like Travis McGee back in the 70's.  This guy seems to find treouble where ever he goes, the fun part is reading on how he gets out of it.
0439023491|5.0|The advetnure continues and you will not be dissapointed or able to stop reading, thats for sure. The book is still full of tiwsts and turns and suprises that you can't believe. I really enjoy the characters and can't help but be on Team Peter. I won't give anything away. Keep reading and you might as well just go get the third book cause you have to know how it ends!
0307949486|5.0|I saw the movie first(English version) and decided to read the book.  The first 30 to 40 pages are tough to get thru but after that I enjoyed the read.  Even though I new what was coming I thought the insights the book provides is well worth the effort.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is truly a creative action packed story. Suzanne does an excellent job shaping her characters, that you are utterly supirsed by their actions through out the story. Even though this book is written for young adults I still absolutley loved it, being a 26yr old.This is a book that you won't be able to put down for sure. The Hunger Games is so vivid that you cant' help but imagine yourself pulled in and watching Katniss struggle though the Hunger Games trying to survive.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver is a well written sci-fi story set in a structured community in the future, where things are a lot more controlled than today. It has some interesting premises and is worth a read.
141694737X|5.0|Especially my 4 year old, she is just enamored with this book. It's definitely one of her favorites. It's a very cute story, with good illustrations.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch arrived as described and in great shape. It was easy to set and once I had worn it for about 3 days it kept perfect time. Luminosity is far brighter than I expected and it is easy to read at night. It shows a little small on the wrist and I am on the small side. When I saw it online I thought that I would change the band but the band is actually quite nice for what it is. I may still change it to a leather one later on as some have done but after seeing the one it came with I can wait for awhile.I purchased this when it was on sale and I think it was an absolute steal at the price I paid for it.
0312641893|2.0|I am 25 and sometimes enjoy reading Young Adult fiction, particularly if it's a retelling of a fairy tale with a new twist, such as Cinder. Unfortunately, this book (although it has very promising potential) is poorly executed:  1) Dialogue is dull and characters barely get their points across before they're interrupted by very contrived means.  2) As in The Hunger Games trilogy, the author creates this sci-fi/post-apocalyptic environment but then doesn't define the parameters clearly enough to engage the reader's imagination or lend any credit to the new society.  3) The behavior of the Lunar Queen was often too outrageous to be believable and the poor dialogue did little to make her at all threatening.  4) The plot was extremely predictable; an adult reading this would figure out the \\"twist\\" as soon as the key component was revealed less than halfway through the book.  5) Prince Kai (like many of the secondary characters) is bland and an even blander love interest; not half as clever or swoon-worthy as the author tries to make us believe. His relationship with Cinder was boring; they're basically the same character, so it was like reading about Cinder falling in love with herself.  6) Cinder seemed like a pale version of Lisbeth Salander from the Stieg Larsson trilogy, but is nowhere near as convincing at being the moody punk with a handy trade. Cinder was a contradictory mess: in general, she is sarcastic, bitter, and shows a tendency for stupidity and recklessness; at inappropriate times (after significant tragedies in both their families) she is suddenly giddy and moony with Kai; she also claims to want to help cure her sister's disease but is then resistant to anything the doctor/scientist explains to her, hampering his use as a plot dump. Cinder didn't have charm and she didn't have spirit, two things that could have redeemed her for me.  I'm giving it two stars because even though I'm not in the target audience, I think that the author has done a disserviceto her that audience by giving them something that doesn't even live up to the back cover summary. What could (and should) have been a semi-complex, captivating premise falls ridiculously flat.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|I'm pregnant right now, and I heard good things about this movie, so my husband and I watched it for our date night a couple days ago.<br /><br />The movie wasn't totally what I was expecting, because there was no narration at all.  It was basically just switching through clips of four babies as they had similar and different experiences during their first year of life.  Honestly, without any commentary I sometimes found the movie to be a little slow, and kind of pointless.  Maybe they could have talked with the moms about the different things that they were doing or experiencing, or how their cultures influenced what they were doing, etc.  That would have been more interesting.<br /><br />Overall, though, it was a pleasant movie.  We laughed at several parts.  There were also many interesting contrasts among the experiences of the children, at the various stages, so it was fun to notice those things.  The American girl's experiences often seemed somewhat atypical, so it did make me wonder if the other children's experiences were typical for their cultures.  Who knows.  It doesn't really matter, I guess, because all cultures probably have quite a bit of variation in how they do things.<br /><br />So, I'm not rushing out to buy a copy of this movie to keep and re-watch forever, but we enjoyed a nice evening watching it, and it was worth seeing once.  I know babies like to watch other babies, so if you have a baby, they will probably enjoy watching it.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I thought it would be better but I guess nothings perfect. it is a good time waster. overall it was ok.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm officially addicted I cant stop playing it.I have it on my phone and my kindle. I play all day I even got my friends addicted.
0375703764|5.0|I first got ahold of this book it was over a decade ago. It gripped me then, and it still grips me today. Even in this ADD internet age when I find most of my reading time devoted to \\"whatever's new on Cracked.com\\", when I read most books once and then never again, I still find myself going back to House of Leaves over and over, at least once a year. And it's always a little different each time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and the ads do not bother me at all. the games are challenging and good to pass time.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover fits the Kindle Fire quite well. It's sturdy, light, and very protective. It also has a nice strap that keeps the cover on and held back when using the Kindle Fire. It also holds the eReader up very well for watching videos and other stuff. I would highly recommend this cover.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read this one in a week. I was attached to the world right away, the hook was instant. There was a good amount of action, but not overflowing.  A little confused romance.  Great setting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great classic game with some nice options and easy to understand. downloaded because it was free, this is my favorite time waster.....
B006VR65OQ|3.0|I was disappointed with (digital rental) poor playback on a TiVo Premiere.  There was pixelation, bad enough to wipe out half the picture at times, and you couldn't tell if the video was stumbling or that was a director effect in the beginning.  We watched with our pre-teens (PG-13) and the language was coarse and probably explains the rating.  The movie was a bit long.  It was interesting to see how statistics transformed baseball.  Or, did it?
B002ZG981E|4.0|Very well played movie, with good actors. Must pay attention to understand movie. But another good movie leonardo, and other actors.

0525478817|2.0|While reading The Fault in Our Stars, I was suddenly struck with the thought that I knew why John Green wrote this book. It's an arrogant assumption, but the more I read, the more my reasoning was confirmed.  Mr. Green wants to make sense of cancer.  On the surface, that's a lofty goal and a pretty common one. Cancer is synonymous with senseless, random suffering, and coming to grips with that is almost impossible. Presumably fueled by good intentions, Mr. Green wrote a novel about two teenagers, both stricken by cancer, in love.  Don't get me wrong. The narrator Hazel is charming and clever. Her romantic interest Augustus is funny, vivid and attractive. Their relationship is suitably quirky, conducted amidst skeleton art pieces and romantic Dutch restaurants. There's lip service paid to the joys of reading and the fallibility of authors. They speak in beautiful sentences that would look good cross-stitched on cushions (like those dreaded Encouragements that Augusus' s mom has all over the house). When tragedy comes, as it inevitably does in John Green novels, there's a build-up and a resolution, a sense that the world can Learn Something from the life and death of a young person.  All the while, every one of the characters protests that there is nothing neat or redeeming to be found in cancer, all textual evidence notwithstanding.  And this is where Mr. Green's internal conflict shines through. He wants to write an honest book about cancer, but he pulls himself back because that much honesty hurts. He can't let his protagonists be anything but flawless because it's too unjust to have a broken cancer sufferer. The protagonists' parents cry, but they don't get angry or divorced because it's cruel to admit that this is the reality many families face. Everyone can pay their hospital bills. Nobody suffers from depression or other associated mental illnesses. Giving up isn't discussed. Heck, even the Dutch occupants of Amsterdam, coming home from work or otherwise enjoying their evening, take time out of their busy day to tell Hazel and Augustus how beautiful they look as a couple.  Worst of all, when there is death, it is accompanied by Life Lessons that leave the protagonist wiser and confirm her worldview. (Which, to my mind, is the worst kind of authorial indulgence, coming from a man who previously said that pain doesn't improve the quality of joy, just as the existence of broccoli doesn't change the taste of chocolate.)  I'm sorry about my upcoming harshness, but it must be said: this book is dishonest. It manipulates the reader's emotions in the most blatant way and crafts characters who are charming but not even close to real. It uses cancer as a gimmick to sell philosophizing teens, and that angers me.  In short, my two star rating isn't provoked by poor writing or a mediocre plot; you will not find either of these things in The Fault in Our Stars. Instead, I don't think an author should be commended for using cancer as a sucker-punch to the emotional gut or a way of making a romance look poignant. It takes a brave writer to create characters who are human, flawed, and hurt and to say through his/her writing that it's okay to be shattered by a disease that is in the business of shattering people.  I'm sorry that I thought John Green was that author.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome it is really fun and addicting. if you get this game you will never be board.  it is a great game to pass time.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I love this app. I have an Ipad as well as an android tablet. This app is the best I have used. The google locator service they use for finding your computers works awesome.. no headaches, no router configuration, no firewall changes, it just works! You install the desktop software and this on your tablet (or the phone version on your phone). Sign in to a Google account on the computer and sign in to google on your device and you can be anywhere and get connected to your machine(s) (I have this configured on several). I totally love it!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This product did everything that I needed. Since the new TVs only have optical output I could not put together the system I needed. As soon as I plugged this converter in, it worked. I am very satisfied.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Celtic Woman is entertaining as always. The women vocalists are beautiful and talented. I think the new singer, Lisa Lambe, sounds great and fits right in. The orchestra, with bagpipes and all, sounds amazing. And the songs are filled with emotions. My favorite ones would be: Follow On, Nocturne, A Woman's Heart, A Spaceman Came Travelling, My Heart Was Home Again, and The Parting Glass. I'm also happy that the quality of the video is DVD standard, much better than the previously titled \\"Songs From The Heart\\" which I enjoyed as well.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love it! This cover was to easy to install and is thin so it does not add a lot of bulk to your Kindle Fire. The front becomes a stand so you can watch movies and your Kindle can stand up.  I would recommend this to anyone that has a Kindle Fire.
B0055SWM08|3.0|This is a nice little game, but I sm not clear why it is rated so highly. It is very simple in its concept and will get boring quivkly.  There are plenty of examples of better games for the same price.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|I compared the remastered set to the US versions from an earlier purchase.  A LOT of the top end was lopped off to make the &#34;remastered&#34; songs sound better on a crappy HiFi.  Plus the guys at Abbey Road really cranked up Paul's bass to give the songs more punch.  So now it is DULLER and has waaay too much bass which really screws up the ringing clean clear George Martin masters and is in particular obvious with comparison to the Americanized Capitol releases.  This is PROGRESS?  Not so much.  What a wasted effort.  Only people with cheap screechy systems will celebrate the 'Improvement.&#34;  Losers.  If you wanted  boomy muddy sound and no magic you got your wish...
B0068TL23G|5.0|Great app with lots of challenges. Has kept me happy for hours and I usually don't play games on my phone. Makes you think.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I first saw Josh Groban when he performed 'Time to say goodbye' with Sarah Brightman on her 2000 La Luna concert tour and was so excited when he came out with an album of his own.  I have seen him twice in concert and own all of his albums, but this one is total crap. Dog crap, on the bottom of my shoe crap. I am so beyond disappointed with this and I want my money back.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this game because its a good waste of time,  it is also very addicting I have nothing negative to say besides that that you shouldn't have to earn so many points
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is the winner after installing and removing a bunch of others.  great card size...fast animations...great randomization...very good game and free
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the best Bible app out there! great selection of versions, easy to use, tons of devos. love it! recommend it to everyone I know.
B0068TL23G|5.0|pros it has challenging puzzles it makes you think easily addicting  cons color is poor hard navigation no sd card storage option  its an awesome game to me but it depends what kind of games you like and how smart.you are. God luck and have fun i hope.this helped your decision
B0052U59F4|4.0|If you have been around the blogs lately, then you know about Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James.  What you don't know is how correct everyone is when they say you will be addicted to the story.  I desperately wanted to read this series after reading so many reviews on it but I never thought I would find the time to read it.  So this weekend I decided to dive into the world of Christian Grey and enjoy the ride.  Talk about an addictive book!  I was hooked after the first few chapters and could not put it down!  I had to keep reading and it became my new form of book crack in the form of Christian.  He will pull you in and keep you there with no safety net for when you fall over from the shock of his life style.<br /><br />Now, first off everyone should realize that this story came about in a weird way.  It is based on fanfiction from the Twilight series.  That being said, you understand the addiction to the book if you were addicted to the Twilight books.  I will also tell you that this series is not at all tame like the Twilight books.  This is for the adult readers and should not be read by anyone under eighteen.  While there were a few things that reminded me of the Twilight series, I personally didn't try to compare it to them and in fact found myself not even realizing this until after I read the story.  In Christians world, you will find darkness, BDSM, controlling behavior, wealth, and sexiness.  This is a man who will blow any other man you have read about out of the water.  Christian is an enigma that appears on the pages and you can't help but want to dive into his life style and read about his fifty shades of 'messed' up.<br /><br />Anastasia on the other hand, was not a character I really enjoyed.  While she did balance out with Christian considering she is the complete opposite of him, she was weak and at times whiny.  She needed to learn how to sit back for a bit and just let Christian be who he is and build up to peeling the layers back.  Ana liked to hurry things along, and in turn she came across as pushy sometimes towards Christian.  Personally this could just be because I found myself protective of Christian as I was reading the story.<br /><br />Be prepared to read about the BDSM life style as well in this book.  If you are not a fan of that, then tread carefully into reading this book.  This is a huge plot point in the story and a dark layer of Christian that needs to be remembered.  If you are willing to dive into his world though and read the story, you will be entranced by him just like Ana was.<br /><br />The ending just about did me in as well.  I cried and instantly had to buy the next book in the series.  I couldn't believe it would end like that and made me want to scream in frustration and pain.  I just can't believe Ana did what she did at the end and wanted her inner goddess to come through and slap the crap out of her! I also wish that the author would have taken the time to edit and fix the many typos that were throughout the book.  I don't usually mention this flaw in a review, but it was a pretty big flaw in the book because it happened so much. That is the main reason this book didn't get the full five star rating from me.<br /><br />Be prepared for sexual tension and satisfaction, dark secrets and personalities, and emotionally draining to the reader when reading this book.  It is one ride that will keep shocking you and keeping you up late at night to finish it.and in turn she came across as pushy sometimes towards Christian.

B006WPSQVC|5.0|Highly recommended.  I rented this movie through Amazon online streaming Movies section.  This is an inspiring story of men who are touched by God to take responsibility for their role as men.  This movie gripped my heart; made me cry and laugh quite few times while I was watching it.  This is a must-see for the entire family, specially for men who are willing to raise the standard of manhood as a father, a husband and a role model in society.  It is my prayer and hope that this movie will ignite a passion in men's hearts to stand up and be men of courage to stand up for what is right, true, noble and good.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|save the $4 I'll watch most any movie, but this one again. great cast. slow moving weak story line.  lame ending.  gave me a headache
B0042YHC38|1.0|Overall the product was nice for he first couple of time, on the third time I used it and was adjusting the strap the plastic loop snapped and broke rendering the product useless. Rather than return it and by a new one that would have the same problem I made several trips to the hardware store and was able to find and metal loop for 97 cents and was able to make it work. The product is nice other than that, now that I have made adjustemets it is a better product, I don't see how a 1/8\\" piece of plastic is meant to support the strap being pulled in order to adjust it. But I'm glad I was able to fix it myself.
B003L77GG0|5.0|The product arrived in excellent shape- shipped via USPS- a dying breed, but better than when it was shipped UPS.  I had to return the first one since it was damaged in shipping.  I haven't watched the DVDs yet but I assume they are all okay.  There's nothing else to review since it is a known entity and if you are a Smallville fan this is a must.  I would have gotten the complete set since I think there may be things in there that are not in here but I bought each season separately already.  Enjoy!  And Amazon- excellent customer service.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I feel bad for these guys who got older versions with old firmware.  Maybe possibly even old hardware inside.  Mine worked perfectly right out of the box.  I plugged it in without setup to see if it was worth using. And yep.  No lag on movement like other people.  Unplugged it. Plugged it into my PC. installed the software and configured the thing to play like Counterstrike on the PC.  And bam, went from about 30% accuracy on controller to 90% accuracy on mouse.
B005HSL626|5.0|fun for kids and adults alike. my two year old thirteen yr old and nineteen yr old all love this game.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Nothing special about this.  Standard aftermarker CPU cooler thats better than the stock cooler most companies give you.  Easy Install and brought the CPU temp down 10+ degrees celsius while gaming.
B005T87QCI|4.0|needs more robots like in the movie like Zeus or atom and needs a create your own robot thing plus needs more moves
B0063IH60K|4.0|Well put together with minimal advertising, not to mention free.  It's an enjoyable distraction that can fill in a few minutes.  Hard to find much go complain about.
0201633612|5.0|The authors had the great insight to identify patterns in software design, and everything follows from this book. It is not their fault, if now \\"patterns\\" crop up everywhere, whether it makes sense or not.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|What a great movie. Sure, the storyline is predictable, but the entertainment value is huge. The thing about this movie is that I could see the depicted robot fights, the computer technology, basically everything about it, as coming about in the normal course of our society. A wholly believable story, probably one of the easiest SF movies to watch in terms of suspending disbelief in quite some time -- and it's worth mentioning that this actually *is* science fiction in the classic sense; a little technology, all of it reasonable, around which wraps a good story. It's not a fantasy, as are many so-called SF stories today.<br /><br />So here we have really great robots, some awesome robot fighting, a not-overly annoying kid, and scenes that are (obviously intentionally) reminiscent of big-arena sports today, all combined with some feel-good stuff in the classic sense.<br /><br />It kind of looks like a kid's movie before you watch it; then when you watch it, there are adult-ish elements; at the end, I wondered who they thought they were marketing to? Perhaps that's why this didn't do all that well at the box office: the kid probably turned off the hard core SF types, the violence probably turned off legions of mommies and daddies, and the people who did go and enjoy it didn't make the case to others that it really wasn't a kid's movie or a movie that is all that violent in the living-things-getting-hurt sense of the word.<br /><br />Well, whatever the case there may be, I say, forget anything anyone says and just sit down with the desire to be entertained. I think you'll find that entertainment is delivered as desired, and in spades.<br /><br />They clearly set it up (very well) for a sequel, but it's unlikely we'll see one, again because of the box office performance. Too bad. I really, really liked it. I think you probably will too.
B0000024JN|2.0|Not one of their best albums, for completists. I would stick to the many other better releases coming up later.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|The drawing pad is something that I defenetly recommend. It is a great app for doodling, painting, and writing. So... buy it!!! It is awesome:)
0525478817|5.0|The second I got the book I was so excited to start reading. The beginning was great. He writes like he talks on his vlogs so I could just imagine everything in his voice. The middle got a little monotonous, but I wanted to find out how it would end. Then the end was amazing!    To me the most important part of a book is the ending. The last 50 pages is how I am going to remember a book and this was done very well. At the beginning I thought I had the ending all figured out, but this was much better.    My favorite part about the book is how so many different little details and story lines are done well. Reading it a second time and knowing how it ends just makes the beginning that much better to read over.  The book itself I give 4*'s, but John's awesomeness bumps it up to a 5.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|although most of the games are fun, easy and entertaining, there are a few that are very tedious! I wish you could move to next group of games like you can in the first couple sets, rather then just one at a time. Would still recommend to others especially as a tool to entertain your kids
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is one of the best apps that I have downloaded. I use my phone to control my laptop. I haven't been able to control it unless I am on the same wifi signal. Works great at home but cannot use it away from home.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I dislike many of the games on market, but I truely LOVE this one, or shall I say 100 in one. it has all of my favorites in one amazing game.
B006RUJST6|5.0|What a great read!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The character development coupled with the unique story line left me wanting more each time I had to put the book down.  I can't wait until the sequel; Colleen Hoover has a bright future and I'm  excited to discover what she has in store for her readers!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This cover does the job of protecting your kindle but man is it cheesy for the price.  I can see paying almost 40 bones for leather, but for plastic?  Also, it doesn't do a great job propping up your device so you can avoid those back problems from hunching over to read, game or what ever. I priced them at Staples and the price is about the same you pay on line.  Hey Amazon, I hope that for the price this product is at least made in the US.
B005RYF5JA|3.0|Well, to begin:  Only three Celtic Women sang on this recording, backed by an unnumbered but overwhelming chorus.  If I wanted Choir Music, I would have ordered any number of other groups and would expect a choir performance.  I loved Celtic Women when there were four, or even five Celtic Women singing without HUGE NUMBERS of backup singers.  I think they have \\"jumped the shark\\" with these production values.  Bring back the simple Irish lasses whose singing was good enough to stand by itself.
B004I744AS|4.0|the ease of finding your way through this dict. is really easy and looks nice.  I would recommend this to everyone.  :)
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Well, Quentin Tarantio liked it; so I was scared. A girl that I once thought had a brain in her head, but is in fact a HUGE Continued Until Next Thursday, said it \\"wasn't that great\\". Well, that depends upon what you thought was great. If you think \\"Gone with the Wind\\" wasn't a POS, this is NOT your movie (and I want to murder you). However, if you like GOOD directing, people who can tell a story with a camera, GOOD, and often great acting, without car chases and \\"whatever\\"; I'd have to say this is at least worth a look. I loved it but it's hard for me to think that most people wouldn't at least think it's pretty cool.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I got this for my A500 and it works great.  It has a lot of colors and shapes.  I recommend this app if you have children.  You will spend hours drawing for them. :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is awesome because it has a lot of games that you can play over and over again so its like. abounch of apps but put in one app so youcan play it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had any issues with this app. It gives easy to view hourly weather updates and has worked flawlessly.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Like many, i use an airport express to feed my 2 channel system, which uses the same cirrus 4344 chip as the d3.  I doubted seriously the possibilty of audible differences between the two, so I took to the web searching for any direct comparison of sound quality between the two, and finding none.  Curiosity, however, finally got the better of me and I purchased the D3, its incredibly low price helping to rationalize my actions.  After inserting it into my setup, i could tell first track that the AE had met its match, and havent looked back since.  To quote my wife \\"it just sounds better\\" and I agree, it does.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|If you're a sucker for feel good \\"sports\\" movies (or if you like robots, or boxing, or fathers connecting with their sons), you'll like this film.  It tugged at the shriveled, black-as-coal strings of my heart...and I liked it.  Well played, Real Steel, well played.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish. Could not put it down. For a video game and movie nerd, I haven't had more fun with a book than this one. Right up my alley.
B0068TL23G|2.0|I really enjoy the challenge of this game. But there is a huge frustration that does not involve connecting circuits. The horrible positioning of the undo button sends me to the home screen of my phone way too often. It's beyond frustrating almost to the point of not wanting to play anymore.
B005LAJ1EK|5.0|I believe I've been pretty patient, but it's frustrating to keep waiting for a release when there are many people I would like to give this wonderful documentary to, who either missed it on HBO or don't have HBO.  Can't find any indication on when it will be available.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I thought the book was great but the one thing that bugged me was the no marriage issue. It  to me made her look selfish because she chose what she wanted instead of them going through life together. why would marriage hinder her plans anyway. other than that i loved it. Sorry for the grammar problems i am doing this from my kindle.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|the app is wonderful, but please fix the orientation issue and force closes on tablets. other than that i love the app and its contents. sony tablet s 16GB 3.2.1.
1451648537|5.0|With great ideas and hard work Steve Jobs had made this world a better place to live before his departure. Amazing Book I recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this app. It is the best one that I have on my kindle. Hope you love this app as much as I do
140003180X|3.0|I like Smith's style. I find the stories soothing in their simplicity. The characters are likable but basic.<br /><br />You will not find anything different in this book than in the first few. Mr. JLB Maketoni tries to fix a pump at the orphanage. Mma Ramotswe solves a mystery while treating others with kindness and pining for the old Africa. Etc.<br /><br />I like to read these when I need something light, calming or peaceful, but if you are expecting a gripping mystery or something new in contrast to the other books in the series, don't bother. That said, I'm sure I will continue reading the series. I will just wait to continue until I've read some more serious books and need a break.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty good....I like the graphics the games are fun but I. wish it didn't take so many coins to unlock games
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|this movie was really cool to see in 3D.  i have watched this movie alot seens i got it i would tell people to get this movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This little youtube downloader works great with kindle fire.  I can use the search function and type in any video makers name and view their videos.  I tried it with my own youtube account, simply typing in my name I use to make videos.  Instantly I found my videos and downloaded a couple to my kindle, which also went off without a hitch.  Nice program works great with my fire, I'm a satisfied customer.  The videos were saved to my gallery and now I can view them whenever I feel the urge.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|RIO in 3D is sweet, cool all kind of stuff this movie is really good for family, kids, and just to sit and relix and friends really funny.
B005K15XR4|5.0|I was so excited when I heard these different songs!  I now have 2 favorite composers!  Two Steps From Hell and Hans Zimmer.  I cannot wait for more from Two Steps From Hell!  I picked up \\"Archangel\\" too and love it as well!  This is up to the top of my recommendations for anybody!
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|i have watched this movie all the time in 3D.  this kids movie is cool in 3D with the family
B000N0W9WO|5.0|The Holiday is my favorite contemporary Christmas movie...fun, romantic, and yes, has a message.  It ranks right up there with White Christmas as a Christmas Tradition. Love it. mec
0071762345|4.0|Likeable Social Media is a good introduction to social media. It's probably the book I'd give to people to get them started.  It also taught me a number of things I didn't know, like Nano-targeting Facebook ads. The book does seem to be aimed at marketing professionals in larger companies, if you're a solo act, you may be wishing for a large team at some points in the book. (Not that you don't already!)  The book contains lots of examples, of both good and bad use of social media. Some of his examples appear to be exaggerated, though. He talks about the viral video \\"United Breaks Guitars\\" costing United $180 million in market cap in July of 2009 (p69). A quick check on Yahoo Finance Historical Prices shows that United was UP for the month of July 2009, and lost considerably more value in June ($4.66 to 3.16) than any of the minor fluctuations in July.  To be fair, if you measure from close of the day the video was posted, July 7 2009, to the lowest intra-day low in July, you get an 8% drop. But it was back up by the end of the day. Not quite the example of the lasting impact of social media Dave was trying to make.  One of the important lessons on social media these days is: all of the data is online, and if you quote a statistic, someone will check it.  Despite minor flaws, I liked the book, and will be passing it on to a friend.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|\\"The Grey\\" is great! This is how the story goes: A group of oil-rig roughnecks are left stranded on the sub-arctic tundra after their plane experiences a complete mechanical failure and crashes into the remote Alaskan wilderness. The survivors, battling mortal injuries, biting cold and ravenous hunger, are relentlessly hunted and pursued by a vicious pack of rogue wolves.  The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Ottway) is great. The directing by Joe Carnahan (who also produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the short story \\"Ghost Walker\\" by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers) by Carnahan & Jeffers is great.  The music by Marc Streitenfeld is great. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi is great. The film editing by Roger Barton, Jason Hellmann & Joseph Jett Sally is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by John Willett is great. The art direction by Ross Dempster is great. The set decoration by Peter Lando is great. The costume design by Courtney Daniel is great. The special make-up, creature and animatronic effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is great.  This is a great action-thriller that keeps your mind thinking while your heart is racing and you are on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson is great as Ottway and this is another great movie for him. This is also another great movie for director Joe Carnahan. This is also a great movie to start the year off with.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun. passes the time. sometimes the games are really hard and others are pretty easy. its more for littler kids probably.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day has been a favorite artist of mine for more than fifty years.  One evening while my 5 year old granddaughter,and I were lying in her  bed watching the harvest moon as it drifted across the evening sky,  I sang Shine on Harvest moon.  She loved it and we sang it over  and over.  I told her Doris Day sang it in a movie when I was young.  She asked her dad to buy her a Doris Day CD he did and she has been  a Doris Day fan every since. she is now 11 and still listens to DD  all the time.  Thanks for making it possible to find the things we want on Amazon  even when they are hard to find anyplace else.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|We bought this cover for our 3 yr old's new Kindle Fire. It holds the Kindle nice and snug. Our little guy dropped it onto the street once already, and it got a little dirty (we bought the white one) but nothing we couldn't wipe clean. And from the fall, I did notice a slight 'peeling' on a verrry small area on the corner, but it did fall on the rough street, so take what you will. The Kindle itself didn't even seem to be phased by the fall, so for us, that makes this cover great for our little guy.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is profound in its unflinchingly honest portrayal of young people living with cancer. I was moved and my eyes were opened to an experience that is alien to me. The beauty of Green's writing is that he was able to tell the story of children and cancer without making a depressing book. It was tragic at times, but it was also sardonic, witty, romantic, and intelligent. The characters were not saints but regular people who happened to have cancer. I fell deeply in love with the two protagonists, Hazel and Gus. Sometimes I forgot how young they were because they ruminated and bantered in ways far beyond their years. In any other story, it would have been unrealistic. But, in this story, it was a logical side-effect of cancer. Face to face with mortality at an age when most consider themselves invincible, the characters would naturally think more on death and religion and life's true meaning than the average teenager. They weren't necessarily wiser, just more cognizant. I hope young people will find and read this book. It isn't the paranormal or dystopian fantasy that so many teenagers gravitate toward, but it is very real and gut-wrenching, dramatic and funny. This book will resonate with me for a very long time, and I highly recommend it. Note: The novel does contain language and sexuality that might make it inappropriate for younger teens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. It is very usefully. I like the fact that you can listen to ghr Bible in addition to reading it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book, it seems everyone is reading it and for good reason.  Very gripping, and I'm eager to see what the other two in the series have in store
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a fantastic game that shows how truly fun puzzle games can be. I didn't stop until I finished!
B004SBBDB2|4.0|This cable works well for what it is. I think most people have trouble with this cable because there are software interface issues between the iPhone and the output to the cable. I use it for Netflix and viewing slide shows of my pictures. I have not tried to view a video I have taken with my iPhone 4 but I am sure that it will work. The trick with Netflix (and this may apply to other applications) is the sequence in which you connect the cable and Netflix. Sometimes when you connect to cable the Netflix App will not output video or audio, even though it is indicating that it is doing so.... Here is what has worked for me: 1) Connect the cable (properly) to your TV, 2) Open Settings, General and then select the TV Out option (you don't have to select or change anything but make sure you are set to the proper output for your TV, either PAL or NTSC... 3) Press the HOME button on the iPhone. 4) Start Netflix 5) Select the movie you want to watch ...6) watch movie... If it doesn't work the first time then go back (leaving the Netflix App running) into Settings, General, TV out  and then hit the Home button on the iPhone and then start the NetFlix App again... Sometimes you have to EXIT the Netflix App to get it to work.... It's kind of a hassle but I think this is a SOFTWARE issue and has nothing to do with the cable itself! Hope that helps!
0439023491|5.0|After reading the description, I decided not to start reading the series  at first; they didn't sound like the type of books I would read. However, after not being able to find anything else, I decided to give it a shot, and boy was I happy I did! I ended up reading 3 three books in the series in only 10 days! This book was so good and really pulled me in, I can't wait for the 1st movie to come out in March! :-)
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Watched with my wife who normally doesn't like hero movies. She actually enjoyed the movie and we both were supervised how well the CGI looked. The plot was orignaland we both can't wait for the sequel.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|With well over a thousand reviews, perhaps this classic 1967 album by The Beatles doesn't need more comment, but I'll offer mine nonetheless. Recently I've been reading about British counterculture in the 1960s, and SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is always cited as, on one hand, a reflection of the immense social changes of the time, and influential to a whole generation who dropped out and \\"followed Sgt. Pepper\\". Thus listening to this album is a glimpse back into a different age, an era that seemed so full of promise.<br /><br />Furthermore, the album is impressive even today in its rich use of innovative technology to raise what might otherwise often be vacuous pop to a profound listening experience. Like Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, even when I'm not in the mood for pop, the production values alone are enough to make SGT. PEPPER enjoyable. To take as example one of the (unjustly!) less celebrated tracks on the album, in \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" after Lennon sings \\"And Henry the Horse dances the waltz\\" there's a swirl of electronically treated sounds that is far beyond any other popular music recording of the era. The sitar effects on \\"Within You Without You\\" resonate in every electronica track to this day. The way each track is made to flow into the next must have been quite novel at the time as well.<br /><br />Of course, for all historical value and its forward-thinking effects, the album wouldn't be quite as fun without the generally engaging songwriting, whether it's the psychedelic imagery of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", the spaced out spirituality of \\"Within You Without You\\" or even the idiosyncratic humour of \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". The surprising thing about SGT. PEPPER is that in spite of its immense cultural impact, its influence on later artists and its inventiveness, there's filler here. Of course one needs an occasional break from the futuristic sonics, and \\"Getting Better\\", \\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" fulfill that important role well. But I don't see how anyone could argue that \\"She's Leaving Home\\" or \\"Fixing a Hole\\" are comparable to the bulk of the material here. Still, the high points here are so high -- and the historical importance of this album so great -- one couldn't give SGT. PEPPER anything less than five stars.nt role well.

B0062NAVXA|2.0|Listen-I am a Christian. I have accepted Christ in my life, and in my darkest moments, I have turned to him. But this movie is crap. It's banal, boring, poorly acted, terribly written, and directed by someone who probably has never had any directorial talent in him. I'm not reviewing this message-people who do give this movie 5 stars, and they need to sit through an endless repeat of The Godfather until they know the difference between a good and bad movie. But the message is good. But this is a Sunday School sketch, not a movie. 2.5/10
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was ok. I like it. you can exit out of the ads. you should try the game. really, try it.

B0035KGWZ4|4.0|The is definitely an experimental project with odd time signatures, counterpoint and syncopation, but overall a good album. It is definitely prog-rock that leans on to the heavier side, with strong percussion and deep bass notes; the jazz, rock and heavy metal influences are spread through in integrated through the album. Not all the tracks are heavy, some have some nice funk sound. This album is a testament of the virtuosity of the musicians.

B005LLXB9K|5.0|Here's some things I learned about Pearl Jam in Cameron Crowe's Pearl Jam Twenty, despite Pearl Jam being a band I thought (just by growing up in the 90s revering alternative music) I knew everything about: That Jeff Ament identifies with the LA Clippers, that the story of \\"Alive\\" is basically true because Eddie Vedder's father did die when he was 13 without Vedder knowing him, that Vedder had a penchant for climbing scaffolding in the early 90s, that Neil Young wanted to call Kurt Cobain a week before his death to tell him to take time off, that \\"Ten\\" the album was named after the number on Mookie Blaylock's jersey (because, of course, Mookie Blaylock was Pearl Jam's first name).  Crowe does such an extraordinary job recapturing what music was like leading up to Grunge's explosion in the early 1990s that not only do you learn to re-love its innocence, you learn - as Chris Cornell tells you early on - that those involved in the scene already disliked it even before anyone paid attention. Early on you see Andy Wood, the doomed tragic almost-rock star of Mother Love Bone, the proto-Pearl Jam, confess into a camera he'd even open for Warrant (!) if he had to.  A moment like that (it not only forces you to remember who Warrant is, but why someone would dislike them) shows you the innocence of a movement it wasn't even aware it could possess.<br /><br />That's because Pearl Jam Twenty is a movie that in its singular love of a time bypasses any irony and lets you experience what seeing that music for the first time was like; in a way it's the first movie to treat music of the last 25 years with the same mythology of the rock music of the 70s. Pearl Jam, by surviving, get to present a surprisingly moving history of managing the modern rock business by, basically, doing what they felt like they were supposed to do.  You see the band's surprise at being famous and their unease about it in ways that, although sometimes speedily worked through, present what must be as accurate a portrait ever filmed of rock music in the 1990s, a time that people like me like to think of as important in music.  I could quibble with the movie's rushed we-love-the-fans recount of the band's love of switching up their playlist that help fill up the final fifteen minutes of the movie.  But scenes like that go a long way to sketching the details of what it's like to be a survivor of a genuine moment in music history.  By the end, you feel proud to have lived through it with a band who, truly, managed to always be themselves.t ever filmed of rock music in the 1990s, a time that people like me like to think of as important in music.

B0068TJLSY|2.0|In a world where there is really very little that is new or refreshing, this turkey fits right in.  If you love obviously miniaturized train crashes where a guy driving an old beat-up pickup truck can survive a head-on crash with a fast-moving freight train, and totally derail it in the process.  If you can accept that premise, silly, overused plot-concept, poor character development and CGI from 15 or 20 years ago, this is your movie.  Big mistake for me!<br /><br />Since I seem to have not learned anything from this drivel, I just rented Cowboys and Aliens.  I wonder how that review will go?  But then, I continue to watch Sons of Anarchy.  Sometimes I wonder if I stuck my head in a Mix-master as a child?

B005HSG3VK|3.0|I like the lightweight, strong cover. Terrific protection for my Fire. But I only give it three stars because it picks up pet hair like you would not believe and then doesn't want to give it up. I have a light-colored dog, and even after using a lint roller on the inside of the cover, it wouldn't come clean. If I want it really spotless, I have to use tweezers. Not my idea of fun.

B003Y3ZTGA|2.0|Teenage Dream, TGIF and ET are sweet songs which are catchy and a lot of fun. Sadly, the rest of the album is really generic, strait-forward and forgettable. I was dying to love this album, but I can't.  And one last thing.  Sorry, but firework is lame, has always been lame and will always be lame. I can't stand listening to it.  So do yourself a favor and just get the decent songs.
0439023521|1.0|I would have given this book NO STARS if I had the choice. As an adult, I definitely would not recommend this book as a choice for children. I just can't get past the \\"children killing children\\" theme throughout. I don't know what the author was thinking when she came up with this senario, but the way the plot plays out just doesn't have any redeeming qualities for me.  The characters do not build or grow in depth. They are shallow and don't seem to learn from their mistakes. There are rather abrupt changes with no explanation. The \\"heroine\\" Katniss (and I use that term lightly), spends too much time running from her issues without resolution. The scenes do not flow smoothly from one to another. One minute, they are in the heat of battle and the next our heroine is waking up in a drug induced stupor in a hospital. The explanations of what happened are weak and full of holes. That this girl is the symbol of rebellion is very hard to believe.  I feel the positive hype about the series is extremely undeserved. What type of message are we sending to our children with this book? Maybe I could deal with the lack of substance if the killing wasn't as prominent throughout and some moral issues were better defined. Then again, maybe not.  PARENTS:  Please read this book before your child so you can make an informed decision of whether or not you want your child exposed to this type of violence.

I read other reviews and realize this is not a problem only with mine so I do not have to exchange one.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|No word is powerful enough in the english language to describe this Turd.  This whole movie is the equivalent to Jim Carrey shouting \\"LIKE A GLOVE\\" in Ace Ventura 2....  All the director does here is flaccidly create similar scenarios with absolutely ZERO heart or artistic leverage.  The movie falls on it's face within the first minute.  Anyone who said this was a good movie is likely the same person who enjoys monster truck rallies and WWE Wrestling matches.  This movie was a GLORIOUS INSULT to the beauty of the original.  Also, WHY? did we need to see the 'Saints' showering naked??????  Who is your key-demographic for this film??????  Director: Please let me slap you in the face.
B003UESJHO|5.0|At face value the plot of this film seems almost clich&eacute;d - how a working class Massachusetts boxer, Micky Ward, overcame the odds to fight his way to a world title. A more novel twist arises from the fact that many of the problems that he had to overcome arose from his own family - an overbearing mother who insists on trying to manage him and a crack-addicted brother, Dick Ecklund, formerly a talented boxer with the potential to be a brilliant trainer wasted by his addition, which threatens to also ruin Ward's dreams.<br /><br />The boxing scenes are impressively done conveying both the physicality and the strategy of the fights, building towards a deeply satisfying and moving climax as Ward's triumph is paralleled by, and to an extent catalyses, Ecklund's redemption.<br /><br />The headlines and awards associated with this film went to Melissa Leo and Christian Bale - both deserved supporting actor Oscars - and Amy Adams' wonderful Academy Award nominated turn. However it is Mark Wahlberg's beautifully understated performance that is at the heart of this film. With it Wahlberg follows the footsteps of greats such as Robert Mitchum and Jeff Bridges into the \\"you'll-never-catch-me-acting\\" school of acting. It is this performance that holds the movie together and gives it its emotional resonance.

B0053F042G|5.0|A man (Jake Gylenhaal) wakens in a Chicago bound train sitting across from an attractive woman who appears to know him. She calls him \\"Sean\\" while he believes his name is \\"Colter\\". When he sees his face in the mirror it is not his own. After 8 minutes an explosion rips the train apart and Colter awakens again to find himself in a command capsule talking to a female airforce officer through a console. She tells him Sean has been killed in the explosion earlier in the day along with everyone else on the train. A programme called \\"source code\\" allows them to transport Colter into the last 8 minutes of Sean's mind. In that time Colter must identify who the bomber is to prevent an even worse atrocity occuring later in the day. So Colter must again and again return to this same eight minutes until his mission is complete.<br /><br />All films require suspension of disbelief, this one more than most, messing with your mind, quantum physics, time and the idea of self all in one short snappy movie. However suspension of disbelief is repaid with an exhilarating and surprisingly moving thriller, with great performances from the four leads, including Jeffery Wright as a man induced to casual cruelty by his belief in the overwhelming moral importance of what he does, and Michelle Monaghan, who, with this, adds to her cv another unshowy, elegant and hugely attractive performance from relatively (and in this case necessarily) limited material.<br /><br />There are many interesting and important philosophical and scientific questions raised in this film. But try not to think too much about the answers presented: behind them lie many gaping plot holes. Instead just go with the flow for one of the most entertaining and engaging thrillers in years.

1439102724|3.0|I find Jodi Picoult's books are a bit like Kohlberg's moral dilemmas - there is rarely a clear cut right and wrong and much is left to personal beliefs and interpretation with lots of difficult choices and a rollercoaster ride of emotions. As always Picoult has chosen a very current and highly contentious topic, that of both gay rights and the rights of the unborn fetus. Her description of the emotional cost of infertility, miscarriage and ongoing IVF treatment on both parents is spot on, which in the novel (as often in real life) also means the end of Zoe's and Max's marriage. Although the Christian characters in the novel may be seen by some as too stereotypical and one-sided, I have heard those views expressed in real life and they highlight the often ignorant and judgmental attitude minorities experience every day in our society.<br />This novel definitely makes the reader think and question our deepest values and beliefs, and also our prejudices. It explores and questions not only human nature itself, but also the law, societal constraints, religion and what it means to be a modern family.<br />The story really drew me in, although I sometimes got a bit annoyed with the \\"worst case scenario\\" approach and the cascade of a series of unusual events which led to the (somewhat too easy) conclusion of the novel. Picoult's writing style is, as always, compelling, as is her method of writing in the voices of three very different characters, which gives the reader a good insight into the emotional baggage of each character. Only the character of Liddy remained a bit of an enigma, and I thought that her actions at the end of the novel did not fit the person she was initially painted to be - but I won't go into it as I do not want to spoil the ending for anyone.<br />All in all, if you usually enjoy Jodi Picoult's novels, this one will not disappoint.

B005LAIGMS|3.0|I saw this one in the theater.  It was just ok.  With the star power, I would have expected a better movie -- Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas -- I thought I saw Bill Paxton, too.<br /><br />Mallory (Gina Carano) is a betrayed special ops type agent, who works the dirty jobs.  The movie begins in a snowy upstate NY, where she is hungry, cold, and on the move.  Another agent, and former boyfriend, comes to get her but she refuses to go.  Something happened in Barcelona to start all her troubles, but what was it?  Now she is said to be \\"a public threat on a killing spree\\"!  \\"They\\" are after her, but who can she trust?<br /><br />The movie takes you from New York to Barcelona to San Diego, to New Mexico, and even Dublin.  There is lots of action, running, and hand to hand fighting and lots of great kicks in her fight scenes.  Gina is the best part of the flick.
B000063UR1|3.0|When \\"Silent Running\\" was first released in the theatres, I saw it three times in one weekend. And I believe I saw it at least two or three times after that during its theatrical run. So, I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD with my second cousin, who had never seen it. But alas, some of the film's weaknesses have cought up with me, and I was not as enthralled with it as I was many years ago.<br /><br />The first big virtue of the film is Douglas Trumbull's \\"2001\\" level special effects, which stand up to today to the best that Star Wars and Avatar can mount (although they are certainly less ambitious. As far as they go, they are perfect. Far better, for example, than those in the film, Dune.)Trumbull and Kubrick had intended to do the Saturn's rings effect in 2001, but either time, money, or technology stood in the way. The second big virtue is Bruce Dern's character. He is neither over the top nor underplayed. The portrayal may not be quite as good as it seemed 40 years ago, but it holds up.<br /><br />What has become so distracting is the blatent violation of so many laws of physic, which were so scrupulously respected in 2001. In the vacuum of space, there is no sound. No matter how big the explosion is, you will simply not hear it. There is some faint possibility that some shock waves carried on the debris from the explosion may make some impression, but it would not sound like an explosion, occurring at the same time that you see the flash of light. The second annoying anomaly is the gravity on the space ships. There is no attempt whatsoever to account for this. Trumbull just changes physics to fit his direction. Kubrick scrupulously supplied a mechanism for artificial gravity on the interplanetary ship, Discovery and on the space station in earth orbit, and assumed no gravity where such measures were not in place. The third implausability is that our hero, the botanist, cannot figure out why his plants are dying within about 2 minutes of discovering the fact. I know nothing about biology, but I can recognize the cause of such symptoms in a moment (I'm trying really hard to avoid spoilers here).<br /><br />I also find the dialogue is generally pretty thin. Again, this may simply be for lack of opportunity, but I noticed that the trio of writers includes Stephen Bochco and Michael Cimino. Both have major reputations as film writers.<br /><br />A third quality of the film which has not lost its attraction is the music, including two songs sung by Joan Baez. Some people have said they were mediocre, but they fit the movie quite well. By the way my impression of this movie has declined, it leaves me with even deeper respect for movies whose charm has not fallen away, and which may have even improved with age.<br /><br />It's possible the plot was fated to not sustain our interest, since the three other human characters are not very interesting, and the robot (drone) personalities are not well developed, especially since they lack speech.about biology, but I can recognize the cause of such symptoms in a moment (I'm trying really hard to avoid spoilers here).

B0064NTZJO|1.0|I don't think I've ever been more bored watching a movie in my entire life. This movie was completely misrepresented. The trailer and posters lead you to believe it's some kind of fun fast-paced action movie similar to The Transporter. Wrong. After watching the trailers and seeing the glowing reviews from critics I was super excited to see this...If only I'd known. This movie is much more of a character study about a guy who literally responds to people 20% of the time they are talking to him...he's deep *sarcasm*. 98% of the movie he is just standing around or sitting somewhere and nothing is happening, then there is a 5 min action scene and the film goes back to being BORING. I found it hard to stay awake, and that never happens to me. I just kept hoping the torment would finally end! My friends and I left the theater wondering wtf we just saw and wishing we'd saved our money. Luckily we told everyone we knew to avoid that movie like the plague to save them the wasted time and money. Maybe we just missed something, but I'm more inclined to believe it was just a bad movie that they tried to save by positioning it as a fun action movie that turned out to be a boring artsy film not worth a tenth of the time spent watching it.
B003VQCSN2|5.0|this is the most fantastic literary ride i've been on since the ann rice series. i resisted getting onboard because i  wasn't sure if the praise was a result of marketing. but this book stands on its own. the writing is well thought out, when it gets detailed its not just filler, the research is sound and the series is entertaining, it is full of action and mayhem, but not gratuitously  graphic. after reading all i can about the author its a shame that the relatives won't give his partner the rights to continue the series. they'd be richer beyond their wildest dreams if so, however, perhaps, if they have something to hide by the release of the story then we may never know what happened to the characters introduced in the third book. this series is the antidote to the 'sex in the city' characters who became a parody of themselves by the end of the first movie. if stephen king were not so committed to the fantastically macabre, he would be my only comparision for the ability to pen a series like this. rest in peace stieg larsson. and i wish we'd gotten to know you better.

B00475AYJQ|4.0|I'm a huge fan of The Name of the Wind and I eagerly looked forward to the second in the trilogy. And, for the most part, the wait was worth it. The Wise Man's Fear has all of the lush poetic prose from the first book as well as some very interesting world-building and plot elements. The characters are the driving force in the novel. They are so richly realized as people, and the world they inhabit so believable, I often forgot I was reading fantasy.  Being the second in a trilogy, it has perhaps the most difficult task of the three: progressing the story while leaving enough material for an entire third novel to cover. In that sense, perhaps Rothfuss was a bit too hesitant in not answering any of the over-arching questions in the series. We see Kovthe grow up and we see more hints of how reduced in power and presence present-day Kote is in comparison. But none of our questions are answered; instead we are more confused as to how Kote ended up an innkeeper. The close reader may have enough material to speculate, but so far several more plot threads have been introduced, and none from the previous novel were resolved fully.  All in all, this book delivered. Hopefully Rothfuss can juggle all the balls he threw into the air in the novel and the last, and produce a satisfying ending in Day 3.

0307592731|5.0|This book risks falling into a number of cliches, a story of personal redemption while hiking a long trail (or other physical challenge). Personal transformation on the Appalachian Trail is a cottage industry, but fortunately Strayed hikes the less-traveled Pacific Crest Trail. Or, more accurately, she hikes large chunks of the PCT over about a hundred days.<br /><br />Strayed had never been backpacking before, and she didn't research this project adequately. Fortunately she had some outdoor skills and a very healthy dose of toughness.<br /><br />She started the journey on a whim, as an escape from a failed family, failed marriage, and failing personal life. Strayed had completely lost it when her mother died - - quickly losing touch with her brother and sister, stepdad, most of her friends, and getting divorced from a man she loved, who still loved her.  That only starts the list of stupid decisions, as it turns out.<br /><br />Despite the opportunities to become another \\"Lifetime\\" move, this book succeeds. It rises above other \\"I hit rock bottom\\" memoirs in the way she takes ownership of her own bad choices. She works to understand them and to move not past them but through them into a better life. Taking \\"Strayed\\" as a last name is a remarkable part of that story.<br /><br />Not all of that transformation is evident here. Strayed alternates between the PCT and memories of her past. The internal story is often in view, but not entirely in view. That's intensely personal, of course, so I am happy to give her some space, even in an intensely personal memoir.<br /><br />The book is not so successful in conveying a sense of place. It's really not about the PCT, and those times when she feels rhapsodic thoughts about the landscape she conveys only the emotions, not the scenery. Hiking alone on a less-traveled trail in a high-snow year with low traffic, Strayed also has far fewer human stories to share with us than the typical AT book would have. Still, she's a compelling writer and the book is hard to put down - - scraping its way into the five star category through toughness and perhaps despite itself.aping its way into the five star category through toughness and perhaps despite itself.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|I was wary of this film, as for me Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman were the only thing that made the prior X-men movies worth watching, so without them I was certain this would be a cheesy 'prequel'. Instead, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender prove themselves more than worthy of playing the young Professor X and Magneto, and the story provides a compelling and authentic-feeling origin for the elder versions of these characters we have already come to know. The basic psychological backstory is that Charles (Professor X) grew up privileged, and with friend Raven, while Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) grew up isolated in Nazi Poland, as the victim of brutal experiments played out by villain Shaw (Kevin Bacon). As adults they are brought together by the CIA to battle Shaw in his current form, and their friendship feels true and powerful - which makes their eventual differences and enmity feel all the more real. The special effects are solid, as are the other young stars playing newly recruited mutants. Hugh Jackman cameos, and the entire thing is a lot of fun.
0525422943|5.0|Book Basics  Title: Where She Went  Author: Gayle Forman  Expected publication: April 5th 2011 by Dutton Juvenile  Format Read: e-book ARC from Net Galley  Number of pages: 264  Book Stats  A Few of the Characters:  * Mia - A gifted cellist who escaped to Julliard to overcome a horrific tragedy, leaving her boyfriend behind.  * Adam - Mia's rock star ex-boyfriend, who cannot enjoy his fame without Mia.  What made me keep turning the page?  * Discovering what happened in the three years that passed from If I Stay  * Trying to discover why Mia left Adam  * Watching Adam's grief unfold, and seeing how Mia's tragedy was also his  * Waiting to see if Mia and Adam would live happily ever after (I kept changing my guess throughout the story)  Any complaints?  * Nope  Recommendation:  * Anyone who read If I Stay  * Young Adult/Paranormal Fans  Final Thoughts...  This sequel did not disappoint! I loved that this story was told from Adam's point of view, which gave everything we learned from If I Stay a new perspective. This book shows how a tragedy can affect so many people in many different ways. I love the author's style of writing in present time and then explaining things through the character's memories.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a great story; the relationship between the future king and his speech therapist is absolutely wonderful - the dialogue and acting make it a very memorable relationship that is both absorbing and fascinating.  This movie has it all - including drama and humor; it is a heart warming and moving story. It is a feel good story - but unlike some others, it is also a deep and moving one as opposed to cheesy.  I was blown away by Geoffrey Rush's acting; I loved every scene he was a part of! What a great character and a fabulous portrayal. Same with Colin Firth; feel like he finally took a role that showcased his true acting chops as opposed to playing yet another romantic part.  When these two actors share a scene - which most of the movie is comprised of - you will be totally engaged and enthralled. The actors captured the unique and amazing relationship between these 2 historical figures so well and you'll love seeing it.

Anna is a \\"good girl\\" who loves movies. She discovers some unexpected surprises in Paris!  · St. Claire (A.K.A. Etienne)-An dreamy French boy who is from England, but was born in America. He becomes Anna's best friend, although neither will admit they want more than friendship. Anna helps him through some tough family situations.  Meredith - a fast friend to Anna.

If you want a book that will actually make you say \\"AAWWW\\", then this is the book for you. The characters are easy to relate to and fun to read about. It was so much fun to watch Anna \\"find\\" herself and become more independent, yet at the same time realizing she can count on other people. I thoroughly enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss.

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|What Made Me Turn the Pages:  The alternating perspectives between the two main characters  Forbidden love :)  Alex's tough guy persona  Brittany's self discovery  The steaminess!  The banter between Alex and Brittany  Favorite Quotes (From Alex):  \\"You are the one girl that made me risk eveything for a future worth having.\\"  \\"We're actors in our lives, pretendin' to be who we want people to think we are.\\"  \\"Makin' mistakes ain't a crime, you know. What's the use of having a reputation if you can't ruin it every now and then?\\"  My Thoughts  This is one of those books I didn't want to be seen reading in public because of the cover. It turns out I didn't have to worry about that, as I pretty much read it in one sitting at home!  While for the most part Perfect Chemistry is predictable, it is an intense read! (This book isn't for the faint of heart as it does contain some profanity and some very steamy scenes). You quickly fall in love with Alex and Brittany, as well as the idea of them as a couple. You experience firsthand their hardships and realize problems find you no matter what side of town you're from.  I found myself just cheering for both of them as they made tough decisions that were outside of their comfort zones. They stood up for what they believed in, and put themselves first for once.  Perfect Chemistry is a fun fast read. It definitely has a Grease feel to it, but with a modern twist.

0525423281|5.0|What Made Me Turn the Pages:  Lola's vibrant personality  Getting to visit with Anna and St.Claire (From Anna and the French Kiss)  The author's quick wit, smooth writing style, and descriptive imagery  The fact that I wanted to shake Lola at times to help her see clearly and make the right decision when it came to her boyfriend Max or Cricket (A.K.A. The Boy Next Door)  The internal dialog of Lola as she worked through determining who she was and who she loved  Cricket's sweet and caring awesomeness  The descriptions of the various ensembles Lola wore, as well as Cricket's striking wardrobe  Favorite Quotes:  \\"There's something about blue eyes.  The kind of blue that startles you every time they're lifted in your direction. The kind of blue that makes you ache for them to look at you again. Not the blue green or blue gray, the blue that's just blue.  Cricket has those eyes.\\"  \\"I don't believe in fashion. I believe in costume. Life is too short to be same person every day.\\"  \\"It's easy to talk about things we hate, but sometimes it's hard to explain exactly why we like something.\\"  \\"Just because something isn't practical doesn't mean it's not worth creating. Sometimes beauty and real-life magic are enough.\\"  Final thoughts:  After Anna and the French Kiss, this book had a lot to live up to. While it was missing the magical setting of Paris, Lola and the Boy Next Door certainly didn't disappoint! This book left a huge smile on my face, and I've thought a lot about the characters since I finished the book. When a book has me thinking about it long after I have finished it, I know it is special! To me this is a \\"comfort read\\". It just makes you feel good. I am in awe of how Stephanie Perkins can make a relatively normal situation feel magical and inspiring. This, along with its companion Anna and the French Kiss, have made it to my very exclusive lists of books to reread!

0545265355|5.0|These books remind me of the Harry Potter series in terms of how unputdownable they were! Almost each chapter ended on a sentence that just makes it impossible to stop right then. You'd be like, 'one more chapter doesn't hurt'. And then you found yourself in the same situation 6, 7 chapters later.  I'm so glad I picked these up, the only regret I have is not reading it earlier! It sort of fills the gap Harry Potter left after the last movie came out and now I have something to look forward again. Honestly each book was amazing (though my favorite is the first one) and I CAN'T wait for the movie. The story was unique on its own and it was executed very, very well. I cried, I laughed, I swooned. Nothing short of amazing!

0307949508|5.0|The second installment of this series was absolutely captivating.  I can't wait to start reading the third and final book.  After that, I am going to happily hunker down and watch the movies. So, why am so excited about this book?  Here's why.  The female character is unpredictable and extremely deliberate in every aspect of her life.  I can ony describe as a woman who viciously pursues justice and has every right to do so.  I loved the twists, the connections, and how the theatre of characters were elaborately pieced together by Lisabeth's own cape crusader, the journalist that wormed his way into her heart in the first installment (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo).<br /><br />You have to read it.  Lisabeth Salander is a classic and unforgettable character.  Michael Blomkvist isn't too bad himself.  You can get lost in this novel with Lisabeth and Michael as the story of an unthinkable crime against your own develops one page at time.<br /><br />Review by Dilsa Saunders Bailey, Author of [[ASIN:B005TUOJWQ The Sperling Chronicle: Split Images (The Sperling Chronicles)]].

B000JMLFLW|5.0|this book is pretty incredible book but a bit long! Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written  This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I read this in about an hour. Classic King... taking ordinary things and ordinary people and making bad things happen. I just wish it was a little longer. All in all, a nice diversion.
0525423656|2.0|I enjoyed \\"Matched\\" and decided to give \\"Crossed\\" a try.

145162445X|2.0|If you read the preface carefully it soon become obvious that Krauss cannot deliver what he promises to do because he admits that we may never have enough empirical evidence to answer the question why there is something rather than noting.   If no one can hear you, see you ore smell you or bump into you, the whole world becomes the best of all places to hide.  Mr. Krauss is a smart man, a potential master smuggler.  He tries to smuggle the laws of physic into noting and by tricking us to believe that the part of this world called empty space is nothing.  He tells us that noting is a fussy word.  Nothing is the absence of everything.  It has a magic nature.  As soon as you chance it into something it disappears never to return.  If you want theist to take you seriously you should never ever get Richard Dawkins to write afterword to you book, but Mr.  Krauss does just that.  Why? To sell more books?
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I had no pre-conceptions when seeing this film.  I had not read any of the Stieg Larsson novels nor had I seen the earlier Swedish version of the film.  Obviously, I was aware of these versions.  However, I was perhaps wary that Hollywood was attempting to recreate something so soon after the original.<br /><br />Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\".  I found it to be dark, brooding and totally engrossing.  Time flew by.  I find that this is often one of the best indicators of a film's worth.<br /><br />The plot is probably well known to most.  I will not be repeating details nor, obviously, trying to compare it with the book or the original film.  Nonetheless, I can comment upon the cast and the broader screenplay.  In this regard, I found the lead actors to be excellent.  Rooney Mara as the rebellious and abused computer genius is a revelation.  She really does dominate the film.  Daniel Craig as the male lead, Mikael Blomkvist, is also good. This is not a James Bond role. He plays a real character with both strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />While the plot is arguably complex, it is easy for the viewer to follow. It has some wonderful twists.  All are explained without the viewer having to ask questions of others at the end of the production.<br /><br />Finally, the settings are also right on the money.  Mainly set in Sweden, the viewer is shown dark landscapes with little colour, These tie in nicely with the overall plot.  Nothing is out of place.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I picked this up a few months ago when it was the App of the Day.  I needed something to do a shopping list, and I wanted the ability to work on a spreadsheet.  On my LG Optimus S, it's very good - albeit a bit clunky to work with.  Where the app really shines is on a Tablet.  My Iconia Tab runs OfficeSuite Pro seamlessly.  The bigger keyboard is a plus, and with the ability to see more of your data is great.  Definitely worth money.

B004ECDNJU|4.0|To start, I LOVED the game. Very addictive and very fun. The graphics are decent and it's engaging for a casual play here and there.  The game is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it. The dragon shoots flames and you need to redirect them to the right orbs by tapping arrows and setting them to the right direction. In the beginning one shot shuts each one off, later it's a few per each until around 3 or 4 each. The obstacles are more complex routes, more colors and arrows that change directions automatically after a flame hits them as well as less time to complete each level. You can adjust the speed of the flames before starting any level, but the levels are timed. If you set it too slow (easier) you won't have enough time to complete the level.  There's a survival mode which let's you keep redirecting flames, but orbs don't go out. I wasn't crazy about this, felt there was really no need for it or that even was entertaining at all. It's just the same levels as regular mode going on forever. If there's more let me know because I only tried it for seconds until I was bored out of my mind.  Sound is decent for the game. Doesn't get old, but you won't be jamming to it.  The only other thing missing was more levels! I completed the game rather quickly, but I wish there was more! More challenges, more flame colors bigger and more complicated levels!  Overall, I liked it just wish it had more!
B004RQDQIQ|5.0|Miller's Crossing is a movie that made an impact on me. When I first decided to watch it a number of years ago I was not aware of who the Coen Brothers were and what outstanding movie makers they were. This movie is my favorite movie by them (and that's a tough thing to say because there are so many excellent movie to choose from). If you are a fan of Coen Brothers movies and haven't seen this one, you must watch it. If you haven't a Coen Brothers movie, watch this one, I predict that you'll want to see all their other movies.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|After seeing this movie, you'll wish you had spent your time on something else.  The characters were not adequately developed in the film.  I've seen even positive reviews complain about this, but they attribute it to the need to compress the story to fit the film's length.  I don't think that is why though because there is so much time wasted in this film. When the end comes, you really don't know or care about the characters or the story, so it doesn't really have much meaning. The actors themselves did fine under the circumstances. But they must have been horrified at the final result.  It's hard to know who to blame for this, the screenwriters, the director, or the producers.  Don't be taken in by reviews that claim this is a \\"thinking person's movie.\\"  What they mean is that it is a poorly made movie that if you really like the actors and put a lot of thought into filling in the gaps and poor editing and direction, you can forgive them for how hard this is to sit through.  Maybe the positive reviews for this were from people who already knew the story and characters from the book or a previous production.
0316098329|4.0|I read \\"Room\\" pretty much by accident. Stumbled upon the book, and decided to give it a read, without having any idea what it was about when I opened it up. I didn't even read the blurb(s). It hooked me from beginning to end, and I'm so glad that I read it 'blind', because that enabled me to really engage on a different level as I went through. I created all sorts of suspense for myself, particularly in the initial pages when I wasn't certain what exactly the whole premise was. As the whole thing unfolded, I couldn't really determine the appropriate emotions to feel -- should I be disturbed by what was going on at a fundamental level? should I be uplifted by the wondrous innocence of youth and the maternal desire to protect and nurture? should I be enthralled and curious - invested in the outcomes for the characters?  It was a few days ago that I read the book, and I still don't know. That's pretty compelling for me - and good reason to read more from Donoghue. Apparently her next work is about a cross-dressing frog-catcher. But have I made the mistake of knowing too much already?

0385344228|5.0|District Attorney Andy Barber's latest case is tragic. There has been a murder in the upscale suburban town of Newton, Massachusetts and it's the worst type of crime - the victim is a teenage boy. The already terrible situation becomes unthinkable for Andy. His own 14-year-old son Jacob is charged with the murder. Andy and his wife Laurie are terrified their son will be found guilty of a crime he didn't commit and even more scared there could be a side to their son they've never seen.  Many books are described as \\"page-turners\\", but I literally did not want to put this book down. While it's not a short book, I would have read it at one sitting if things like work and sleep didn't get in the way! This is a book in which everyday characters are put into a terrible situation and while you don't want to put yourself in Andy or Laurie's shoes, the book is written so realistically that's is all too easy to relate to them. Andy isn't a perfect character, but some of his unwise decisions show how desperate he is to protect his son. Laurie is a loving mother and good person which makes her reactions to her son's situation almost unbearable to read. The ending is shocking and yet the author did give hints several times to prepare the reader.  This is the first book I have read by William Landay, but it won't be my last. He combines the \\"ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances\\" theme of a Linwood Barclay novel, the legal mind of Scott Turrow, with a moral dilemma you would expect from Jodi Picault. All of the elements come together into a dramatic, heartbreaking suspense novel that kept me thinking about the story long after I had finished reading the book.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|If you thought \\"Viva La Vida\\" was Coldplay's big U2 move, wait till you hear \\"Mylo Xyloto.\\" \\"I turn the music up, I got my records on/From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song\\" moans Chris Martin in that awesome purely English voice of his. Brian Eno is on board to add even more cinematic flair, like instrumental brides between and before songs. Then, when you're listening to the guitar building up from below the bubbling base in \\"Charlie Brown,\\" it's impossible not to be reminded of \\"Joshua Tree\\" moments.<br /><br />However, this is Coldplay. Ambitions aside, Chris Martin still writes hooks and melodies better than most pop-rockers these days and as grand as he tries to be, songs like \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" or \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\" will lodge into your ear canals like wax. With Rhianna adding a sweetly seductive goodbye in the breakup song, \\"Princess of China,\\" and you even get Coldplay swinging towards the RnB fences. Let's not forget the uplifting bu sad single, \\"Paradise,\\" maybe the best song here. Pop cascades flow from these guys to the point that they make it sound almost too easy.<br /><br />Which may be why they have the Enoxifications (as they list them) of cinematic bridges and artiness. The electronic \\"A Hopeful Transmission\\" is the best of the three instrumentals here, and it calls Radiohead to mind before lunging into \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart.\\" Which is yet another anthem to lift you, and why Coldplay may try as hard as they want to prove their critics wrong and the haters will still deride them. Chris Martin seems to actually like writing big, melodic rock songs that give reinforcement to their listeners' lives without dramatic (and critical rave baiting) angstiness. That's why \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is ultimately enjoyable and holds up as a real good album.

B003Y5H5AG|5.0|This movie is really cute! 5 year old loves it! I used to watch Smurfs all the time as a child and I have to say I really like watching it too:) We recommend this movie!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is very fun. it brought solitaire back in my life. I think it is easy to play with the touch screen.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is great.  It's durable, sleek, and functional. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  It's not bulky or awkward.
0307474275|2.0|I still can hardly believe this book sold as much as it did.  Was it a fun read?  Yes.  Was it a great book?  No.  In the Name of the Rose (Umberto Eco) was a far superior book in the genre of religious suspense and secrets.  Everyone should go back and read that -- but maybe it was too complex for most readers of light fiction.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game it's fun and I like changing the tiles. I played this all the time on my Pc and am glad it's on my kindle fire for free. I didn't like the one on my other kindle. It was hard to play and had no color.
0061537969|4.0|A must for dog lovers.  Kind, warm, sad, spiritually nourishing.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is it was just a little too sad sometimes.  But well worth it.  The book is narrated by the dog which might seem like a silly thing to do but it works well in this instance. The dog sees the world through the metaphors of car racing, his owner's profession.  This works remarkably well also, which I say even though I detest car racing.  Through the quirks of seeing the world through a wise dog's eyes, the metaphor of racing takes on a worldliness and relevance that ended up surprising me. In fact I often felt surprise, and in a good way, at how the tale unfolded, and about how it ended.  A bit of a tearjerker, but it will also make you laugh and feel warm.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|High speed, high tension from the get go.  I don't understand all the lower ratings.  There is a lot that isn't plausible, but that's Hollywood!  I don't think anyone can go through that many wrecks without needing medical intervention, but hey - give in to that and the ride is really breathless!
1400032717|5.0|This book was totally gripping.  The author successfully creates the world inside an autistic boy's head, and draws you in, and makes you want to spend time there and yet also race to the finish to find out what happens.  Marvelous, creative fiction, and so real.  Bravo!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|idr have a opinion about this but I think it is fine and its funny because I can do anything about this
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game on the computer. now I can play it sitting on the couch. there are very few pop-ups which is very tolerable.
B006PKQQJS|2.0|I really liked sally's spa for the desktop, but this one became boring quick. the screen is too small for the kindle fire. and because of that you have a hard time with the controls. I ignored the reviews and regretted it. please save your two bucks.
B0000CABBW|5.0|As a granddaughter born to the tribal chief, Pai seems to be resented by him due to the fact she was a girl.  Her twin brother and mother died during childbirth, leaving no male to carry on as chief.  Her grandfather begins to teach other boys the ways of their ancestors.  He completely ignores the fact that Pai possess many of the traits he is currently teaching the young boys.  When his final test to determine who will be the next chief fails, her grandfather begins to feel that he too has failed. Pai is able to complete that test, but her grandfather does not know.  She chants to the whales and they listen and come to the shore.  With so many whales beached, they find one that they believe is that of their ancestor.  The whole tribe fights to get him back in the water, with no luck.  It is Pai who climbs onto him and rides him back into the ocean.  It is then that her grandfather truly realizes her potential, but it might be too late.  Pai ends up in the hospital, but thankfully she ends up okay.  This directly relates to indigenous religions because they follow many ways that their ancestors set before them.  They have chants that they perform depending on what is needed.  Their tribe is mainly male dominated and they have a hard time accepting a woman who steps out of her role.  The follow traditions to a T, and Pai's grandfather gets very upset when things are disrupted.  He believes that each ritual much be performed just as their ancestors had previously done so, or it may have very harmful consequences.  Their tribe seems to greatly worship the whales of the ocean, and they all come together when the whales are in harm.
1416575464|3.0|After hearing such rave reviews for this book, I eagerly waited for it's arrival and gobbled it up the moment I held it in my hand.  Unfortunately, I was left with much disappointment.  There are some good points for newbie decorators like myself - how to find your sense of style, how to go about decorating a room from scratch, etc - but this is within the first 20-something pages of the book and information that you'll likely find displayed on many design blogs.  I also liked that in each section, the authors give an overview of different furniture styles, pros and cons, and what they would match well with.  But other than that, you can tell that this book was written for a certain crowd and not the average household.  Most of the design examples are in lofts with tall ceilings and seemingly endless space and not in a traditional space ie: moderately sized rectangular rooms with doors and windows to consider.  There are some small-space examples but the authors seemed to forget an equally important space size - medium!  Homes are not either big or small; some are moderate and I really wished that the book had more examples of that size, along with more traditional floor plans.  The floor plans would have been extremely helpful if I had a loft, an oddly shaped room, or something that looks to be a 30x20 ft room.  Outside of the sizing issue, I think that the design elements of the book are for 20-something art decorators with small or no children and their friends.  Most of the examples seem either really cluttered or completely spartan but of course, most of the photos only show a small part of the room and you have to take the author's word that the other half of the space blends seamlessly with the small section that we see.  I do like some of the suggestions given but I feel like the examples didn't convey it properly for me - nothing wrong with Domino on that part; it's just my personal taste.  I don't know what exactly to call Domino's style since it seems tobe just random stuff thrown together [which I usually like but it didn't work for me in the examples given] but if you're into the loft, art-deco, shabby chic [to the extreme] look then this book would be perfect for you.  Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Got Full Paid version when it was the free app.  Used to work, then I upgraded my phone, and reinstalled it.  All it does now is tells me to go back to the store or to their web site to download a newer version.  When I do, it won't install.  USELESS!  Good thing I have OfficeSuite (works well in ICS) and QuickOffice (can't access SD card, but works).
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I love it. I don't make sence.So I think you will looove it.You should get it ,its wonderful. Really good
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This calendar is much better than the stock Android calendar in both its visual apects and it's abilities, as it will use events from multiple calendars and color code them (i.e. work, personal, US Holidays, etc.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game no lags,my husband daughter and I have all downloaded the game I would recommend it to anybody all ages my favorites are the sushi and bouncing ball
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a wonderful stress relieved, and it is very easy to learn. Beautiful, and has such relaxing music.
0060825456|3.0|This is a graphic novel of an alternate reality and a girl who finds herself having to rescue her parents and her neighbors from the evil that is stalking her.  Incredibly creepy, in that Coraline is all alone and must combat the fearsome menace by herself.<br /><br />Graphics are creepy and disturbing and perfect for the story.<br /><br />This book may be way too scary, suspenseful, and/or intense for some children.  Parents should pre-read.<br /><br />Maybe also try \\"The Ghosts\\" by Antonia Barber or \\"The Children of Green Knowe\\" by L. M. Boston -- neither one is as terrifying as Coraline.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I like taking pictures of the sky, and sometimes even the moon. This is a great app for timing the right nights to do it (the moon is best taken a picture of when it isn't full), and the sky when it is a new moon. It is easy to use and informative. Highly recommended for astronomers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|As everyone one says..peaceful, graceful, enjoyable, intelligent, zen, worth the money. Pictures don't do it justice make yourself happy get this app:)
B0068TL23G|5.0|This is a fun mind game where you have to connect dots of similar colors. Sound easy? Well, you can't cross any line you've created prior. Which means you have to pretty  much think things through from the beginning. Makes you feel extra proud when you complete a difficult level and it says you've done it with the shortest paths. Yay!  Worked without flaw on my EVO 3D. In my opinion, it is worth the two bucks!
B002C6A6FY|5.0|This movie has everything: suspense, romance, humor, and BOGART of course.This is one of my favorite movie, and a favorite Humphrey Bogart of course. I've seen many times, but will continue re-watching.  Arlis F. Rice
B004ECDNJU|5.0|It is fun, challenging, and keeps you on your feet. It is one of the rare games where I have to think of several things at once in order to play well. And for only a dollar? I would highly suggest this if you didn't get it while it was the free app of the day. Oh, and easy to learn, too. It took me less than a minute to figure it out.  Good luck!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun and challenging, brain teaser, can spend a long time playing this game without getting bored, a must have game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are simple but I find myself playing everyday. runs fine on the kindle fire. most rely on finger taps.
B001AOKA3W|1.0|Lowest quailty, ghetto trash, no plot film. Save your money and buy a coffee, don't even watch if someone pays you!
B006M4F67A|1.0|Ordered this for my android device and some of the puzzles are set too far to the right and can't be moved by pinching, etc., so I uninstalled.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game: easy to play, keeps your mind occupied, but still challenging. If you have the time, you could become addicted.
B000I8G5B2|1.0|This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. I felt nothing for the characters and they had even less chemistry between themselves. There are numerous gaping plot holes.  The way the story loops back around to the brother and father was completely unbelievable and irrelevant.  I am offended to have wasted the 6 bucks and however much of my life watching this movie.
B0058VW36U|5.0|fun app, good for playing for a few minutes or a few hours. Lots of levels to play. Challenging, but not too hard.
B004SDEP38|5.0|good app.. must get... was free app for the day ... works good and its like office is right in front of me on my android devices.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very enjoying. would recommend. this game to anyone that just to waste time. this is enjoyable to all ages. thank you
0307891372|5.0|I am new to playing Skyrim(Oblivion) and this walk through is A HUGE help! I use this book each time I play. My boyfriend uses it when he plays too!
B003GAB75I|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes. When the judge insults her and she's all like \\"Oh no you didn't!\\"and whacks him...  you'll get this when you watch the end:  Ship setting sail. 10 seconds later: Ship getting hit by torpedo, catching on fire, and sinking.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Loved the movie - the entertainment/action content is high.  Leaving Michael out as an active character was good for this story line, but I hope that they don't write him out all together.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good game. Didn't have any problems and most of the games were really fun :) but I didn't like having to replay games in order to be able to buy another game. it should give us more money for the games that are higher up the list, but still really good game :D
B004KD5TQI|5.0|The movie was embarrassingly bad, but the soundtrack is incredibly great!! Fantastic covers of terrific songs. Glad I could find it and buy it. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I reallly like this game. lots to do. green playing it for a week now and still enjoy it. thankd
B005K17RU0|3.0|A nice weather app, but I'm not getting weather updates as often as claimed.  Sometimes it can be hours rather than 15 minutes.  Uninstalled it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The reading plans and daily reminders help me stay on task with my daily Bible reading.  What an awesome tool.
B006NXIO0Q|5.0|Not many movies or television shows can hold my complete attention but this movie did so it gets five stars.  I was thoroughly entertained.  This movie added nothing to my knowledge bank.  I learned nothing from watching this movie.  It just never stopped, and that, in and of itself, is awesome.  i refer to it as \\"action-porn\\".  Not too much dialogue; just a lot of ass kicking.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I was really surprised.  i expected nothing out of it.  it was solid entertainment.  This is my fist movie review to write, so i do not want to risk giving away a spoiler.  Any movie that can keep my attention the entire movie, without making me laugh, has to get five stars!<br />I thought the acting was fine.  no one is winning an Oscar from this movie, but I really enjoyed all of Zoe's action scenes.<br />If  you like a lot of action without  a lot of dialogue, you will enjoy this movie.  Excellent rent, wouldn't have bought the movie though.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Loved the price of this item. It works as advertised and is a good value besides. Pleased that I purchased it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the game.  I am not good or like all the games but it has something for everyone and there are some games that I love.  best of all.it is FREE!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Buy the trilogy. You MUST push through the first half of the book which most have found challenging but after that you will NOT be able to put these three books down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! I cant get enough of it! it never gets old because there's so many games on it that u can unlock!
B0002HWO82|5.0|When I heard this rattling around in the box, I was a little concerned that it was broken. Nope, it's just that it has a lot of parts! The chair is in 2 parts; then the desk, the laptop (which folds), and the smurf himself. My husband even commented that it's pretty intricate for $6.00. He now resides on our own computer desk, & I think he's adorable and well worth the money!
B006TJXZ30|3.0|I wan t a &quot;Select All&quot; function.  There doesn't seem to be a function to select multiple emails for deletion. I get enough emails that multiple selection would be very helpfull.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Jack Reacher is in the wrong place at the wrong time and finds himself kidnapped along with a woman he's never met. Fast-paced a great to get your mind off of everything else.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read this last night on my Kindle. I don't find time to read many books but this one was recommended to me by a friend and I started it and couldn't put it down. I laughed and cried. It's a great story.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Boring game. Storyline is just blah and every new scene is just &quot;find the hidden objects.&quot; Too much clicking on objects multiple times before it registered.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Okay, so there are already more than a thousand reviews for this product. I just wanted to add that this works great as a wireless (Bluetooth) joypad for playing games on the Mac.<br /><br />I've had both an original PlayStation and a PS2, and the controllers have always been great. I wasn't crazy about the thought of buying some unfamiliar gamepad for use with some emulated games, but I was relieved to find that it works with Mac OS X Lion out of the box! I really like that it charges over USB (although you apparently need a USB host on the other side, not just a 5V power source like a wall adapter), and has an internal battery.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm sure it works great as a PS3 controller, too. :)
B0068RHSZO|5.0|The Number one tip I can you watching this movie is not to have any expectations. It's not a horror or a thriller. It's a drama. Watch it. It is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. MY whole family loved it. How's a man to survive when the lives of his family are at risk? This movie delves into how we can become slaves to our grief and loss. I would love to give more details but the less you know about the better. Give it a chance and make your own conclusion about this movie. You won't regret watching a beautiful movie as this one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great app! So much so, that it is pretty addicting. Be wary of getting lost in this classic game when you should be cleaning or working on something else... I withheld a star only because sometimes when starting a game it goes straight to an ad popup. Avoid this prob on KFire by touching the back button. Takes u right back to the game...Happy apping.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Only gave this book a chance because the movie looked like it would be interesting.  I never like to see a movie without reading the book first.  I'm SO glad I did.  WOW!
055357342X|4.0|When I began getting midway through this book I began to see what people were complaining about in the writing.  After a while it became predictable because all you had to ask yourself was \\"Does this benefit this person?\\"  If the answer is yes, then the opposite would happen and this became a common theme.  I think it did pick up again near and at the end and there is never a shortage of twists for you to find to keep you intrigued.  Overall, I think every book since A Game of Thrones has decreased in quality but I'm still going to keep reading.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|[[ASIN:B004LWZW88 Puss in Boots (Two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]  Pre-order in place. This should keep our kids busy on road trips. The movie was completely absurd and hilarious. My wife is a real cat person and we watched it in 3D. Whole family loved it tons. I would even go as far as to say the choreography was really quite entertaining.  Well produced kids movie that is really quite watchable by all ages.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is one of the better app games I have ever played it is a must but only if u can keep up
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|EL James -- it can not end here!!  The walls could have collapsed around me during the reading of these books and I would not have noticed.  In my mind... Christian Grey looks like Christian Bale and Anna Steele like Emmy Rossum (with blue eyes).  You captured the chemistry of these two characters in ways that baffle me.  It was real, it was carnal - and it was delicious to read.  I wanna see this trilogy made into movie!!! Yum!
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Have been enjoying Scotty McCreery's first CD. It is refreshing to hear his voice with a definite Josh Turner influence which is good. Nice to be able to understanding the working in his songs. We hope he has a very long and succesful career and remains humble like he seems now.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Works great on my old HTC phone but keeps freezing on tablet running Android 4.0. I really enjoy the game when it works.
1935670913|1.0|I bought this book with the hopes that it would include at least 1 or 2 words of direction in marketing your own book, NOTHING HERE! This guy should be ashamed. He does nothing more than talk about himself and how many books he's sold. Not even a nickle worth of guidance for an author. If you like this guy and just wish to hear him talk about himself then this is the book for you. If not please skip this one, in fact I would suggest you skip every other book this guy write.

1435294017|3.0|I liked this book, but I didn't love it. It was obviously well-researched. In its depiction of everyday Roman life, I felt like I was actually witnessing it. I thought Harris' use of a water systems (aqueduct) engineer (Attilius) was a unique idea that squares extremely well with the historical record. And I thought the ruthless, vengeful, over-bearing, and psychologically scarred  former slave (Ampliatus) as the bad guy was another inspired choice. I liked the way he worked Pliny into the story, although that's really a part of the historical context that I think is the book's real strength. Finally, the setting of the fascinating disaster that was Pompeii is enough by itself to warrant a huge amount of interest. The book almost reads itself - the story unfolds smoothly and the action is pretty much constant, with only a few slow spots. So why only three stars?  <<< If you haven't read it yet, and I recommend you do, don't read any further. >>>  Well, the plot, in my opinion, is really weak. For example, supposedly, as the book jacket tells us, there are \\"dark forces\\" at work threatening to \\"destroy\\" the hero, Attilius. However, all it is is that Ampliatus sends a guy after him to kill him (he sends an incompetent, who, by the way, only catches up to him under really improbable circumstances, with predictable results). The problem here is that Ampliatus doesn't really have a plausible reason to kill Attilius, at least in my opinion. Attilius doesn't know anything about the games that were being played with the water bills, and Ampliatus had no reason to suspect he did, at least until later. Also, the love interest that is supposedly the motivation to get Attilius back to Pompeii (among other things) is so little developed as to be totally unbelievable. Attilius and Corelia see each other only twice (almost literally just see each other), before they both start going all Romeo and Juliet. I mean, lust is a powerful force, but so is self-preservation. And then therewas the great mystery of the disappearance of Exomnius, the man Attilius was sent to replace. Turns out he just got too close to a live volcano. Finally, I didn't like the ending. After a tremendous amount of detail throughout the book on Roman aqueduct technology and the physical manifestation of the volcano, together with a confidence that Attilius was all but a Roman Jason Bourne, I was sure the escape that Attilius cooked up for he and Corelia would be a tour de force of escape literature! Sadly - not so. All we get is basically an epilogue about a man and a woman. Kind of a let-down.  OK, maybe I'm being a bit harsh here, and I don't really mean to be. If half-stars could be awarded, I would make it three and a half. I'm just saying that the plot could have been better constructed, and the characters could have been more realistic, but then, that's the case with most books. I still look forward to reading some of his other books. I did like the book, and as I said, the historical aspect was spot on. Actually, with a decent screenplay, I think this could make a heck of a movie.
1250006341|4.0|I was very excited when I saw this book. I cannot get enough of Downtown Abbey. First, I must give a disclaimer. I  read my book on a Kindle so the pictures were spread across 2 pages and the content sometimes didn't match the heading or photo. This book is obviously best experienced in all its hardcover, beautifully bound glory. I don't know if that affected my reading experience, but it may have.  Summary: If you are a diehard fan, you will devour every page with relish. If you are looking for a historical companion book for Downtown Abbey, you will enjoy it. I just wish there was more to it.  First: The Good.  I really enjoyed learning more about the time period and context of Downtown Abbey. I loved seeing images of the time period and learning more about the WWI, families, marriage, and other aspects of life that Downtown Abbey explores.They did a great job of talking about how the characters relate to the historical period. They have some great images from the time period that show nursing, style, and society of the time period. For example, they have some great information about nurses and the training they received as volunteers during WWI along with some images of nursing posters for the time period. My favorite was the cartoons of the pantsuits that Sybil's shocking dinner outfit was based on.  I also enjoyed all the commentary from the cast and the details about the intensity of the filming. It was a fascinating read.  Second: Why it Got 4 Stars  I felt like the book might have been thrown together quickly.  At times I felt like I was reading a research paper about the time period rather than a historical perspective on Downton Abbey. I was really surprised when the book was finished and I saw the cast list. I feel that if more time was put into this, it would have been an extraordinary volume to complement the series. As it stands, it was a great way to quench my thirst for all things Downton.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I now have a complete collection of both the Harry Potter novels AND the Harry Potter films. The books were extraordinarily well-written, for adults and children equally; and the films were constructed with the same intelligent production values as the books.<br /><br />This last chapter in the Potter series has the same first-rate production values, and the same lack of pandering to the 10-year-old mind (if that term is not in itself an oxymoron -!-), and I loved-loved-loved it. It touches all the important points of the novel in as much detail as possible given the time limits of film, and it told me the same story as the book in pictures and sound instead of written words.<br /><br />And a good time was had by all!
0307352145|4.0|Introverts have been marginalized throughout history and in society and this book provides a refreshing perspective by showing the silent power of the introvert.  The prose was readable and inviting. I normally struggle a bit with non-fiction that can get a bit dry but I found this book a fascinating, enjoyable read. It is one of those books where you turn to a friend and say, \\"Oh did you realize?\\" or \\"Have you ever thought about?\\" I think this book is an excellent catalyst to help us examine how we perceive the world and understand those around us. I like books that make me start looking at the world around me in a different way and that is exactly what this book did for me.  Quiet would be a great book for a spouse or parent of an introvert. I can see teenagers buying this for a parent who nudges \\"Why aren't you going to a party? Growing up, I was busy every weekend.\\" It would be a great book for someone who just completed the MBTI (Myers Brigg Type Indicator) and was classified as introvert as a way to really coming to understand the power of being an introvert. Career Counselors and High School Counselors should add this book to their permanent libraries.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was an okay game. some games are lame, others are okay.. none are amazing, yeah... my kids that I babysit love it, so that's good!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Was looking for a way to be able to access my desktop remotely to view files, and occasionally access some multimedia. Still haven't figured out how to get the sound to my phone when playing media...but you are supposedly able to do it. Other than that...a great app!
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is the best game ever the graphics are also terrific on my kindle fire it is totally worth the money! this game will never get old
B0068TL23G|4.0|Really enjoying the game.  Up to chapter 5 stage 11 (heart shaped puzzle).  This is the only one I have not been able to solve so far.  All others are pretty easy if you think about it for a few minutes.  Only real issue is when you interupt the game, you have to back all the way out.

0394721780|5.0|This book is what made Julia famous.  From here she got her TV show and was teaching Americans how to cook.  We haven't had the chance to do too many recipes yet, but so far so good.  Genuine French cooking, complete with all the butter and cream.  Very rich.  But oh so good.  The style of the cookbook is a bit different.  Instead of listing all the ingredients at the top of the recipe, and then listing the instructions, this book lists the ingredients in the left margin next to the steps that use those ingredients.  Takes a little getting used to, but it's not bad.  Happy with this purchase, and looking forward to more wonderful sauces.
B006W5JF9Y|1.0|I was really looking forward to this album when I first read about it, but then I listened to it!  Four CDs and I don't think there are even four good tracks total.  How is it possible that they are all so bad?  Whether it is established stars and people I have never heard of, it seems that every slow song is too fast and every fast song is too slow.  I realize that on a cover album people are allowed to try different things and I have seen this done successfully for other artists (Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Who, etc.), but in this case I believe they have failed miserably.  Please listen to all of the clips before you buy the album.
B002PYW26O|2.0|Danger Will Robinson; this film is so icky sweet at times your in danger of getting diabeties just by watching it. Fun for a walk down memory lane for fans like me who were young during the shows first run, it now is just less than mediocre scifi flick. Nostalgia and popcorn if nothing else is on and you got a cold sixpack in the fridge, nothing more.
0385512058|1.0|I'll keep this brief.  This book is written solely from the personal experience of the author.  As such, although the ideas are reasonable, they all seemed somehow shallow.  The ideas themselves are hardly revolutionary, possibly best described as \\"ideas from Dale Carnegie as applied to Keith's life\\".  As I force fed myself this book, my brain kept regurgitating the thought that this is nothing more than chest thumping from an egomaniac.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is an extremely easy way to record almost anything! I have used it for writing poems and short stories so far, and it is absolutely fantastic! It is easy to save any picture or word document (which you created with Evernote) and e-mail it to someone or edit it on different devices via different versions of Evernote! This application is extremely important for many things and has been so much more than invaluable to me.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I think this game is. vere cool and fun because you fight and the movie was the Reilly good I liked it
B0058ZPNOK|1.0|My Reasoning= NO character depth: This movie isn't inappropriate for a film whose point is what this one has, yet it is just a depiction of a want-to-be bad-a** character & one whom is hopelessly lost, and one whom any real person with integrity and real grit most likely can't stand. It has good acting just horrible plot & truly elementary character creation.  The point of the film is not to judge what looks bad... as evil, and also how help can come in the strangest ways. The plot and point of this movie probably couldn't even barely \\"pass\\" for a black comedy which is a style I would be fan of usually. For Ex: \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" or \\"Fight Club\\".  In my opinion honestly the main character made me remember every jerk who thinks hes hot stuff, but has no true integrity, respect or honor for other peoples freedom and personality.  A protagonist who is simply a wanna-be \\"tough guy\\" or a hypocrite in other words.   It fills me with a sort-of deep frustration to watch the way this films loser kid screws around with the family whose house he forces himself into.  I know why the film was made sociologically at least but i'm no fan of its content & attempts as the plot unfolds to show it's meaning. I know about \\"the other side of life\\" & have been a rebel myself but this is just a depressing torture-fest of a movie.  I could easily go to a local bar and watch people acting tough or fighting and have better entertainment. Look up the DEFINITION of character in a dictionary and you CAN fine tooth comb this movie and find VERY little.

0439023521|5.0|So, I have to start off and say that this is not a book I would have normally picked up. I recently received the kindle as a gift and was anxious to start building up my library, and this book seemed to keep popping up (and it was cheap), so I bought it. I was hooked from the start. This is simply a book that you cannot put down once you start, I would read for hours on end, not wanting to put the book down because i was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. It is engaging, exciting, and definitely full of unexpected twists and turns. The book is a very easy read, yet manages to capture the feelings, visuals, and scenery perfectly, allowing you to \\"put yourself in the book\\", and get lost. I finished the book over a course of three days and am definitely planning on purchasing the other two books to complete the trilogy.
0385534639|3.0|I read Claire Messud's review of `The Night Circus' on the Guardian website and I found myself nodding to most comments.<br /><br />Just like Messud (whose novel, `The Emperor's Children' I also reviewed a few years back), I have difficulties liking anything that smacks of `fantasy'. Contrary to Messud's, my reasons are more practical: I merely think the vast majority of those novels are plainly unreadable, a clumsy mess of awkward language and trite set-ups.<br /><br />Still, from time to time I manage to find a `fantasy' novel that somewhat catches my attention: American Gods, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel (the latter being a true masterwork, regardless of the genre), etc.<br /><br />The Night Circus isn't on par with those examples but it still represents an intriguing read and possibly, with time, Erin Morgenstern could grow into a very interesting writer.<br /><br />In a nutshell, The Night Circus is about a `challenge' of sort, pitting one magician against another and using an enchanted circus as the battlefield. The novel is set towards the end of the 19th century but don't expect much in terms of `historical details', it could take place in the 20th century as well and you wouldn't notice.<br /><br />The language isn't anything special, the characters aren't that memorable and the happy-ending makes one suspect this is aimed at `young adults' (don't worry, no vampires attached!) yet the novel has one redeeming quality, one that thankfully comes in abundance, that is, a vivid, fascinating imagery.<br /><br />Messud is right here, the book is very visual. The charm doesn't lie in the plot but rather, in the depictions of the circus itself. Each `tent' hosts a different kind of whimsical attraction and each one is rendered in a highly evocative way.<br /><br />More than a novel, this could be a collection of fantasies, a dictionary of imaginary wunderkammers and in that lies the power of the narrative, rather than in the tale itself.<br /><br />Morgenstern is very apt at creating worlds one wants to visits, if she becomes as good at populating them with stories that are equally engaging then, and only then, we might be in for some great literature.lating them with stories that are equally engaging then, and only then, we might be in for some great literature.
B0063GORYU|4.0|good range of options, and the adds for the pay version are not as intrusive as other free apps I have.
0307593495|4.0|I've loved PBS's series starting Kenneth Branagh as Kurt Wallander, so although this is the first book I've read in the series, Wallander's worldview was not a surprise.  Nevertheless, I wasn't quite prepared for how bleak this story is.  None of us can deny the inevitable slide to the grave, nor duck the complications that accompany it, but I'd just as soon not focus so exclusively on it.  Henning Mankel's writing still makes the journey worthwhile, though.  The plot is intricate, yet fits together precisely, and the writing is superlative.  Few authors make me want to read their work just to experience their writing; Mankel does.  A word to the wise, though:  If you're thinking about reading the Wallander series, this is not the book to start with.  Either watch the series or read earlier books; I don't think one could appreciate this book without having the groundwork laid.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Saw the negative reviews, yet also saw a couple positive reviews.  Despite the positive reviews being so greatly outnumbered, I figured I'd give it a chance.  Same issue: \\"Connection to update server failed.  Check your Internet connectivity and try again\\".  Well... I checked it and it's fine. The app on the other hand....  Do yourself a favor and do not download.  The overwhelmingly negative reviews are absolutely true. This app stinks right now.  There is an obvious bug or glitch preventing updating.  Re-installs didn't work, rebooting didn't work, it's just broken.  I'm going to contact Avast to advise, but I'm sure they already know.  In the meantime, I've uninstalled it and sideloaded Norton.  Norton works like a charm.  Go figure, the app that's endorsed and made available in the App Store doesn't work, yet the sideloaded app that's not in the App Store works like a charm.

B006PZBR8S|5.0|At times yes this movie lacks the best writing but it makes up for that in its emotional intensity. The fact that he talks to his son during fights instead of keeping the eye on the ball, like the first fight, in the end comes together. At times the movie may not seem logical but in the end its a very unique movie, I sort of felt the same emotions with the movie IP Man.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The Marware MicroShell Folio Cover is exactly as it was advertised and shown in the ad video. It is light weight, and if set up on a hard surface, the stand feature works well. I prefer this fitted cover to the sleeve-style fabric ones I found available at local retail stores.

B001AKTZO6|5.0|First, I became a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Then, I took a liking to the Marshall Tucker Band. And now, I found a soft spot for Creedence Clearwater Revival.<br /><br />CCR may be from the San Francisco Bay Area, but the county, folk, blues, and Southern Rock elements in their music are just timeless. They sold me with their first self-titled album. And now, with Bayou Country, I can enjoy listening to their music even more so. The songs on this album are top-notch. The opener \\"Born on the Bayou\\" is absolutely splendid. \\"Bootleg\\" is short, but it's musically exquisite. The 8-minute long \\"Graveyard Train\\" is good on a cold/warm rainy day (and I mean that in a good way). \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" is a cover one of of Little Richard's classic songs, and it's just as great as the original. The next three songs (\\"Penthouse Pauper,\\" \\"Proud Mary,\\" and \\"Keep on Chooglin\\") are typical vintage CCR. The bonus tracks for this new release, especially the live recordings of certain songs, are nice additions.<br /><br />Bayou Country is absolutely perfect. I really wish I would have discovered this sooner. But hey, I'm still young. This album is a classic, and I hope that the later albums are just as great.<br /><br />Grade: 10 out of 10

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was having trouble organizing my job search data. I needed many thing at hand at all times in all places to support phone calls. This intelligent software provides a convenient framework for organizing anything. Its easy to capture data, move it around, aggregate pieces together, and access them on all your devices.  I would gladly pay for this if I I could pay once. Their premium service is a monthly charge which I'm not likely to buy. If you wanted to organize big files, the 60MB limit of the free version may get in your way. I started to build a collection of my grandkid photos but stopped when the software warned me about space.  So my collections have limited files to preserve space, but lots of links and note files which are space-friendly.  The User interface is friendly and built for productivity. it is taylored to my PC, smartpjone and my Kindle.  I really am glad I found this app. It's helping me a lot!

B004EPZ03O|5.0|wow i am shocked by the number of negative reviews of this movie!!  obviously it is not going to \\"exactly\\" the same \\"muppets\\" from when we 30-somethings were kids, but still, it was an amazing movie.  yes, in true disney style there was obvious branding and some not-so-subliminal messages, but overall i felt the story and characters were very much in the jim henson style.  my 2 and 4 year olds absolutely adored the movie.  i cried when the opening theme from \\"the muppet show\\" started playing in the theater...how amazing it felt to watch our kids dance to and feel the same magic we did when we were younger!  bravo disney for recognizing the love our generation had for henson and the realization that we would want to share that love with our children...(even if it was only for your monetary gain).  now if you could just do something with the programming on \\"the disney channel\\"...  we own the entire fraggle collection and a number of other muppet films and my kids have enjoyed watching them, but seeing this movie on the big screen totally captivated them.  the songs were fun, and although there were more \\"human\\" characters in the film that the other muppet movies, it still felt like a \\"muppet\\" movie to me.  overall, i think it was a great movie.  no, it wasn't jim henson.  but it was muppets, and they seemed pretty authentic to me.  and it brought these unforgettable characters \\"to life\\" for my kids.  thank you disney!

0307946711|5.0|Loved this book. Such a different plot format...a look into the lives of two people on the anniversary of the day they met for twenty years. Clever writing and sometimes I laughed out loud. Of course, it made me cry, but not in an over-the-top Nicholas Sparks kind of way (like TRYING to make you sob), but in a sweet, weepy, I just love these characters and don't want to see them suffer kind of way. I'm nervous about seeing the movie, but I already picture Anne Hathaway as Emma just from previews, so I guess I will go ahead.

1400032717|5.0|One of the taglines for this book states \\"Clever and observant.\\" I'd have to agree. It was a quick and engaging story from the POV of an autistic teen. The author seems to really understand the disorder and can relate a story that is both humorous and heartfelt. It's Holden Caulfield, only on the spectrum.

B00000K3CM|5.0|This is definitely a Christmas classic. I love Home Alone (1), and I love Home Alone 2 just as much! Often times movie sequels aren't as good as the original, but that is not the case with Home Alone 2. It's just as good if not better than the first movie. I highly recommend it. Although it plays basically every year on TV, I wanted to purchase the DVD because 1) I could watch it when I want, instead of waiting for it to play on TV, 2) I could avoid watching commercials, and 3) it's edited for running time on TV and I always like to see the full movie.

0743509900|3.0|I bought this audio book for my grandfather because I thought he might like to listen to a military-themed story. He said he enjoyed it, but thought it was a bit violent. However, since it is based on a true story, that was probably unavoidable in the book.
0380789019|5.0|Take a weak man whose life is pretty much in the control of the other people in his life, then throw him through the proverbial rabbit hole and into a \\"through the looking glass\\" version of the London tube system. Put his life in constant peril where he must use what wits he has about him to form alliances among a series of intrigues, the depth of which are wholly outside his grasp. This is the story of an unlikely protagonist, Richard Mayhew, who, like Alice in the Looking Glass, has to see an unfamiliar world with new eyes to survive the constant dangers that threaten him.  In my opinion, this is one of the best books of the past two decades. The number of copies I have lost through loaning them out would support this opinion.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|This is an older movie, but I like Paul Mercurio (he's in the epic Biblical movie Joseph) so I purchased this. The storyline is cute, and I enjoyed it overall. If you like romantic comedies, and watching ballroom dancing, you'll probably enjoy this.
0060012331|5.0|This reads like a Terry Pratchett novel with fewer side plots and less complication.

B005H9B2CE|5.0|Lots of fun and this is one you can let the kids watch (maybe not the real little ones). I remember watching the Thor cartoons as a kid and reading the comic books, so its interesting to see how the characters were brought to the big screen. I also appreciated that it wasn't just one fight scene or violent occurence after the next, although there is plenty of that for your 11 year old boys (the kids visiting LOVED it and it kept them quietly entertained).

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I went with this case over the rest because I wanted something lightweight.  My brother had bought a case that was also a stand, which he then convinced me I needed as well.  His case was nice, but had a magnet closure, making it very heavy.  I want to be able to put my fire in my purse and carry it around with me.  I went with this case and it's perfect.  I like how it snaps in, instead of having a covering on the sides of the screen.  I do also like the stand feature.  (My brother was right, I do need that).  I also like the strap that keeps the case closed while it's in my purse.  Overall, I would buy this case if I were you.  The price is decent, and the case is very nice, and it doesn't add a lot of extra weight.

B004OC07GM|5.0|Biggest question is - how do you figure out something is a \\"disruptive\\" technology, not just a fringe/inefficient one. Only somewhat answered by the book - a lot of gut feel goes into that one I guess.  In a way, a tech is disruptive if after building a startup or division around it, you can find a segment of the market that's growing at a fast enough rate to fuel more innovation in this technology, until the new market starts to get big enough to rival the original market. Or if your competitors do this. There's no way to identify the technology as such except if you try your best to do this and succeed and fail.  Conclusion: as a large company, you must create tiny spin-off startup-like departments to chase down wild ideas, and they must be allowed to fail w/o major repercussions to their careers.  --Highlights from the book below--  What is disruptive technology?  \\"innovations that result in worse product performance, at least in the near-term\\"  \\"disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value\\"  Why do companies fail?  \\"Established companies that investing aggressively in disruptive technologies is not a rational financial decision for them to make\\"  The thing to watch out for is when the basis of competition shifts to a different metric: features -> performance -> stability/convenience -> price  A large company is entrenched with its biggest customers and the things that are important. It is hard as a company to go from caring about, say, deep rich feature set to having a sloppy feature-poor product that's a lot more convenient, for example.  \\"Performance oversupply is an important factor driving the transition from one phase of the cycle to the next\\"

B000OCY7JE|5.0|No one is perfect! This is reality. This is life!  This movie brings you through a couple of unexpected twists and turns, but completely realistic and completely possible in real life.

It is particularly moving when I saw how the multi-millionaire tried to bring happiness to his family, beyond his own life....  Very touching indeed!

B006OB3K56|5.0|This may be my \\"movie of the year\\". Having lived for almost half of my life in New York, a lot registered for me in this movie. It made me miss New York and be happy I am no living there......all in the same movie. I know of someone who has some of Brandon's, the lead character, qualities. It perfectly captures the thrill of being successful in New York. And sometimes the emptiness and vacancy you may feel once you establish that success if you don't have a strong support system that you can be honest with. His apartment is very much the starkness of a bachelor in New York. When confronted with the possibility of a real connection with a co-worker, possibly subordinate, his  self assured persona withers. He is unable to make that leap from anonymity to intimacy.  Carey Mulligan's role is a little more tragic, but, painfully real. Once again, she reminds Brandon about the danger of isolation despite his protest of wanting to navigate through life, solo.  It is definitely a movie I will be purchasing on Blu-Ray.  Fassbender should have also been nominated for an Oscar. There was just no performance as memorable.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I like the color of the color and all the cities on it. I wish I would have spent a little more money for a cover that latches closed. This one has opened in my purse several times.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is pretty fun. It is pretty neat that it has 119 games in one app. But you have to play games to get points so you can unlock some more games.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|Excellent book reader, but no update on Amazon. I'm having problems with a couple of ebooks imported from Calibre. On one, I can't get past a certain page. I'm sent to the 'about the author' section at the end of the book. In another, I can't move to the next page after displaying graphics. I have to jump to the next chapter and page back. Contacted developer, and he has a new version to fix the issues, but it takes Amazon a week to review and post it. Why? Otherwise this is an excellent, feature rich reader. Waiting for the bug fixes.

B006WT2TZC|3.0|I love the Scorpions, and Humanity Hour One will always be one of my favorite CDs.  The remakes of their original material are pretty good, especially the vocals.  The lyrics are much easier to understand, which makes most the songs better.  Interesting choices for the extra songs.  Some work, like Ruby Tuesday and Children of the Revolution.  The others are mediocre at best.  Their take on Tin Soldier is horrible.  This is easily one of the worst remakes of any song in history.  It starts out fine, but the main chorus, I have no idea what they were thinking.  If you want a remake of that song, look to Lou Gramm, he did it right.  Overall, I am glad I bought this CD, Ill record it to MP3, and cut out Tin Soldier.  Buy it for the a more modern vibe on their material, not for the other remakes.  And someone force the Scorps to make Hour 2 of Humanity.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Thomas Bergersen's album \\"Illusions\\" is a must for lovers of the 'trailer music' or 'epic music' style. His songs in this album are not all one uniform speed or crashing style. Illusions maintains an excellent variety of songs which range from ones that start dramatic and only grow from there (such as 'Age of Gods') while also having songs such as 'Remember Me,' which starts off far slower with light piano which only eventually grows into a swelling end.  The voices in this album focus primarily around a strong chorus and stunningly beautiful female solo singers. The exception to this is the song 'Sonera,' which features a male/female duet (which is also gorgeous).  The price--$7.99 for nineteen (NINETEEN) songs is mind-blowing, especially because most of these songs are not just 1-minute sample-style tunes but full, rich tunes.  Bottom line: this album is a masterpiece, and should be treated as such. Read other reviews and I'm sure you will find this holds true of other listeners as well.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I purchased this game for my fiance after playing it with some friends.  It is a really fun game, sort of like a combination between risk and monopoly.  It is fun for a small group for a game night or just for fun.  We haven't played it with 2 people yet because you have to modify the rules.  It is definitely an involved game, lasting about 2 hours for one play.  Like I said, it is the most fun with four people, three is also fun though.  We like this game a lot!
0525478817|4.0|I got this book the day it came out, anticipating that it would be great, and I would say, instead, that it was very good. I liked the way John handled the topic, and I loved Hazel and Agustus, and them together, but I don't think that it was all it could have been. The two things that caused me to give it 4 stars: the dialogue and Peter van Houten. For a book that was supposed to be about potentially real characters with cancer, their dialogue was not real at all. I know brilliant people myself, and not a single one of them, nor any adults, have ever constantly had conversations like Hazel Grace and Augustus. I have friends with which I talk about my perspective on philosophical questions, but I do not constantly do this brilliantly, and neither do they. /No one/ talks like this, and I like to be able to suspend my belief when reading a book. Peter van Houten was the other thing i didn't like about this book. Everything about the character seemed fake and contrived, and him showing up at the end was just not believable and more awkward.  Despite this, I would certainly recommend this book. It was touching and well-written, and I think both the most successful and ambitious of his efforts so far. Also a complete tear-jerker.
067154683X|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers. Id' also recommend [[ASIN:0300103077 Salvaged Pages: Young Writers` Diaries of the Holocaust (Yale Nota Bene)]]
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|*NOTE: this review pertains to the entire Fifty Shades Trilogy*  This is a smart and funny fantasy love story set against a backdrop of inventive, frequent, and all-around really great sex. But ultimately, this story focuses on the healing and personal growth that develops within a setting of intimacy, trust, danger, and suspense. The hero and heroine aren't perfect, but they're likeable, and they really like each other.  What a wonderful debut for E L James! I hope to read much more from this author in the future.
B004HZ76FQ|2.0|I loved it but I was really worried for my device. and the price for the full version was outragious! $3.99!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If only there could be more games like this. The puzzles are spectacular and the music is wonderful. If you keep making games like this, I'll keep buying them.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire and my Galaxy S II. It works really well and I like how I can watch movies with the sound coming out of the device.
