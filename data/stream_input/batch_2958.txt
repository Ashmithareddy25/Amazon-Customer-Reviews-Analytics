B00BEIYMTW|5.0|My two year old daughter loves to fly, and asks pilots to let her visit the cockpit when we travel (& at this point may believe this is a right, not a privilege). She likes to go watch planes land and take off at our local airport. She loved the movie and weeks later still mentions scenes to me on occasion. She was VERY excited about the pink airplane, and liked the yellow one, too...and of course loved Dusty. As for me, a pilot for over 20 years who has done aerobatics in small jets, flown for an airline and even flown in combat, I really enjoyed the full motion \\"camera shots.\\" Great job, Disney! But....we are a little disappointed there aren't more pink airplane toys and books and other marketing items. We women pilots are a growing percentage of the pilot population.
B00F5I344G|5.0|Since Gov't Mule doesn't release albums quite as frequently as some bands, the release of a new Mule record is that much more exciting. Anyone who is a fan of GM knows what they are getting when they buy a Mule album. I don't think Warren and the boys have ever set out to rewrite the book of rock, but when you are a blues-based rock band like GM, I don't think that's the point. Shout! is Gov't Mule through and through, and if you like their older stuff, you will love the new album. Whereas some of the albums have contained a song here or there that are not as good as most of the others, Shout! is an album of nothing but gems. It's everything you like about Gov't Mule's best albums all mixed together to make one great listen. I'm not much for doing song by song breakdowns, but suffice it to say fans of rock, blues, jam, country, funk, reggae, and guitar virtuosity will all find something to sink their teeth into on Shout! Just buy it, you won't regret it.
B00DGKQ5I2|5.0|Love WCAR this album is no let down they just keep getting better and awesomer lyrics... Especially love the continuation of the album art...
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|I am a Dream Theater fan from way back. My favorite albums are Images and Words and Awake. I think these two albums are my favorite, besides the fact that the songs are extremely strong and beautiful, because of Kevin Moore's more atmospheric keyboards that sound like, well, pianos. Jordan Rudess is an amazingly talented keyboardist, but the sounds he chooses most of the time, while not horrible, take away from his otherwise peerless playing. On the new album, Rudess has, for the most part, opted for a more piano-like sound that harkens back to the early days of DT. In addition to this change, the new album has shorter songs than what DT has been writing of late, and I think the compositions benefit from this relative brevity. I say \\"relative\\" because the songs are still longer than your typical 3:30 radio tune. I have found many things to love about each and every DT release, but some of my lesser favorite songs are \\"The Count of Tuscany,\\" \\"Six Degrees...\\" \\"Panic Attack,\\" and \\"A Nightmare to Remember.\\" I can't put into words what is inferior about these songs, but they just don't stack up to songs like \\"Caught in a Web,\\" \\"Innocence Faded,\\" and Pull Me Under.\\" There are no \\"Count of Tuscanys\\" or \\"Panic Attacks\\" on the new album. I'm not saying they are all 10s, but every single song is solid and enjoyable. Standout tracks are \\" The Enemy Inside\\" which is very heavy. \\"The Looking Glass\\" which wears its Rush influence on its sleeve. And \\"Behind the Veil\\" which pays brief homage to Metallica starting at 1:23 with a \\"Creeping Death\\" style section that leads into the heart of a song that would fit nicely on Awake. Overall, there is not a bad song on the album. I think it's the best album DT has put out in over a decade, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The sequel to the 1977 book \\"The Shining\\", Stephen King's sequel \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is an entertaining and fun read. It picks up many decades later with the lead character, Danny, and the continuation is so seamless it really feels like it was just last year when the previous book came out. I would advise reading the first book if you haven't in a while before tackling \\"Doctor Sleep\\" because there are numerous references that will make you enjoy the experience more.<br /><br />If you are a horror fan, Stephen King fan, or want the quintessential autumn read, pick up \\"Doctor Sleep\\"!

B00EVCD9HY|5.0|If this album doesn't get you dancing, you might be a lump. I sit in my car and dance... good times.
B008DGUT8Q|2.0|When I first heard this album was coming, I was desperate to hear it. The idea of Enrico Rava making a large-ensemble recording (as far as I know, for the first time since Carla Bley's \\"Escalator over the Hill,\\" forty-odd years ago) was irresistible. And even more, the idea of his taking on Michael Jackson's gorgeously danceable music was just...wonderful. (And on ECM! How is it possible that anyone could have talked Manfred Eicher into that?) But the record just doesn't live up to that promise. The young musicians were clearly having a lot of fun, and the audience (this is a live recording) seem to be enjoying themselves tremendously, too. But somehow, for me at least, the pleasure just doesn't doesn't come through on the record. The arrangements seem perfunctory, most of the soloists are...nothing special, and even Rava seems to have dialed backed his virtuosity, perhaps to avoid showing up the others.<br /><br />I've actually been reluctant to write this review, because I love Rava's music so much. This man is one of the most important musicians alive, and one of the most fun. I own perhaps two dozen of his recordings, and can recommend almost any of them unreservedly. But I'd hate to have anyone who's new to Rava's music start with this album, which is neither representative nor (in my opinion) very good. Better to start with almost any of his other recent ECM recordings, like \\"Easy Living\\" and \\"Tribe,\\" or (if you can find them) some of his more obscure titles, like \\"Chanson\\" with the French accordionist Richard Galliano or \\"Quatre,\\" with the amazing rhythm section of Miroslav Vitous and Daniel Humair, which is probably my personal favourite.<br /><br />I really hope no one who reads this will be put off exploring Rava's music. He's great, truly great. But this album probably isn't the place to start.
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|Disc two was not not functional.  All it had was static.  There were three episodes that were not able to be viewed.
B007ADIRDM|3.0|the set was extremely small and my daughter only played with it once or twice before the cheap plastic started to bend or break

B00F5BON8O|5.0|Sarah is yet another bright star coming out of the Boston borne music community.  A true talent on the instrument array she plays, a great wordsmith, and a very nice voice.  Currently, she is the best out there.  We hope she stays true to her skillset and does not allow her production to become something that makes her not the best version of herself.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Interesting story, felt that it was not fully developed though! The ending was main dislike, enjoyed the acting very much

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just keeps you reading, very interesting.  A great read!  You would never think that things are going to happen until you start getting into the book.
1400032717|5.0|Written in the style of a first person narrative by an autistic teenage boy, \\"The Curious Incident\\" gently and cleverly conveys how alien and overwhelming our culture must be to anyone who is an outsider. Christopher Boone is only capable of literal interpretations. He does not understand nuances of emotions or facial expressions, so the book is often funny, as he tries to understand what others mean when they communicate with him. He has rituals that help him to cope with stress, and his daily world is filled with stress, as he notices every detail of his surroundings. He lacks intuition, but his mind is highly intelligent and logical. He innocently sets out to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog, but in doing so unravels a web of mystery in his own family. Given all the obstacles of his disability, he shows tremendous courage and ingenuity to arrive at the truth. Anyone who has navigated through the crowds in the London Underground or traveled to a foreign country without knowing the language, will understand how bombarded this poor boy feels almost every moment of his adventure. He's also brilliant at math, so I learned a lot about prime numbers. I recommend this very engaging story.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Great book! Really takes you in! I have read it twice now and will read it again! A must read!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|A fantastic first season and amazing action! A brilliant heart pounding addition to tv. Plus Charlie Hunnam....need I say more??
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Got addicted to the first book and had to get the 2nd one! So convenient having it on my kindle! Definitely worth it!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love everything Demille has ever written. After watching the General's Daughter, I was intrigued and had to read his novels. Each one, a political, military, thrilling ride, I can't seem to put them down. I own all ecopies and paperbacks. These books are sure to please, with non stop action, with well developed characters and well written plots.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|Wish the story was advanced a bit more.  Felt like just more character development of characters we already met.  The world is interesting and the writing is great but just didn't feel like I got that much more of the post-BlyssPlus world story.
B00F875N98|5.0|Absolutely love this! Cannot wait until KOL tours. :) I was very excited for this album to release & my friends and I counted down to the release.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful read.  Character development is incredible.  Real life situations.  Makes you think---What would I do?  Well written.  Read way into the night.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Complete waste of money. They don't have any tools in any platform. Word looks like a simple note pad, excel is just a simple worksheet with any tools of function or even format and was so discourage by the product that didn't even get to open power point. I would not recommend to pay for this.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Great movie, everything one could want in an action adventure movie! Marvel has done an excellent job! I loved it!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|I have music from Stephen and from Kenny Wayne separately, and I think their collaboration on this album is great. I look forward to any more songs from them.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Just like the heading says , could not use a popular repair website for my automotive repair business on the kindle. The wife figured out to download this app and now everything is working good.
145210655X|4.0|Pretty good book.  My 3 year old enjoys it.  I wish there was more text, but the illustrations are well done.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Extremely interesting and well documented story about a little known part of American history.  I was surprised at how many children the orphan train program affected.  I like the way the author wove two different stories together.
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|The show is beginning to deteriorate in its moral character. It is having to many sexual intimations and the last episode was way too explicit for what is supposed to be a 'family' show. Those things are not needed to appeal to the vast majority of the audience. It might gain a few additional viewers, but it will lose far more than it will gain.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It has a lot of great features and choices. I hope the plan on making a sequel,
B00CM4VC7M|3.0|I preordered this figure from Amazon as I'm use to their site and how preorders work. It was a LOOOONG wait but definitely not Amazon's fault. All in all I'm glad I ordered from Amazon but I was shocked how they just threw my figure in a box with no protection at all. Luckily since the nearest facility is only an hour away, it wasn't damaged at all upon arrival.<br /><br />On to the figure itself. I'm in love with the idea these figures bring and I've loved all the images of others posing them and such but it's lacking in some areas. One part is that some of the pieces are harder to replace on the figure than others that seem to just fall off during posing. One other one is that my figure sadly had a paint chip on one of the boots :/ pretty sad for that 50$ I spent on what I thought was a premium made figure. The joints seem ok but could be easily broken so you must make sure to handle carefully when posing. One of the pieces for the stand was even loose inside the box and had fell out of it's plastic bag so I thought something was broken before I opened the box. I'm just glad I didn't buy a bunch of these like other collectors have. Don't think it's worth buying more than one of.
B00E193TM2|4.0|Definitely has the classic FFDP feel with great new content. However, the duplicate songs with different people seem unnecessary. Definitely worth it though! Can't wait for the release of Volume 2!

B005HEDI3K|5.0|Granted, this show looks dated to the young and sophisticated. But the interplay of Kirk, Spock, and &#34;Bones&#34; is just about the best of any show of any era. And the subtle upgrading of special effects is occasionally more than subtle (as in the planet-killer's demise in &#34;Doomsday Machine.&#34;) You really can't get better or more heartfelt sci-fi than this! For fans, this season is now part of our DNA.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I was pleasantly entertained, I am a fan of the Walking dead TV show so I was very interested to see how this movie would story line would unfold, would be campy like the old Living dead movies? No it had a pretty good story line for possibly a B type movie, some action, obviously syfy. I recommend if you like this sort of movie.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|It's hard to come up with a rating for this book because it really depends on which aspects one considers.<br /><br />Lost Symbol is a series of debates between the various principals separated by brief spurts of action.  The action is entirely forgettable: melodramatic, unbelievable, and overly drawn out.  One particular walk down some stairs had to have extended over 6 chapters: I thought they'd never get to the bottom.  If I were rating the book on action, it would be at most two stars.<br /><br />Then there were the characters. The \\"bad guy\\" was brilliantly described, but everyone else was one-dimensional and terribly similar.  On the strength of the bad guy alone, this book might justify 3 stars, with the other characters contributing little.<br /><br />On science, the book doesn't do well.  At one point the main scientist obviously fails to understand the meaning of \\"exponential increase\\".  One star.<br /><br />Where the Lost Symbol shines, however, is in the description of architecture, symbology, and art.  This is Dan Brown's brilliance, and is the stuff of a 5-star review.  Had the book removed all of the action, and had only the discussions of philosophy, art, architecture, symbols, and puzzles, I would have gotten as much out of it with fewer pages.<br /><br />As it is, though, I give it 3 stars.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Terrible! Stopped watching after 90 minutes.  Terrible tv-like story.  Expected Kirk (Pine) to start the Shatner-type line delivery at any time, can't believe they let that pass.  Sci-fi gem, my ass.  Nothing original, wasted my money.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I had to return the first pool I received because of a leak in it.... and boy was that a pain to get back into a box!!  I tried to find the leak, but nothing worked.  The 2nd pool I received lasted all summer long, even though bad weather. This pool was perfect for my 2-year old who was able to overcome his fear of the pool.  My husband and I laid in it a few times too.  Great pool for the price. I highly recommend.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This movie was great took my son to see it and bought it....already seen it 3 time since I bought it
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This fantasy series is very short and many fans wish they would produce more. But it was well begun and ended and they do not leave you hanging at the end.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|One of the best Disney cartoon movies in years. The story was sweet and original. I loved how the heroin was strong and smart therefore setting a good example for little girls. The sound track was also very good.

B002MFWLXK|5.0|This is a very controversial movie that treat one of the most relevant events in the american history from a very analytic perspective
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I played the free episodes plus everything possible to get a few more plays.  But I was hooked and had to see it through to the end.  The story line is barely surpassed by the graphics.  If you're into mystery hidden object games, this is a must-have for any collection!!!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|What a Great movie. I'm a fan of Star Trek movies and I love the way they redid the characters made it very interesting and fun to watch.  They kep to the old Star Trek lore while making it new and fresh.  Good movie!  Must buy if your Star Trek. Fan.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I enjoy this app often. It has a nice selection of items for your park. My only complaint is about the park items that cost dollars, which is to much. If you are willing to throw actual money at this you will have no problem getting these things.

B007TK77QE|5.0|I shouldn't say I was surprised as I loved the Harry Potter books (not the movies!) but you just never expect someone to make the transition from children's books to adult ones easily.  I decided to try it anyway and was pleasantly surprised.  Interesting weave, colorful characters who stay with you even after you've put down your iPad, pace and rhythm.  Am recommendign to everyone I know (who reads).
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book was sooooo good. I really hope a third comes out.  The best book I've ever read, other than the first. The only bad thing about it: the end leaves you on such a cliff hanger that you feel like you can not wait AT ALL for a third to come out.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game easy to navigate easy to play lots of fun can't wait for more give it five stars highly enjoyable

B0010SKUYM|5.0|As a previous reviewer stated, the very initial start of the book was good but starts as most things slowly at first then building momentum.  Fabulous book, the story telling is rich and the storyteller adds immeasurably to the tale.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Wonderful!!  Second time reading and I am amazed again!!  I have a feeling I will read the entire series again someday!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Let me share with you my recent LifeProof (LP) case experience and then you judge if this product is worthwhile or not:<br />I purchased from my local AT&T store this product August 13th, 2013 the same day I replaced my daughter's iPhone 4S. The case serial number is AC38208268Q. According to the packaging the case is manufactured and tested to military specifications including providing protection for up to a 2 meter drop onto any surface, without any resulting damage. WRONG!!!!!!<br />The phone fell from a height of less than 2 feet onto a tile floor. The result being the front of the phone shattered. I called LP and filed a complaint and requested they step-up for repair ($80) or replacement of the phone. I was told by the LP rep two things: First, they never have done any drop tests on their cases while the phone charger is in place, Seriously????? Second, I was told they would not warrant for any damage caused by the product's failure to provide the protection they advertise and the consumer pays for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I have tried to handle this in a professional manner by creating a formal complaint (#103103275 - \\"Escalation\\")<br />This is the response I received from LP:<br />Please refer to the photographs below from your product packaging and from the website. LifeProof is very upfront about the fact that you as the user must take care during use and regularly correctly inspect, test, and service your case and gaskets to maintain protective capabilities.The LifeProof case is not intended to be a replacement or substitute for careful use or an insurance plan or extended care plan.As shown in the photographs below, LifeProof also is very clear in stating that you must accept responsibility for the inherent risks of using your device in rugged environmental situations, and under no circumstances does LifeProof accept responsibility for any accidents that may result in damage to your electronic devices or any other personal property apart from your case itself, which we do warranty. This is standard industry practice. No other case manufacturers provide a device repair or replacement guarantee. There is simply too much in the care, use, and maintenance of a case that is completely out of LifeProof's control once our products are in the customer's care. Unfortunately we are also at risk of some users that abuse the case, or damage their phone outside the case and try to claim it on LifeProof.On our website product page, on the package exterior at the opening point, in the packaging insert (which has to be removed in two places from the case by the user during installation) and in the user manual, our warranty statement is very clear about what is and is not covered.We are most willing to inspect your case and replace your case if it is under warranty, at no cost. We suggest that you contact your local repairer if your device needs repair.

B003THHIEM|5.0|I really love Rick Castle. He is a fun character to watch and I like his interactions with Detective Beckett. The addition of his mature side (in relation to his daughter) is also nice so we have the fun immature side and the home side. He is a much more believable character that way. I also love the two male detectives that work with them sometimes. Humorous pair. I would like to see more of them with Castle in an 'after work boys night' capacity.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a superb book for the skeptical on your way to God. The DIY style of the book really helps to understand the workings of the universe and how we play an active role in shaping our lives. Really a very good book.

Maybe if I was a pirate or a scalliwag I might take a liking to it, but haven't applied for those jobs yet.  I could'nt tell if this was an attempt at something greater or just a bottle of rum speaking, but to go on for 2, yes 2 discs using a sea captain voice against some sea chantys is not for everyone or is that anyone?

B0054LJGWS|5.0|I was referred to this book when asking a group on Reddit for a book as funny as Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. What I got was so much more. Not only is it funny, but also thought-provoking and chock full of awesome Christian mythology, which I happen to love.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Great album heavier then their last. Love the Rush  influence and obvious Limelight tribute.  James Myung great bass lines and love Lebrie's griity vocals.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Here's something with creativity, humor and very clever writing, but doesn't have the &#34;shock&#34; factor usually required for multiple stars.  This is something the whole family can watch, yet adults can feel entertained and can catch all the &#34;adults only&#34; jokes.  And whatever happened to Colin Ferguson?  He's amazing - great timing and an amazing range.
B003XYERRM|5.0|I have loved this book ever since I first read it many, many years ago; it's a 'read-again' book! Penman does thorough research and accurately reflects the facts in her novels.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The playing between the two main charters and not knowing if the was behind the hole thing.

B00140PK6O|5.0|I'm a BBC period film junkie.  This is one of my favorites.  I have watched it again and again and never tire.
B00902MCVY|5.0|I found this album while being pretty disillusioned with music in general. I'd check out bands that people were going nuts about to find I thought they were alright at best. Most things I was checking out sounded formulaic and dispassionate- or maybe I'm just getting more jaded. Either way, I was looking for something different and this is definitely it.<br />I do think though that if you go into this album with expectations about what it should or shouldn't be, you might not like it. I'd recommend sitting back and letting it be its own thing.<br />Being an artist myself, I want to give major praise to the cover artist here because that's what drew me in in the first place. Simply put, it's beautiful. And once you listen to the album, it compliments the music perfectly and I love the effort that went into that. Seriously, awesome job.<br />Anyway, I can't slap a label on this album and I love that. It's emotional without being sappy or cliche, and beautiful while remaining powerful. It's mellow and aggressive, forlorn and hopeful. Musically, it's got this balance between \\"masculine and feminine\\", in a sense, going on. The singer sometimes uses more aggressive vocals and sometimes is just singing- the man has got an amazing voice.<br />Other people describe the individual songs better than I would, but Sons of Winter and Stars was the first I heard off the album. That song alone is an epic musical journey in and of itself. I fell in love with the entire album, but I personally tend to end up listening to Land of Snow and Sorrow the most. There's just something about it that captivates me. Especially around the midway point of the song with the lyrics<br />\\"The white snow is falling from the starlit sky<br />And the stars are shining like your eyes<br />You are so beautiful<br />And I will follow them in this cold winter night<br />So I'd find my way to you this time\\"<br />Land of Snow and Sorrow...indeed, I can practically see and feel the snow (and the sorrow) whilelistening to this. On that note, I recommend wearing headphones and closing your eyes while listening to this album sometime, especially the instrumentals. When I listen to these songs, I feel like I'm being sent on a trip straight into this guy's soul- the passion in this is very powerful. It's one of those rare albums that I find is more of a work of art than \\"cool songs\\", and I will most definitely buy part 2 when it comes out.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I'm plodding my way to the 75% mark on this one. Overall my beef with it is just that there's so much happening but so much of it is so trivial to the story. Oh, a new room in the circus? Sounds dandy, what does it have to do with what's happening? I feel like the story is taking too long to get to anything important. Who is Mr A. H---? Why are there dashes in his name -- alone out of the cast? Yes, surely he's up to something nefarious, but there needs to be more meat here instead of all the meringue. All in all I have a hard time caring about the characters and their star-crossed love.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is the common \\"fill in the grid from number clues\\" puzzle, but with a variation. Instead of just filling in the grid with either Yes or No, you have different colors to fill in, which are defined from the side. For the most part, that makes this it a bit easier to solve. However, it does add an element of additional interest that offsets the lesser challenge.<br /><br />The overall look of the game has a nice antiqued style that I found appealing.<br /><br />I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 without any technical issues.<br /><br />If you like this general type of puzzle game, then I highly recommend you give this one a try, especially as the FAotD.

B00C7607FS|4.0|Disney gives what is most likely one of its most beloved modern classics the Blu-ray and 3D treatment finally. After years of being locked in the \\"Vault,\\" \\"The Little Mermaid\\" swims forth and receives the high-definition treatment it's earned for a Diamond Edition release. I know MY house is exploding with excitement. It's become almost a monthly ritual to pull out the old DVD version and watch it ever since my kids starred in a local stage play based on the movie.<br /><br />Mermaid Princess Ariel wants to live up above the ocean floor in the world of humans.

When things go array in both her beloved worlds, Ariel must enlist the help of her fish friend Flounder and crab Sebastian to set things right.<br /><br />What can be said about \\"The Little Mermaid\\" that already hasn't been? I think its award nominations and wins speak for themselves. Boys and girls of all ages adore this treasure. As stated above, it's even found life as a stage play performed around the world by children's and adult theaters.<br /><br />Disney spares no expense giving fans the best high-definition transfer it can for \\"The Little Mermaid\\" Diamond Edition. The video is pristine and the colors are vibrant. The 7.1 surround sound gives the film's musical numbers and environmental noises an extra boost that literally puts you in the middle of all the action.<br /><br />There's over three hours of bonus material for \\"The Little Mermaid\\" Diamond Edition.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I get lost in every single one of these books. I start and can't stop til it's finished! Can't wait for the next one.
0062255657|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book after reading some of the reviews casting it as a \\"fantasy,\\" or even \\"young adult\\" novel.  If read as some sort of fairy tale, I suppose I would agree.  Instead, however, Gaiman presents traumatic events from a key time in a seven year old boy's life.  There is an adult, matter of fact presentation to consider, and a more seemingly mystical interpretation of these past events from the perspective of a young boy.  Through this dual lens, the story is masterfully crafted, and a must read.

B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I am enjoying the book.  I can't wait to get back to it.  It has history, romance and life. I recommend it to anybody who likes to follow life.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Everyone needs to get this movie and enjoy one of the best, fun, happy movies every created. I love all the singing and dancing.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Enthralling and terrifying, like the other two in the trilogy. It's been some time since I finished the others, so I'm not sure about this comment, but my impression is that this third is more explicitly polemical than the others. In the middle of narrative you'll have statements telling you that corporations only fund research that may have a profitable commercial application. Yes, of course, that is a feature both of Atwood's dystopia and of our own world. But saying it so baldly is an example of telling rather than showing, and reminds me in the faintest way (for I adore these books, and Atwood as a writer and ethical thinker) of Ayn Rand's polemical exposition in her novels.
B008N1LL42|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  It had adventure, action, excitement, suspense, and magnificent graphics!  However, what I really liked about it was that it utilized retired soldiers, as well as handicapped soldiers.  I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this movie!
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Great movie night flick, everyone really enjoyed it. I love the cross bow angle and the little twists to the original story

B0083Z614S|5.0|Nice and entertaining literature which was a pleasure reading with my kindle. I look forward to reading more books from this author.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|I always have enjoyed Alan Jackson and really enjoyed this album for it entirety being bluegrass. Easy listening and great music always come Alan Jackson.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|My four yr old could not comprehend this game! I would not buy this again unless it was for older children.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app that offers great access to all times of music and talk radio.  Recommend for all radio heads.
B00DQHZZ0O|5.0|Fits the RX100 II perfectly and installation was an easy task. Just line up the camera with the guide, remove the adhesive strip protector and attach.  The actual part where the filter resides is removable...  kind of similar to how you'd remove a lens cap on a traditional SLR lens.  Very intuitive and useful.  I'm using mine with a B+W slim UV filter which works nicely.  I also got a 49mm pinch cap from EZ-Foto to attach so that the lens and everything else are always protected.  It does make the whole camera a bit wider with everything attached but it's not too much of a concern for me since I don't put my cameras in my pocket too much and if I did I can just remove the filter.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|I had read the book and was a little disappointed in how the book was followed. I decided to just like the movie for the movie then I enjoyed it a lot more.
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|Love this book - it draws you in and transports you to Hokitika. You can see, hear and smell the characters and the places and the novel presentation of the book is fantastic.
0345534379|4.0|Great book for leaving around on a coffee table for folks that want to entertain themselves for just a few minutes at a time... I guess it would also be good as a bathroom reader for the same reason.

B004JHYRAE|4.0|This book is really good. It is really hard to accept a lot of what it says because most of us was raised with religious dogma that tells us its not right and this is what we should do.<br /><br />this book in no way suggest that you cannot be monogamous, but rather tells yourself to well ask yourself if this truly what you want.<br /><br />Its a truthful book that is probably hated because well nobody likes the truth and our insecurities will get the best of us.
B000AJIF4E|2.0|I read tons of awesome reviews and a few really bad on this... and actually listened to a friend's set and was really impressed.  I always have had great success and only  a rare failure with Amazon.  THIS is one of those failures that is probably not the fault of Amazon but the supplier to the seller.<br /><br />The low end is nonexistent... the mids and highs are muted and very unbalanced.  When even slightly adjusting the EQ the sould distorts at ALL volume levels.  I called Sony and they told me they have had reports of fake MDR7506 sets coming from Amazon sellers.  Do not fall for a &#34;break-in&#34; periond... SONY says they shoudl be perfect out of the box.<br /><br />I am returning these and will order direct from Sony for slighly more money and tax.  Not worth taking the chance here.<br /><br />I would have given one star but Amazon gets credit for fast delivery.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|There is not a single song on this album I dislike. This album is more upbeat and fun than Born and Raised. It also has the interesting aspect of having several different styles all mixed into one album. Worth a listen even if you are not a hardcore Mayer fan.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love this show, never heard of it before, but I love the characters and the movie just doesn't answer the questions.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|Eh, the book was okay. It did not live up to the hype surrounding it though. Park's mom was my favorite part of the book. She always had me laughing.
B00ESB75FA|4.0|some parts of the show get a bit choppy . Not sure if it's due to a weak internet connection.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|I loved this book. It had me chuckling almost non stop. Although, I read it on my Kindle, so I couldn't do any of the activities.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Totally entertaining, a book you can not put down.Grisham weaves such an intricate plot, even the best CSI does not see what is coming.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really love this show. However the ending was a little much. Spoiler alert! There is no reason to make another person die off. Yes, it helps the show to be more dramatic, but that doesn't mean that no one in the family can have a happy life. One pregnancy with a death was enough, speaking of Sybel. Should've left Mary and Matthew alone, there was enough drama already with them. But I'm still looking forward to next season.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is fun so far. After awhile we will see if it makes me spend money in order to advance.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Suspense from the start.  Interesting plot.  Sufficient character development.  Definitely not the &#34;slow walking dumb zombie&#34; approach.  Very fun to see.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Sounds, colors, the way it feels....great job! I need to type in more words to get this up so here you go..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is awsome because you have rolling missals being thrown at you and blueish purple minions.And lots of other stuff thats really fun.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I thought the book would get better but it never really picked up. The ending wasn't at all what I thought it would be...
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I have to say that I think the final episode of this season is the single best episode that has ever been on TV.  It is the reason that this show is still so great through the current seasons, and yet I can't help but it got to where it was through a cheat in the story telling.  The entire show has pretty much been flawless and without major gaps in logic or plot holes.  It is just one great twist after another.  What I can say is that is with the exception of this season.  I will say, without giving anything away, that the resolution from last season completely leaves me scratching my head.  Despite the fact that both Walter and Jesse should be in hot water for what they have done, Gus, for some reason, only holds it over Walt's head.  He then goes towards Jesse, to promote him in an attempt to separate Jesse and Walt, when that makes absolutely no sense, considering that he spent all of Season three trying to convince to let Jesse go at best, and kill him at worst, and now because Walt made a mistake and backed his friend, Gus is going to show him the error of his ways by doing the exact same thing.  This is not to say that there are not a lot of great twists and turns, or that Jesse wasn't needed in Gus's corner for the purpose of the finale, but I really found the explanations at the beginning of this season hard to swallow.  Like the reason they didn't trust Walt was because of his personality, which would make sense if they had a crystal ball, but really doesn't make sense considering that to this point, his reasoning to deal with Gus mostly had to do with his need to settle down and stop taking risks.  Like I said, still a great season and a great build up, but what I can say is that for the only time on the show, the writers do cheat a little bit to serve their story, but knowing where it goes from there, I'm rather glad they did.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Awesome Movie, i loved this movie alot. it was really cool. it had alot of cool special effects... i am done here
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I have to say that I'm really amazed by how good this show is in only the first season.  I have heard so unfair criticisms comparing this show to Breaking Bad, which I will admit, the current seasons of that show are better, but it did not start out as strongly as this one did.  This is the best first season in the history of television, and the best Fincher project since Fight Club to include Social Network.  I am not saying that the show can't make any mistakes going forward or that there haven't been other great shows that have fallen from grace over time because they did not have a clear end game and objective like Breaking Bad (here is looking at you Dexter) but still, the best show that will be on television by the time that season 2 comes out.  Just all around amazing.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I picked one of these up a while ago to solve the very simple problem of wanting more than one source to feed my headphones while gaming. I connect the audio output from my PC on channel 3/4 and the output from my smartphone on 5/6. And just like that, gaming, music, and phone calls can all be fed to my headphones with levels set appropriately. It's a bit overkill for my purpose, but, as a result of my setup, over 90% of the listening I do comes through this mixer. There is no discernible noise introduced by the 802, and EQ and pan functions are very helpful in certain situations. By far the best part of this setup is never having to adjust my volume within my pc's operating system. Having a physical volume pot to adjust, rather than alt-tabbing in and out of games, is downright luxurious.<br /><br />P.S. - Since there's no power switch, I like to power the 802 with a surge protector separate from the rest of my system. I use the switch on the surge protector as the on/off switch for my audio setup as well as a few lamps, etc. This saves me the possibility of damaging the fragile pins in the power connector.
B000063147|4.0|This is an album that I probably wouldn't have bought if the band hadn't gone on to better things.  It really doesn't stand on its own, which is fine.  They made this album when they were all 18, and what did any of us do at that time in their life that stands the test of time.  It is a strictly metalcore album with no clean vocals, so fans of their later work might want to sample it before they buy it.  With that being said, it is simply a good old fashioned thrash record.  There are moments of genius on here that show the talent that would be more evident on later releases, and its still better than their self titled album for me (that is too say, I like the sound of this album more, though I concede it is not as well composed), but not as grand as their next two albums.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This author never disappoints.  Already finished his latest and looking forward to the next. Please go get this book now.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|I have to say that I was very disappointed with this album when it came out.  It wasn't like City of Evil as much as I would have liked, and all the metal influences had pretty much be toned down to the point that this was a rock band that wasn't all that hard anymore.  In retrospect, I can't exactly say that I blame them, because I really don't know if I would have wanted them to keep making the same album over and over again, and while I will lambast many of the fans who criticize the band for not sounding enough like their previous album, I will say that the changes for this album were the least to my liking of all the incarnations that the band have made through their career.  I hate that this was the last album that Rev was a part of and really wish that he had been around to make another opus, but this really isn't a bad album.  I kind of resent that THIS is the self titled album, as if the band were trying to convince fans or themselves that this album was their crowning achievement, much like Metallica's Black Album, or The Beatles White Album.  Plenty of fans have called this the White album, and I can't help but to just have to get over it and think of it as a single album, and it does work well as an album.  There is a very deliberate shift in their music that is more rhythmic than any of their other albums.  This is my female friend's favorite album because they can dance to it.<br /><br />I am not saying that these are bad qualities, but the guitar parts really do seem to be toned down some to a more generic structure that supports the base, much like a nu metal band.  But I will say that if it is going to be considered a nu metal album, then it is a very good one that does not fall into many of the trappings that plagued that genre of music.  There is a lot more synth elements to this album, and really is more a wall of sound that aren't really metal sounds.  A7X have always said that they are not trying to fall into any genre and that they are their own sound, which I respect, and I do respect this album and what it is trying to achieve, but it is probably the album that stays in the stereo the least of all their albums.wn sound, which I respect, and I do respect this album and what it is trying to achieve, but it is probably the album that stays in the stereo the least of all their albums.
B00004VXF2|5.0|I have owned both the vinyl and 8-track versions of this, unfortunately my 8-track version is no longer :( I have not listened to it for many years and I am not to be sure if I am having the vinyl version even still, since I have not listened to any of my vinyl records for quite sometime :( I did listen to it quite often in my younger days at a time when I was all teenage drama ;) I would lie on my bed with my hands across my chest and just stare up at my ceiling , while listening to  the vinyl version the end of the sides would actually make me jump at times for the sudden silence. It was a terrible distraction to be having to change the record , it is the reason why I did stop listening to the vinyl version.<br /><br />One time when I was listening to the 8-track version,that did keep playing indefinitely until I was making it stop, my sister did come in to my room as I had been listening to it for hours with my eyes wide open in my usual position, I was looking at her and everything in the room including myself from a corner of the room it seemed. She was talking to me but I did not answer , she even poked me in my eye with her finger and i did Not blink, so she did then run out to my mother yelling that I was dead :( It did strike me as quite odd and it made me start to be laughing hysterically and so they were both quite upset that I had scared them so very much :( It was, I am thinking my very first awake ,out of body experience. I have had other similar experiences since without the aid of this particular work of art .
B001DJLCRC|4.0|It kind of pains me to not give this season 5 stars.  The reason for this really isn't about the show or anything that it does wrong, but more about the fact that they charge you for a full season when all you really get are a few episodes or half a season.  There are not many special features, and the overall presentation for the box set is lacking.  With that being said enough happens this season that you need to watch it before you go into the second season, so my recommendation is to either find it on a streaming site or watch it online.  If that is not your thing, I would definitely recommend that you start watching the show.  There are some great moments in this season, but I have to admit that I wasn't really hooked until mid way through the second season, so I definitely think you should stick with it even if this season isn't your bag, but still THE BEST SHOW OF ALL TIME persiod.  Just not the best season.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Good game fast pace I think my son would even like it. The boosts are reasonable and I like that u don't have to pay out of pocket they can be earned.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|I have to say that I wasn't really sure what to expect with this album.  I think it is funny when reviewers talk about this album not being like the old albums, because every album the band has done has been completely different, and that is what makes them really cool to me.  This album will eventually be just incorporated into the mix and their next album can be the one that doesn't sound like the old stuff.  What I will say is that there is definitely a very metal feeling about this one, but this is by no means their hardest or heaviest, but more a stripped down and bare bones approach to metal, circa early 90's.  There is a big backlash that Machine Head frontman saying that there are a lot of song parts taken from famous songs from that era, and rather than try to defend the band, I will say that who cares.  Is an album that sounds like a mixed tape of the best songs from one of the best eras in the history of metal supposed to be a bad thing?  Yes it is mid tempo.  No I don't think that it has anything to do with the skills of their new drummer.  I didn't think his job with the Black Ops II soundtrack was so great that it proves his place as much as it stands that he is versatile and that he can create the sound for the album the band is trying to make.  I think he is a huge improvement over Portnoy, not that he is a better drummer, but I don't feel like he is trying to showcase himself in the album as much as he is contributing to a much tighter sound than what their last album was.  I really hope that they speed things up with their next album, but this album is a welcomed surprise that will be appreciated.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|With a movie grounded on reality, this soundtrack conveys that mood while still giving me that heroic feel to me. I can't get enough of the main theme.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I know that this is a heavy claim to make about this film, but there is just so much to love about it.  It is the best looking film every made.  Yes, there were no CGI effects at the time, but the blending of miniatures that they did for this film has never been touched.  The acting for this film is absolutely impeccable by everyone that was involved.  The direction seems to be both completely epic and understated at the same time.  The blu ray is really utilized here, as you can tell that Warner really spent the time and money to go back into the original negative and this is one of the cleanest remasters that I have ever seen.  The different versions of the film really do change the meaning of the film with only very slight changes that really show just how subtle and perfectly spaced this film is.  I know people who like each as their favorite, but I have to say that the final cut of the film is pretty amazing if you haven't come around to this version of the film.  This is the film that started the cyber punk movement in cinema, and is still the best example of it on screen.  Just a beautiful beautiful film.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|I bought this book five years ago. At that time I regreted I had not bought it a year earlier while I took up a new job. It got the points and insights for anyone going to pick up a new job. I recently read this book again because of I have to switch my job. I still found it very helpful. Highly recommneded.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I am not a huge fan of live albums.  Generally, live albums are a showcase of studio trickery and how musicians really can't play their instruments.  This is a great live album that showcases the band though their self titled album.  It is a great representation of basically the Rev years of the band.  There is also a great version of Walk on here.  All in all, it is an essential part of the A7X library that no fan should go without.
B001CXWWBE|5.0|Works EXCELLENTLY with VMWare, and lets you get your Gigabit on. Get 4 of these for networking fun, mix with an HBA, and you have yourself a headless - Harddriveless  VMWARE system!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I have to say that the first time that I heard this album I pretty much hated it.  I couldn't get beyond very basic classifications and to say that wasn't what I was about at the time.  Then I heard City of Evil and I started to really respect these guys and I went back to their previous albums to see what they were about.  It still wasn't love at first site, but this is one of the best albums ever made.  It really is that technical and just a great blend of genres that I don't think tha I have ever heard before.<br /><br />One of my friends explains that there are two basic camps that metal bands choose, either Maiden or Priest.  Not to take anything away from Maiden, but they are probably the more classical of the two, with sweeping guitar parts and classical drum fills.  Priest is a little more edgy and the drums are always a bit more heavy, not to take anything away from their guitar onslaught.  Around the 80's, metal bands started to incorporate a lot of punk themes into their music, but this really favored more on the Priest side of things, as it was hard if not impossible to get those clean guitars into a punk structured song.  This album does precisely that.  It really is the merging of those two styles with punk like I have never heard before.  Sure it is a bit alienating because of how unique this album is, but it really is uniting all metal under one banner to go forward behind.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Kept your interest the entire time. I think it would be a great movie to share on family(teenagers and up) on movie night.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I have to say that this season always felt a little pushed.  Many of the resolutions from this season feel a little glossed over in subsequent seasons, and yet it was still enjoyable.  Just not to the level of later seasons and the season that came before it.  There is plenty of good stuff here between Jesse and Walt and the emergence of Gus.  I love how Walt sticks with Jesse through this, even when he probably doesn't need to, not to mention the weaving story line with Hank and Jesse only goes to make the conclussion of the show that much stronger.  Sure, those are really long pay offs, but that is what this show is all about.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Music is great. ..love him. A must have. Great cd...great artist...its a hit. His music is not trashy but more lyrics that you can relate to. Purchase this cd today.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|Great movie of coming of age. Great music. The Italians were all bums! But then, how were we supposed to know?
B0091WNK8M|4.0|I had my grandkids watch this movie while I was up visiting them in Oregon. Why? We were going to Astoria and Cannon beach where the movie was filmed at so I wanted to get them excited about pirates and such, of course I have seen the movie many times and knew they would like it. Also they happen to have an Ex-uncle who bears a striking resemblance to sloth, I'm really not kidding either.. Except for the eye that's not level with the other he's a spitting image! I even taught them to say &#34;hey you guys!&#34; like sloth says..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing. I love it. It's the 2nd time I read it!! Great job on all three books. I can't get enough.
B00A285OOW|4.0|This author does her research very well and always sets forth a good read.  this period in Great Britain's history is fastinating.  I liked this novel as I have enjoyed the others by this author
B00280LYHS|5.0|Very good read. I am enjoying this series. You will enjoy it also. It has lots of excitement and battles that hold your interest.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this app calculator. It is Very easy to use for people who what the answer guick . Love the added features it has. And it's FREE!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|easy to use,  loads fast on my kindle,  simple, no issues yet nor hope to have any. great app all in one.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like dark and twisted... This is the show for you! My oldest daughter watched the first season and loved it.  We are 4 episodes in to the second season and we are not disappointed!
1451673442|5.0|Great book that I highly recommend. You name it, health wealth, relationship, finances can be achieve with the Magic which is so simple,Thank you.  The 28 days journey is truly magic. Try it and believe
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The ending gives closure and the storyline is ok but it is written in a jumble of the timeline with gaps in events. Almost seems like the author just stringed together the storyboard without anything in between. Also some of the scenes are confusing to understand. Not sure if the author wrote this way on purpose.
1616551607|5.0|I am a definite Final Fantasy nerd/buff/obsesor(spelling?) and I cannot believe I hadn't heard of this on its first run. I'm glad I found out about this on the second as I love flipping through it and looking at the artwork. It's a MUST for any final fantasy fanatic that you know. Even if you don't like final fantasy but your spouse does, this will not embarrass on your coffee table, anyone can truly appreciate the art in it.
B00AWBNNAG|1.0|it would not download properly so i don't have that book.. i would like to get this, please fix asap!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|We always wondered, now we know what's happened to Danny Torrance, and in Kings usual \\"\\"hang on\\" style, we find out. Great read'
140006922X|4.0|Aslan's work was enjoyable, helpful, insightful, balanced.  Obviously a well researched study condensed into an easily readible book.  A welcome addition to my history/religion library.  Recommend!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Lots of puzzles for free! Kept me busy for weeks! Even good for kids since you can choose the number of pieces
0374531943|3.0|Good read once I forced myself to read it but found myself doing many other things on vacation rather than read this book. I love all things astronaut (always wanted to be one!) but even that didn't help.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love angry birds they are the best birds<br />I like angry birds games<br />I wish I had it for my I pod
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Definitely worth buying the whole album. AJ Hit the mark on this release. Tired of all the pop sounding &#34;country?&#34; These songs tell real stories & skip the cliches.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Everyone at work has me thinking it was page after page of dirty sex.  Well there was sex.  But there was also a story line.  I've already read all three books.  Rereading now and catching so much I've missed the first time.  Yes I would recommend, but don't read to fast, you can miss so much. Just little things other charters say.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I've read quite a bit of diet books, health books, etc. This book is definitely worth reading. If you follow the guidelines, you will definitely be healthy and even lose weight. The concepts aren't necessary new to me but I like how it is presented and it helped me to regain focus on my healthy options.l
B00F91H666|5.0|Great, entertaining movie. New take on the Zombie genre where you better run fast cause these folks are like Ray Lewis....only faster!
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I would give this cd a 5 but comparing it to my favorite Dream Theater cd's it's only a four. Far better than DToE which I thought may have been their worst and somewhat better than \\"Black Clouds\\" which I thought was middle of the road for DT. I am no expert but I do agree that the drums sounded off a bit but they sound far better on my ipod than my car stereo. To the reviewer who said he couldn't hear the drums, he should get his hearing checked as that was not an issue.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Sarah Jarosz finally came out with new material! She is an amazing talent with a lovely voice. I have seen her live twice, and her shows do not disappoint, like so many artists. She is even better live. If you love mandolin, banjo, and fiddle bluegrass without the twang, she is for you.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've read a lot of books--a LOT of them. This is one I read because my book club picked it and it has now taken a spot in my all-time top-5 books of all time. Seriously it's that good.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love it! Now if my ipad would just let me download the entire season without having to buy more GB.
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is a album that caused thousands of guys and girls to pick up a guitar in the late 60s.  This is the album that caused &#34;Clapton is god&#34; to be scrawled on subways and overpass walls around London.  There is no auto tuning, no perfect performances, just pure revolutionary guitar playing on the part of a young Eric Clapton and the talent of the band as a whole.  This album changed to world.  If you love blues rock and/or rock and roll and/or play guitar, you should listen to this album at least once in your life time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|.Love this game great for all ages, my whole family plays this game. I<br />Recommend this game to all gamers out there
B00009V93Z|5.0|Very Nice Elvis boxset with unreleased and alternate tracks.  This is for the true Elvis fan who enjoys Elvis' artistry and listening to different versions of otherwise familiar songs.  A necessary addition to an Elvis music library.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What ever your searching for you can pretty much find it on Google search will find the site or info you are asking for great app.
B00008GKEG|5.0|For those who love the Beatles, this is a treasure trove of info and music.  An indept look from the early beginnings of the individual members of the Fab Four.  I wish the members had had the guts and respect to fire Pete Best in person themselves, not thru Brian Epstein, but there is no sense beating that dead horse 50+ years after the fact.  We all make mistakes.  Some of the audio and filmed performances are abridged, but for the sake of a feature documantary film, it is important to keep a program paced and moving (special features with complete performances would have been great).  Overall, this is a fantastic set and a wonderful tribute to four guys who had incredible influence and impact on the world of music.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The packaging and setup experience was great.  Kudos to Google there.<br />However, I'm not impressed with the rest of the offering.<br />I have 2013 Nexus 7 and the ability to use the dongle is 'locked down' to apps that Google 'wants' (i.e. monetize I'm sure).<br /><br />It works great for Netflix; and if this is your primary use case, &#34;Go for it&#34;.<br />I dont buy movies from Google Play, so that's no usage to me there.<br />The dongle doesnt allow playback of 'local videos' that you store to your device (FAIL GOOGLE).<br />Casting via Chrome Broswer under Android doesn't work / not available.<br />Casting via Chrome Browser from a PC is spotty.  Some machines it'll work, some it wont.<br /><br />Anyways, so much potential.  So much fail.  Avoid until Google 'unlocks' the Ecosystem.<br />I'm thinking about returning it.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|We unify isn't the best but I do love the story and all that it entails... Couldn't put the book down!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Nice little book about Tesla and his struggles. The author uses Tesla to give understanding to what it means to be intelligent vs. success. It is just a taste though of this great subject and a more in depth view of how and why this is.<br />I personally was affected by this explanation of Tesla as I have many similarities of struggle with success and the relationship with being very good or imaginative about things and putting  that to work in being  successful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game ever! I love to posy this game everyday even when I am at school. walk this is the best upgrade ever. because of the minion beach. like I said best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I like the techniques and science in this book. It's definitely worth the read for anyone looking to gain strength. Wade definitely makes a good argument about how fitness should be approached.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Both leading ladies were great and the onscreen chemistry between Colin and Ginny was believable.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|An action packed movie with Tom Cruise playing a good/bad guy.  It is a sit on the edge of your entertainment.  Well worth watching.
0312370849|4.0|I really enjoyed the book but it was a disturbing story.  Very well written.  This is the sort of book that you cannot say you &#34;loved it&#34; because of the subject matter but it definitely was a book that I could not put down.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Funny and sad at the same time.  Two crazy, lonely, love starved people find each other in a highly entertaining movie.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|LOTS OF ACTION i ONLY SEEN PART OF IT CANT WAIT TO SEE WHOLE THING! ITS KIND OF CONFUSING IF YOU MISS PART!
B0087IT8LO|5.0|I was interested in this movie because of the trailer I saw showing a Maserati Quattroporte screaming through the street of Paris.  I immediately did a search on Amazon, and there it was.  One quick click and I had it two days later!  To my delight, the Maserati appears frequently and, more often than not, at high speeds.....ooohhh, the sounds that car makes!  However, this revue is supposed to be about the movie, and while I must admit that I've never really been able to get into foreign movies with subtitles, this movie grabbed my immediate attention and held me glued to our big screen TV until the credits at the end were over.  The best part is that it the movie based on a true story.  The movie is very well done, cinematography is great, screenplay is inspired, acting is on par with some of the best in the business, and it pulls the viewer into the story so well that you can't wait to see what happens next.  Emotions run from knee-slapping, laugh-out-loud to an unexpected lump in the throat.  Oh, and did I mention the Maserati??  This movie has taken its place among my all-time favorites and I know I will watch it again and again (already watched it three times).  Don't miss this one, you will be the better for it!  Bravissimo!!
B006IR6NH8|1.0|I contacted steelseries twice, requesting new levers. Both times they told me to send it back at my cost and they will determine if they will replace it. All I want are the parts to do it myself. Its seems they didn`t even read my request, more like a computer generated response. If this thing breaks this often and no parts are available, what after the warranty runs out? I have to admit, I really liked the wheel, but thinking I should have just spent the money for the g27. My momo force feedback lasted me almost ten years with minor problems, and Logitech sent me replacement parts to fix it myself. At no cost to me.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Here is the newest response from support for this product(if you call it support?)Copy and paste from my email.<br /><br />Unfortunately we do not have replacement parts or repair services for this product. The primary reason is because the cost to order parts individually, although counter-intuitive, is as much if not more than the cost of the product in addition to shipping costs. Repairs are even more prohibitive in terms of cost.<br /><br />We are looking into solutions for the future but at the time, we cannot offer a replacement part or repair service for this product.<br /><br />Thanks for your understanding.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy this product. This line is my opinion.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Okay--I had to do it.  I love manga and anime, and while this book has no illustrations, any book that involves an ordinary Joe taking on superheroes gone bad, in an anime-style post-apocalyptic setting was bound to interest me.<br /><br />Wow!  Action from page one, right to the end.  Sanderson is back to writing in a way that is fresh and out-there.  You feel like he has fallen in love with writing all over again, and it is awesome.<br />The protagonist, David is young, hotheaded and naïve. He is smart and too bold for his own good.  He meets people who are justifiably wary of him, and that is when his adventures really begin. David gets put through the wringer and keeps coming back for more.<br /><br />The Epics are nothing more than common thugs, street-criminals with no class and no conscience.  They abuse their super-powers as much as they can, and they flaunt their power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. The more powerful an Epic, the higher they rise within their own ranks. Like most street-gangs they are always jostling within their own ranks for power.<br /><br />This is not a two dimensional tale of good versus evil. The Reckoners are not without flaws of their own, and that gray area is what make this tale interesting.  There are layers here, and yes, it is a setup for the rest of the series, but I don't care. I enjoyed the heck out of it, and can't wait for the next installment!
B00F35BV64|5.0|If you love movies, then you must see this one. This one is awesome and keeps you on the edge.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|One of the Best Books Ever<br /><br />Read it. You'll love it. My review is so short only because I'm busy reading :-)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Start the reading from first book city of bones, and trust me you won't stop reading. One of the best book series!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Joshua presents the material in an entertaining and fun style that makes it hard to put down.  I highly recommend this book to all.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game. I LOVE THIS BINGO GAME! Although sometimes there are times when it has technical difficulties during the play and it sucks if you were in the middle of a good round.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Great set. Probably more suitable for advanced builders over the age of 12. Lots of pieces so you can make your own creations as well. Fits in with the other modular sets to create a row of buildings.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Although touching, I found this book kinda dull and predictable.  It was enjoyable, but just didn't suck me in.  I would recommend this book, it's ok, just didnt really grab me.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Absolutely hooked on Downton, even if 3-year contracts made for a series of untimely plot twists. Style, great characters, drama and those little bits of dry English humor - it's got it all.
B000JIN3J8|2.0|It was not that great a version a lot of it felt felt like they were rushing through the lines
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another great book in the Bosch series and another winner for Connelly. Great read that will keep you engulfed from start to finish.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Excellent read. Kept me interested until the very end. Wanted the story to continue. Looking forward to reading more books from this author.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to know more about what to expect after this life, by someone who is very acredable, and done in a very captivating, interesting way.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Terrible!! It'll definitely wake you up, but it does NOT turn off!!  Gave it one star bc I had to. I would rate it as -5
B001EBYM62|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a film class and I don't usually like old movies. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it. It's not your typical musical, there are also a lot of funny parts. All I have to say is: watch it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|But I have a feeling that I'll get tired of it soon.  Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles..... it needs to change up something to keep the interest.  But for now.  I'm having a blast.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the novel that should be shutting up the longtime SK fans that think the Man from Bangor has lost his gift. But don't expect it to be a pure horror tale: it's more along the lines of a supernatural adventure. Or dark fantasy, whatever you want to call it...I'm not into labels. But it's entirely in the real world, and you believe in every detail of what's happening. And it's a beautiful, 100% worthy, sequel to King's masterpiece, _The Shining_.<br /><br />But if you haven't read _The Shining_, read that first. This novel won't have the same impact if you haven't read it. And no, if you've seen the Stanley Kubrick movie, that doesn't count. You gotta read _The Shining_ first. Hell, if it's been a long time since you read it, read it again.<br /><br />I guess the most important thing I have to say is that I'm a huge fan of _The Shining_, and this novel, _Doctor Sleep_, is a completely satisfying followup. And it leaves the door open for another novel in this series, which some people might say is a sacrilege, but which I think would be just dandy.<br /><br />_Doctor Sleep_ is, quite simply, a kickass story. It even packs in some life lessons...without getting within a thousand miles of being preachy.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this movie. Brought back a lot of memories for my childhood. Would watch is over and over again. Goonies forever
B00EUS6FR0|4.0|I wish I knew more languages. I feel like I've been taken for a world tour!  Very fun and engaging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever even though I do not like despicable me it is so so so sooooooooooo fun
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have tried for two days now to get this to operate. No luck on my smart phone or my laptop. I cant seem to get them to connect to the final step. I guess I need to watch more you tube videos on this.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|An amazing purchase!! Exactly what I was looking for to complete my Star Trek collection!! Recommended to all!! I defiant must have!
B00CEZJT2E|2.0|I have two issues. One, the built in usb plug doesn't fit my Galaxy S4 with the case on. I imagine it won't work with most cases. Two, after the device is charged to 100% it stops powering the phone. The charger detects this and shuts off. Then the phone battery drains and the only way for it to start changing again is to unplug and plug back in.<br /><br />Also, I have experienced some weird issues where even if my phone is less than 100% and the charger itself is full, plugging it in doesn't start charging my phone. I had to go through a bunch of plug/unplug of the charger itself to the wall, and then plug/unplug of the phone a bunch of times. Eventually it started charging. Since I can't use the built in usb connection, it sits in it's holding spot and sometimes it seems like the charger then doesn't think something is plugged into the external usb on the side.<br /><br />I do like the form factor. For me I wanted this to take to keep my phone powered on my longer 100 mile bike rides. And it fits perfectly in my back pocket with my phone.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love kik I really do but for some reason it won't let me sign in it been doing this for 2 days now can someone help me please?
B00DQC2FPM|3.0|This set has a lot of potential. Little things that other reviews mention do bug me. Like not being able to fit both mini figs into the car. Also it really isn't that durable. My 5 year daughter was lightly playing with it and the doors kept falling off. So its mostly a show piece.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A good fun movie to look out. Avengers movie surprises little mysterie good magic trick very exciting the good actor
B00846F1YW|5.0|The game is attractive overall. Interesting and challenging. Don't have to share to FB or Twitter if you don't want to.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I have like his books but this was important to get a better feel of what created Harry. I also liked that it was not as dark as the later books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is great TV......Historical and entertaining.  Never thought I could enjoy a soap opera like this with my wife and friends.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Well, my friend highly recommended this book saying its plot is like Desperate Housewives. I think DH season 1 plot was really well done but unfortunately, this book plot isn't as good. I guessed the secret right and what's going to be the resolution. There are additional twists but I thought those are somewhat tacked on to make a point. Overall, it's still an enjoyable read with funny bites and quotables which I did enjoy.
B001NLL93W|5.0|good plot. jace sucks...he's annoying . Simon is just what this needs! I HOPE THE PREQUEL WILL BE THIS GOOD.
B00D660M6M|5.0|The pricier import version has 6 reviews at the time I write this (see those). But since most people will naturally look at the cheaper US version, I had to write a quick review.<br /><br />Like another person reviewed on the import, I first heard him on the HBO commercial for the Newsroom. I was glad I was watching HBO that day just for that.<br />I quickly listened to a few videos on Youtube and immediately bought his vinyl import that was released earlier in the UK.<br /><br />Luckily, he was playing some small shows in the US in the summer with little fanfare. His live show was also good, albeit short.<br /><br />He has a great voice and as others have said, sounds a bit like Jeff Buckley. Cannot go wrong there.<br /><br />Go to iTunes and listen to the longer samples they give you. Buy the full album, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />He is also touring again in the US, so see him live if you can.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is one of the darkest books I've ever read. I could really feel the fear from the woman it was happening to. The ending crept me out an  it felt like her nightmare with this man wasn't  over. Truly scared me.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|The game is great just a little UNrealistic and it needs traffic also needs boses<br />But it's good when you multiplayer  but needs to be like need for speed
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is to complete out collection of the Star Trek series.  I haven't had a chance to watch it yet but I hope I will enjoy it.
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Seems like a simple game of Backgammon.  Nothing fancy.  easy to work.  Has several options available to change up the game played.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent control, great visuals, perfect time waster, mesmerizing gameplay. Especially awesome for Galaga fans. The extra power-ups add another layer of fun. Love it.
B003M6WERG|5.0|Modern family is so funny! The amazon version is good quality and downloads immediately. It is a must see TV show!
B000UZPIAW|4.0|This was a very informative and interesting book... if u are a fan of the crew as I am then I recommend it highly...
B008VPC9WS|3.0|It's a good book, but don't expect so much.<br />I recommend it for the beginning of your prep, when you have no idea about iBT.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|So far so good... it's only been a few lessons but for free I a learning some Spanish.  I have found that I need to write phrases in a notebook to help me, but that is just me.  It is at your own pace and you can repeat lessons if you need or want to (especially for pronunciation).
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I havent finished it yet because its not the kind of book you just read passively because it has experiments you have to do and continue to the next chapter.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie & it left me wanting more.  This could be taken 2 ways but in this instance  it's meant as a complement.  The storyline was well developed as well as the main character.  The remainder of the cast were as they were meant to be, supporting roles.  I believe these zombies are the best to date.  I'm a huge zombie fan & have an extensive collection of Zombie movies, mini series, & tv series.  The most important features of a Zombie as far as I'm concerned are make-up & movement.  The make-up wasn't as gorey as most other Zombie flicks but the movements were extraordinary.  They were extremely fast & they had ticks which to me took them to a whole new level.  Nothing like a full on global Zombie Apocalypse!  I will watch this movie many more times which makes this one a keeper.  This is the only Zombie movie I've seen where they actually came up w/a solution for the problem.  You'll have to watch & see to find out because there's nothing worse than someone giving you spoilers of a movie you haven't seen yet.  I gave this movie ★★★★ stars because I felt the make-up could've been better.  My guess is the Zombies moved @ such a fast pace they didn't feel the need to go into great detail as far as the make-up was concerned.  I wholeheartedly recommend this flick to any & all Zombie fans.  I  would like to recommend a great Zombie mini series called DEAD SET.  It's takes  place in England & the majority of the film takes place on the Great Britain Big Brother  set.  Both make-up & movement are extraordinary.  Make sure if you're in the US that  it's in the Region I format or else it won't play on your dvd player.  If you have a multi  zone player then it won't matter what region it is.  World War Z - Buy it !  NOW ! ! !
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My grandchildren and I love this movie.<br />On a recent auto trip they watched it over and over.<br />It is most entertaining and my six year old granddaughter knows the words to the songs and loves to sing with the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|For me, it's been a piece of crap. Very unstable. I have several laptops, desktops, Roku, and even DVD wi-fi players, and none of them, except this Chromcast device, have trouble connecting up. And it is every time I use it. I have to reboot several times, cross my fingers, and toss coins into the fountain to get it to sync up with my laptop to stream. It is much easier to just use my 25 foot HDMI cable from my laptop to the TV, and be done with it. A waste of money...
B00BYISQTO|5.0|There will be fans who only like Boxer & Alligator and those who cite High Violet as their favorite. I assert that Trouble has MUCH more subtlety and craft than their previous work. They're pushing boundaries here and I for one appreciate what they've done. I liked High Violet, but found some of the lyrics cliched and boring. With Trouble, they've really moved beyond that. Candidly, I wouldn't even have bought this album except that a friend suggested we get VIP seats to their show in Seattle last week. I said yes and bought the album in preparation for the show. I have to admit that I was not expecting much and I was PLEASANTLY surprised with the album. I was even more surprised with how good the show was. One of the best I've seen in recent memory, although the Dead Can Dance show at Marymoor park in 2012 was the best I've seen in YEARS. Several songs from this album have stuck in my head and I continue to listen to it over and over again. It's a keeper, no matter what anyone else says.<br /><br />Update November 8, 2013: Still listening to this album almost daily, sometimes more than once. This is definitely my favorite album by The National.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Absolutely love it!  I've been listening to this album and Random Access Memories every day, when it's time to get a few hours of uninterrupted work done.

B005OT2YVA|1.0|Just awful, overly long and surprisingly gory - yet somehow people keep paying to watch. And listening to Optimus' dialogue, you'd think he was the villain.
074356619X|5.0|It will give you a new outlook on everything and is superbly made and edited. I also got the audio edition which has more on it!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It is an okay movie, with a great plot idea. It just seemed lacking and did not seem to connect.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|just wish it worked when my tablet is in sleep mode Other then that its fun to use and easy to figure out.
B00004W221|5.0|I want to share this movie with my grandkids.  It tells a beautiful story of the courage on young man had to live his dreams.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|the movie is funny and cute and fits the tv series wonderfully. it was a great next movie after the first one.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|This is one of those films that gets better with repeated viewings.  Once you get over the &#34;it's not Avengers 2&#34; feelings, the movie is enjoyable in it's own right.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|A lot of people think the movie adaptation of the book was awful. I was an English major in college and I thought the movie was wonderful! It was nice to see things that we analyzed over and over again make their way into the movie. Plus, who doesn't love Leo?
B00BS4PF0C|4.0|I started watching Blake Shelton on the voice and just really enjoyed his personality, so I decided to buy the album.  LOVE most of it.  Was a little disappointed at the difference in the language in The Boys Round Here album version and the one on the radio.  I may have missed the warning somewhere, but my 4 year old loves the song...bummer that we can't listen to the version I bought because of one word.  Overall, good.
B008L5G4I8|3.0|The  Myer sty  was presented to be solved.  You picked your villain  but he too died.  she choose a sneaky  way  to reveal the end..  It was not quite fair,

B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like this app. It has some good features like maps a 24 hour forecast and interesting video clips (but some are too graphic) also has good credit system and prizes are reasonable. I would like it if there were more prizes that did not cost so many credits... not everyone has the time to watch multiple videos and view maps :-L

B007KAJG3K|4.0|I love the take on this version of Sherlock Holmes!<br />And also love the interplay Holmes and Sherlock.<br />Gave this only four stars because they killed off the female lead from the last film!<br />I adored her, and her scenes though brief in this film were simply delicious!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it.  Costumes were spot on for the period.  The story line was perfection.  Won't miss any season!  Truly loved it!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Terrific movie and the absolutely georgeous female lead!<br />This the last are my favorite, stunning stunts in this also WOW!
B005NFVZTM|2.0|is a simple, poorly written movie, having all that potential, it should have added more to the saga. The only good part is the mystique's difficult decisions
B001QOOCTE|5.0|The music touches my heart like no other music has before.  A beautiful concept, beautiful music, wonderful musicians...we need more.
B00DU74U74|3.0|It began as an interesting concept for other species colonizing earth, but then it became a love story and it got boring
B005COO1X6|3.0|King at half-speed. Always readable, not always worth the candle emotionally.<br />Stakes must always be Life/Death to the nth. Period.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was exciting in the beginning. I couldn't put it down until the last few chapters. A lot of scenes repeats itself, and I got bored. So I skimmed through the last two chapters just to know the ending.
0823003590|5.0|This book is a must have for people studying portraits. This author is a real master of his craft, which is a rare thing nowadays.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Amazing product. You get exactly what you're expecting but better! It comes in a perfect little box perfect for a gift too and a 5 year warranty.
0823016285|3.0|this book was okay. there were some things to be learned in it. I don't think there was enough to fill a whole book,though.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wow...whereas the shining had craziness that was overwhelming at times and either made the read slow going or made me skip ahead...Dr sleep has just enough to make the story enjoyable while still moving the story along...well done
B009MYARIK|2.0|I've read all her other books before and I felt this book was quite boring. The plot was pretty shallow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game soooooooooooo much it is so awesome. I hope everyone agrees with me. Get this game now!!
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I attended 5 of these  shows at Hard Rock & out of the hundreds of concerts I have seen, these were by far the best. Joe's voice was well rested and perfect! The setlist was different each night, which included songs from Def Leppards early career. For me, the Ded Flatbird set was the absolute best!  I'm so excited to relive this wonderful concert experience! If you missed Viva Hysteria in person, you will absolutely love this!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is great! No lags so far! All it needs is fast wifi,nothing bad has been detected so far!
0679745203|5.0|This is perhaps the finest novel that I have ever read. Despite being a post-war novel, it is very unlike the rest of them. I found it a pleasant surprise that a novel set in the territory ravaged by World War II could give the reader, almost the feeling of being in a cocoon. I found it a very centered and even paced book.<br /><br />The intimate space that is occupied by the 4 main characters in the book is beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. The characters themselves are complex and fleshed out in great detail. Their transformation over the course of the novel is tangible and impressive. This is especially so of Caravaggio, the thief, and Kip, the sapper. Kip's character is the one that seems to grow the most through the novel. He starts out as a brilliant sapper and by the end of the novel, sees the futility of what he is doing in a place that is in no way significant to him. The decision that he makes on this realization, bears testimony to his transformation.<br /><br />Hana, one of the central characters in the book is endearing and strong. Thrown into the battlefield as a nurse at the young age of 16, she grows up too fast. When the novel opens at the end of the war, the English patient who was rescued by beduins from an airplane on fire, is not up to being transported along with the rest of the patients. Hana decides to stay back with him, her last patient, in a ruined ancient Italian villa, while her colleagues leave for civilization.<br /><br />The beauty of this book I believe is in many different aspects. The most important I think is the beautiful prose that is used for the narrative. Another point that appealed to me is the way the author addresses identity or the lack of it and boundaries or the lack of them. Basing the central character on the life of a Hungarian Count who was a desert explorer, worked well in achieving this. Keeping the identity of the English patient a mystery till the end, was a masterly stroke.The brutality of war and what it doesto people across the world, is brought out poignantly in this book. This is done effectively with the use of this assorted bunch of characters, each belonging to a different part of the world but strung together by the common thread of humanity. Each of the four characters nurses a different emotional wound. But their being there together at that time after the war, seems to help in a strange common healing process. The multiple dimensions and layers that this book has, gives the reader a peek into the keen intellect of the author. But what takes it to a level above other equally intelligent pieces is, I believe, the gentleness with which the story is told and the fine brush strokes that seem to paint each frame. The feeling that I got on reading many parts of the narrative was of seeing a beautiful painting. But on other occasions, the author manages to say very little but communicates a strong mood or emotion. Among these, I was touched by the longing for the past and happy times, the emotion of love of different types, the beauty of the written word and how it helps the English Patient to reach out to Hana, and so on.<br /><br />The author's mastery over his craft stands apart in his aritistry in weaving such a tale that stands out as a larger-than-life canvas. This will stay with me forever.
B00F3YHMUE|3.0|Sting's latest album is infinitely better than his last album of folk tunes and poems.  This time Sting focuses on showtunes for an upcoming Broadway musical about life working in the shipyards.  The album is filled with the somber tones of a workman's life with little hope of happiness beyond the potential love of a woman.  There are no catchy tunes that high school choirs will latch onto and learn.  There isn't a single song on the album that could stand alone and be a Top 40 hit, but something tells me that's not what Sting was trying to do.  This is a musical about the rough life and love of a ship builder.  There are still some fun moments in the songs.  I particularly liked &#34;And Yet&#34; and &#34;When the Pugilist Learned How to Dance&#34; which reminded me of the lyrical genius and musical might that Sting can wield better than most.  I long for a Sting album of pop hits that go back to the days of Dream of Blue Turtles and The Soul Cages, but those days may be done and gone.  In the meantime, the musical accompaniment on The Last Ship is some of the best I've heard in years.  Don't let the lyrics and Sting's shifting accents distract you from the amazing, haunting sounds of the music he's created.  It's worth the listen, without a doubt.  Just go in with expectations lower than I did.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I think this is classified as a young adult book, and it's won awards in that genre. It's about a teen boy and video games so it's easy to see why they put it in the YA genre, but it definitely does appeal to those familiar with the 80s culture as well. It seemed a little too masculine if that makes any sense, but it is very good and held my interest throughout.
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|It is a lesser of Lee Child's work. The characters seemed a little weak. I only have a few more &#34;Reacher&#34; books to read and I hope they get better.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|Never ceases to entertain me :)  The storyline is different....<br />The storyline is awesome!  I will keep watching for sure~
B00DXP7L88|3.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS SO PLEASE WATCH OUT<br /><br />We wrote our first Dexter review at the end of S7 and threw up some possible story points for S8 (pretty unsuccessfully!).  There seems to be alot of early negative reviews here, relating to the season in general, but particularly with the ending and although we were disappointed too the 1 & 2 star ratings are way to harsh.<br /><br />After writing the S7 review we had hoped that the final season would eschew the standard Dexter formula and NOT introduce new characters and provide yet another serial/master killer.  The reason being that all S8 had to do was start at precisely where S7 ended and should have simply focused on Angel, sharply changing his mind about retiring, and with the full resources of Miami Metro behind him, aggressively investigate the murder of Maria (I mean, is there a fan out there who really did not want to see more of the immediate aftermath of Maria's murder..........particularly when Dexter & Deb went back to the party....and then the hours, days and weeks after!?).  Ultimately, the entire season would have revolved around the unit slowly piecing together evidence that points to Dexter being the killer (hell, you even had Angel find the warrants Maria had obtained for Dexters/Debs phone records!!).  The story turns/developments that could have been done would have been more than enough to fully flesh out the season without the unecessary tangents that this final season took.  In addition, it could have included and given more screen time to the main supporting characters (eg. Vince would have been pivotal in forensically identifying his 'hero' as the 'villain' & Quinn would have been divided by his affection for Deb).  There was alot to work with here!<br /><br />With the murder of Maria the final season was always going to be downbeat but even though we thought it would happen the death of Deb was still heartbreaking (particularly when the impression was that she might be allowed to survive.......but it appears the makers did want her, and Dexter, to pay the ultimate price for their actions).<br /><br />With a show that lasted 8 seasons, with fans investing so much time and caring for such appealing characters, the show should not have ended with so much ambiguity and so many loose ends and unanswered questions (to the point that the last few scenes seemed like an 11th hour tack on).  Not that we want to be spoon-fed but a certain amount of definitive closure should have been allowed for.<br /><br />Despite its failings S8 is still very good but contrary to the filmakers apparent endgame this is a show that demanded, and we hope most fans would agree and have accepted (and really wanted), a 'happy' ending.......with Dexter, Deb & Harrison making an escape when it was clear Miami Metro was on to them (how great would it have been to see the reactions of Angel, et al, once the evidence slowly revealed the truth about their great friend Dexter!?).<br /><br />Thanks once more to everyone involved with this marvellous programme that we will almost certainly never see its like again......but we will also kind of hate you because, at the moment, the first thing we think of when we now think of Dexter is that Deb dies.....hopefully that will fade in time.<br /><br />PS: a few more days have passed since we saw the final episode and the ending has gotten less and less acceptable.....to the point that our rating has reduced to 3.5 stars.  Apparently, we need better lives if we're still thinking about a TV show, huh!?

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little gadget is absolutely amazing. Not only does it let you stream netflix and other apps to your television, it also lets you cast from your computer once you install the chrome-cast add on. Literally took 5 minutes to set up.<br /><br />And, to top it off, you can also cast music, movies, photos etc from your personal data collection if you install Plex. Best 35 dollars I ever spent.

B00B52FDXQ|5.0|The writing was great, the special effects and battle sequences were bigger and better and the rule of Rome was severely tested.  I will miss Spartacus, I hope Steven gets a new series soon!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was a waste of time. I should not have purchased this as it seemed unlikely to mentally stimulate in any way, however I had read the positive reviews by the Washington Post and others who raved about it. I thought there must be something interesting here... This was an utter bore, I thought if I kept reading it would get better... it did not. When I have time to sit and read, I prefer a book with a story... this is simply a monotonous log of petty small town daily life... don't waste your time.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|I got about halfway through it and realized I didn't care about a single character or how the movie ended. There didn't seem to be an original thought in the entire movie. I'd read/seen it all before.

031623480X|5.0|Dr. Permutter's \\"Grain Brain\\" is based on cutting edge science from several disciplines.  He does a good job of arguing for the convergence of his ideas in several different types of scientific literature.  The information presented in this book extends the science of the \\"low carb\\" approach  (like Volek and Phinney's work), giving a better rationale for why it works, and it also agrees with and extends the anti-inflammation and leptin control approaches to diet/lifestyle (like Leo Galland's Fat Resistance Diet).  If you are familiar with either or those approaches to nutrition, then you will probably find the information in \\"Grain Brain\\" to be especially valuable.  I personally found Dr. Perlmutter's discussion of \\"type three diabetes\\" to be particularly compelling.  The author of this book is no scientific lightweight, but he presents his information in a way that is  easily understood.  Of particular importance is the information presented and explained regarding the importance of fats to human health and longevity. After three decades of being bombarded with information suggesting all fat was bad, this book deserves serious consideration, and Perlmutter presents a convincing argument for his position.  If you are interested in general health,  longevity, and if you want to hear an interesting argument about a possible cause for Alzheimer's Disease, then read this book.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|I was unsure about this album, as I've heard other albums from older artists that just didn't pass the muster, but this CD isn't one of them. It is a slower CD than some of their others, but like another reviewer stated, that becomes less important the older I get. My favorites are \\"My Little Universe\\" and \\"Slow\\".<br /><br />This CD is worth the price and then some, if you are a DM fan.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|Welcome to Country Music Sheryl Crow!!!  Outstanding music on this album!!! Shotgun is an awesome blend of both country and eay rock with Sheryl's signature bluesiness!!!!! Then, of course, the first single, &#34;Easy&#34; which is outstanding both vocally and lyrically. The ballad, &#34;Give It To Me&#34; is so sensual and provacative!! I hope the next single will be either &#34;Callin' Me When I'm Lonely&#34; or &#34; We Oughta Be Drinkin'&#34; as both of those songs have a great melody and the lyrics fit right in with what country music should be doing today!!!  Rarely do you find an entire album that is worth listening to but this record is one of those rareties!!!  I really would like to see every song released as a single!!! Hope Sheryl Crow is here to stay!!!!

B00FFVML74|5.0|Another great production from British TV. A few of the earlier episodes move a little slowly but they were still fascinating in that they showed the interactions of the the members of a close  knit small community grieving one of their own. I have to say I was mesmerized during every episode to the point where I was always surprised when the credits came up! Very enjoyable series and I recommend it.

I'm all about artists moving forward, like when Eddie Van Halen added keyboards to his repertoire, and when Chris DeGarmo left Queensryche for Piloting due burning out rather than fading away. And although Petrucci, I absolutely love your work, I am sad that this album did not grab me like so many others. Been hooked since Images And Words, and rediscovered again with On the Backs of Angels, and Bridges in The sky... As well as the 3 minute break in A Nightmare to Remember... omg, I honestly can't think of a better more emotional passage than that. But at first listen to the new DM, I'm sad.  Not one track has caught me... I hope that over several more listens I find the gems that I love about DM.
1623420148|5.0|Tangled was a great witty ready from the beginning to end. I look forward to reading another Emma Chase book
B00B97TMIE|3.0|Sigh No More is a classic.  Babel tries to sound like that, and does, but in a strained way.  A recurring word that the lead singer (sorry, don't know his name, but love his voice) is &#34;heart&#34; - in Sigh No More, I love how he says it - in Babel, not quite as good.  I'd call it a good second album, but not like second albums I've really enjoyed from groups like Guster.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Raw emotion.  That's what I felt while reading this, from the very first chapter.  Children.  My gracious....they're children.  I wanted to hold Ender, to cradle him and tell him it's all going to be ok.  I still do.<br /><br />If you've not met Ender, I invite you to enter in.  What more can I say?
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|Sigh No More is a classic - and Babel will not be.  I'll listen to Sigh No More for years to come - Babel just sounds like M&S tried to do a continuation album - and it just doesn't work like their first album did.  This is OK, but not great.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|GOT this app for the multiplayer, can only connect once then it doesn't work after that. Have reinstalled and reset everything it happens every time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is an amazing look at humanity.  It also looks at another common theme current in Dan Brown's book inferno, which is over population.  There are limited resources and we don't seem to understand this.  We need to challenge ourselves to understand that we are or own worst enemies.
B005XUC398|2.0|BOOOOOORRRRING!!!  Tried for intensity and ended up very dull, draggy, overly dramatic with a small plot.  Demi Moore should have stayed home.
B0040PYVTW|5.0|Lovely album. If you can get to Youtube watch Creating a Moment based on this album. Blows this out of the park.
B006RZFACU|5.0|My son never wanted to be read to from my kindle, he's say. \\"No, Daddy, I want real books!\\" But that was before \\"The Garden Party,\\" which was the first Peter Collier book I read him - he loved it and wanted more. Next came this one . . . \\"The fog was here and over there; the fog was simply everywhere.\\" Perfect rhymes, great stories that I enjoyed, too. I'm getting them all and you should too! Highly recommended 5-stars.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it, cant wait for next season. It is a wonderful show and I am glad it is part of Amazon Prime.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a fabulous period piece set in Blenheim Palace.  The acting is superb, the architecture if fabulous, and the story line keeps you watching.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Not as good as the first two. The actors all did an excellent job I just didn't care too much for the storyline of this one.
B00DJZR46G|1.0|No one expects Elton to be what he once meant to rock music at this stage of the game. But once again we have an album of basically duds melody wise. This somnambulistic album is depressing, dreary, and devoid of any memorable melodies. Taupin consistently delivers and yet Elton has clearly run out of ideas how to write a memorable pop or rock song. The energy level is ZILCH. Ten years or so ago the track BIRDS stood out from the West Coast album as a true example of a real return to his roots and 2007's THE CAPTAIN AND THE KID had its bright moments. Thus has none and that almost octave-less voice is pretty much painful to endure. Bravo to Billy Joel who bowed out before the millennium pretty much at the top of his game, rather than drag his star to a halt the way elton has done.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik waz down but now its back up YAY this is amazing the update is even better get kik now its awsome. Ull luv kik. On a scale of 1 to 10 its 1000 it breaks the scale get kik. U must get it.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great show for anyone tired of the typical banal tv shows.  This is well written, great casting, and unpredictable.  Finally. Refreshing tv.
B005NAE04E|3.0|I think I hoped too much for this book. It's not that I didn't enjoy it - I really did - but it's supposed to be &#34;Neil Gaiman's best novel&#34; and I don't quite agree. I love the world he creates below London, but I guess it feels more like a first novel in a series where everything is explained than the whole story. I did like the characters though.
0767903862|5.0|It is only recently that I have discovered Bill Bryson, and in short order he has managed to become one of my favorite authors. This work is the epitome of what a travel book should be. Bryson seamlessly weaves together history, wit, insight, and personal anecdote into a memorable tale that greatly increased my desire to see this enormous and remote continent.<br /><br />Firstly, it is clear throughout the entire length of the book that Bryson genuinely loves this nation. My appreciation of his affection may be somewhat heightened by the fact that I also listened to the audio book (read by the author), and his tone betrays his endearing lack of subjectivity. His love of the people does not keep him from making some sharp comments about particular subjects however. He observes that Australians tend to engage in the art of argumentation without actually wishing for change, as with the topic of them becoming a full-fledged independent republic. Also, he doesn't pull punches when relating how some of the inhabitants of this great nation were anything but hospitable.<br /><br />The historical narrative he weaves into the tale would undoubtedly be more interesting when traveling through the towns and countryside. Brief historical sketches of the small communities he passes through tend to be boring but his more generalized Australian history about the founding is fascinating and well told. The countless failed explorations into the interior were mostly forgettable, but they successfully conveyed the brutality and ruthlessness of the natural Australian environment. Also, the migration of peoples 45,000 years ago onto the continent was right on the nail.<br /><br />When discussing the plight of the aboriginals he makes some cutting observations about the Aussies and himself. After mulling over the `problem', and considering ways that the position of the aboriginals in Australian society might be bettered, he finds that he has no genuine answers to the problem. \\"So without an original or helpful thought... I did what most white Australians do. I read my paper... and didn't see them [the aborigines] anymore.\\"<br /><br />His humorous obsession with deadly animals continues in this work as well, as he documents fish, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians that are particularly adept at maiming and killing unsuspecting or careless travelers. Also, he makes note of the introduction of wild rabbits onto the continent by Thomas Austin, a resident of Victoria in 1859. The 24 rabbits originally released for sport soon grew to a population in the millions. Temporarily curtailed by the governments' introduction of a rabbit-killing disease, the hardy survivors eventually began breeding again until the figures reached a staggering 300 million (at time of publication.<br /><br />Lastly, the most personally impactful aspect of the book is Bryson's narrative style. As an avid traveler, I log my own journeys and document where I've been, as well as interesting tales, brushes with death, etc. His descriptive ability is superb and he draws the reader into the scenes with a comic and conversational style. His lonely encounters in bars, awkward picture taking with other solo travelers (as they stare at an enormous fabricated lobster) and drunken nights with his traveling companions are hilarious and genuine. I hope to bring his vividness to my next trip, when writing about it later.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who likes travel, has gone to Australia, or wishes to go in the future. He inspired me to do so, and even made me believe that Uluru (Ayers rock) might be worth seeing, and not just the world's most useless geological artifact. Five stars.

B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Amazing, need a sequel. My favorite movie of 2012. The only reason this was a flop in the US was poor marketing.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|Question: What can you say about a CD that features songs sung in German, Mandarin, Farsi, French, Japanese, Romanian, Turkish, and English... songs from the 1900s, 20s, 30s,  40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 90s, and 2013... vocals by China Forbes, NPR's Ari Shapiro, Storm Large, the remarkable Meow Meow, Philippe Katerine, Timothy Nishimoto, trombonist Robert Taylor, Rufus Wainright, four von Trapp Family singers, and Phyllis Diller...assisted by the Harvey Rosenkranz Orchestra and the Pacific Youth Choir, and 95 year old clarinetist Norman Leyden?<br /><br />Answer: Pink Martini and friends are at it again! As usual, Pink Martini offers a musical melange that is eclectic, fun, inspiring, and touching, with a large ensemble of the finest musicians one could ever hope to find. Mix yourself a cocktail, put on your dancing shoes, and prepare to enjoy some of the finest music you will ever hear.  You will soar across genres, decades, countries and continents. Enjoy!
B004742Y68|4.0|Remarkably clear in HD, for such an old movie. It's amazing to watch this again, and realize just how influential this film was on modern horror movies. So many pop culture references come from this movie. As we ramp up to Halloween, this is definitely one to add to your list!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This was s  beautiful, respectful portrayal of what I imagine it must be like for aging, formerly gifted and famous performers when they still wish to express their gifts, but have clashes as well as respect for their former performers.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|Okay, another reviewer has already pointed out that for the standard version, you can only download to AMazon, Vudu and Google Play.  Another comment claimed that the Blu Ray version for ten dollars more does allow an itunes download so you are PAYING for download options - it's not a free thing.<br /><br />Okay, I chose amazon instant video because I am a big fan of Amazon and the name Vudu scares me because it reminds me of the World of Warcraft trolls.  It works of course on the Amazon website, doesn't let me download to the pc that I can tell, plays on Roku if I close out the website on the laptop BUT even if it plays nowhere else, it will not play on the iPhone despite the Amazon Instant Video app which is the reason I was willing to choose Amazon over Vudu.<br /><br />The message on the iphone is:<br /><br />Playback Unavailable<br />Please connect to a Wi Fi network to play this title<br /><br />It's better to download it to your apple device if you have the NONREMOVABLE storage or to your laptop via this link which I learned of courtesy of Amazon's excellent customer service:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-7?ie=UTF8&nodeId=3773&qid=1380322802&sr=1-7<br /><br />but searching other articles, I learned that Amazon will only let you download a max of two owned movies per device/pc.  Oooh, that's worse than iTunes ....

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you've wondered why, or how, the gospels were conceived and written, then this book will answer many of those questions.  For me it clarified many puzzles about the time and life of Jesus, his disciples and the people of that period.  So many questions were answered I've read the book three times!

B00B7Y0206|1.0|The ads on this app are really annoying. I would pause it to try and see something clearer but as soon as you pause it, ads appear on top of the video. I used my free Amazon bucks to get rid of them and it was fine for awhile but now the app keeps crashing, it won't even open for me anymore. Something that got really annoying was that I couldn't figure out how to add a video to a playlist because there's no links around them. I didn't even think I could like the videos until it randomly popped up the last time I was able to open the app. So I just got rid of it, YouTube works better in Silk, I can actually share and add it to a playlist no problem. Would be nice to have my coins back.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|i love this show. my husband bought me this as a gift. there was absolutely nothing wrong with it when i received it. this is the best gift ever :)
B008M721MS|1.0|Skype might work on android phones and iphones but on the Kindle HD its a piece of garbage. Always has problems signing me in and it even fails to send me an email to reset my password when I request to do so. Im deleting this waste of space.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Its an amazing workout. Once you finish it you feel as though you were at the gym for hours. A definite must try!
B001675SOY|5.0|I bought this album only knowing the song Bed of Razors and man, now I wanna listen to every song on this every day. Every song is good. Wicked solos, thundering blast beats, it's just got everything. I would say out of all their albums so far, this is my favorite hands down.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A great deal for anyone who loves Magic and has quit the real life version because of lack of time and money. A god-send for those missed the game. for all those years.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found this book to be enormously educational. It Was a little bit tedious in parts but overall extremely well researched and written.
B00ELE8D4Q|1.0|If you like an album of electronic dance crap then this album is for you!  You should also buy Madonna's MDNA album to go with this one.er pitch sounds. Repetition is more important than full, rich sound. The first six songs on Closer To The Truth fit this category.<br /><br />The review<br />Initially, as the album progresses from the first to the second song, you could call it, I called to my partner to adjust the sound system. I thought that with the sophistication a modern sound system has, there must be a knob or adjustment to increase the fullness of sound, and it had to have been inadvertently bumped down. He called back from the other room, where the controls are, and said that no such knob exists. So I called to him to lower the treble and increase the base and mid-range. He made the adjustments and there was now, no sound to be heard. These first six songs made my sound system sound like a $20 K-Mart player, or an A M radio. In these first songs, even Cher avoids making the rich full tones that she, the rare contralto I suppose she is, can make.<br /><br />If you are one of the younger guys and love doing Molly on your party time, this first half, and several songs in the second half, of Closer To The Truth is for you! You may be too young to know it but I have heard all of these cheesy electronic sounds since before you were born. Mix them up and slow them down and they are still awful.<br /><br />I Walk Alone<br />If you have loved Cher for the fascinatingly rare range of vocal qualities unheard in any human, then there are just 2 songs for you on this album. If you would rather avoid the electronic and simplistic sounds of the first 6 songs then jump to number 7, I Walk Alone is a vocal ride through the Grand Canyon. Cher brings out all of her exquisite range, leaving out the higher pitched vocal quality that she uses in the first half of the album, a range which any female artist of today could do, and takes you on a river ride at a tongue twisting rate. In this song she is still 23, 33, or 43 years old. Cher approaches timelessness. It took me several plays through the album to realize the beauty of the song because the aggravation from the first half of the album contaminated my view of the 2 uniquely beautiful songs that come later, the other being I Hope You Find It. In I Walk Alone she brings human musicians into the recording studio and they pluck, blow, strum, and stroke and the result from all of them is thick scratchy ropes or feathery light strands of gold. The producer of this song understands that Cher's voice needs a heavy setting.<br /><br />I Hope You Find It<br />I almost missed it. After hearing about a 67 year old dancing so low on a dance floor or some of the other mind cringing lyrics of the first half of the CD, that I Hope You Find It almost couldn't break through the disappointment, and irritation frankly, that the previous songs had formed. Again real musicians pour out sound as they are the pastry chef of the song covering audible space with the highest quality molten Belgian chocolate sound if you will. As well, Cher leaves out the higher pitched part of her range and powers out her notes as if we are in glass boxes and she is exasperated and desperately trying to satisfy us in that we aren't hearing her loudly enough. If Cher can produce a song like this then I hope that science progresses to the state where Cher and I, as well as all of you, can continue this singer-listener relationship for another 1000 years.<br /><br />Favorite Scars<br />I guess it just sounds to me like a nursery rhyme. It's pretty simplistic in its cadence. The same goes with the music. My dad had absolutely no ability to tell good music from bad. If he could tap his foot to it he liked it. This song would be for dad.<br /><br />Sirens<br />Because so many fans liked this one I kept trying to find out why. At first it sounds like it is going for the ethereal mood but then the screeching guitar thing half way through disrupts the groove that the song set. And base jumping and hang gliding?<br /><br />Pride<br />Kinda like We Built This City. Its lyrics overreach and it makes me feel awkward for Cher.<br /><br />You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me<br />It seems like the words were there but no rhythm or melody of any enjoyable quality ever followed, no matter how hard everyone tried.<br /><br />There is no point<br />in my review of any of the other songs on Closer To The Truth because it would be a repeat of how little talent I feel is needed and used to produce electronic sound, except Red. I can't believe Warner Bros. agreed to work with Cher on this one. Red is like driving in a foreign country and having a semi on your ass periodically blowing its horn. What mindless human talked Cher into doing this one?<br /><br />And as a side note<br />Many celebrities who are curious or like to see other celebrities criticized, people in all ranks of the entertainment business, and people in general could read a 5 star review. There are countless reviewers babbling on about how great a performer is, more reviews than one may care to read. But everyone will jump to the 1 star reviews. This one didn't get lost.
B005PTYOTE|2.0|Mission: Impossible is an exciting action series based on the famous television program. The picture and audio quality are great in this release.

All of the previous special features have been ported over except the second disc of the Mission: Impossible 3 Blu-ray release (there is only an audio commentary provided).

B00007BKVC|5.0|The movie is in a perfect condition.  And the date when it arrived was exactly on the date you offered.  It was a good service and I am happy with it!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The visuals and overall design are on point. The acting is solid. Definitely better than many movies but the script keeps me from calling this a classic. The story starts strong but in the last act the story seems to lose some focus.
B000MMMT46|5.0|My absolute favorite album by my absolute favorite band!<br />I'm so glad to have found it on vinyl.<br />It arrived beautifully!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I've been an EJ fan since I was 9 or so (that was 1980).  He's one of the few artists that I've been consistently in love with, as in his music NEVER gets old.  Goodbye Yellow Brick Road has been on my top 3 favorite albums list now for many, many years (right up there with Dark Side of the Moon and Cat Stevens Tea for the Tillerman).  Anyway...  I really liked Songs from the West Coast when it came out, and to a lesser extent I also enjoyed Peachtree Road and The Captain and the Kid.  But after having purchased The Diving Board, I am absolutely AMAZED.  It's more more reminiscent of his earlier works.  It sounds as if he's exploring more, using more melodies and just rocking it in general.  It's just richer and more layered and more...musical.  So far my favorite tracks are Oscar Wilde Gets Out, A Town Called Jubilee, Voyeur, and Home Again.  Even Elton's voice sounds like it's aged and ripened, making the last 10 years or so seem like a sort of vocal growing pains.  It's not that I didn't like his vocals in the last decade, but after hearing The Diving Board, I'm left scratching my head and wondering how it's possible for him to sound any better.  He's still got it.  I really, really like this new album.  A lot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is totally addicting and I love that the screen is so much larger than my phone so I can see more pins! Must Have!
B007B5EDEG|4.0|A wonderful book with tastefully interwoven plot and surprises at each turns. Attention has been paid to ensure that no detail is missed and author has a way to bring life to reader's imagination. I for one, am waiting eagerly for the final two books!
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Solid album! Alan cut no corners on this. This is an album that demonstrates his talent and versatility. It is a must have for any Alan fan. He had said if was always a goal of his but it is evident that he didn't rush it in the name of selling albums.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a very entertaining and interesting series.  Love it!!!  I watched a few episodes of season one and was hooked.
1616550414|5.0|The pages of this book are filled with all the details of Hryule. Reading it transports me to the lovely land of my childhood. The book is quite large and impressive looking as well, more of a tome actually. I love being able to read about all the character development and why every action was taken in the development of the beautiful masterpieces that the games are. A true must have for any Zelda fan!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Graphics, animation are good and clear.  Can play against computer, which I prefer.  Also like option to play as either color.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Some have complained this release is not the same as the 50th anniversary concert.  It is still a very well produced video from the event with several surprises and a healthy dose of their biggest hits.  Best of all we get as close as possible today to the original Beach Boys that made the magic happen.  Having Brian Wilson at the keyboards adds a whole lot to the Beach Boys sound.<br /><br />The group is aging but with the help of an army of back-up musicians they provide the lush harmonies and complex sound for which the group is known.  The hotrod medley is fun starting with \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\" and closing with \\"I Get Around.\\"  The lush \\"All This Is That\\" was an unexpected delight. Only weaker moment is Mike Love's meek version of \\"Kokomo\\" -- the boys last hit.<br /><br />Overall this offers outstanding videography,lighting and sound.  Its production is equal to greatess of the band.  Considering the age of the original band, this turned out to be better than expected.  The legendary Beach Boys are a joy here.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Very good book and one of the most well written books I've ever read.  I loved this book and the previous book as well. I'm reading &#34;the Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest&#34; now.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|they are trying to hard to prove that this system works and the intro is very long. I bought the Kindle addition and it is kinda hard to navigate but all in all good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Getting all 5 books in one collection (and really cheap) was great.  These books really grab you right away and don't let go.  I bought the rest of the series before I finished this collection so there would be no downtime.  GREAT books!!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Best book I've read this year. James has quickly become one of my favorite writers - I'm glad I had a wtf moment and got it. Exactly what I needed to hear right now. I'm guessing I'll refer to this many times over the next couple of years- jammed packed w/ ideas....like WD40 for the brain!

B008AIGWVA|1.0|I thought this was one where you talk to the dog and it repeats what you say well it does not. this do sits on a chair and reads a paper or ansswer a phone and goes into a lab where you have him mix some stuff either he drinks it and he spits fire or smoke or it explodes in his face. nothing special. I wasted .99 cents on this one wish I could get my money back. don't waste your time or money not worth it.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This is not really my kind of a book, but it is educational and informative regarding inventions and the beginnings of technology.
B000OXHRRC|2.0|It was just ok.  Russell Crowe's hair in the film was so distractingly bad that I had a hard time focusing, lucky for me there wasn't really much I was missing.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A little too much costume description, but otherwise, it's a gripping read of an incredibly real medieval world that George RR Martin has created.  The book really fleshes out the story that the HBO series understandably had to condense onscreen.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Story about the power of love. Mixed with a little bit of fantasy and philosophy. My kind of movie :-)
0061992860|5.0|I got this and a ton of other things for my family Bug Out Emergency Bag, frankly I hope I never have to use any of these purchases but if an emergency happens I have them we will be prepared with useful and versatile items. For that piece of mind it's a great purchase
B0062O5UL2|5.0|I have this Pretenders first issue album in my archive of rare vinyl. Now I have the convenience of listening to it on my iPhone via the Amazon Cloud Player.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I loved this book, it deals with complex psychological issues and the mystery is fascinating.  The book is exciting throughout
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Quality product for a great price<br />- solid construction<br />- small and lightweight, for easy storage<br /><br />We used this item when we traveled and rented various cars. Worked very well all the time. Able to charge the phone while constantly using gps features.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved the book, it's full of adventure.  It tells a story of a women who is lost in life and then found
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|trying to keep track of what everything does is a bit much for me. Would not buy it, that's for sure.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I wish I had started watching this in the beginning. So glad I can do it now on Amazon Prime.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Loved this movie....The concept sounded silly to me but it was well done, the acting was fantastic and I really loved it....
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We purchased the Rainforest Jumperoo for our first son and he LOVED it!  Unfortunately, during a move, the movers lost the main plastic ring that the seat and toys fit into, and hangs from the springs.  It is not a piece that Fisher-Price offers for replacement, so we had to purchase a whole new Jumperoo when our second son arrived.  He is 5m old and LOVES it!  He is above the 99% in height and weight, so he fits perfectly and will have many months of entertainment.  I like that it gives him a place to play that isn't laying down or sitting at an incline.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Just your average movie, just seems like they gutted the star trek theme to me, replacing it a lot of action scenes (terminator) and little dialogue that the other Star Trek movies and shows seemed to capture so easily. I guess all good things to come to an end.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|I fell in love with this series straight away. It was hot, action packed.. everything you want in a romance book.<br />The only thing that annoyed me was the past histories (don't want to spoil anything for those that haven't read but you will get what I mean).. not sure why all these kinds of stories always make their characters flawed in these ways.<br />Still, even with that, I highly recommend this serious!
B00F3HQMV6|5.0|back to the krewella we all came to love. there is a different variety of beats that make you appreciate them as an artist
B002FQOI0A|4.0|It was a little bit weird but it was really good and I think everyone should read it and I recommend the hunger games also.
B00915G6MG|1.0|the region code for the dvd's was still on USA while i live in europe.<br />the side did not tell anything about this.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|IT IS A AMAZING BOOK WITH A LOT OF GREAT SEENS I RECXOMEND THIS BOOK FROM AGES 11-15 it is really good
B00DM11LV6|4.0|With a little editing to re-centre on the main story, and perhaps a bit more background on the two lead characters, this could have been a very fine film indeed.  As it was, the chemistry between the two lovers was so perfect, and although some of the side-plots could have been reduced or eliminated for clarity, and a couple of implausibilities explained or done away with, the film was riveting, anyway.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it brings joy and entertainment to my heart and its fun and its better than all the running games I'll say!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I fell absolutely in love with Auggie, the main character in this book. He is sensible, insightful, and exceptional. This book offers a really wonderful window into the world of a middle school child, particularly one who is facing a unique challenge such as Auggie's. I also loved hearing from other characters in the middle of the book. These chapters were a reminder that, not only is there always another perspective on any given event, but that each person has unique vulnerabilities and challenges that they face and that most of the time, everyone is just trying to do the best they can at navigating their world (especially kids in school). As a mom and an educator, I enjoyed this book tremendously.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|hyde is great to put on the back of a horse as a saddle and a rug in your house.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|A personal favorite. The actors actually took me back to my youth and revived all of those feeling, you have when you're young, of trying so hard not to show your cards and letting someone know that you love them. Sigh!
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|A good start to the small screen version of the Marvel Movie-verse! If the characters introduced here in the pilot are explored fully the first season should be a solid foundation for a long run.<br /><br />Bringing out little details and hints about the histories of each character has piqued my interest as Whedon often does. I'll be watching next week for sure!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|If you are a Jane Austen fan. Elizabeth Darcy has no charm in a serious novel and Darcy shows himself to be the stick in the mud bore he hinted at in P&P. Wickham is back, accused of murder, but of course he can't be guilty. That would be too hard on the Bennetts, to think they had a murderer in the family. Still, he is only a little better than a killer, still causing trouble, lying, cheating etc.<br />The first part of the book takes far too long to review the plot lines that brought all of the various couples together. Anyone who read P&P already knows all that by heart and anyone who didn't read it, wouldn't be interested in this book anyway.<br />Elizabeth Bennett has become a boring do-gooder, thinking of nothing but charity for her neighbors, her own children and books to improve her mind. She would have been more fun as a spinster than married to Mr. Darcy.
B009LNI0T0|5.0|I agree with the pair of reviewers who preceded me here. This is a truly superb collection of Haydn symphonies -- sadly, not complete because the recording project was never finished. What is here, though, is magnificently played in original instrument style. The accomplishment is not unlike these same forces' traversal of the Mozart symphonies. The period instrumentation works quite fine for the earlier installments, as one might expect, but the heft is there for the later symphonies as well. If you're aiming for a complete run of Haydn's compositions in this form, then obviously this set doesn't qualify, but if you want a magnificent partial set and then fill in the gaps with other orchestra/conductor pairings, then have at it. This collection does not disappoint, period.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This book grabbed my attention right from the first chapters. I read this book in record time, this book was perfect for my reading style. Can not wait to see if Daniel Suarez writes more books to continue on this story line.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|It is a good flick.  The look and feel of the effects reminded me of &#34;Inception&#34; or &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34;. A bit dark in look, but you could watch this one with the kids probably.  The story is interesting, a little hard to follow but romantic.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|It's hard to know why Planet Waves was/is so underrated because the more I listen to it, the better is sounds, and I've always liked it.  It didn't just dawn on me that, \\"wow, this is a great album\\".<br /><br />\\"Never Say Goodbye\\" has become one of my favorite songs. Bob Dylan's body of work might never be equaled on this Planet.  It's like living during the life time of Shakespeare.  It's very lucky.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This is a great show!!! Love the story.  Love watching Charlie Hunman play Jax.  This show is a must watch!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I was not happy with the changes made for the movie for the first book and the second seemed to start pretty slowly and I needed to forget the movie to enjoy the book again. That being said, I enjoyed Darkness and look forward to the next book.
031623480X|5.0|Once in a while, a groundbreaking book is published by the right author at the right time. \\"Grain Brain,\\" by Dr. David Perlmutter, is such a book. It is a game changer. And in just over a week since publication, its message already is resonating with a significant audience. The New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly have all just listed it on their bestsellers list.<br /><br />Though similar books have been written about the effects of gluten and carbohydrates on the health of the GI tract, this is the first one that examines their effect on our brain. \\"Grain Brain\\" is not just for people who have gluten sensitivities or allergies. It is for everyone.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter is a renowned board certified neurologist, whose practice is in Naples, Florida. He is also a  visionary. I know him personally and am aware of his deep commitment to his patients, to functional medicine, and to sharing this particular story with the world. Dr. Perlmutter passionately believes in the power of food as medicine and wants to make sure that everyone is aware of how to achieve optimum health and avoid debilitating degenerative diseases.<br /><br />In Part I of \\"Grain Brain,\\" Dr. Perlmutter has gathered the results of years of experience in his field, supported with annotations to numerous credible publications (books and scientific journals). There are seventeen pages of over 250 footnotes to support the case he makes for shifting our diet away from too many carbohydrates (especially those high in sugar and gluten) toward a diet that is much more like that of our ancestors (more protein and good fat). In Part II, he examines habits and lifestyle, and suggests simple positive changes.<br /><br />Part III contains the user friendly map of how to \\"Say Goodbye to Grain Brain.\\" This section boasts a four week plan that is clear, staged in steps, and accessible to all. It also includes delicious recipes.<br /><br />I shifted to the recommended diet a few years ago, after reading \\"Power Up Your Brain\\" - Dr. Perlmutter's previous book. What I know to be true for me is that when I follow Dr. Perlmutter's protocol, I sleep better, feel better, think better, have more energy, and lose weight without effort.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|J'ADOOOOOORE cet album!!! Magnifique. ...ou formidable ;) I've always listened to Stromae but this album is theee best. Everyone should get it
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|So long as they keep making them, I plan to keep seeing them. Richard B. Riddick is a no-holds-barred character in a brutal universe and I just can't seem to get enough. The mythology is there, the violence is plentiful and the action always satisfies. So did RIDDICK deliver? Yes, yes and hell yes. The wife and I went to see this together in the theater and we both got what we were looking for. I got ultra-violence and cool mercs and monsters and she got Vin Diesel...flexing.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled by the last entry but DARK FURY and PITCH BLACK were both solid. This is Riddick doing what Riddick does best and it definitely outshines CHRONICLES. I plan to grab this once they release a mega-set containing all four films. Check it out and leave your brain at the door.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My granddaughter loves her Disney Princess Peel & Stick Wall decals with Gems ! They really added to her bedroom with everything Princess it looks great ! And my order came so fast its nice to have such great sellers on amazon ! thank you !
B00DPUB59W|4.0|I was initially hesitant to watch this but I finally gave it a shot and I'm glad I did as I've found a new film to add to my collection. Jordan's BYZANTIUM is the melancholic tale of two vampires trying to eke out an existence while doing their best to hide their true nature from the mortal world. Comparisons to INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE are sure to turn some off but the imagery in this film is far more breathtaking, and the mythology far more riveting than what Jordan was able to accomplish with INTERVIEW. That's not to say it's a better film, I just feel it offered me a bit more.<br /><br />If you're looking for action or teen romance, this isn't going to be for you. BYZANTIUM takes its time telling a story and it's a bit grittier, a whole lot more tragic and unconventional than modern vampire fare. It's closer in atmosphere and style to LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, MIDNIGHT SON and THE WISDOM OF CROCODILES.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Its so nice to watch something without swearing and nudity ! And a great story line to boot. I love watching lark rise to candleford on my amazon its great to be able to turn it on when ever I want to watch !
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey during season 3 and enjoyed it so much that I bought all 3 DVD's.  I am really looking forward to season 4 this Fall. I seldom record any programs in case I miss them, but Downton Abbey is the exception!  The cast is excellent and there are several story lines going on so one is never bored.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great Series.  Could not stop watching.  Acting was very realistic.  Unsure about how much poetic license was taken.  However very graphic so would not recommend for younger audiences.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I had been led to believe that there was something wrong with this film, given its undeserved reputation as a financial flop that had necessitated expensive reshoots to bring it up from and &#34;F&#34; to a &#34;D&#34;. However, after reading &#34;John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood&#34;, I was fascinated by the story of this film, and how the only flop was in the marketing of it. The film itself was done well from start to finish, and I'm glad I read &#34;Gods of Hollywood&#34; and supported this film with my purchase.
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|My boyfriend got me hooked on Simon's Cat's YouTube videos and i had to purchase this cartoon. I will be purchasing the other books.
1402270275|5.0|4/5 stars!<br /><br />The author definitely knows how to capture the reader with imaginative adventure packed with action, danger and an element of Gothic suspense. The set up of the story was in Victorian Era blended well with historical, paranormal and steam-punk features. The male lead Blade is a true blood leader of the rookeries, with his other companions protecting the city of London, but he was cast aside and doomed for the horrific crimes he committed and everyone fears him. I was intrigued by his character and the more a read the more my curiosity grew to know him better and he did not disappoint me. Blade is ruthless, dark and dangerous, but under that gruff exterior lays a man with tortured soul in desperate need of love and acceptance of who he is and the heroin Honoria unleashed his darkest cravings for blood but also exposed his tender side the one that he could not believe to have. Honoria was very smart and strong-willed and new the consequences for asking Blade for protection that she would have to pay. She was brave and would not hesitate to protect her loved ones...I liked that ear of innocence in her and Blade could not have missed that too, so it was delightful to watch his inner tremors of wanting to claim Honoria for himself and at the same time being scared his own needs... I like their chemistry together and slow building of feelings...especially Hooria was more resistant to Blade charms and at time her stubbornness got to my nerves but it did not deterred from enjoying the reading. I wish the author could have made Honoria more attractive, as there was too much emphasis on her skinniness and compare to Blade's masculinity, they did not complement each other at times..but that is my personal preference..it may not be an issue for others. Suffice to say, the author showed their love was believable and i rooted for them to have their happiness and I wanted so much for Blade to accept his inner beast even if that beast murdered his own sister....under the horrific tortures he was forced to take and the guilt that followed him like a shadow.<br /><br />The final battle was just freaking awesome and the intensity kept me on edge and I was caching my breath because Blade was strikingly good with his battle skills and furious with his beast to unleash his vengeance on his long time enemy Vickers that led to his sister's death and who he have become. Barrons was another character..I enjoyed reading..he was so complex that you never new on which side he would be the good or the bad...we later learned that he was Hooria's brother and I want him to have his own story too!
3836501899|4.0|I just received my copy of the Taschen 25th Anniversary Edition Polaroid Book and I do love it but I was surprised at the level of nudity throughout it.  At one point you can't go two pages without some woman being completely nude. and I get that it's \\"for the sake of art\\" but why are there no nude men in the book if that is the case?  It just seems a little bit biased to the female form and a little too exposing.  What happened to the powers of subtlety and suggestion, something I would be more in favor of in the long run?  So buyers beware: if you're looking for a little peepshow along with some great art then this is your book, but if you've got kids in the house, then think twice about having this lying around.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a good book has a few twists and turns that keep you turning the pages. I recommend it.
B005PK553C|5.0|I totally missed this on TV, and am so glad I did.  I'm watching it on Amazon and can never stop at just one episode. I'd hate to have to wait a whole week for the next installment. It's in soap-opera format (plot continued from week to week). There are a lot of twists and mysteries, so if you decide to watch, give it a chance and don't stop after the first episode.  You'll get the hang of the plot after the third episode, then it's hard to quit.  There are enough reviews by now with plot spoilers, so I'll just say this show is like none I've watched before.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love this game! The graphics are good; much better than some others out there. The coveted gems can be earned through colosseum events, races or gifting from friends so you don't have to spend money. I like how new dragons are regularly added and I enjoy the thrill of wondering what dragon will be bred from the combo I've chosen. Definitely addicting and challenging enough to keep checking back in to collect money, rearrange island layouts, compete in races, save up for habitats or shrines, etc. This is my favorite and most-used game app on my Kindle Fire.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I enjoyed the book thoroughly and will read it again and again. The added German in it is great. I learned several new words
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Great, Drake has done it again, I love this artist,  every CD has met my expectations,  Nothing Was The Same was no different.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|Fitting summation of trilogy, but not as wonderfully innovative as first two in series. Genetics, controlled by corporations, is the science most likely to shape our  futures
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Bought sums it up.  Free is good.  Big numbers, really big numbers.  For those of us unable to add, subtract, multiply or divide, it was a marvel.  Magic!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Hearing this record took me by surprise, as I did not expect to be moved by a Soundgarden record in 2013. This is a HEAVY record...I mean that in the best sense of the word and its implications. The music is harmonically, melodically and rhythmically dense, filled with urgency and powerfully performed. The mix is very warm and the arrangements are tight. WOW!!! The songs are really great too. Most surprising, in my opinion, is that Chris Cornell sounds even better than he did in '90s...Although I liked them more than the other Seattle bands of the 90's (Chris Cornell is without equal amongst the \\"grunge\\" era vocalists),  I admittedly was never a huge fan of the band. I will likely revisit their backcatalog with fresh ears after hearing this record. However, I do suspect that I will still find this to be their brightest moment.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fast paced and tons of fun. I enjoy this game. A good time waster that makes you think a little. Reminds me of the Windows game from awhile back. You won't regret investing 99 cents on this one.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I highly anticipated the release of Stephen Kings' latest novel, \\"Doctor Sleep\\".  After finishing it, I came to a sad conclusion.<br /><br />I have read every King novel (with the exception of the last few of the \\"Dark Tower\\" series.  I gave up on those 10+ years ago).  I've always been a tremendous fan, and have never minded telling anyone so.<br /><br />When reading his books, it has always felt as if I was listening to a close friend tell a story.  The words flowed, the descriptions were clear, the dialog realistic, and the storyline usually believable.  The characters always came to life in my mind, and stayed with me long after the books' ending.<br /><br />With this book, and if I'm going to be honest, many of his more recent writings (except 11/22/63), I felt let down.  I believe the \\"master of horror\\" no longer has the magic touch.  Gone are the days when I would sit down with any new King novel, and read it straight through until the very end.  This particular book took me many days, and at times, I felt I had to force myself to get through it.<br /><br />Much of the descriptions weren't coherent (or were exceedingly, unnecessarily long), the dialog jerky and lame, and the characters not well-defined or worth caring about (not even drunk-but-doing-better Dan).  I hated his unimaginative excessive use of \\"hip\\" topics... 9/11, Amy Winehouse, Michael Jackson, The Hobbit, and Harry Potter.  Useless.<br /><br />The \\"bad guy\\" characters all have a special \\"talent\\" for finding, putting to sleep, and otherwise tricking the \\"shining\\" humans/rubes they're after for their \\"steam\\".  And they're gazillionaires - how convenient is that?  It's totally unbelievable.<br /><br />And the fact that this story is supposed to be a sequel to \\"The Shining\\", to me, seemed to be just an easy way to write a book without really having to work for it.<br /><br />The worst part - at least I would think King would have to agree - is that at no point in the entire book was I in the least bit horrified, scared, or spooked.  That's the gist of his genre, isn't it?<br /><br />I've spent 30+ years reading Mr. King, and have always believed that one should not criticize anyone without on spending a little time in their shoes.  Well, SOME times, I think it's kinder to let someone know that they're no longer running on all cylinders, and should give their work (or word processor) a rest.<br /><br />I for one will not be reading any more of his stuff... and that makes me terribly sad.  But reading should not be a painful struggle, but enjoyable and invigorating to the imagination, and a pleasant past-time.<br /><br />I know this book will sell boatloads, just on Kings' name alone.  That's all well and good.  I just hope that this doesn't get adapted into a television movie.bit horrified, scared, or spooked.

B000MV9026|3.0|This was supposed to be a Birthday Gift.  I've heard it is a great movie, but the provider did not ship it in a timely manner causing me to return the item.  Never was able to watch the movie.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|What a disappointment after reading Kite Runner.  I found this story for the most part boring and uninteresting and forced myself to finish it because of the author.  I can't really pick one part of the story that stands out because it was boring throughout and I really pushed through each part just to end it.
B00AX6KNOY|3.0|ok not the best. Too predictable. Hokey story and the acting lacked any depth. I hoped for more from this.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I love this song Pharrell always do it with his songs. This one song  is how I fill all the time. All because GOD & The Blessed Man he put in my life. Keep it up. You are Blessed. &#60;3 &#60;3  GOD Bless. ::) :)
B000FC10H0|4.0|The information is clear and concise.  Some of the examples are a little dated but overall the advise is great.  I have taken all of what I learned an implemented it into my own branding of an independent event planning business.  I highly recommend this book!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is an awesome game.  There are lots of characters to play as.  Another thing is that you can be on the &quot;Pork Side&quot;!  I love all the unique powers.  This is the first Angry Birds game that I`'ve purchased (although my family plays it often) and I think it is great.  Its interesting shooting pigs at birds too.
0399159347|5.0|Another reviewer wrote that they loved the Epilogue. After getting to the epilogue myself, I can understand the reason.  The story concerning separate lives of three different women, all entwined in a stunning way, made this book an absolute page turner.  I could not wait to find out what happened to their marriages and their families.  But, the epilogue was such an eye opener for me. Funny I say eye opener, because at times I felt like my eyes were bulging out in anticipation of what was coming next!  What consequences we could face when making certain choices, and the \\"what if's\\" were so thought-provoking that it seriously made me wonder about the choices I've made, or will make in the future.  I found the author to be witty in just the right parts of the story, heartbreaking in other areas, and whatever emotions you can think of are right there on these pages.  I felt as though I knew each character and felt their pain, heartache, and at times, happiness. I hope you will purchase this highly readable book and enjoy Tess, Cecilia and Rachel as much as I did!
B0090QL748|5.0|A little clunky but a lot of possibilities. I haven't found axeay to do text with it so using in conjunction with another app. Still like it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Captured me from beginning to end.  Put off reading the last hundred pages, because I didn't want it to end!
B005HSL626|5.0|My girls love to play this game on my phone. They enjoy it and it is a lot of fun for them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love her books! Amy is crazy smart! Very calculating. Sometimes, being too smart can be very dangerous! Do not get on her list....it might just cost you your freedom!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Her Greatest Hits is an awesome CD. I saw her in concert and she is actually fantastic live! You won't be disappointed in this purchase! She is so talented and I look forward to hearing new tunes from her soon.
B003G4W49C|5.0|From the beginning, it kept me hooked all the way until the end.  Would highly recommend it.  Many thought provoking aspects to it.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|It is a scary and fun movie. Not as fun as the original version but it still has a great sense of humor with some really scary moments. Colin Farrell is great as a vampire and Anton Yelchin as Charley makes a believable hero. The supporting cast is good with David Tennant funny and complex as Peter Vincent. Toni Collette and Imogen Poots are great as the Mom and girlfriend, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is very funny as Ed, Charley's nerdy former friend who puts him on to the reality that Charley's neighbor is a vampire.
B00915G6MG|5.0|For my money this is the best series EVER.  I hope it goes on forever....and ever....and ever.  Terrific writing and great humor.
B009CG9YEQ|5.0|Love this movie. Has great references for everyday situations to lighten up a conversation. Bought in HD digital to watch anywhere. :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I truly enjoyed this story.  If you are looking for a fairly quick read that packs some surprises and at times pulls at your heart strings, this is the story for you.  Happy reading!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great way to kill time. However it is very addictive.  I feel like I am always needing to check on the progress of what I am building.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really like these newer Star Trek movies. They picked a great cast. For the villain in this one they pick none other then Benedict Cumberbatch. He is cast as Sherlock Holmes in the British show Sherlock. Great actor. This one won me over. I saw it in the theater and had to buy it. Get it! You will enjoy it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book intertwined several families and how their lives intersected in Afghanistan around the war.  Characters are real, interesting and ordinary in their lives.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|Can I just say Iron Man Rocks. I really thought after Avengers that this movie couldn't keep up with whats already been done. Needless to say, I was wrong. I loved this movie. I think I like it better the the first two. Don't get me wrong they are all great, but I just enjoyed the way Tony was portrayed in this one much better. Buy it! Well worth it.

B00BEIYP1W|4.0|Most racing or car related films pale in comparison to the \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" franchise. While the series is improving with each installment, it's also a massive hit at the box office. Discovering a racing film that isn't an overflowing garbage heap seems like a victory in itself with this year's \\"Getaway\\" failing to shake that impression. While there isn't really a Formula One racing film to compare to Ron Howard's \\"Rush\\" (unless the Sylvester Stallone starring \\"Driven\\" from 2001 counts), the Nascar themed \\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\\" came to mind with Jackie Chan's \\"Thunderbolt\\" coming in a close second. Remarkably enough, \\"Rush\\" shakes off whatever misconceptions you may have about the film going into it and may be one of 2013's most entertaining films.<br /><br />\\"Rush\\" is based on the true story of the relentless rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) between 1970 and 1976. You witness the two very different stories of how the two became pro race car drivers with Hunt slowly building his way up and earning the respect of others despite his reckless ways and Lauda doing everything himself, paying his way into the field, and quickly developing a reputation as an extremely headstrong loner.<br /><br />The most unexpected element of \\"Rush\\" is how genuine the relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda becomes. What begins as a rivalry slowly evolves into what feels like a friendship that is filled with mutual respect for one another. Even when they're trash talking one another, you can sense that everything they say and do to each other only loads another clip in the ammunition that represents their passion and desire to win.<br /><br />The first-class cinematography will easily ignite the adrenaline rush in you, as well. The camera always seems to be just in the right place at the right time to make you feel like you're sitting in the car along with these drivers feeling the roar of the engine and racing around death-defying turns; seeing the drivers shift gears, close-ups of screaming engines at the start of the race, the perspective of someone being right on the tail of the leader through their side mirror, and pistons pumping like there's no tomorrow only fuel your desire to see more. You even seem to have low-visibility just like the drivers when it's raining on the race track. These are some of the best racing sequences to be filmed in quite some time.<br /><br />Formula One drivers are as famous as rock stars in \\"Rush.\\" There are always countless fans waiting for an autograph outside of public places, constant press, loads of money to be made, and an endless line of women waiting to sleep with a man who gets behind the wheel and drives in circles at 170 mph. Maybe being born 10-15 years after the fact factors into it, but it becomes a bit difficult to believe that drivers were basically porn stars that women lusted over and threw themselves at as if the drivers were members of The Beatles. While the film's early moments are intriguing, at its core the first 30 or so minutes are nothing more than a pissing contest between two stubborn men acting like children and it becomes a little tiresome until they reach the pro circuit. Then there's Olivia Wilde who proves once again that she's the queen of taking minor roles in bigger films that don't really go anywhere.<br /><br />\\"Rush\\" will reel you in with its heart pounding and breathtaking racing sequences, but the biographical action film will win you over with its compassion. Absolutely exhilarating, amusing, and passionate to the very end, \\"Rush\\" is a film that has no right to be as good as it is.f the engine and racing around death-defying turns; seeing the drivers shift gears, close-ups of screaming engines at the start of the race, the perspective of someone being right on the tail of the leader through their side mirror, and pistons pumping like there's no tomorrow only fuel your desire to see more.

B00992CF6W|5.0|At school everyone was telling me all about minecraft. But I was stuck firm that block story was better(it was until it got all the new updates and just crashed). So I got it and tried it at first I didn't understand it but my friend told me how and its just gotten better. I strongly suggest this game ,but it's better on the PC computer version.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|A seriously flawed protagonist, a story set in Australia where Harry Hole, a Norwegian detective, is sent to investigate the killing of a Norwegian citizen. The story drags a bit in places, but it's a good read overall.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|Not a bad story - I'd rate it as one of the better ones in the series. Harry Hole is still a protagonist with some serious flaws, but he's either a brilliant or a very lucky detective. Like all the Harry Hole novels, this one drags in places. but it's still worth a read.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Another series that I just absolutely love. The characters were easy to get to know and love right away. I feel all the ups and downs right along with them, So happy there are many more seasons to watch.

Amazing clarity while watching YouTube and Netflix.<br /><br />You can enable chrome cast and play it with your Iphone, computer or ipad, and still keep working simultaneously with the device with which you played.<br /><br />If you watch YouTube and Netflix most of the time like we do then its a must buy.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I came late to this series, after reading two other series by this author.  Content and style improved, until this book.<br /><br />This book reads like some of her early works.  The characters are superficial within their personalities and relationships.  The scenes are rushed.<br /><br />Ms. Harris has previously said she writes for herself and not the fans, but she would have been better off not writing this book as it is clearly written as I must fulfill my contract, am tired of these characters, and wish it was over.<br /><br />Her credibility as a talented author is damaged.[[ASIN:193700788X Dead Ever After: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)]]

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series, even though I don't tend to read this type of genre. The ending seemed to be somewhat predictable but left off some unanswered questions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is totally captivating. The writing and character development are such that you can watch all the episodes back to back without realizing that an entire day has passed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It deserves even more awards! It draws you into that life style and time. Hope the show continues for a long time to come.
B007G92QGO|5.0|This is the FIRST book I have felt moved to write a review for other than to say it was enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is well written and held my interest until the very end. The characters are totally believable as are the events surrounding them.  I was kept guessing all the way through about Jacob's guilt or innocence and I feel the author has really grasped an understanding of (like) teen speak.  I can highly recommend this book.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie is entertaining, but it should have been called \\"The Luckiest Guy Ever.\\" At least then, I wouldn't have rolled my eyes during quite a few parts.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|this is a great book.it is definitely worthy of a Hugo Award.I have nothing else to say, but Amazon requires at least 20 words so here are a few more words.

B005D63ICI|3.0|Its not my favorite season of Dexter by any means but it is still good. It keeps you interested. It is just a little slower than other seasons.
B005SZARKK|3.0|I was interested when I first saw the trailer for the program on Amazon Instant Video; however, I am disappointed in the anti-conservative rhetoric. Hollywood used to be a fairly balanced environment, neither too conservative or too liberal, but today's programing appears to be slighted to one side of the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat!<br /><br />As a lifelong Conservative I find this lack of even-handedness absolutely troubling. I worked my entire life and watched my 9th grade educated mother build a business from scratch. While working for one of the oldest Private Banks in the world I was mentored by a conservative man, in his nineties, who taught me that honesty with ones clients was worth more than quick financial gains and personal charity was much more rewarding than government hand outs.<br /><br />While I dislike the political lecturing and labeling of conservatives as all bad, I do enjoy the program and lo-cal and shall allow myself a little more time to enjoy it.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|SO wonderful! Possibly my favorite show ever!!  Its incredibly funny!  Has great life lessons in it as well! WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Don't waste your time.  This is chick flick, none looks realistic, just garbage overall.  Wasted my money and time.  Too much cheese, just all around nonsense.  He ruined his actor career with this crap.

B00D48BSBA|5.0|I thought Mr. Forsyth quit. But he's returned with my kind of story of terrorists vs some organization. As always I had to be patient for some time until I knew what's going on, like in the labyrinth of Forsyth. And once I got his intention / remembered his way, great fun I had. Especially I love the Pathfinders.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is just a wonderful series! I wish there was more shows like this one on TV its one of the only shows I can watch that I don't think REALLY?! (At least in a bad way... somethings Sheldon does I think that but its in a complete comic wonderful way! lol)
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|HOMELAND is an amazingly well-written show with a dream cast. All of the pieces fit together in keeping this political drama moving in surprising directions. The writers have kept the momentum in Season 2 as alliances and motives shift. The writing is crisp and fresh and stimulates the viewer with a story that delves deep into political, social and moral issues. Here is a show that excels in being well-written, absorbing and intriguing.<br /><br />Season One left CIA agent Carrie Mathison's life shattered. There could have been no better choice to play Mathison than the lovely Clair Danes. Confident Mathison with a remarkable \\"gut\\" instinct fell into the depths of dispair in Season One.  Her career and confidence were gone.  This hotshot agent became a shell of her former self as she began to question the truth behind rescued hostage Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) and his ties to his former captor the terrorist Abu Nazir.<br /><br />In Season 2, Brody is a congressman fast on his way to becoming a major force in politics. He becomes top choice as the Vice-Presidential candidate when the current VP runs for the Presidency. Brody seems to have it all as he tries to mend the rift with his wife and children. Mathison's life was destroyed in Season One when her theory that Brody had been \\"turned\\" by Abu-Nazir was \\"proven\\" wrong--though the viewer knew all along she was correct with her idea.<br />Season Two does not disappoint in its revelations that Mathison's instincts were not wrong. She is on the road to recovery and teaches English as a Second Language when the CIA comes calling.  Although it is not clear how she returns to the CIA, somehow she again becomes a major force in the agency. Let the intrigue continue.<br /><br />HOMELAND keeps us wondering as characters, especially Brody, seem to change alliances and beliefs. How would someone return to their former life after years in captivity? How do \\"good\\" people become twisted with hate and revenge? There are some fascinated character studies here as new players are introduced this season. Zuleikha Robinson is outstanding as the Palestinian and British-educated journalist Roya Hammad. Hammad is beautiful and thoroughly wicked and devious with contacts in high levels of government. She becomes Brody's mysterious handler and connection to Abu Nazir. Hammad's sinister nature proves that evil can come in any form. Robinson brings depth and substance to the misguided Hammad.<br /><br />Each episode only gets deeper and deeper into the minds of Brody and Mathison who re-ignite their volatile relationship as Brody's family life deteriorates beyond repair. There is a fascinating journey with a moral tinge. Who can be trusted and what is anyone's true intention? Even the \\"good\\" guys can be bad. Danes gives Carrie Mathison an edge that becomes more and more disturbed as she questions Brody's intentions. Her confused doe-eyed gaze that hovers between madness and sanity say more than any words could.<br /><br />I'm hooked and can't wait for Season 3 on DVD. One disappointing note to mention are the bland and sparse \\"extras\\" that are included in this DVD set. Damien Lewis's Super 8 Movies-yes, he apparently still has an ancient Super 8 camera-does have some fun behind-the-scenes footage featuring cast and crew. Unfortunately, the extras are limited and give very little insight into the filming and visual effects and storyline.<br /><br />HOMELAND is a fascinating exploration of life in the modern age of terrorism and political unrest. The writers are abreast of current events and the show has a force of reality that is rare on TV.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|SH Figuarts DBZ figures are amazing.  Tons of articulation and detail.  Plenty of interchangeable parts to re-enact your favorite scenes.  One problem with this figure is that the hair is the yellow color from the Cell Saga so it seems odd.  The SDCC version has better coloring imo
1592402038|5.0|I would recommend this book to older and adults looking for an informative yet entertaining read about grammar. The novel explains the complexities about grammar while giving insightful guidelines to writing. Unfortunately this subject tends to become repetitive, but do not fear! Lynne Truss' presentation is short and to the point. Lastly, Truss includes fun interludes that make the reading amusing. I really enjoyed reading this novel and I award it five stars!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the love story behind all of the &#34;enticing, juicy parts&#34;.  It's really a great love story jazzed up with spice!
B00CATONCA|5.0|The heads are very detailed and the tank had a very clean and nice design. Looking forward to season 4 limited edition!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It has action, adventure and comedy all at once. Loved Benedict Cumberbatch as the villian!
B00001NTXN|5.0|I love this strategy game. The rules are easy to learn but one has to be very good in designing strategy with one's own wooden fences and movement of pieces. To date, i only played with one person. I wish I could have 4 players including myself but I like the gist of this game. While the rules are easy to learn the movement plan is very strategic. You have to be able to block your opponent from moving into your territory by predicting moves. It is easy to learn but allows for your own strategy creation. It is not too easy. Definitely get this game!!!!!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Great acting as usual.  Good story line and entertaining.  I hope the writers can keep this 'fresh' without becoming 'stupid' and 'unbelievable'.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I went back to the other ap I was using.  I didn't really like it, so I'm not currently using it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I've never been a fan of child protagonists.  I don't like children.  Gaiman is a great author, the story is cool, original, kinda twisted in his usual way...but the book is rated G.  Not the violence, language, adult situations you'd expect from the guy who gave us American Gods.<br />Still, its a good, unique story.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|no need for me to comment more, all the prizes this series have been receiving say all.<br />The crew are talented, they use songs flexibly and match the situations in the film, the way they combine all and new songs is wonderful.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Got time to kill and looking for something to do?  This works.  Waiting for a plane?  In the bathroom? etc.  Its cute.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables causes tempers to flare and spirits to sore. Some people hate this version, others love it. Many times, the opinion simply depends on what edition of Les Miserables one is used to. I must say that I find the 25th Anniversary Concert to be one of the best renditions of Les Miserables to be found. Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are stunning in the roles of Jean Valjean and Javert. Their voices are powerful, huge, and fit the score magnificently. While the concert is certainly not perfect, it is still an incredible production and well-worth watching.<br /><br />Naturally this question will arise; is it better than the 10th anniversary?<br /><br />Since comparisons are constantly made between the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts, I'm going to get this out of the way immediately. There is ne definite answer to this question; it is entirely a matter of taste or what one is used to. Even if one loves the 10th anniversary, however, there is absolutely no reason not to immerse oneself in another high quality production of Les Miserables.<br /><br />Now that that is out of the way...<br /><br />One of the most remarkable aspects of this production is Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean and Norm Lewis as Javert. Boe is an opera singer, and is spectacular in the role. His vocals are particular noticeable during Valjean's soliloquies in Act One, where he reaches very high notes while retaining vocal depth. However, it is not simply Boe's singing voice that makes him perfect for the part. His eyes radiate kindness and warmth and he is a absolute pleasure to watch. Norm Lewis, as Javert, also has an incredibly powerful voice. His Javert has an attitude of power, and his rendition of \\"Stars\\" is one of the best ever. They both are easily five-stars.<br /><br />Needless to say, Les Miserables is full of other famous characters, most of them being admirably played here. For anyone with an interest in musical theatre, there are a number of recognizablefaces here. Lea Salonga, who played Éponine in the 10th anniversary, appears in this production as Fantine. Jenny Galloway once again plays Madame Thénardier, (she appeared in the same role in the 10th anniversary). Also in the cast is Ramin Karimloo (perhaps best known for The Phantom of the Opera) as Enjolras, Nick Jonas as Marius and Samantha Barks as Éponine<br /><br />Most of the supporting cast is incredibly good. Their energy is high and their voices powerful. It is with Nick Jonas that there is the most serious problem. Jonas' voice lacks power, often sounding nasally; he is undoubtedly the worst of the cast. Despite this, the cast is quite good overall.<br /><br />While different from the 10th anniversary, the 25th is a worthy version of Les Miserables. I highly recommend it!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game for those who like lots of action and also want shorter quests so they can start/stop play frequently. Also good tablet controls.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It kept me interested all the way through.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of closure in the end.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|It was a good story. Kept my attention....good acting. Matthew did an excellent job of keeping the story believeable. Yes, it was exciting. Hope it becomes a Series
B002QS5OQ4|2.0|SPOILERS: Maybe because I just started watching it, I was laughing at the cliched aliens in the stomach thing.... Thought the humans blocking off the stargate was cool though.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Scanner does not turn on.  I cannot return because I had put it away when I received it without trying it, and now it is too late to return it  I emailed the company explaining the situation and asking how to go about returning it for repairs at my expense, as it is my fault for not try it when I received it.  It has been a week and I have heard nothing no acknowledgement even that they have received my email.
B00C2C637I|1.0|The story is terrifically creepy, but it's hard to make my way through it considering all the typographical errors. Another review written in 2009 stated the same, but I thought SURELY 4 years later they MUST have corrected/updated the problems. I was wrong. As a person who almost exclusively reads e-books these days, I cannot suggest strongly enough that you get the print edition of this title.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Weaving a plot that spans an orphan's experience on a train taking her to Minnesota in the 1920s, the author uses these threads by intertwining a current day teen who is struggling within the foster care system. The characters throughout are well drawn and I certainly cared about both main females. It makes me want to research more about the Orphan Trains.  Lovely writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|All of my kids play the original game and when I got this for them they were  a blit hesitant to play.  Once they started playing, they only said GREAT things about this game and haven't put it down since.  A few obvious control differences; but overall it was very easy to learn the new controls and toggle thru the game.  Kids LOVE it and now we have our game room back.
B0060AY85C|5.0|A brother and sister return to a home that was painful to grow up in, and find healing there.  Morrison tells the tale in a sensitive and beautifully touching way.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a bit of a weather addict.  I use The Weather Channel, NOAA and Wunderground to get my weather fix.  The best presentation is by far The Weather Channel.  Typically I access The Weather Channel from my PC or my smartphone.  But I will sometimes use my Kindle Fire HD. When I do I find it works just like my android phone but even easier to see and read because of the screen size.  Easy navigation, stores my locations, stays updated, gives me access to all the excellent news, videos, maps and forecast info I want.  In fact, it pays videos better than some other apps that struggle to deliver content on my Kindle Fire HD which does not support flash player content.  I also notice that The Weather Channel app is constantly being improved for more intuitive, attractive interface.  And the cool thing is that it is still free after all of these years.  You really get a lot of high-caliber content for free with this app.

B00DP3IESY|5.0|What a mind blowing action thriller.  Its scary where were going with technology.  I see on youtube the beginnings of the drones in this movei, such as the quadcopters.  A must see if your a sci-fi action thriller kind of guy!
0517548232|5.0|I'm using this in our homeschooling program, but read it first myself. It's really readable (even though it was written a while ago) and surprisingly relevant. After reading this, the news will drive you bonkers! The lies they feed us for control. Read this and debunk it all at home and among friends. ...just be prepared to be almost unable to consume pop news or swallow what politicians are peddling!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game if you love horses and if you love completing. i love this game because it like taking care of a real horse.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I bought this movie to be able to share it with my friends that don't have a Bluray player yet, it's that good! I remember the original comic from long ago & even though they make this story more contemporary, it's still every bit as good (if not better) than that comic. Plus, when I saw this in the theater, I gotta thank the unknown young person who suggested that if I (& my family) were fans, we might wanna stay to the very end of the credits for a surprise. We did. On the chance you didn't, I won't spoil it here, but know when it was finished I gasped over the potential. Good stuff.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Bring on the next one.  Not sure if it's available yet. But going to be keeping my eye eye out for it.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|I mean it's what it shows you surprisingly larger then I thought but it's a nice little set however the price for some Legos has certainly gone up all in all it's worth it if you can spare the money I think it should be like 10$ less.
B00130EVSS|3.0|This review has nothing to do with the movie itself. Actually, I loved the movie. However, the casing was damaged when it arrived. It was cracked noticeably and the corner piece pulled back if you aren't careful. As much as I like ordering from Amazon, they really need to start sending their movies in boxes.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is by far my favorite classic movie.  What more can you say about this great movie?  Bogart is great in this.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|The book is from Drew's point of view, the male perspective. He talks directly to the reader in a pig-headed jack ass way. His arrogant dickishness makes the book hilarious. Of course he's a notorious man-whore that sleep his way through every night club in NYC. But in true chic-lit form, he gets his comeuppance. Kate, the smart sexy heroine, gives him a run for his money. He begs, he pleads and he grovels. It's quite perfect actually. So if you are looking for a quick steamy romance, this novel is for you. The only negative is that the ending was kind of abrupt. There should have been Christmas with her mom or a dinner with his family, something! YES, an epilogue would have been great. If only all writers could follow in Kristen Ashley's footsteps!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The main reason I bought this product was to be able to stream Amazon movies that I get free as an Amazon Prime member. When I try to start the Chromecast streaming, the screen goes blank. It seems that MS-Silver-light, which is required to play the movies, is not compatible with Chromecast. Is there a workaround for this problem? Will Google provide compatibility in the near future? I already get HBO Go through my Direct TV and I can get Netflix through my Blue Ray player, so I do not need Chromecast for that. I am tempted to return Chromecast unless you make Amazon Movies compatible.

B00CVQYMB4|5.0|I love the Secret and I love these daily teachings. So glad I purchased the Kindle version, I already had the paper version.Great stuff in here.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome Sci Fi novel through and through. Its a very quick read with a very satisfying plot. Definitely recommend to all readers.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show!!! Can't get enough :)...I highly recommend it. It's smartly written and the cast is perfect! Getting friends to watch as they missed the season..
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I purchased this CD as a gift to my husband.  He will be attending Avenged Sevenfold latest tour and thought this would be perfect!  He loved it!!!
B00CPWTRAA|1.0|If you're swayed by PR, then this CD is for you. Domingo had a long and (mostly) outstanding career as a tenor. Once he can no longer sing those roles he's gone to attempting to sing baritone. Anyone who calls him a \\"Verdi baritone\\" apparently knows nothing  about opera or thatstyle of singing. For one thing, Domingo is simply not a baritone, he's a tenor who has lost his range. So he can't be a \\"Verdi baritone\\" if he's not even a baritone. He's just pitching his voice lower but the coloration and timbre are still a tenor. He should retire gracefully. Ramon Vinay extended his career by taking on baritone roles but Vinay started out as a baritone. His last role was a rather pathetic Don Basilio. Will Domingo follow the same route? Stay with Domingo's tenor recordings from his prime.
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|I LOVE John Mayer, but will have to admit this CD was not one of my favorites.  However, I did see him during this tour and after hearing it live I think I will give it another chance! I will forever be a JM fan!!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This was my husband favorite xmas gift. He uses it a lot. The picture and video quality is awesome!! Great for using in the water, such as snorkeling or scuba diving.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|I am such a HUGE fan of these movies!! This was purchased for me, as a little something extra, for my birthday.  They are absolutely adorable!!  They would be perfect on any cake and/or cupcake!
B004TJ1H3C|2.0|This show is reminescent of Star Trek Voyager, only it's flat, boring, over-dramatic, and the acting is terrible. The actors have zero chemistry. The Atlantis series didn't have the same kind of resources or money for effects, but they drew you into the story because you could relate to the characters.  The plot is good, but the series is forgettable.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Much better than the movie in my opinion. The details and action is intense. I highly recommend it for anyone 13+.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released in 1963.  It was good then, and was good again this time.  The movie lost connection 3 times while trying to watch it.  Customer service blamed the disconnect on my cable company.  It happens every time we rent a movie from Amazon.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Probably the very best action comedy ever. The  superb cast is nothing short of excelent. Lots of exciting action, very funny comedy, interesting plot (twists) and lots of action and violence. Never a dull moment. Everyone I've shown this movie to, has gone out and bought it! I'd give it six stars if I could!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is very addictive and keeps your brain active. It is fun to play. Would recommend this game if you like a challenge
B002ZG999U|4.0|This is about as good as an action movie gets. Good acting,interesting cararcters, really bad, bad guys, and a lot of great action and gratuitous violence.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|In the genre of Pat Metheny, this sound is its own and one track rolls into the next without losing the listener's interest.  Suitable for a wide range of positive moods and good for active or passive listening.
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|Cher still has and her cd is so crystal clear and I downloaded it on my Kindle with no problem. Amazon make its so easy to load on to my kindle will. You can't go wrong with this song .
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|If you love Cher, this is an awesome album.  If you don'l like Cher....don't buy it.  I find myself liking the second half of the album better than the first half.  But overall, I love most of the songs.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I am still reading it but I like it so much that I might read it again.  You can understand how the characters really feel.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Beautiful quality album. A must for Lindsey Stirling fans. Music is eclectic and fun, perfect for dancers or people who enjoy choreographing music.
B0063M22QO|4.0|A good game to pass the time while waiting in an Dr. Office or other place of business.  A great game for a tablet.  Or even share with young children to keep the mind active.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This movie went with me on a trip. I was not impressed. Actors and actress did a ok job. Just did not like movie.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This will be the first time using any Amazon items (but I love the kindle and the possibilities of uses
B0038P59A0|4.0|Heard this was a great movie. I like the actors in it so, I got this on my kindle for a trip I took. Must have been not in the mood to watch can't remember the movie.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie. As an older guy it did bother me in knowing several opportunities I blew as a younger father.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was a great movie. There was action and it was interesting. I have added it to my collection. Thank you.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|This is really good. Surprisingly good and addictive show. I started watching and im hooked. need more Glee, and cant wait to see the rest of the episodes.
1401216676|5.0|How can you not love anything involving those two? One of the greatest graphic novels AND it's got them two?<br />You need to get it. Get it five minutes ago.
143911000X|5.0|This book is NOT for the lassies.  ;)  Honestly, though, it is very entertaining and some of the material is actually somewhat useful to take into account.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a wonderful game. Takes time and you to look real hard to find things, Some dark rooms. But overall I love it.
B00821OX98|3.0|I think this series is acceptable but I would not follow it further than the 1st episode.<br />The subject has been treated many times and I do not see anything different, innovative or interesting in this one.<br />There is too much over-acting and personal drama which does not add to the interest of the series.<br />I would't recommend it to anybody in my circles.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|It was like reading a book for youth except for the sex scene. It was my first book by this author and I think it will likely be my last.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love Downton Abbey, Season 3 is very sad, but you still want more ! Can't wait till season 4 comes out
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Many people can convey a message. Even more communicate. Everyone attempts to say something that matters. But to actually impart a message requires special skills. This book breaks the secret down into easy to understand parts. The beauty of the book is that it works. The first three pages gives a practical exercise that locks the reader into finishing the book. Its value is clear from the beginning.
B000002TLX|5.0|Love Richard Marx, This is a wonderful Cd with all his hits. Takes you back in time .... love all the ballads.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install and use. It works perfectly. This device is a great enhancement to traditional TV viewing choices. Worth the money, easily.
B00CM4VC7M|2.0|I was extremely excited when I saw these figures first appearing as prototypes and couldn't wait to get one in my hands.  Now that I actually have one, I'm sadly underwhelmed.  Which is unfortunate because being at an age where I can collect figures from my childhood and relive the nostalgia, its upsetting this figure wasn't up to par.<br /><br />I can say a few positive things about the Moon figure before I go tearing into it.  First I love the fact that she is pose-able.  I literally have the ability to recreate any of the crazy action poses I want from the show.  Its awesome.  The second thing I did like was the insane amount of diffident hands, faces, etc.  All of the interchangeable parts are a great add on as it allows each person to customize their figure however they choose.  And the addition of the mini Luna is also a nice touch as well.<br /><br />After my nostalgia died and I stopped being giddy, I noticed a lot of problems.  And now on to the negatives...<br /><br />The first issue I have is the base and clasp to hold the figure.  The clasp doesn't hold the doll well at all and very easily shifts or opens up again and the figure goes slipping from its pose.  I struggled to get the figure to stay in place for a solid 10 minutes and when I went to carefully move the figure and base from my desk to dresser the figure slipped out again, from only the slightest bit of movement.  Very frustrating.  Even to make a small adjustment such as moving an arm or leg causes the figure to go sliding out.  Not to mention the clasp doesn't seem to want to hold her in some positions.  I wanted to have her throwing her tiara but the stupid clasp refused to hold her in that position so I had to settle for her standing up and giving the peace sign.  There were pictures of her in mid air, feet off the ground with the clasp once again around her waist...tried that.  Figure tipped and the clasp broke free and she fell.  So not happy about that.<br /><br />The second issue I haveis the joints on the figure.  They are weirdly stiff and its hard to actually put the figure into a pose and then get it to stay.  I'm so used to the fluidity that comes from the Revoltech line of figures that I guess I was hoping that Bandai's S.H. Figuarts line would be up to that level as well but I suppose not.  I do like the fact that Bandai hides the joints a little better than Revoltech does but its never been a big issue.<br /><br />Another issue I have is the paint job.  It's fairly sloppy in some spots especially around the edges of where the skirt meets the body and also where the boot meets the legs.  Also the hands do not seem to want to stay attached and kept popping off.  I had to force them in and then didn't move them after that.<br /><br />I was hoping that maybe I had a defective figure, maybe I got one that came from a bad batch, sadly it wasn't just me.  A friend ordered hers from Big Bad Toy Store and hers had the same issues as mine.  I was so disappointed by this, I really was.  The S.H. Figuarts line didn't do this justice.  Which is so unfortunate.  I cancelled the preorder I had for Mercury and Mars for the same reasons above.  I don't see the point in spending $42 plus shipping for a figure that I am not going to enjoy and has some serious flaws.  I really wish Revoltech had gotten their hands on the license for these as they would have done a much better job and still come with all the add ons.  Not to mention Revoltech is significantly less expensive and the figures can take a beating.  Same scale as the S.H. Figuarts line as well.  Even Good Smile Company's Figma line would have worked, and their figures are twice the size as that of Bandai and also so much more articulated and maybe $10 more than Bandai and again, all the add ons.<br /><br />It's a shame.  Hopefully when Legend Studios releases their Sailor Moon S line they do a much better job.  I have high hopes for that line and for getting all 9 scouts.  Until then I just have tobe patient.
B00F875N98|4.0|Not a bad album, will give it a few listens to let it sink in. I felt the tempo definitely slowed down in the middle of the album but I am sure I will like it more after a few long road trips.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this whole series the suspense the story line the passsion drama kept you wanting to know what will happen in their future and what happened in the past.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Check out the original review @ booksandswoons.blogspot.com<br /><br /> As I write this review I feel a little torn because there were several things that were done very well and other that for me were a little distracting. Simone Elkeles is a very talented writer and executed this novel very well. I love when novels are written in dual point of views but this one takes the cake; Elkeles is the master of the dual point of views. The transitions were very smooth from chapter to chapter and I was never confused as to who was speaking. The author does a phenomenal job integrating Spanish into the text which is not that easy to pull off with out being distracting.<br /><br />On to the story part, the plot moves along well and there were enough twists in the story to keep me interested and curious to find out what happens in the end. The scenes were well set and believable and the language was appropriate for the characters' age. I really love that the author took the time to include an epilogue. I always want to know what happens after a story ends.<br /><br />I had a few issues that kept me from giving Perfect Chemistry a higher rating. The biggest issue was the Mexican slang which was a turnoff for me. I'm Latina and can appreciate Spanish, Spanglish and a lot of variations of the language but some of the terminology used put me off. I felt that Brittany and Alex were a little generic and stereotypical. I also could never get into the whole gang thing.<br /><br />Apart from those few issues , this novel was very well written and I would recommend it to anyone. It's a quick read that will leave you feeling nice and happy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of my favorite reads the whole series kept you wanting to know more and going from hate to love.

006097625X|5.0|This book was required for a college art class I took way back in 1998. Today I'm a professional illustrator and I still own it, referring to it from time to time. I feel it's a wonderful introduction to the subject of comic book drawing as well as narrative graphic design. It certainly made me look at the art of comics in a new way. It's the perfect starting point for anyone who is interested in creating their own comics or graphic novels... I highly recommend it.
B00F2LIV4E|3.0|I like how amazon wants to know how you like an album 1 day after you purchase it. They should ask for survey after 2 weeks

B007TK77QE|2.0|The basis of The Casual Vacancy is a simple situation - a town Councillor dies and must be replaced. J.K. Rowling delves in the past, present and future of the people of the town. `Delving' is the right word, because, for me, many times there is too much detail, which distracts from the immediate story behind the simple situation. The best example of this is the Weedon family, with all the attempts at West Country accents on paper. I must admit I thought of giving up a few times (rare for me), but I continued, and in the end I'm glad I did. However, I think if Rowling's name had not been on the manuscript this book would have struggled to get published.<br />With so many people involved, the reading pleasure would have been greatly enhanced with a list of characters and their relationships. A sketch map of Pagford would have also helped.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I love this book!! I laughed my ass off! I love that's is from a guy's point of view, they're honest and not all rainbow and butterflies. I love drew, his attitude, his arrogance, his determination to get what he wants. All around a great comedy/romance!! Highly recommend!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|It's a great game and i love it so much i think it is worth the money find me if yo install<br />-derios6
1465414444|5.0|I pre-ordered this not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Lots of great artwork, and very well written text. I sat down to glance through it, and ended up reading the entire thing in one sitting in about 2.5 hours. Even though I knew a lot of the lore, there was a lot I didn't know, and this filled the gaps. Great \\"coffee table book\\" too.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that it advertised a lot of \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff which only consists of a few pages near the back of the book that doesn't provide any insight at all, it's just like \\"photos from BlizzCon,\\" etc. I didn't order it for that, so wasn't put off by it, but some might be.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am going to find it very difficult to write a review about this book, because I am at a loss for words every time I think on it too hard. It slips away, and I'm left with a memory, a sensation, a tingling of a feeling I had while reading it. Not since The Wheel of Time series have I felt such emotional attachment to characters. My heart raced when something bad would happen, it dropped when there was an unexpected twist of evil fate.<br /><br />This is not predictable, it is not rote. It is new and fresh and amazing in every way, and I give it all of my stars. Every single one, forever. Looking forward, with MUCH anticipation, to the final book in the series.

1476734941|4.0|I'm a Brit in the US and I have the US version. First of all myself and my husband have been following it faithfully for five weeks. We have both lost a reasonable amount of weight. He has lost at least 8 lbs and I have lost 6 lbs. we like it very much and I for one feel much more healthy as a result. I had IBS on and off for last few years and since being on diet, feel noticeably better.  I also take thyroid medication and I still lost the weight. The recipes we have tried so far have been very good - teriyaki chicken, ginger chicken, salmon and cherry toms, tilapia with vegetables.  We have also made up our own based on the principles we have learned. I generally have oatmeal (porridge) with blueberries or strawberries made with water and a bit of milk and my husband has two eggs. After first week or so, we have got used to going without food from breakfast until evening meal. We even look forward to it because we know it's doing us good!<br /><br />One complaint is the measurements and weights. They are not consistent. I know the Americans have complained about metric terms etc but even as a Brit, they aren't easy to work with. All the individual calorie counts at the back are in 100 grams (about 3 1/2 ounces) but some of the recipes are listing ounces or cups so if you want to tweak it to fit into your allowance you have to keep getting a calculator out which is not very convenient. Also a &#34;chicken breast&#34; in the US is usually a lot bigger than in UK so we need to know an approx weight.<br /><br />My other complaint is that the recipes and meal plans are not couple friendly. We want to be able to serve the same meal but the recipes are either 500 or 600 cals so you have to do a lot of fiddling around with amounts and calories to be able to make it easy for a twosome. What we need is the same meal but with adjustments for 500 or 600 cals.<br />Anyway, overall I would recommend the diet very much. I have lost my weight without much exercise although my husband has exercised.  I would recommend that you should try it for a couple of weeks to see how you like it. After first two or three fasts it feels a lot easier.band has exercised.  I would recommend that you should try it for a couple of weeks to see how you like it.

B00866H7SS|4.0|18/12 - Bared to You has been compared to Fifty Shades of Grey, favourably. I think it should be the other way around - FSoG compared to Bared to You and unfavourably. Thankfully, while a lot of the elements of the story are quite similar to FSoG the story itself is a true romance instead of a horrifying story of domestic abuse masquerading as romance.<br /><br />I found the similarities between this and FSoG to be quite startling in their obviousness, but as I think Day wrote a better book it didn't bother me. I thought Eva was a far better character, much more believable and much less laughable. Her reactions to Gideon's actions fitted better with her personality and past experiences than Ana's reactions to Christian did. Compared to Gideon I don't see how any reader can find Christian romantic. Gideon and Christian were both abused as children (it's not clear yet, but from what was mentioned I feel that Gideon was abused even worse than Christian) and while they both feel a need to be in control due to these experiences, Christian's controlling nature is made worse by his desire to cause pain as well, something Gideon gets no enjoyment from. Both Ana and Eva have broken families with their mothers marrying a number of times. Both Christian and Gideon have a brother and a sister, with the sister being considerably younger than themselves. Both books feature trouble caused by ex-girlfriends, one of whom has a longstanding and deeper relationship with Christian/Gideon which causes insecurities in both Ana and Eva. Both books feature a party held at the hero's parent's house. Both Gideon and Christian are business moguls buying buildings and companies in order to keep them safe (whether the heroine sees it that way is another thing). In both books the hero has a driver/bodyguard who is frequently subjected to some potentially embarrassing situations. There are other more glaring similarities but I could be here all day.<br /><br />There is one big difference between Bared to You and FSoG and that is the lack of a menacing feeling that always seemed to emanate from Christian. It didn't matter what Ana did I was always scared for her, that Christian would take something she said or did the wrong way and decide she needed punishing and put her in the hospital. I never got that feeling from Gideon, even when he nearly raped her during a nightmare. I would recommend this to people who read FSoG and were disgusted with the way Christian treated Ana and felt mislead by the label of 'romance' that has been attached to that book - this is for the people (like me) who believed that erroneous 'romance' label and were disappointed when there wasn't any.Bared to You and FSoG and that is the lack of a menacing feeling that always seemed to emanate from Christian.

Of course having a crush on Harrison Ford and getting to see him play this romantic part might have something to do with it. I like that Sabrina isn't going to France to learn to cook. I don't like cooking, so this made me be able to connect with her more. Plus, Audrey Heburn can't help but look gorgeous in any character she plays. The actress in this updated version pulled off mousey and naive well. And I like the way they covered her time in France, as a girl coming of age.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Ordered this for my mom, came on time and this is something we can both enjoy playing throughout the house :)
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|This band takes me into a relaxed state. They play all their own instruments and create some of their own. They are very catchy. You will find yourself singing or dancing along. It reminds me if music before all the rap crap and songs about wanting to &#34;do&#34; this guy or this girl. Definitely recommend giving them a moment to listen.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A friend of mine suggested this book to me some ago and I just around to reading it... I wish I picked it up sooner! I love the details, trivia, the characters... everything. It really sucked me in and my imagination went wild. Having some knowledge about 80's culture and being married to a gamer is a bonus- it make the book even more gratifying but I think anyone could read this and get wrapped up and lost in another world. The amount of detail is amazing and the action had me biting my knuckles... I even yelled out loud profanities a few times- this book was a blast! I most definitely recommend this book!!!!
B000NMW6M0|5.0|Awesome movie second time I've seen it...  Better the second time around guess cause I was able to enjoy a little bit more didn't have to study it so hard second time around to understand it...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We really liked this game.  It was pretty short.  Nice searching game with a little twist of challenge.  Great for a couple game.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|&#34;Hang Loose&#34; is the &#34;Somebody to Love&#34; of 2013!  Why didn't I hear about them sooner.  It's a diversely talented group.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|STARTED PLAYING this game because it was free, but then I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to continue playing!

B0065RIJ3W|5.0|The source of information able to write with this level of passion, simplicity, and accessibility has in this case, obviously cleaned her own fish, and has the talent to support her ambition. I feel this is an honest, and thorough treatment of AP.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|While I'm still working my way through this book, I can tell you that I have had success on the first three experiments.  Pam does an excellent job of explaining the experiments, and it's fun to try the experiments!  I'm stuck on #4 but will continue to work at it.  It's a motivational read and very well written.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|What can you say great movie of love and lost .Set in the background of war.<br />Give it a chance.
0345803493|1.0|The books were like a lifetime movie about a girl who was mentally abused by her mean over controlling, abusive boyfriend that she just kept finding reasons to not leave. He was a crazy person who stalked her, showed up at her work, bought her other place of employment just to control her life. It was more crazy than great. I felt like I should be locking my bedroom door when I go to sleep at night after reading this. E.L James should stick to her day job and give up writing books. Please don't make this a movie!!!

B005GY0Y8S|5.0|The book starts off quite generic and sweet well as much a a murder/ love story can as the story unravels more and mire twists and turns appear just when you think you have nailed what happened another twist appears great to keep you reading until you get answers ( no so good if bed time was 5 hrs ago)<br />Enjoyable book go ahead jump in just be warned you May not put it down fast onto the next one for me
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This album took me about 4 or 5 listens about 1 a day to finally realize that I really thought it was very much to my liking. Of course this has a lot to do with the fact the production is strange and loud - (a tad to compressed and weird drum sound) but eventually I got used to that and realized these were great songs.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book interweaves the experiences of a teenage girl and an elderly woman whose childhoods at different times in very different places are parallel stories of abandonment, loneliness, and hardship.  Although the circumstances of these childhoods are unremittingly bleak, this is not a depressing book.  In fact, it is a lovely story of strong personalities ultimately persisting in spite of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />I appreciate fiction that also educates.  In addition to an understanding of foster care from the child's perspective, I learned about an important but little-known piece of American history.  The title \\"Orphan Train\\" refers to trains run by charity organizations between 1854 and 1929 that moved over 200,000 orphaned or abandoned children from the east coast to the Midwest where they were supposed to find caring foster parents but often became little more than indentured servants.  The author portrays the leaders of this charitable effort as having low expectations for the children, and the children's lives as a series of dislocations outside their control.  Although the modern foster system has more protections and advocates for children, the child still lacks control and can only hope for a good placement.  One important theme of the book is \\"portaging,\\" or what one carries from place to place when moving is necessary.<br /><br />For this fine novel, Christina Baker Kline did extensive research on the orphan trains, foster/adoption protocols, and each of the locales (Ireland, Minnesota, and Maine) that play important roles in this book.  Her characters are convincing and memorable, the interplay of the two main characters' stories is well structured, and the book is highly involving--in fact, hard to put down.  I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The product is working fine for me until now. After 3-4 hours it is becoming hot and casting is hanging some times. Otherwise the product was very good.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This is a very good album but I don't think I can agree that it is \\"bluegrass\\", it's more country.  I enjoyed it and love Alan Jackson!!!  I would definitely recommend purchasing it but not with a \\" bluegrass\\" expectation!!!
B0041KVW2K|2.0|This was my third try from Amazon to get a good one. Their shipping offered great protection for the box set. Great book!<br />But, on the first one I started playing them in order and got to BEATLES FOR SALE and there was a defect in one of the songs. Cleaning would not help. Listened to others in the box and found other similar defects.<br />Box 2 the first album I tried, WHITE ALBUM had visible defect which caused pops and ticks on GOODNIGHT, and, also on ME AND MY MONKEY. Again, cleaning would not help.<br />Box 3 came yesterday. I chose ABBEY ROAD, it was it's anniversary release date. YOU NEVER GIVE ME MY MONEY has a similar defect. No visible signs. No cleaning would help. Just sounded like it was a long scratch in the left channel only.<br />Amazon's web site says there are sounds and hissing known. But, these are clearly just pressing errors.<br />THE BEATLES deserve better quality than this. Sent it back to Amazon already and they didn't even want to send me a 4th. Very unhappy with this.
B000CNESU8|5.0|NETWORK directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Paddy Chayefsky is prophetic in nature. Peter Finch's riveting performance as news anchorman Howard Beale who raves about the seemingly awful truth behind the news media is devastating. This film is way ahead of its time. Its message is now quite clear.
B000B7QCKE|5.0|This was the very first concert we saw on DVD many years ago and have wanted to purchase it for our own collection since then.  It is a beautiful concert.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall in this Blu-ray/CD combo pack is very impressive. It is beautifully done and looks and sounds terrific. Actually I was surprised how well this was produced. It is an exceptional experience. Adele continues to amaze.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a brilliant period drama.  I wish it would go on forever, like Eastenders. I am so glad that it was offered on Amazon Prime.  Thank you.
B00CSA41FK|5.0|1954's Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.
0142410705|2.0|This was my third John Green novel (the others being The Fault in Our Stars and Looking for Alaska).  While I certainly had my issues with those two books (mainly that the characters are overly intellectual and unrealistic), I found them to be interesting, entertaining reads.  On the other hand, the story in An Abundance of Katherines is severely lacking.  I actually thought that Colin (minus the anagramming) and Lindsey were believable characters (with Quaran-Arabic-speaking Hassan being entertaining but a bit over-the-top).  I think a lot of smart kids can relate to wanting their lives to mean something, to make a contribution to the world.  The fear that smarts are only academic is something that many students struggle with.  At the same time, feel the need for things to stay the same, the same way that Lindsey does.  However, the story doesn't have much action, the main storyline is extremely predictable, and it doesn't really tie up the ending storylines as well as I would have hoped.  We do get a bit of closure during the scene with the trio at the warehouse, but they don't provide enough closure.<br /><br />Finally, I take issue with the constant refrain in the book that you \\"don't really have to understand the math.\\"  I may be biased, as I graduated from college with a degree in mathematics and math has always come easily to me.  However, this book does not CHANGE THE CONVERSATION with respect to mathematics.  The number of teenagers going into the tech and engineering fields is dropping and writing books that send the message \\"Math is hard! You don't really have to pay attention to these parts\\" is not the solution.  I understand that the book needs to be accessible to everyone in order to sell copies, but this really irked me.<br /><br />Overall, the novel was a fair way to spend five or six hours.  Aside from my thoughts on the message and mathematics, there were some relatable characters but overall, I felt the story fell flat.  Read this if you want to breeze through a novel in half a day and be mildly entertained, but not overly engrossed in a story.
B003INBOAG|5.0|BEHIND ENEMY LINES looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable. I found THE THIN RED LINE to be a deep film, very ethereal in nature and liberating as it is disturbing. Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way. Nick Nolte's performance as an over the hill Lieutenant Colonel trying to impress a very shallow and aloof Brigadier Geneneral (John Travolta) is moving. THE THIN RED LINE is a devastating film.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Talented writer, original plot with many twists that build to the end.  Can't believe it took me this long to discover this book and author.
0767846362|5.0|If the global conquest of earth by the forces of Evil hung in the balance and could be tipped in the favor for the good of all mankind by these three, or is it four, sorry looking men of distinguished and not forgotten valor - let's just say that I hope you know some really good prayers.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|This is a useful app for anyone who shops or sells on eBay.  I have used it only for buying and it provides notification when an item I am watching is ending soon.  It is convenient for reminding me of those items and also gives me notification if I win or lose a bid.  I have used it to search for items but not used it to actually place bids.  I am pleased with this app.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Ron Howard's RUSH is absolutely amazing. It caught me way off guard. Wow! This is an amazing film. It is high powered. It is excellently acted! It has energy in every aspect of the production. This may be one of the best race car movies ever made. It is thoroughly captivating and you never want the adrenalin rush to end. It is a must see film in every respect. A quality production in every respect. It blew me away.
B00BXDOSXS|2.0|I downloaded this player to my Kindle to view videos I downloaded from the net.  Either I was not doing something correctly or this app was incapable of showing the videos but it did not work out for me and I removed it from my Kindle.
B00DMZ7OBI|5.0|THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence. On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors.

B008469DGY|4.0|would love to be able to play a whole round of golf, implement that and this game would be great.
B00BEIYMZ6|3.0|Reminded me of National Lampoons Vacation at times, which is a good thing. Though, The Millers is somewhat forgettable after viewing. I enjoyed the movie and it was entertaining, but I won't rush to buy it anytime soon. Sedekis is charming as the lead, but, not as commanding as an actor with seasoned experience. The scene with Aniston stripping is so forced it's almost pathetic. It comes out of nowhere. But again, this is a comedy. A few gross out moments as well which some find super hilarious. I prefer subtle, witty humor which this has also. Still worth a rent.
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|I am in love with this album and I have had it on repeat since Tuesday. A definite must buy.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Talent talent. It will be wonderful to see what they come up with next.  It is like Janice Joplin with out the drugs. Great.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't mind an erotic book but this one is so badly written I could've written something better when I was seven.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Loved it! A good western. We were looking for something to take our minds off things and it worked perfectly.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|When I heard them for the first time I fell for them and each time with each CD they inject their special style to each song.  I love their rhythm.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I had no intention of watching the movie when my wife asked if we could see it.  I had no interest in a &#34;musical&#34; and dismissed it out of hand.  But we did watch it on DVD and I was absorbed totally.  I have not seen any other renditions of Les Mis but I cannot imagine any being more moving than this.
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|Verdi is one of my favorite composers in the classical music and opera and Placido Domingo makes it the best.  His interpretation of each piece on this CD shows us that Placido will be with us for a long time, his voice is at its best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great fun. Relaxing after those stressful days and great entertainment. My children can't wait for there turn. I would recommend this game for kids of ALL ages.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Marc Anthony's voice is amazing and versatile, he adjusts it to the different rhythms injecting his style to each song.  He has been my favorite singer for years.  My oldest daughter got me hooked when she treated me to one of his concerts.
B0043UB0EI|3.0|Lot's of blood and sex. The creators knew what they were doing. Entertaining enough to watch. Interesting to get  'glimpse' of what life as a gladiator may have been like.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|Another fun one for Dr Panda. Its a little to advanced for our 2 yr old. its a perfect one though for an adult to play along with the toddler. The concept of all the things you have to do at an airport is lost on a very young child.
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|Plot was good. Good ending. I would recommend it to my  friends and family to watch. Possible part two in the works?
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old grandson will play this for 30 minutes straight and not get bored. He especially likes the high five he gets for completing a  task. There are a few hidden features he loves to tap on especially in the attic.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|I liked the entire film. I thought it wasn't  a predictable outcome as I previoiusly expected. The film tells a story for younger people, which is something that is needed in today's culture.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Amazing book, edge of your seat story  with all of the Nicholas Sparks wonderful perks . A must read for sure
1400079276|1.0|I can imagine that some people will not agree with that statement. But let me tell you, I have a young daughter who is totally innocent and this book is in her curriculum for her world Literature class. This is not literature, it is a poorly written book about someone who must be insane! He has sex with his mother and his sister and these parts of the book are very explicit and graphic! This includes graphic descriptions of oral sex!<br />My daughter is mortified and we are going to take it up with the college for sure.<br />I am disgusted and appauled that this filth is given so many high stars with no comments on the graphic sexual content!<br />I hope this review is seen and people are warned. I understand there will be many will not care and that is fine, but for those who do care, this is my warning!<br />There are so many wonderful examples of literary art that this should not be considered anything of the sort.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|This game would be awesome if it played right. I haven't played it yet it won't let me in. I've tried everything DON'T GET THIS GAME.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|One of the best of the genre.  I just wish we had more than one season of it!  Wonderful blend of humor and drama.  Fine storytelling!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoy futuristic stories, but I'm not much of a sci fi fan because most of them just aren't that good. They tend to drag on about technical or pschological details making it not much fun to read.  But this writer knows how to grab you from the get-go. I had a hard time putting it down.
B00F87A7HG|5.0|As always, another solid release by Kings of Leon.  They never release garbage.  If you are a fan, buy it.  If you are not a fan, but it and become one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I recommend this game.This is easy to play. I do find it challenging but not so difficult that it is not enjoyable.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|Just bought a bunch of albums and this is the best of the bunch.  Starts off strong and ends solidly.  The middle tracks didn't do it for me at first but are growing on me.
1439170916|5.0|This book is a brilliant history of cancer, from earliest times to the present.  The book is accessible and fascinating, even for a reader without a medical background. High recommend.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Disclaimer: The National is my favorite band.  Every release, I think thealbum is just OK.  And then it grows on me like a weed until it's a classic.  This is no exception.  If you don't love the first track, it's you, not the song.
0143119680|5.0|This novel, and its follow-up, Shadow of Night, are two of my all-time favorite books. The writing, the setting, the story, the characters -- all mesmerizing! If you love fantasy, historical fiction and romance, you will fall in love with the All Souls Trilogy.

B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Fantastic new Gov't Mule tunes - excellent diversity from sweet blues/jazz to ass kickin' rock.  NOBODY does it better.  Warren Haynes is spectacular.  Matt Abts on drums drives the truck right through the brick wall whenever needed.  If you're not a Mule fan, you are seriously missing out.  When you finally get around to it, you're gonna kick yourself in your ass for not getting on the train sooner.  This band is spectacular & this new album is proof of that fact.<br /><br />Don Hill - Charleston, SC
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book defiantly deserves 5 stars. It's even better then the movie and I can't wait to read the next book
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Fun movie to watch! It's not a &#34;I gotta watch this one again&#34; movie. It's not a &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; or a &#34;Skyfall&#34;  kind of fantastic movie but it's good. Check it out!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I loved reading this book, every time I thought I had it figured out I didn't. The characters were very well written and came alive in my head while reading. I would highly recommend.

B00622D3BS|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. Steve C continues to make for a great down-on-his luck character (see also: Little Miss Sunshine). The characters are fun, if a little over the top... and the actors in the movie are a fun group.

B00EDPFJA4|5.0|You can't go wrong with this cd. But this album and truly experience that nothing was ever really the same.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Not as good as the first one but far better than the second. Lots and lots of action the whole movie
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Have played many other racing games. This one rocks, especially for a free game.<br />Only game that I have enjoyed for 2+ months and still play daily.
B001B2KXX0|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife. The copy was extremely well made and a far cry from the paper back it replaced. The binding, pages, and gold leafing are great.<br /><br />I can't speak to the validity of the translation--I haven't read any other copy to compare it.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I expected something better from Brad Pitt. Plot concept not to my taste. Had I known the plot line, I wouldn't have rented it. I should have watched the trailer
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have read many a time-travel or sf story regarding time travel.  This one may be the last.  Not because I hated it but because I doubt any will be better.  King invites us to return to a time he obviously loves (1958 to 1963) and to dip our toes in the flow of history.  As one who lived through the Kennedy assassination as a child, I had no trouble going back to those awful days.  (And I learned a lot about Oswald reading this book....)<br /><br />I gave this four stars rather than five because of the Kindle version.  This is the first long book I've read in this format and it does get a bit difficult.  I read it on my Nexus 7 using a Kindle app, which worked flawlessly.  Like other tablets, however, the Nexus is heavier than a dedicated reader and so it got a little tiring.
B000HT386M|5.0|Thanks!! Order was delivered quick and in GREAT condition! Love the movie!! It's a cute funny movie! ! ! !

B002SHD9E2|5.0|When this movie came out I never made it to the Theatre to see.  It would be great to see on the big screen in HD.
081297381X|5.0|You need to read this book with a purpose. You will need a general background in statistics and philosophy to understand the point. It's about induction, linearity and humane and natural bias when dealing with data and facts. It's talking about the improbable effects of outliers the we don't usually care about. One of my best reads ever.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|When I first got the game and started playing their things were happening that I had never seen before in playing this game.  I changed things back to standard play without the crazy rule changes on some of the editions.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I've played this sort of game on paper and in several apps. This is by far the best implementation in electronic form. A great game to grab as free app of the day.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It took me a little while to get into a flow with this book, but I'm glad I did.  It was a good read and I thought it was an interesting perspective since it was narrated by 'Death'.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Reza Aslan's \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" utilizes the old and negated theory that Jesus Christ's life and work are best defined within the context of the Second Temple Jewish movement known as Zealots. Alslan is a engaging writer but offers nothing new. His treatise is destined for the dark cave of discarded anti-biblical belvederes.<br /><br />Reza Aslan claims that Jesus was mainly a revolutionary. He makes this brazen claim without proper rational and linguistic tools, since he is led by his faulty presuppositions (influenced by J.D. Crossan and S. G. F. Brandon). His view of Jesus is a misrepresentation that's been around for a while, but has spread like a virus over the past few years. It was concocted for theoretical reasons: to boost the prejudices of the quasi-Islamic view of Christ, to discount the Gospel narratives, and to simplify multifaceted truths into fashionable religious tales. Many writers do this by isolating and overemphasizing powerful truths while ignoring the full web of historical actualities.<br /><br />Another distortion concerns a view that downplays the supernatural content of Christ's death as it plays up a semi-naturalistic view: Jesus was a good teacher, but history cannot speak with authority regarding the atonement and resurrection (see [[ASIN:B00EPQ5COE Killing Christ: Contesting Trendy Critics Regarding The Death and Resurrection of Jesus]]. An increasing number of modern writers assert that Jesus began and completed his ministry to show men how to live a moral life (O' Reilly). Christ's impressive moral ideas are taken as proof that He was a wise sage who offered the world a new philosophy.<br /><br />The truth is more complicated.<br /><br />In reality, Christ preached ground-breaking spiritual truths but was not a political revolutionary. Jesus delivered a major sermon that called men to turn the other cheek, do good to those who mistreat you, and pray for those who misuse you. Drastic and far-reaching yes, but not political.<br />So, Jesus proclaimed a whole grid of potent moral truths, but His main goal was securing the salvation of men through His atoning death (Matthew 26:2 & 28; John 3:15-19). Thus, the radical nature of His ministry involved the redemption of men and not merely offering the world wise ethical sayings.<br /><br />Aslan's claim that Christ was a member of the Zealot political party is not possible inasmuch as it was not formed for another 35 years after the resurrection of Christ. Aslan asserts that the chief reason Pilate had Jesus crucified was for political reasons. The priests did press the political aspect of Christ kingship to the governor, but Pilate did not completely affirm this charge. Pilate seemed to want to mollify the Jewish masses more than safe-guarding Caesar's authority since Rome's throne was not directly challenged.<br /><br />Aslan's Numerous Errors<br /><br />Aslan makes a number of significant errors: use of Greek definitions not found in any standard Greek lexicon; using the wrong Greek lexicon for the New Testament; incorrect definition of the \\"targumim;\\" unawareness of the evidence for high literacy in ancient Israel. ... Aslan repeatedly presents highly unlikely interpretations of passages in the New Testament, makes little effort to defend those interpretations, then moves on as if he has made his case. Suffice to say this, as others have said before: there is something a little bizarre about using our only historical documents about Jesus (the New Testament) to come to conclusions quite in opposition to those documents[1].<br /><br />Reza Aslan is not an authority on Christianity, the New Testament, or Second Temple Jewish life. Aslan was asked if Christ claimed that He was divine and he answered, \\"Absolutely no.  Such a thing did not exist in Judaism. ... the notion of a God-man is completely anathema to everything Judaism stands for\\" (National Public Radio: July 14, 2013). Yet, as recorded in the trial, the Jewish leadership adjudged Jesus for blasphemy--they charged that He claimed to be God (the I AM:  John 5:17-18, 8:58, 10:30; Mark 14:62; Luke 22:70-71).  Jesus was crucified because He taught what was considered \\"completely anathema to everything Judaism stands for.\\" Additionally, Jesus forgave sins and healed on the Sabbath--actions reserved for God.<br /><br />In opposition to Aslan's views, Jesus Christ claimed to:<br /><br />I. Be God.[2]<br />II. Be the Redeemer.<br />III. Die for the sins of humanity.<br />IV. Rise from the dead.<br />V. Sit at the right hand of God.<br />VI. Send the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />Zealot is yet another modern reconstruction of Jesus. It is not fresh and new, as it claims to be, but reflects longstanding debate. That debate is between those skeptical about the Gospels' portraits of Jesus and those who see them as complementary pictures of Jesus as he was and is. ... It's not at all clear, however, that Aslan understands the history of Jesus better than the Gospel writers did. ... There are good reasons to suspect the Jesus of history was directly responsible for being confessed as Christ. It was zeal for Jesus' person that drove the earliest disciples to preach him as unique. This is something the disciples not only thought about but also experienced--even to the point of being willing to die for what they knew to be true. Zeal for Jesus arose from his own claims about what God was accomplishing through him[3].<br /><br />Aslan, fixed to a semi-Islamic worldview, misses the essential element of redemption in Christ's death on the cross. Aslan stresses the idea that Jesus died because He provoked violent political subversion. Jesus may have been considered a threat, but His mission was centered on salvation, not political achievements. Christ did not need to seek or encourage sedition for Pilate to have Him crucified. Jesus was executed because He claimed to be God (Jewish) and He claimed to be a spiritual king (Rome). Craig Evans observes: \\"There are numerous problems with Zealot, not least the fact that it heavily relies on an outdated and discredited thesis. But it also introduces a number of its own novel oddities and implausibilities. Aslan has canvassed much of the responsible scholarship in the field, but he does not always choose his options prudently. He often opts for extreme views and sometimes makes breathtaking assertions. I cannot help but wonder if Aslan's penchant for creative writing is part of the explanation. Indeed, Zealot often reads more like a novel than a work of historical analysis.\\"<br /><br />Aslan also affirms an outmoded and unsound notion vis-&agrave;-vis Christological development. According to that timeworn idea, Christ was a good teacher and an influential prophet, but it took hundreds of years for the doctrine of His divinity to evolve. Aslan envisions the Greek-leaning Paul and his Gentile disciples as the ones who began the corruption that finally ends with the canonization of Jesus's divinity at Nicaea in the fourth century. Paul, Aslan thinks, gave us the idea of Jesus as the \\"Christ\\" and later Nicaea gave us the idea of the \\"God-man.\\" Nonetheless, Paul was a Jewish contemporary of Jesus; he spoke the same language, walked the same streets, and was immersed in the same traditions and culture as Christ. It only seems to make sense to trust one submerged in the customs and language of Jesus over an outsider 2000 years removed from the ethos and culture of Jesus. Paul's association to Christianity can be traced back to a few years after Christ's crucifixion. In Paul's writings (47-60 A.D.) we find him affirming that Christ is God. I will reject an outsider's opinion and take the opinion of Jewish man who visited the same Temple, had the same dust on his feet, and drank from the same streams as Jesus. I will trust Paul and not Aslan. I will trust the Gospels and not O'Reilly. I trust God's word and not the trendy critics seeking to make money with impudent and unfoundedclaims about Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />And it's good to know that I can reject every foolhardy scheme that contradicts the biblical accounts of the life of Christ because in every examination of Christ's life, naturalistic presuppositions must give way to the underpinning of intelligibly: God[4]. Naturalistic thought is, in principal, empty of any genuine concept of truth. One needs the Christian worldview, which alone provides the universal necessities required for historical investigation and analysis.<br /><br />In this way, hyper-critical thought regarding Christ's life are upended using arguments from ultimate criteria (God vs. unaided human reason). The skeptic accepts the reality of historical analysis, the necessary condition of which is God. This problem is disabling for the critical program of Aslan. This is the case not merely because of cynicism's irresolute consistency, but because of its ontological restraint--it is devoid of a basis that is airy and grandiose enough to provide universal immutables utilized in historical analysis. Christ died for the sins of humanity and rose again in triumph. If one's worldview lacks the resources to account for the universal operating features of reason, as Aslan's does, it is unqualified to underwrite a project that analyses such. The book is fluid and fetching. Aslan is a winsome writer, but errors greatly when he discusses the life of Christ. Perhaps he can stick to subjects that are within his range of knowledge and ability.<br />Review by Mike Robinson author of numerous apologetics books available on Amazon.<br />------------------------------------------------------<br />1.

Plus you can stream pretty much anything else you'd want using Chromecast. You can't beat this for $35, at that price it's even less than the cheapest Roku. I can't wait until Google adds more apps.

1592402038|4.0|\\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" is a great book, and a great book on grammar at that. Lynne Truss wrote \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" in a style that doesn't feel tedious and lifeless like a textbook. \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" instead reads like a story about the importance of grammar and its history. Lynne Truss while telling an interesting story about the genesis of grammar, she also teaches the reader cleaver ways to think about grammar and its many rules.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is chapter 3, \\"That'll do comma\\". It highlights what \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" does so well, it makes you forget that you are reading a book on grammar, and instead gives you a story about why we have commas and why you should use them. Lynne Truss writes \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" in a clever and enlightening way. She knows that if you're reading her book then you have probably read other grammar books and have been on the verge of tears, from boredom. Rather than beat her readers over the head with all the rules of punctuation, Truss artfully tells the reader a story about the comma and answers the question of who, what, when and why of grammar. Who created the comma? What is the comma for? Why was the comma created? When was the comma created, and when do I use it? \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" uses cleaver questions that make you want to read more, and as a reader you will keep turning the pages and learning. \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" is by far the best grammar book I have ever read and I seriously recommend you take a look.

One thing I did notice that this book had in common with HP books: Rowling gave the young people the power to try and do something about their situation and, grown-ups are terrible.  The only people who found peace in the end were the dead.  I would have given this book five stars if Rowling would have done something horrible to Obbo. And maybe, the young people will learn from this tragedy and be better people than their parents. Now, I'm looking forward to Rowling's other adult book.

B004QYTRRS|5.0|But seriously I love this movie for all the reasons people hate it. I love the fact that it is essentially escapist and it has no redeeming value whatsoever. It is the accidental comedy movie, I don't care. I love it. I love the (Russo/Brosnan version) movie &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; for those same reasons, although this one wasn't as steamy which I actually like, it is really great movie to see when you just want to idle away an hour and a half doing nothing. One thing: Amazon needs to really back off with the you can only watch it online business. It kept stopping and loading every three to five minutes. It got rather annoying, if I hadn't seen it before I would have been angry. I have everything working fine on my end, so it has to be Amazon and they need to fix whatever the problem is, I know I am not the only one.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I have a weak spot for musicals.  Sure, they're often campy and over-the-top, but they're fun and often come with the bonus of great (or at least catchy) songs.  That's one of the main reasons I like so many of the classic Disney films, and am sort of disappointed that their later films seem to be veering away from the musical format.  In fact, musicals in general seem to have fallen out of favor with the general public, and it's rare anymore to see a movie musical in theaters.  Luckily, most of the good musicals out there are already available in DVD format, so they can be still be enjoyed even if the musical is becoming a dying art form in Hollywood.<br /><br />\\"Little Shop of Horrors,\\" while not a classic, is still a fun camp musical, and this movie version is one of the better transitions of a musical from stage to screen, helped by a strong cast, good special effects, and a macabre sense of humor.<br /><br />Seymour is a shy and nerdy employee at a failing flower shop, chafing under the reign of his tyrannical boss and longing for his lovely but equally meek co-worker Audrey, who herself is trapped in a loveless relationship with a sadistic dentist.  When Seymour happens upon an unusual plant and brings it into the shop, business picks up and the shop becomes a success... but only Seymour knows the truth about the plant -- that it requires human blood to thrive.  Eventually the planet reveals that it's not only sentient, but sassy and every bit as domineering as his old boss.  When the plant begins demanding flesh instead of blood, at first it seems to be the solution to Seymour and Audrey's problems... but the planet has its own terrible agenda, and Seymour and Audrey may not live to warn the world about the threat it poses.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie have held up well over time, and while some might claim the plant looks too \\"puppety,\\" I find I prefer physical puppetry over CGI.  Somehow the puppet plant looks more realistic than CGI could have been, and it doesn't jar the viewer out of the story.  That and it's quite hilarious seeing the actors interact with the plant, treating it as just another actor instead of a special effect.<br /><br />The acting itself is pretty good, and helps carry the film.  Rick Moranis does a wonderful job of playing an awkward but lovable nerd as Seymour, and Ellen Greene is adorable as Audrey.  Steve Martin seems to be enjoying himself way too much as the evil dentist, his every move exaggerated and every line belted out with lip-smacking maliciousness.  Bill Murray has a memorable cameo as a masochist who finds his way into Martin's office, and the singing trio who plays the Greek Chorus in this film slips into the film from time to time as nurses, employees, and street kids, delivering their own humorous commentary.<br /><br />While the singing itself isn't exactly a masterpiece (Rick Moranis and Steve Martin sure try but aren't exactly the next Josh Groban, though Ellen Greene has quite a set of pipes on her), the songs themselves are incredibly catchy and full of dark humor.  Steve Martin and the plant get two of the best numbers of the film in \\"Dentist\\" and \\"Feed Me,\\" though the plant's other number, \\"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\\" is somewhat annoying in my opinion.  (Oddly enough, this number wasn't in the original musical and was added in for the movie -- coincidence?)<br /><br />Sadly, the version of the film I watched doesn't include the alternate ending -- a much darker ending was filmed but cut out and replaced when it bombed with test audiences.  I'm rather curious about how the original ending played out, and will have to look for another version of the film to see how it went.<br /><br />Dark, campy, and a ton of fun, this is a definite must-have for musical fans and fans of '50s-style schlock horror movies.  Especially good for fans of \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" with the added bonus that this one can be watched with kids in the room (though I'd use caution playing it for any kid under 8 or 9).e caution playing it for any kid under 8 or 9).

B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Nirvana's final tour concert, filmed on December 13th, 1993, is finally available in it's entirety for the first time on DVD. Of all of Nirvana's shows, not counting the untouchable Unplugged performance, this would have to be my favorite. The band blazes no-holds-bar from the start and doesn't let up. Kurt was at his peak creatively and the band had never sounded more full, partly because of the addition of ex-Germ's guitarist Pat Smear. The songs from their latest outing In Utero sound especially good live. Though this concert is now considered a classic, it is also a somber one watching now knowing what would transpire in the coming months. What makes this already perfect DVD even better is the extras. Rehearsals before the show, some live TV spots and footage from the bands final show in Munich, Germany. Also included is the original and director's cut of the Heart Shaped Box video. So if you're a fan of Nirvana, or just grew up during this short-lived era of musical genius, this purchase should be a no brainer.

B0052REUW0|4.0|This is an important and thought provoking work.  If it is not perfect, it is because Prof. Pinker  attempts to make everything and the kitchen sink  fit into his thesis.  For example, his  blind  praise of  the international regime against the spread of chemical weapons seems a bit foolish in light of recent events in Syria.  Also in his need to stress the violence in the Bible he blatantly overlooks its moral and ethical impulses.  The injunction to  beat your  swords into plougshares wasn't invented over a cup of tea but  promoted in Judea over two thousand years ago.  History has many more zigs and  zags than Prof. Pinker suggests; the book however  is  persuasive in its thesis that there are discernible trends towards  less violance. Let us pray that these impulses win out over the other ones.

B008D28HYS|4.0|This game is fun and a bit challenging, though it can also get easy at times.  You fill in colored squares to make a picture.  Where the colors go is told to you by numbers on the side.  Though, once you get an idea as to what the picture is, you can pretty much fill it in without the numbers.  However, not all of the puzzles are this way because not all of the pictures are that clear.<br /><br />I've found one issue with this app:<br /><br />The tutorial is very badly written.  It has multiple typos.  It can be difficult enough sometimes to learn a puzzle game that you don't need to first have to be able to decipher what the tutorial is trying to tell you because somebody doesn't know how to proofread.  This is inexcusable and was worth me taking a star off of my rating.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a very good app.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Boy,, was this a long time coming.<br /><br />I want to start by saying I truly respect Portnoy as a drummer and also his decision to leave the band to pursue his own creative direction, but what his departure has done to the band is absolutely amazing! Mike Mangini is an ANIMAL on the drums in this new album! I was excited to hear him play in a ADToE (and he was a monster, live) but he's completely unleashed himself in this album. The crazy fills and the ever-changing time signatures just don't stop! My only gripe is with the production - I do agree with what a few of the reviewers said about the over-compressed sound, I would have liked to hear a slightly warmer sound and a little more echo out of the drums.<br /><br />As far as the album itself is concerned, this is probably the tightest album since the 6DoIT and SFAM days. You hear a lot of the old chops (even from as far back as \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\") interspersed with homages to Rush, Metallica and some of the 90's era bands, with a layer of classic 80's metal riffs thrown in for good measure. It gets clear rather quickly into the listen that the band's focus on prog is back and here to stay. The virtuosity in this album is simply astounding and Mangini's influence on the songwriting is evident (and refreshing). Myung and Mangini totally shine in this album, but that doesn't take away from Petrucci's flawless guitar playing. There's a good mix of shredding and melodic passages that makes this album very accessible across the entire spectrum of DT fans. And their one radio friendly song on this album, \\"Along for the Ride\\" is probably one of the best radio friendly songs I've heard from DT in a while.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very strong album - and each song stands on its own as a work of art. It does take about 2-3 listens to fully appreciate the nuances, but it will get amply clear why DT are the undisputed Gods of Prog.<br /><br />My favorite tracks (and trust me, every single song is amazing):<br/><br />Behind The Veil<br />Surrender to Reason<br />Illumination Theory<br /><br />Can't wait for the North American tour dates to come out - I'll be in the front row for this one!

B00F52YOPA|5.0|\\"Home Makeover\\" is a bit different from most hidden object games that I've played, but I enjoyed it. There's a backstory about young Emma trying to fix up an old house. To get the money for new furnishings, she has to find lists of hidden objects to sell, then choose which furnishings to buy. There are also some bonus games that pop up every few levels, although you can skip them if you like (but you can earn bonus points with the games). You can play with a timer running, or you can play in the \\"relaxed\\" mode. I preferred the relaxed mode, but to be more competitive, you can play against the timer.<br /><br />It's definitely different from most hidden object games, but it works for me.

B00DHHWYAW|1.0|I've seen all his other movies more than once and enjoyed them immensely, but TGG feels as if an intern or group of interns who didn't really understand his style copied it. The result is a frantic mess, and I agree with the critics who said it was sound and fury, signifying nothing.  First, Toby McGuire is dreadful in this part (and often in other roles), and so my ears felt assaulted by his callow whine every time he spoke or narrated.  The much-ballyhooed opulence of the film feels like second-hand Moulin Rouge run through a blender, a slumgullion of \\"techniques\\" that don't tell an even mildly interesting story.  And the framing narrative is so badly done at first I hoped it almost classifies as camp. You know how bad it is the *third* time confetti starts falling during the lavish party scene.  Doesn't matter that it's differently shaped. And relying on fireworks? Tacky.  It's not surprising TGG did better abroad; so do the big, showy, dumb movies made from comics.
B00DMEQP46|2.0|(OK, apologies for the terrible pun)<br /><br />The album vacillates between progressive rock and noise pop. Mostly sounds like a mixed-tape made up of rejected Flaming Lips and Animal Collective songs. It certainly doesn't succeed as a pop album in the way that 'Oracular Spectacular' did, and it also lacks the focus of 'Congratulations'. I don't find it especially interesting as a piece of psychedelia either. I will probably listen to it every once in a blue moon when I want something a bit different, but I find myself mostly disappointed with this outing.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|got it on a timely manner but 2 of the dics in the collection were messed up and not working. AND on TOP of that, its missing one whole last disc! when  u put the last disc inside, it does not play the episodes. I tried to contact this company for refund but they don't answer back
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Loved the first season!  So suspenseful.  It's like watching a movie, not a tv show.<br /><br />Also, I love the romance between Brody and Carrie.<br /><br />You are always left wanting more. :)
B00006IUL6|5.0|Al Pacino and Martin Donovan play LAPD detectives headed very north to help out an old friend.  The small town Nightmute, Alaska, has just lost one of it's young citizens to a violent killer and the locals could use some help catching the guy.  But that's not all as Pacino's character is quite possibly dodging an internal affairs investigation back home, one that is complicated when his partner states his intention to testify to protect his family.  During a subsequent chase through the Alaskain wilderness, Pacino accidentally shoots and kills his partner and, knowing that the circumstances will cause everyone to doubt him, blames it on the killer.  Hillary Swank plays a local cop assigned to the case to make sure everything is in order when the killer's caught and brought to trial and Robin Williams plays the killer, who saw everything that happened out in the woods.  Williams proceeds to taunt Pacino with this information, seeking to beat a murder charge.  This is a thrilling film with a top-notch catch.  Despite his short stint on the screen, Donovan has great chemistry with Pacino.  The two aren't life partners or anything, but when it comes to their jobs, they feel they can count on each other...at least before they got to Alaska.  It's cool to see Robin Williams playing an antagonist once in a while and he certainly makes the most of his role.  Hillary Swank fits in perfectly as the rookie cop in a small, middle-of-nowhere town who idolizes Pacino (who wouldn't) and only seeks to do right by him.  Again, this is a thrilling film and it's worth adding to your collection.  It doesn't matter what actors and actress in Hollywood you like...chances are at least one of them is in this film.  Enjoy.

B000055Y0Y|5.0|First off, we never do learn the President's name, except for his Secret Service codename \\"Traveler\\".  I guess that jives with the philosphy expressed by Clint Eastwood's character of never getting to know who you're protecting as you might not want to take a bullet for them then.  So I can live with not knowing.  Otherwise, this is an excellent film...the real-life Secret Service certainly thought so.  Clint Eastwood plays the agency's only remaining active agent who was on duty during the Kennedy assasination back in 1963, 30 years before this film.  Now, he's pulled out of his life working undercover to bust counterfeiters to investigate a threat on the current President.  This threat comes in the form of John Malkovich, who begins a series of mindgames with Eastwood and the Secret Service that begin with him calling himself \\"Booth\\" in a nod to the Lincoln assasination...he also knows plenty about Kennedy's death, so it's imediatly obvious that the man has a strange hobby.  Malkovich has played his fair share of villains, but many of them could take lessons from the character in this film.  Too many times we see a person so evil that they become  something like Dr. Hannibal Lector.  But John Malkovich does not slide down that slippery slope and remains his own man  with his own agenda and headgames.  It is a performance that Mr. Malkovich should definetly always keep on his resume.  Clint Eastwood is no slouch on his end.  John Malkovich is looking for an equal in his \\"game\\" and Eastwood provides it.  Now aged a bit since 1963 (hey, they put the actor's real age to good use) he steps up to the plate and keeps up step for step while remaining perfectly frustrated that he can't get ahead of this maniac.  The diolog between these two men is one of the best parts of this exciting film.  Dylan McDermott works alongside Eastwood as his young, somewhat uncertain partner and Rene Russo plays the young man's counterpart on the President's protection detail.  Thankfully the film only spent little time on any sort of romantic elements between Eastwood and Russo...it's the one part I could have done completely without.  While we see little of the President (the film isn't about him, remember) we do see a fair bit of Fred Dalton Thompson (is he in the Senate while they made this movie?) as the President's high-strung Chief of Staff.  I always enjoy seeing Thompson around and this film is no different...I would have liked to have seen more of him.  This is an awsome film and worth keeping around to watch again and again...and again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the whole series and loved it.  Looking forward to the next movie and hope it won't take long for the next.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This film went beyond any concerns I had about it not having a plot worth keeping up with...in fact, it completely destroyed those notions (Thank God!)  Denzel Washington plays a pilot with a serious drug and alcohol problem who nevertheless manages to guide a plane smoothly through some serious turbulance and later crash-lands it when the machine's engines fail, preventing what would have otherwise been a horrif disaster.  However, his heroic efforts are forgotten when a blood test taken while he was unconscious in the hospital after the crash shows that he had been drinking and doing drugs before takeoff.  Now faced with the very real possibility of losing and going to prison, Washington turns to his friend, a union representative played by Bruce Greenwood, and an attorney played by Don Cheadle to get him out of this mess while still keeping in touch with his friend, a drug dealer played by John Goodman (a likable drug dealer...who'd have thought...)  Along the way, Washington's character, who has one marriage already behind him, meets a recovering addict played by Kelly Reilly who has her own demons to deal with.  This film succeeds largely because we can be drawn in by Denzel Washington's performance of a man we can't exactly like but nonetheless want to root for.  All the cast work together nicely even when their characters don't and this film isn't the crash it portrays.  It's definetely worth watching.  Enjoy.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|A great  compilation of old favorites and brand new stuff written by Alan himself! He's got the sound and definitley the musicians. So glad to see new music, and I do mean music, come out that is still real, and not this  so-called today's country music! Would love to see more and more of it from different artists.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|This is no flashy action thriller or tragec romantic film.  This is the story about the humanity of man and being judged by one's worst deed...or as the trailer puts it:  about looking into the eyes of a killer and finding the heart of a man.  Adapted from the best-selling non-fiction book, this film puts forth a valid arguement of why capital punishment is not the answer for society's worst of the worst.  Sean Penn sits on Death Row in Louisiana, awaiting his execution for a brutal rape and double murder, a crime for which his partner got life behind bars.  Susan Sarandon, a nun, comes to meet with him and her eyes are opened up as the days tick down towards his scheduled execution.  Becoming his spiritual advisor in the final days, she sees the mechinations and procedures set in place for putting a human being to death.  She also meets the people who are involved in the process, those who oppose the punishment, and those who favor it, like the victims' families.  She must now find a way to understand the pain felt by both sides of the case and help Penn's character come to terms with what is happening to him in the hopes that he might then be able to find God before his time is up.  This powerful film can serve as a teaching tool about capital punishment and it can be enjoyed and talked about within the privacy of one's home...or it can just be enjoyed.  Both Sarandon and Penn give terrific performances as they spend almost the entire film sperated by bulletproof barriers inside the prison.  Their intamacy must be felt without the two of them ever touching one another and both actors pull that off successful.  So go and get this film to keep around for your viewing pleasure.

1620402963|5.0|William Boyd's Restless won the Costa Novel Award in 2006, and when I found a copy in our small library in Sicily (it had probably been left by a guest), I decided I had to read it.  The reviews on the cover were effusive in their praise.  For example, The Times was quoted on the front cover as saying: \\"Boyd is a first-rate storyteller and this is a first-rate story . . . An utterly absorbing page-turner.\\"<br /><br />The setting of the novel is the early years of World War II, when Britain and Russia were fighting against Nazi Germany alone, and the US had not entered the war.  The central female characters are Eva Delectorskaya and her daughter, Ruth.  The chapters alternate between Ruth telling her side of the story, in the first person, from 1947 onwards, and Eva's story being told in the third person from 1935 until 1941.  Ruth does not know her mother as Eva; she knows her as Sally Gilmartin, n&eacute;e Fairchild.  She also didn't know that her mother was half Russian, half English, and was living in Paris, age 28, when the war broke out in 1939.  The principal male character is Lucas Romer, who recruits Eva into a special branch of the British Secret Service.  Eva is beautiful and fluent in Russian, English and French.  After being recruited and trained in Scotland, one expects that Eva will be parachuted into France to work alongside the French resistance.  But we learn - partly through the files that Eva/Sally passes to her daughter and partly from Eva herself - that she has been recruited into an organisation which attacks Germany through the media.  The stories that the organisation places are sometimes fabrications and sometimes exaggerations or little-noticed Nazi misdeeds. In 1940, the organisation, including Lucas and Eva, move to New York City, where their focus shifts to persuading a reluctant American people to join the war against Germany.  Eva and Lucas become lovers, and for Eva, Lucas is the perfect secret agent: brilliant, and devious, but devastatingly attractive.  Of course, they succeed in persuading the White House to go to war, but just before Pearl Harbor, Eva is sent on a mission during which she is nearly killed.  Suspecting everyone, including Lucas, she goes onto hiding: first in Canada and then in England.  Years later, as an old woman, she persuades Ruth to help her unmask the traitor.<br /><br />What could be a better story?<br /><br />What I particularly liked about it was the subversive activity involving the use of the media.  One wouldn't expect media people to be literally assassins, but when one is a traitor and one has to prevent something from happening, one uses strong measures.  The daughter who doesn't know the truth about her mother, who discovers it during the course of the novel, and who collaborates with her in realising the conclusion, is another appealing feature.  The story is very well-written - not in a literary style - but in straight-forward, clear language.<br /><br />The only faults I could find were what seemed to be a little bit of `filler material' about Ruth's occupation: teaching English as a second language to business people.  I also wasn't clear about what actually happened during Ruth's nearly-fatal mission.  Somehow, it didn't all fit together.<br /><br />But having said that Restless is a first rate thriller, and if you decide to pick it up, be sure you haven't any pressing engagements: it's difficult to put it down.gly attractive.

B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book!  I thought it was going to be a rip off of Fifty Shades, but it totally is not.  I do have to say that while I loved, loved, loved FSOG, I believe this series holds its own!
1476727651|4.0|I am only about fifty pages into \\"Doctor Sleep\\" and I have greatly enjoyed every word so far. Among other things, the ghost of the creepy, decaying old woman from Room 217 makes an early re-appearance in \\"Doctor Sleep\\" (if any of you don't recall her from the Kubrick version of \\"The Shining,\\" she was the ghost who tricked Jack Nicholson into French kissing her dead carcass).  Dick Halloran is also back, and as wonderful as before.  The \\"True Knot\\" villains of the story remind me of the Gypsy family in \\"Thinner,\\" only much creepier.  I just loved the movie theater scene where they make their first appearance, as well as the ensuing scene of what they do to their first \\"victim,\\" who they meet there.<br /><br />I do wonder if the 1-star and 2-star reviews have discouraged some people from reading this novel.  Am I the only person who suspects that some of those reviews are written by the same person? There seems to be some kind of agenda there. I am also currently reading, and nearing the end of, \\"Night Film.\\"  I noticed the same thing there.  To those considering reading either \\"Doctor Sleep\\" or \\"Night Film,\\" I encourage you to be your own judge rather than let those people negatively influence you.  But, if they have at least partially accomplished their goal of dissuading others from reading this novel, and if you thus are still plagued by doubts, stop in a Barnes and Noble or other book store and read a couple of chapters.  Trust me, the great majority of you will be quickly hooked.<br /><br />I am also very, very impressed by the quality of King's prose, which, as difficult as it may seem, is better than ever.  In reading reviews of \\"Night Film\\" (both on Amazon and in magazines, including some so-called \\"artsy\\" ones), some people appear to think that the author of \\"Night Film\\" has written a \\"literary\\" masterpiece, comparing Stephen King unfavorably to her.  Literary snobs will probably hate this, but while I do agree that she is an excellent, above par writer (though her prose hardly compares to Charles Frazier's prose in \\"Cold Mountain\\" or Annie Proulx in \\"The Shipping News\\"), I do not feel that she is any better of a writer than Stephen King.  And she certainly is no match for him as a storyteller.  But who is?  Academic snobs in particular will probably never give him his just due, which is sad.  Because, IMO, Stephen King is one of the greatest storytellers of all time.<br /><br />I sure hope Hollywood is at least in the pre-production stage of turning this novel into a movie.  If not, Mr. King, light a fire under them.  Uh, figuratively, (g).<br /><br />Gary P. Landry, author of \\"The Bridge Tender\\" (a murder mystery/thriller/courtroom drama set during the early months of the Civil War and dealing with the utter stupidity of bigotry), and \\"River of Mist and Light\\" (a contemporary murder mystery/thriller set in New Orleans and the nearby river parishes).
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Great movie! I've been waiting a long time for some really cool and different zombie movie. Finally the dead are no longer slow walking brain seeking zombies that seem to be very easy to kill. This movie follows most rules about zombies and changing a few things, making the dead look rerally dangerous. It's a very nice movie to see!
B00D1QBQ2G|5.0|Only a few days ago I was just listening to Philippe Jaroussky´s new ERATO cd devoted to arias composed for Farinelli, and now the young Argentinian countertenor Franco Fagioli essays the music of Farinelli´s great rival Caffarelli. This castrato must have been quite a character. Most castrati came from poor families who saw in musical talented children the opportunity to get rich. This was certainly not the case of Gaetano Majorano born in 1710. His grandmother left him 2 vineyards which produced enough money to let him study whatever he pleased, but he loved music so much that at age 10 he INSISTED on being castrated...and castrated he was.<br />Like Farinelli, he studied with Nicola Porpora at the San Onofrio Conservatory in Naples. Porpora described him as the finest singer ever born in Italy, and very soon he was a musical sensation all over Europe.<br />His problem was his capricious and diva-like personality, at his worst he was a nightmare, insulting everyone and making everybody miserable, but he must have been so good that even Handel composed for him Serse and Faramondo, (yes, he was the first to sing \\"Ombra mai fu\\").<br />The nickname of Caffarelli came from one of his most important patrons, a certain gentleman named Caffaro, and even Charles Burney, who heard him when he was long past his prime, described him as an exquisite, marvelous singer.<br />Franco Fagioli is also a prodigious, marvelous singer and a vocal phenomenon. He´s been singing for a while now, and has several recordings behind him, but it was with last year´s Artaserse by Leonardo Vinci that he was catapulted to stardom because of some of the most spectacular countertenor singing ever caught on disc. This new recital is absolutely amazing, what Fagioli does is unheard of in what we understand is countertenor singing. During a Harmonia Mundi meeting I attended in Arles, René Jacobs told me that he preferred females in castrato bravura roles, because the countertenor voice was so limited and fragile, and of course he was right. If you listen to David Daniels singing Rinaldo in the Hogwood recording the bravura arias are not really satisfactory, the vocal range is missing. But Fagioli has a unique voice, the high notes are fantastic, almost to the point of being unbelievable, but he is not only a vocal freak, the musicianship is outstanding and he has the gift of being spectacular without being circus-like, this is virtuoso singing to rival Marilyn Horne or Joyce DiDonato.<br />The music is superb, we get some arias by Hasse, Leo, Porpora, Pergolesi, Vinci and Manna, and even though there´s no Handel, we are grateful that most of these arias are recorded for the first time. The marvelous ensemble Il Pomo d´Oro gives excellent support, with stunning trumpet and oboe solos. All in all this a vocal display that must have left the great countertenors of the previous generation like James Bowman, Michael Chance, Paul Esswood and Rene Jacobs open mouthed in disbelief.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I saw previous movies in the series and therefore I didn't think I should've expected much from this movie. But to be honest I had quite a good time watching this movie. It was funny, entertaining and actors were just right. The acting for quite good and even when the Americans were speaking Russian, it was nearly completely good. There were very few moments when the speech weas nearly unrecognizable but it wasn't the same like in other Hollywood movies where  it was so awful. This movie definitely deserves 5 stars because it was so completely different. It's like whoever made made the movie, actually cared for it and hence the outcome. Great movie. I liked Tom Cruise in it a lot! It's like he changed in a very good way.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This picture is the antitheses of modern, action filled, meaningless movies. If you are tired of the superficiality of the cash hungry productions and have the time and peace of mind to sit and watch without needing something to pull you out of the chair to stay awake,its for you.<br />Some people miss the central point and fail to relate to the theme. Its about romance versus routine, desire versus obligation. I loved it.

B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Very stupid movie. I really can't say more than that because that pretty much sums up this movie. A lot of usually very good actors that have been given pretty lame characters with lame lines in a movie with a very weak and unbelievable plot. I am very surprised that these actors actually did this movie. The studio must have paid them a lot to get them to do this weak movie. I could tell within the first 10 minutes of the movie that I was not going to like it, unfortunately I kept hoping that it would get better and watched the whole thing. Even the &#34;twist&#34; at the end was stupid.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I loved this when i first watched and loved it the second time around  waiting to get the next season
0761169253|5.0|This book was a life-saver for me. I know that sound super cliche but it really is. It's cute, funny, unique and well-written, and it doesn't give you any BS. It tells you how things really art when being creative in this world, and also tells you that it's okay. You don't have to be the most amazing artist in the world, or the best sounding musician or the most prolific writer to be an amazing creative person. And it also helps motivate you to do better, get better and work harder and more often. I love this book and I carry it around with me and re-read it when I need some inspiration.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I purchased this item because I thought it would work like a Roku. It does not. You have to have either your laptop or your cell phone to control it. You can only watch Netflix, Youtube, and Google supported items. I gave it away.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I purchased this watch a little over a month ago, and it's a pleasure to wear.  Comfortable, looks sharp.  Sure it doesn't keep time like a quartz or higher-end automatic, but I don't mind since I like having an excuse to adjust the time on it periodically.  I only wish it had a screw-down crown that wasn't so hard to grip, on the other hand the low-profile of the crown is somewhat nice.  For it's look and build quality, I prefer this watch over many others that are in the $300+ price range.
B00F91H15W|5.0|I have been waiting months for this to finally come out since I don't go see movies in the theater and it definitely did not let me down! It's deep, funny and Emma Watson does a great job in this. Not a family movie that's for sure but very well thought out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What can I say. Worked out of the box as advertised; hopefully more apps soon to be added. This is worth a lot more than $35.00
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie really spoke to me about how the Help influenced these generations. The characters are very believable and likable.
B007LB2B3K|4.0|The album has good sound and quality and the band is good all around. This is their first album I have owned by them.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|This movie will keep you tense until the end. It is one from the vault that needs to come back out.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|I got this book for free, and for that price it's hard to be dissatisfied. That said, I agree with other reviewers that this is pretty basic information. There are also issues with organization, and the style isn't very engaging. If you really want to learn techniques for meeting people that are easy to implement, I'd definitely recommend Leil Lowndes books, such as &#34;How to Talk to Anyone&#34;.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I just got Facebook and I am learning how to use it. It has been a good way to talk to people close to you and your family members that are somewhat close and those who are not.
B002VISN9E|5.0|Was good. Has a good time reading it. So you should read it too. This is not the end lol
B00DNDR29I|2.0|I wanted to like Janelle Monae so badly that I overlook that main entity that you need to be an artist, which is talent. She's just missing something as an artist, a songstress. Maybe the generic lyrics, or her bland voice. I just can't figure out what it is. Unfortunately, I don't think she'll ever evolve as a musician.  She does present something new and fresh to R&B. Just a take on the old and the new. Having said that, I think her fans are more in love with her style, personality, and message than her music. Fans are making her more than what she is. Yeah, she is tackling serious issues, so have many others. The message she puts forth to the younger crowd is commendable.  Her music is great workout music, and that's it. Dance Apocalyptic, Ghetto Woman, We Were Rock & Roll, are fun songs, but I have to say, a little cliche. The intimate love songs, ex: &#34;Can't live without your love&#34;, &#34;Primetime&#34; felt stiff, and unemotional. On the other hand, a terrible copy of Michael Jackson style, and singing tones in &#34;Its code&#34;, Eh. I can go on, and on, these are just a few examples.  I think she focuses on style and trying so hard to be so disparate, that ends up being nothing different, than a bad female version, of Andre 3000. Where is the originality?  See the problem with music today, it is hard to be original. I get that. However at the same time, these new artist aren't even trying. Its as if they watched MTV, Vh1, BET, and tried they're hardest to imitate what they saw, when they were younger. Which is normal, but to be a true artist, you have to take it to another level; And this generation isn't doing that. Unfortunately, Janelle Monae falls into that category, however, she has the potential to stand out.  In her defense, I hear her live performances add finesse, to her artistry; which is part of a great artist, but her music, is just average.  I'll give it Janelle Monae, she's better than many artist who acclaimed fame for absolutely nothing. I don't want to be marked as hater, as another reviewer quoted but come guys, her music is cheesy. If this is something you enjoy, enjoy it.
B003477DVK|5.0|This was a great movie, based on  true life events.  It catches your heart.  You don't want to miss it.
B00006I53S|3.0|I own 8 different Canon lenses.<br />This lens does 'everything', from Macro, to wide angle landscapes, to 50mm - 85mm portraits, to telephoto.<br />Yes, there are faster lenses for photographing weddings in a dark chapel, there are longer telephotos, but this lens does a bit of everything.<br />The drawback is that this is the only Canon lens I have ever owned that has to be refurbished every couple years.<br />Three times this had to be sent back because the auto-focus and Image Stabilization failed.<br />Canon used to charge $82 to bring the lens back to factory specs, but as of Sept 2013 Canon is charging $210 to fix the lens.<br />And with the way Canon is raising the repair costs, in 2015, it will probably cost $325 to have the auto-focus and Image Stabilization fixed again.<br />No other Canon lens that I own has ever needed to be repaired, but this lens has required three separate factory fixin' to bring it to factory specs.<br />Discussing this with Canon Customer Service, their response is 'That is the way it is. If you can make the auto-focus and image stabilization stop working in 6 months, we fix it for free, but if it takes 12 months for this lens to stop working, we charged you again and again and again to bring it back to working condition.'
B00FFVML74|5.0|Amazing ending to a great drama. The ending blew me away how it brought all the episodes together with intensity and a sense of reality with superb acting from all of the actors.<br />You have to watch it and experience it. British television rocks!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|wake me up every morning. amazing app for notification or a wake up call every day tlyou can set days it goes off
B000AP04FG|5.0|It's the Sunnydale reviewer, sorry this one is so late! Again I'm having So much fun with Halloween this year I had to celebrate early planning my Illyria stories with costumes (celebrate the holiday for more then 1 day) okay movie. One of my favorite things; casting. They just make the best spy couple, me and my friends have been talking about this for days I've even been writing story parts for the ballroom scene for like 3 stories. I thought that joke where Brad said he had an ex(although no offense cause I like those actresses....not her exes though) and she said jokingly that he was her problem then asked for the address and he jokingly said no you're not going to kill her...plus that's during an awesome fight scene!  And I liked that they actually did know that they were spies (plus even in a movie how could you not) I thought Brad Pitts best friend was really funny...You live with your mom....carrying joke. And I thought that ballroom scene was great, and kinda batman returns like....with the knife in that Brad threw in the wall during the sexy spy dance....then we find out they're gonna stay together....(good cause I really liked those two together in this movie.) But I'm not done, not just yet I have a few more parts I liked. First there's the elevator scene. That is so funny I grew up on that joke (corny music in a dramatic scene) when I was a kid. The fight scene that follows(which I really dug) and that funny ending. That's my latest review, thanks for reading!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This story was truly magical, with things happening that are beyond the realm of &#34;NORMAL&#34;...<br />Then, at the end, I felt let down, as the two star-crossed lovers maybe got together, yet I felt they weren't in this dimension...(more like the girl's father, who kept coming into the story, like a spirit...No early explanation, except they all had powers that I could not understand.  Plus, the circus kept appearing, all set up, as if by magic...and so drab, with just black and graaays, and white, and often fires burning...Just too strange for me.<br />Susan
B008YRVW0I|2.0|The game is fun until you get a screen that will not allow you to proceed without further purchase. It is frustrating to play a game, attain a certain level and be stopped from finishing.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Elen DeGeneres is truly a funny person...but it was tiresome to stay with her book.  I would read some, then put it away, and pick it up for  another treat, much later...<br />It was not my usual pick for a book...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The characters are wonderful. It is a very moving and thought provoking story which I found it hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this on my tablet to entertain my step son who is 3. It ended up entertaining my 13 year old (who never leaves his xbox)  and myself :) was just a lot of fun
B004YKSXYW|4.0|This is an interesting resource and its availability in a digital format is useful and flexible.  You will find it a valuable addition.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|What a fun, upbeat Christmas movie.  We cook all day Christmas Eve, every body is tired, time to wind down.  Simple, funny and touches the heart movie.  PS...we also have on our Christmas list of must watch:  Love Actually, Home Alone and The Family Stone.  If time in between events...The Christmas Story, Miracle on 34th Street, The Grinch That Stole Christmas, It's a Wonderful Life.
B00EQRP5LW|5.0|This is an excellent album with high quality love music! This album covers the broad spectrum of love topics. I would highly recommend this album to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a really good book and basic look at when the mind goes.  It touches the heart practically and simply.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I actually enjoyed this book. I don't get the negative comments regarding this book. In my opinion, this book was a complete enjoyment. However, I couldn't tolerate the way how he was speaking to her but overall the book was pretty decent to me.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved this book, even though sad in parts it really grabs the reader to continue anxious to see what lies ahead for characters.  Very good book, I haven't read this author before but am eager to look at other books by her.
B000HZD168|5.0|This was the best of the first Star Trek series. I've watch it multiple times and enjoyed each showing as if it was the first time I watched it.
B006QKKMBA|5.0|I have been a fan of the Final Destination series, and now I have the entire set after adding this to my collection!!  Of course, the twist shown in this movie really shocked me.  But it was a good shock!!
0395240050|1.0|It was very old and on the inside cover had a marking that it sold for $2.99 when purchased for $15. Looks NOTHING like the picture.
B008469DGY|4.0|I'm not good at real golf, but I'm pretty good at this. It is a good stress relief and my kids like it too.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|This is one of those movies that tries to awe you with cheap tricks and visuals to distract you from the terrible movie that this is.<br /><br />The movie starts out incredibly interesting, banding together 4 skilled illusionists/magicians, and prepares you for what you'd think will be an interesting ride.  Half way through you realize that there's literally...zero plot.  The entire movie is one giant chase scene.<br /><br />The cast and acting is decent.  I love Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson, but overall it's very unimpressive.  The twist at the end is so incredibly dumb, the fact that it's done as dramtically as it is makes me think the producers of the movie know how bad this is and are playing up the joke.<br /><br />I'll sum up the type of people that'll like this movie.  If you're over 21 and go to July 4th parties FOR THE FIREWORKS, you'll like it.  If you're a normal person who outgrew the awe of fireworks as a teenager, don't waste your time with this.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app. It makes texting so much easier and faster. I love that this app learns my texting habits. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I have this game oj the xbox reeally fun Thoth get this app now now its cool to<br />reeeeeeeeeeellyl awesome I Egon got it on my phone
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I adore this whole series!  It is suspensful and creative!  I can't stop watching once i've started.  JUST WATCH IT!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We love the book and the movie! Great costume design and amazing locations! I love that this was free with Amazon Prime-- great deal!
B001NLL93W|4.0|I normally do not read series but I am enjoying this one and all of its colorful characters. I am looking forward to the next one.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Amazon Pros: Way cool that they shipped this a week before originally promised!  Also, despite being months after the first edition release, what I received is in fact that first edition figure (as of 9/27/13 - not sure if subsequent orders will include these First Edition bonus parts).<br /><br />Amazon Cons: Like other customers have noted, the box is kinda pushed around and the seal was already opened.  I expect this is due to being an imported product, but I haven't seen this complaint elsewhere.  Not an issue for me, as all the figure's parts are present and fully functional, but be warned if a box's pristine condition is one of your must-haves.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Figure Pros: Lovely colors, wonderfully posable and full of fun, expressive gesture-pose combinations. The pincher-stand allows you to tackle all kinds of crazy cool poses.  I was also impressed with their face-modeling, as it's such an awkward design to translate into 3D (in my opinion, they did a great job!). Looking forward to nabbing a Jupiter when she comes out.<br /><br />Figure Cons: There's some stray red paint on the top of her head (not a huge deal but for $40, I'd hoped it'd be cleaner).  As for the the joints, be aware that some parts (particularly hands) can slip off their pegs if not tightly secured.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Overall?  I like it a lot and wish this existed when I was a kid (but hey, it's never too late to play with toys!).
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I like the characters and although some of the story was predictable there was just enough twists to make it interesting.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This movie is great and i recommend everyone who hasn't seen it go watch it. It brings a more realistic theme to the &#34;super&#34; hero genre.  Its not as cerebral as the matrix but it sure is a good two hours of movie magic.  I love the reference to shawarma which was my daily diet in college.  So two things: watch this movie and go eat some shawarma.
B0055S348W|5.0|Exellent app found my printer instantly and printed without any issue. Unlike other apps I tried it this app was easy to setup well worth the money
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Use it as instructed for my Kindle HD Fire.fast charging & user friendly.Highly recommend. No issues at this time as far as I am concerned.
B009NQLT0M|4.0|I purchased this fan as a replacement cooling fan on my Ultimaker 3D printer. It more or less matches the airflow of the larger fan it replaced, but is lighter, smaller, and much, much quieter.<br /><br />My only complaint... and this may sound like a weird complaint... is that it comes with a ridiculous amount of stuff. It's packaged in a beautiful, resealable box filled with pamphlets, half a dozen optional wires, and several bags of additional connectors. All of which is now in the trash... because I just wanted a fan.  I appreciate wanting to emphasise quality in all aspects of your product, but the cost and waste of all that stuff is unnecessary and makes me feel like a dick when I then just toss it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It passes time while waiting I wish there were hints in certain areas though but over all its a pretty cool game
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Engaging, thought provoking, an excellent read!  Very easy to relate to.  Speaks to issues I have dealt with my whole business career.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this product! It is the perfect solution to listening to my favorite artists anytime,anywhere! I am no longer chained to the local radio stations!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is so interesting; keeps you on your toes, keeps you guessing. It's scary, but not insanely so. Very good, me and my friends love it!
B005DZMNHA|4.0|New tunes,good energy from the standard that we have come to respect and enjoy.Chris does a great job on it.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|Excellent movie one of my top favorites of all time<br />Excellent movie one of my top favorites of all time
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game. Wonderful for killing time . I play in the Dr.'s office it keeps me busy so i don't get upset with the waiting give it a try it works for me.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|In the beginning its great, now even pressing the search button crashes the app. Reinstalling only moved the problem to page scrolling. This app crashes WAY too much!
B00EJ9RIXA|1.0|Just overall not good.  Use the web interface instead.  The mobile web interface on my Kindle is much better and more closely resembles the one on my computer.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I was entertained throughout.  I hope some of the negative reviewers make a film soon...I would hate to see all that expertise go to waste.
B00005JLCI|1.0|This is the third Hamlet I've seen, having watched the BBC production with Jacobi and the older movie with Olivier.  From nearly the very beginning I found this a violent and bombastic interpretation, with Branaugh doing the worst acting of the whole group.  His hyped-up delivery was extremely wearing.  He seemed to mouth words he didn't understand.  Branaugh should have followed the advice his character gave to the actors in the play within the play.  While freedom of artistic vision is to be supported, this edition makes distasteful use of stereotypes.  The inclusion of gratuitous sexual elements did nothing for it.  The cameo appearances of numerous well-known actors was a distraction.  All in all, it put me in a very bad mood and was a waste of my time.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great season of Doctor Who; excellent quality video; no hitches or glitches or spooling...watched on iPad2 and will again soon.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This movie captures the flavor of some of the best moments in LA recording history, using historical video clips and interviews with the people who were there. Any fan of recording and music creation will love this.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I have read many books about North Korea over the years and this is definitely one of the best.  If you are interested by life in the DPRK, then you have to read this book.  North Korea is the exact opposite of the way it portrays itself to its people and outsiders.  There is no life experience quite like that of being a North Korean citizen.  The author captures life in the hermit Kingdom unlike any author has thus far.  I highly recommend this book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Every experiment worked but one and that had almost impossible odds. Loved it all. Gave me a whole new outlook on life just when I needed it most. Must have been one of the blessings from experiment #9.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Enjoyed the engaging story, the actors and the attention to detail. Graphics and sceanary where awesome.<br /><br />Hey Amazon, having to type a review (especially on tablet) takes too long and is a pain. You should follow Netflix lead and allow me to just give things a star rating and be done. Think customer convenience. And a star rating is better then no rating. I felt strongly enough about this to write all this!!!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Movie that was received skipped and had scratches when it was labeled as working and good condition. However the seller promptly returned my frustrated email and immediately issued a refund. Will buy from them again :)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love all the different types of hidden image levels like in the dark, silhouettes, morphs, etc. Awesomeness. Very unique. The only con is having to use &quot;energy&quot; to play.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I would LOVE to buy this book for everyone in my family all my friends! I WILL recommend this book to everyone I know. Eye opening and very helpful and written in a language that is easy to read and entertaining! Well done!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Prometheus seems to be either a prequel or a sequel to the Alien movies.  A ship is sent into space on a mission to discover the beginnings of mankind.  After landing on a planet, they do find a ship, but at first it appears no one is left alive.  Some of the crew are stuck in the ship at one point and encounter creatures that would have been better off left alone.  I don't want to give too much away because this is really a multi-layered story full of kind of interesting characters.  While the first Alien movies were more fun (with a better soundtrack to get your heart racing), this one is rather dark and the lead female is just plain morose...not like our Ripley!  The last 20 minutes make watching this movie worthwhile.  It would definitely be a Spoiler for me to tell you except that not EVERYONE was dead when our ship landed!  Some wonderful looking creatures!
B005LAIGSM|3.0|This shows the devastation caused when a loved one receives a brain injury (amnesia in this case).  Rachel McAdams is in a car accident and receives a brain injury that causes her retrograde amnesia, meaning she can't remember the last few years of her life (which happens to include a new boyfriend (Channing Tatum) whom she married!).  He is at a loss of how to handle this situation.  Her parents, who were estranged from their daughter before, try to use this opportunity to get back into her life by trying to take her home with them.  Luckily, the doctor says taking her into her most recent environment may help jog her memory...but that isn't as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />This causes some funny and some very sad situations.  Tatum's heart is breaking at every rejection from his impaired wife.  She begins to try to reconnect with her ex-fiance because he is a source of familiarity.  There are some great surprising twists we don't see coming.  This is a good romance film.  You are pulling for them to either reconnect, remember or fall in love again through the whole film.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was amazing! It's about Rowley falling in love with a girl who Jeff Kinney says he's married to now.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Absolutely loved the way it harked back to The Wrath of Kahn but with wonderful twists, always in keeping with the best of Star Trek and the working as a team idea.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|The plot thickens! Old friends and new. Magic may give characters power, but it looks like the power of love is the greatest magic.
0525478817|5.0|This was the very first thing I ever bought on amazon, hell, first thing I bought online. It was the first book by John Green I read and I recommend it to anyone. I've bought this book several times actually, and gifted them all. John's an amazing author, and I like how realistic his depictions of teens are. I love his characters and they're voices and quirks. They're believable and real and you love them.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It's not like it wasn't worth watching, but the majority of the movie took place in a single building with very little story around it.
B004GGTAQE|5.0|Unlike some of the other reviewers who have commented here, I read a lot *about* this book before actually deciding to read this book, and so I knew what I was getting into: a first-hand account by a legendary tanker of the second world war, written primarily for other tankers of the second world war.<br /><br />I almost gave the book four stars instead of five because, frankly, it's lacking in terms of accessibility. You will need to keep research materials (or at least Google) close at hand as you're reading, and you're going to be looking up a lot of stuff (like, &#34;what the hell is a Kubel?&#34;) if you want to get the full effect of the work, but I found added effort to be worthwhile.<br /><br />Carius's voice was surprisingly clear and compelling in this translation--and also surprisingly acerbic! His descriptions of combat and events are thick with sarcasm, at least as they are rendered here in English, and I found myself at once delighted by his tone and curious whether or not, and to what extent, it is present in the original German. Not that I was planning to learn German. The appendices in the last quarter of the book is exactly the sort of dry, blow-by-blow reports and technical data that I expected the entire book to be made of, but the rest of it is pretty darn entertaining.<br /><br />One caveat for those who are looking for vivid images of the armored battlefront: they just aren't here. Carius himself states that this manuscript was assembled for his peers rather than for the rest of us, and it is apparent that he doesn't feel his intended audience needs to be reminded about how things looked and felt. That said, if you are willing and able to read between the lines here and there, I doubt you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />A final note: I would very nearly recommend this book on the basis of its final few chapters alone because they paint a picture of the late war Western Front that I had never imagined before--indeed, that I didn't even realize was possible. The differences between the author's descriptions of the fighting on the Eastern Front and the last stand on the West are like night and day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a wonderful app. Not only is it eye appealing It's extremely functional. A must have app. You won't regret it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My lady enjoyed it take it anywhere digital nice she's a big fan wanted the book bus was sold out
B0000TAZBK|5.0|The package arrived very quickly. Thank you for the excellent service and reasonable price. I would recommend this to my friends..
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Never get tired of watching Dr. Who. Entertaining! Can watch the series over and over and discover things you missed in a previous watch.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I just absolutely love this game. Great graphics, lifelike and it is worth the time to play it and get to levels. I am looking forward to getting to level 20!!!
159463176X|5.0|If you like any of Khaled's other books, then this will be no different!<br />My biggest fear is that he will quit writing!
0452289963|5.0|Something you will read, highlight, write tons of notes in the margin in, and carry with you for personal inspiration later.
0395389496|5.0|We bought the book for a Christmas present last year, and<br />it is my son's favorite book.<br />It also comes with a CD, & sometimes we listen to it in bed - trying to fall asleep.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I was never much for a reader of the classics but I decided to give this one a shot ( I mean it was free, how could you not) and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a great pace with just enough tension to keep you fully engaged. The vivid imagery was a necessity in a book that deals with the vanity of one man. The theme and moral lessons tucked within the pages made it a thought provoking read. Very enjoyable
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult novel I have read. I'm going to need to wait a day or two to start another book. Deeply affecting and beautifully written. I ached for every character. I will read more by this author. But first I have absorb everything from this book.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|By looking at Jesus from the standpoint of the historical realities, Reza Aslan provides a perspective that is lost in the mythology of Jesus as portrayed in churches today. This book will make the reader reexamine their assumptions about Jesus, but it is not a book with a negative or disrespectful about its subject. The discerning reader will find their understanding of Jesus enriched by this book, even if they don't agree with all of the author's views.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Download from the App store and it has provided hours of fun. The movement of the cards is swift and if you're keeping score this help a lot. I highly recommend this game.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Because I can note get it to work and there is no help. No support for the end user. It will not come up at all yet shows it is loaded.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved this game so much. I haven't had such a good time. I don't know why some one wouldn't buy this app.
B00821OX98|4.0|yea, it's been done a million times before; aliens invade,humans resist.  The difference in this one is the characters.  The professor and the convict are two very entertaining characters. I highly suggest this if you are a sci-fi fan at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games series.<br />It's incredible plot and imagery is truly amazing. I love the author and everything she writes
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Every once in a while, the have glitches and I fall through the ground. I can look up, and see the bottom of the ground, but I just keep falling xD. Other than that it's a wonderful game. I highly recommend it. Well worth the money to buy it. I just wish there was more locations
B009NY43NY|4.0|HATE THAT IT WILL BE THE LAST ONE....MAYBE JUST MAYBE THERE COULD BE ANOTHER ADVENTURE FOR SOOKIE??? WE CAN ONLY HOPE!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Kids especially love this game! So if you have  a kid that needs some kind of gaming or a way to pass the time to occupy them then this is the perfect game!
B008MVPHNE|5.0|I have been a croc wearer for a number of years, and I like them brightly colored.  These are made with a stronger sole and are a bit stiffer than the older style.  Plus they have better traction.  I got the wrong size at first but the exchange was painless and easy and the new ones fit fine.<br />If you like crocs in wild colors you'll like these.
B005LJKEXS|4.0|This cable is what it says it is and more. Once you see it you know it will work. I am happy and will look forward to my next purchase.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Sometime technology moves so fast that language doesn't catch up. How many people actually hang up a phone any more? I bought Hugh Howey's \\"Wool\\" as an ebook so I could have a book to read on my phone when I didn't want to carry a paper book around, and I raced through it, trying and failing to slow down. But is it a page-turner - or is it a screen-swiper?<br /><br />It's just that sort of book; hard to put down, made me eager to find out what was going to happen next.
0385474547|5.0|Achebe masterfully uses  the rich oral tradition of the Ibo people.  The many proverbs and folk stories reveal a culture that has a deep tradition of morality and of community.  Every time I re-read the novel and teach it, I find new levels of meaning and new marvels.  It is no wonder that Chinua Achebe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Wish I could play longer and not run out of energy. Have a great time playing.<br />It's a great game to play
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very good for traditional metro or town locations.  If the app incorporated remote weather stations, then it would be 5 stars.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|I bought the book because of the movie.  I  find it to be well- written, but the topic is too intense for me.
B00122BEPA|5.0|Where else can you find 'the best of both worlds' in one CD? Well here is the collection you have been looking for. The best of the David Lee Roth era and the Sammy Hagar era all in one. Back in the day I purchased the &#34;Best of Volume 1&#34;, but here is the ultimate Van Halen collection.
B0001I561E|1.0|I purchased this DVD for the express purpose of learning Spanish from it as I saw that Spanish was listed as one of the languages it was in plus it had Spanish subtitles (essential for doing this).  It does not have Spanish subtitles.  Yes, you can hear it in Spanish, that part works, but the only subtitles available are in English.  Just thought I'd put this hear as a warning for anyone purchasing it because, or at least partially because, it says it has Spanish subtitles.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game is much more accurate than I thought possible. Even the really nerdy obscure stuff didn't trick it. I have yet to get one over on this guy :)
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Rolling Stones is a timeless band, Gimme Shelter is one of my favorite songs. Such powerful lyrics. This is album is a must have for your collection.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Highly recommended read for anyone who has been a kid. Jeff Kinney brings back \\"forgotten\\" experiences from childhood and tie them to cute, artistic cartoon drawings. I have the feeling I'll keep reading...
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Always Keeps you interested in the book. Very little filler in James Rollins books. Can't wait for the next Sigma Force book.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|...but when you put it with Star Wars, it gets even better.  I did go further than I usually do at one sitting with this version.
B008LP8QE8|2.0|Great book. Poorly formatted. 2 column reading just does not work well on a Kindle fire. Searching is also very slow at times, and it often misses occurrences of terms which is inexcusable since Harrison's is best used as a reference and not something you read cover to cover. Another reader described this book as basically a pdf version of the text which is an apt description.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|I tried downloading this on my Kindle and my PC and neither one works.  I went through the troubleshooting things and nothing!  I can't watch crap because everything uses &#34;flash&#34; which is not a good name for something that doesn't even twinkle.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Awesome game but needs more vehicles I love to play it when I'm bored good for kids adults very cool game
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Didn't need the 3D version, but only cost $1 more. also love the bonus features and digital soundtrack.  Great deal!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It was not nearly as interesting as his previous books.<br /><br />It was confusing with all the different characters  - going back and forth - the two Pari's- was not sure which was whom at times.<br /><br />Very disappointing
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very nice. Came in handy. Easy to use. With easy access to get too. I would recommend to down load
B008LC8TJI|5.0|cd was in great condition, as stated. fast shipping & great price, thanks!
0307891372|5.0|This thing is a behemoth! Bought mine used for 11 bucks and wasn't disappointed at all. Even included the map i predicted wouldn't be there because of the used aspect..but it was there! this thing is detailed, informative and heavy. your Skyrim enthusiast will thank you.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|great price, un-edited & fast shipping, thanks
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|it was really disappointing this look like a great app but unfortunately it wants me to log on to Google or Facebook or give up account information or create an account why I thought this was a free app
B007ZD17XO|5.0|For a match 3  game it's pretty fun. Lots of power ups. Only downside is no relaxed no timer mode except on bonus round puzzles.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Graceling is a very well written novel. It language flows very smoothly and is rich in imagery. The main character does many truly extraordinary things, such as handling all of the dungeon guards by herself, defeating a mountain lion, and running through a cold mountain pass that nobody has passed through before. I liked also how the secondary main character was able to feel the surrounding environment. This reminded me of the movie \\"Avatar,\\" except, unlike in the \\"Avatar,\\" this character could feel the environment without wiring himself in through the tail. I agree with some of the reviewers who said that parents might need to be cautious about letting their children read this book, because it does contain at least two scenes that are more or less explicit. For the most part, though, the book is just a really beautiful narration that describes the main character's adventures in the seven kingdoms, and the things she encounters on her path, such as vast mountains, forests, the sea, as well as some farms with cows around them in the distance. It was a truly enjoyable read, and I plan to read the next books in the series soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great fun &amp; addictive!!!  recommend for relaxation.  challenging and gets your attention and focus on high alert. I play for at least thirty minutes a day. Also play with friends.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A great and easy read!  You fall for all of the characters and find yourself cheering for Harold on his crazy journey
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love playing this game all the time !!!<br />I play it on my Kindle Fire !!<br />Thanks a lot !
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A hero both in battle and in his life.  A warrior and a Christian. The best of America. Must read
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I'm glad that they did a different story regarding heroines. There aren't any males coming to save this female. She ends up saving everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you have ever seen despicable me and you love minions this is the game for you I really recommend you get this app and puts its free it can't get better than this
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|At times, I wanted to counsel the two main characters or shake some sense into them. I couldn't stop reading, because I needed to know what was going on. Love the characters and felt every emotion they felt. A good read if you like feeling one with the story. A recommended read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love PINTEREST!!!!!!  I have been able to find so many crafts and Diy projects. We are in the process of getting bids to remodel our bathroom.  I found a great pin of painting the cabinets and changing out the faucets.  We are going to be able to save a lot of money. I am hooked!
1444777556|5.0|This is the continuing adventures in life of James and his cat Bob as James continues to make his life better.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A poignant, bittersweet love story with characters who are endearing, real and heartbreakingly funny. A deadline is looming and the race is on to make a difference, to push for change, to find life worth living. With a provocative and controversial topic looming as the backdrop, this is an intimate view inside a very complicated human experience, one that none of us can really understand unless we're thrust into the situation ourselves. The writing is crisp, well-paced and quite simply beautiful. The characters are so well-developed, you feel you actually know them personally. You'll find yourself crying one moment then laughing the next, but isn't that just life? However cruel it can be, it is also so wonderfully joyful -- and there in the reading is the lesson. Me Before You is excellent material for a film...but please, dearest Hollywood, don't muck it up like you sometimes do, this one is too perfect to ruin.
1250029465|5.0|A very good true story of one man's effect on and being affected by a stray cat who becomes his friend, protector, and companion.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|At first the movie was slow. Then when the girl came along it was thrill ride. Great acting from the whole cast.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book was very interesting to read. All along you kept waiting to find out the end. I don't know about other readers but it came as a surprise that the final game was the complete inhalation of the buggers! Great job!
B00ERD6XTI|4.0|a great book .thought provoking. glad it is on school curiculum.illustrations not suitable for e book  as illustrations are faint.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|By far the best application I have ever owned. I would highly recommend it.  Easily stream or move files.  All prices apps work.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is very fun and realistic. I recomend this app to everyone. This would be a fun app for anyone looking for a little fun .
B002PEP4SC|2.0|I bought this because I enjoy the T.V. show.  Unfortunately, this is the T.V. show. no surprises. I guess I should have known.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I liked the game but it wasn't worth $5 plus I wish the ending was better u felt no closer to the game at all..if you do a second one I would love to buy it....but not for $5 More like maybe 2 or 3
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is my favorite Bond movie yet...the intro song from Adele is the best movie song yet and the acting and plot of Skyfall is exceptional. SEE IT NOW!
B005GIS1WA|2.0|I couldnt even watch the movie in its entirety because of the quality of the video. The movie seemed like it would of been great though.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Oh my God I got it two weeks ago and it was lame but until 9/27/13 came out it is awsome there are new robots New stages any tag team match so yeah get it right now it's really cool.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I loved this book on many levels.  Great character development.  Great setting - he made Bombay completely come alive.  Great philosophy - weaving the characters, events, and settings together gave opportunities to explore different (and new for me) philosophical points of view.<br /><br />It was the first time in many years  where I actually shouted &#34;YES!&#34; When I finished the book.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0046RE5HW|5.0|Excellent.  Agatha Christie is always first class and this is one of her best.  Her stories are fresh even today.
B00008NRL8|5.0|This music has so much energy and soul  that you just can't not be inspired in some way.  The talent is unbelievable
