B00012QM8G|5.0|The importance of Schindler's List can never be understated as it is not just a movie but a message to society that unabashed good can come out of irrevocable evil.  Spielberg's homage to Mr. Schindler is so masterfully realized that is recognized in most circles as one of the greatest movies.  Unlike other \\"best of all time\\" movies, Schindler's List isn't subject to numerous repeated viewing as the power, emotion and subject matter provides the viewer with an intense and harrowing experience.<br />Every aspect of the movie is a winner and the movie was an Oscar machine garnering winning 7 or so Oscars and claiming at least 11+ nominations.  Many recall 1993 as the most lopsided \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar race in the history of the show as enties like The Fugitive and The Piano couldn't hold a candle to this powerhouse.  Spielberg rightfully took best director as this movie showed that he was able to do more than excellent popcorn flicks.  Art Direction, Cinemetography, Editing and Muscial Score were among some of the other Oscars this movie won.<br />The making of Schindler's List is a well known and interesting tale.  Spielberg has said that the making of the film was the most draining, emotional and wonderfull experience of his life.  The movie was filmed on location in numerous places in Europe and included numerous real life sets of very disturbing places and settings. Hopefully the DVD will include a \\"making of feature\\" as well as deleted scenes even though most Spielberg films don't inlcude unused scenes.<br />Obviously this isn't a review of the DVD since it won't be out till March but here is what I do know.  There will be a regular 2-disc version and a limited edition gift set.  Both will probably include a widescreen and full frame version of the movie.  Apparently there are two featurettes already annouced and a Spielberg news site that there is more that is unannounced.  The gift set will include a coffe table book about pictures of the making of the movie, the soundtrack and a certificate of authenticity.  Apparently there are hours of great deleted scenes but there is no word on if they will be included.  Spielberg DOES NOT DO commentary and even though the importance of this film is overwhelming, rumor has is that he will stand by \\"no coomentary\\" attitude for Schindler's List.<br />As a high school teacher I can tell you that there is a generation of students who haven't seen Schindler's List and thank goodness to Universal for finally releasing this DVD.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Yes DT as we all know, are more in excelence and mastering your intrument, but the lack of true meaning in the songs with the incredible amount of changes in the melodies and rythms made it sometimes hard and frustrating for the average listener to catch ( that is if you are not realy into a musical instrument).This new album however adds the right &quot;commercial&quot; touch without any loss of power and tecnique, wich, in my opinion, makes it definatly more pleasant to listen to!Best work since &quot;Images and words&quot; Go get it and go see them live!

B0000B1OFL|5.0|The film stars Mark Walhberg, who really can't act.  That doesn't matter though because the part didn't call for a great performance.  Ditto for Charlize Theron.  Her acting doesn't matter either because she's so attractive that all she has to do is appear in a scene and all eyes will be on her.  Then there is Donald Sutherland, who does a good job in the role of her aging ex-con father who has taught her everything she needs to know about safecracking. But my very favorite actor in this film was Seth Green who is cast as a computer hacker who winds up controlling traffic jams in Los Angeles.<br />There's murder, of course.  And lots of chase scenes.  One is on the canals of Venice and involves speed boats and gondolas.  The car chases are really good too.  In one scene the cars drive down the stairs and on to the tracks of the Los Angeles subway. Best of all is the plot.  It moves so fast and held my attention so much that I didn't have time to think about how impossible it was.  And of course I was rooting for the thieves.  Isn't that what a caper film is all about?<br />I realize that this film certainly wasn't real and most of the acting was mediocre. But I can't help it. I loved it. It was two hours of pure relaxation.  And I highly recommend it as a truly fine escape film.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam did it again with &quot;Lost dogs&quot;. An amazing collection of b-sides and rarities taken for this CD. Here you can find all kind of ways Pearl Jam has made songs during its all carrer. Personally, I feel that the first CD in thi compilation is grungy and alternative in the Pearl Jam way and the second CD is smoother and mistical in a certain way (check out &quot;Fatal&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Last kiss&quot; and &quot;Dead man&quot;) Dont pay attention to those reviews that says this CD is worthless... WRONG!!!! go and buy it as fast as you can!!!... you wont regret!
B0000399WI|5.0|Until two weeks ago, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; was just one of those &quot;must-see&quot; movies I had never bothered to rent. After viewing it however, this film spoke to me on a level that I didn't expect at all. I just thought it was going to be a touching story about friendship. Yes, this *is* included, but there is more.<br />Tim Robbins' character epitomizes the type of individual who usually succeeds in life. Not only is he gifted with above average intelligence, but he has an amazing work ethic. Yes, bad things happen to him in the film, but he doesn't let these things slow him down. He keeps going. He realizes that life isn't fair, bad things happen, and that we can either &quot;get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot;<br />It was tremendously sad for me to see what happened to Brooks, the librarian. I for one, do not consider people who choose to do what he did to be &quot;losers,&quot; - a term I hear thrown around by insensitive types whenever the aforementioned subject comes up. But at the same time, I realize that he did make the wrong choice in that it was a total and complete waste. Our lives are a gift that comes with good and bad, but in the end we *do* have the power to make our own destiny. Even if it takes decades of suffering to make it happen.<br />I'm choosing an angle when I recommend this film. My angle is this: there is something to be said for hard work and ingenuity. And if you aren't gifted with ingenuity, then align yourself with someone who is, and put yourself to work for that individual. Sooner or later, your work WILL pay off. Even if it's for an evil warden, as the film so brilliantly depicted. This is a film about choosing life over death.<br />Life is too short to wait around for it to happen. We either &quot;get busy living&quot; or &quot;get busy dying&quot;. I get it now. Thanks.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Smiths was a great band with great albums but &quot;The Queen is dead&quot; broke the idea of what everybody had about Morrissey and Marr. This album reflects the huge talent that Morrissey has lirically and Marr musically. From The opening track &quot;The queen is dead&quot; to the final one &quot;Some girls are bigger than others&quot; The Smiths gives us a great pleasure by listening them. My two favorites of the album (if I have to pick favorites) are &quot;The boy with the thorn in his side&quot; (I dont know where or how Morrissey and Marr compose this song but its just beautiful and charming... I cant listen to it just once casue I have to play it at least twice everytime I play the record) and &quot;There is a light that never goes out&quot; (another beautiful masterpiece that takes you to the most beautiful places in your mind and in your real life). As you know, in the late 50s and the early 60's with the golden years cinema that Morrissey loves so much (just take a look to every Smiths' album cover), The Smiths would have been the most requested band to make soundtracks from those movies. They had the feeling and the intelligence to make such a great music that would have fit perfectly as a soundtrack for a James Dean movie and &quot;The queen is dead&quot; would have been the one
B00004T9UF|5.0|RIGHT NOW I WANT TO GLORIFY EVERY EMINEM HATER WALKING THE FACE OF THE EARTH. EMINEM IS A WHITE GUY TRYING TO BE BLACK. HE ACTS LIKE HE'S THE ONLY WHITE PERSON THAT CAN RHYME. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING HIS FACE ALL OVER MTV AND MAGAZINE COVERS. EVERYWHERE I GO, IT'S EMINEM...EMINEM...EMINEM! WITH ALL THE WHITE GIRLS AT SCHOOL IT'S &quot;EMINEM THIS&quot; and &quot;EMINEM THAT&quot;. I LOVE TO HEAR INSANE CLOWN POSSE AND CHRISTIAN AGUILERA VERBALLY BASH EMINEM IN THEIR MUSIC. PERSONALLY, I DON'T LIKE RAP. IT S*CKS. INSANE CLOWN POSSE KNOWS HOW TO RAP AND ROCK. PLUS, THEY'RE MORE INVENTIVE WITH THEIR MUSIC AND CAN EVEN MAKE ME LAUGH. LINKIN PARK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS. THEY MIX THEIR MUSIC UP WITH A COMBINATION OF BOTH RAP &amp; HEAVY METAL. AND THAT'S COOL. BUT JUST PLAIN RAP MUSIC ANNOYS THE HECK OUT OF ME. MARILYN MANSON, OZZY, KORN, SLIPKNOT, CRADLE OF FILTH, ICP, LINKIN' PARK, METALLICA, ETC. THESE ARE SOME OF THE BANDS THAT STAND OUT BEST IN MY OPINION. I'D LIKE TO HEAR EMINEM MAKE A HEAVY METAL ALBUM. IMAGINE WHAT THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE?
B000002VCE|5.0|The OUTLAWS were among the absolute finest bands/guitarists ever to walk the planet and this album is a fitting live tribute and record of their incredible music and skills. Their talent is unmatched to this day and they are sorely missed. Especially notable is the accurate, complex and steady backup from their bass player and drummer who worked very hard to complete the mission and provide as the incredible backbone of the music. Thankfully (and lucky for us) this recording documents their energy and talents. This is the among the finest guitar work you'll ever hear from anyone, anywhere. No one did it better back then, no one does it better now, and no one ever will, in a 3-guitarist configuration with this kind of music. This album is a treasure!
B000002U8G|5.0|This was my first Pink FLoyd album to buy. I love this album. Its older pink floyd, and its a very soft album, Besides One of these days which is an amazing song. Fearless, is a great soft beautiful song. Echoes is the best song on the cd, i think, I am not saying the others arnt good, but i was drawn to this album by echoes. I love the changes in the song, its not repetative. I recomend this album to any starter pink floyd fan.
B00004T9UF|5.0|If you dont get the urge to rap from listining to his albums your down right insain. straight off the bat icp insain clown posse is for a bunch of freaking clowns aka chalks get a life listin to the realist artist ever. you have to gutts to spit stuff like he does nearly on every song dissing some other artist in the industry. just like my man Tupac now dont get me wrong he is no tupac by anymeans but he is as close as we will ever see again. i have and own every eminem tupac dre and 50 cent album made and they never ever get old. if someone in your family is a lover of rap as i am stop and get him one of eminems great albums.WESTSIDE FOREVER
B00006ZCFH|1.0|I am a huge fan of hers, actually a borderline fanatic, and when I heard this albumn I was so heart-broken.  I have all of her CDs.  She is such a creative, talented person who seems to put alot of time and energy into her work; this CD does not reflect any these attributes.  It seems as if she just threw all of the songs together as a quickly as possible.  I expect so much more from Ms. Badu creativly, and this CD did not make the cut.
B000002BFZ|5.0|If you were expecting roaring guitars and screaming voices delivering the passionate aggression of Pearl Jam's debut album and its two follow ups, you might be slightly disappointed, but be assured that it is all your fault. No Code presents lyrically the yet most thoughtful statements and is a remarkable musical experiment, telling us that the group has no code, has no category and can only geographically be attributed to the Seattle Grunge movement. <br />\\"Who you are\\" is a folk song if you consider the percussion, which consists of a few congas and toms not using a full drum set. Vocally it reminded me of reggae, but still it remains great rock `n' roll. \\"Of he goes\\" is a Beatlesque acoustic ballad about an old friend who is \\"always movin' much too fast\\". I was in love with that one, from the first listen. \\"Hail Hail\\", \\"Habit\\" and \\"Lukin\\" are straight rockers reminiscent of the old days, but still you feel that something moved forward. \\"Mankind\\" is obviously a parody of punk music, playing around with typical stylistic features of the genre. Another innovative song is \\"I'm open\\", which combines psychedelic elements with the melancholy of disillusionment, when we become adults. The first and the last verse are not sung, but spoken lyrics and in between we hear Eddie Vedder's praying voice singing \\"I'm open - come in.\\" The most outstanding track is the very emotional an epic \\"Present Tense\\", where the band tells us \\"to lean out an catch the sun's ray\\" cos \\"it makes much more sense to live in a present tense.\\" The outro of the song is three minute instrumental part with a cracking bass-line.<br />To sum it up once again: We have to be grateful for the gift Pearl Jam offered to us. Everything is there, love and hatred, passion and aggression, life and reflection, Vedders beautiful baritone and McCreadys fantastic guitar work. We just have throw away our \\"preconceptions about what should have been\\", and go on the \\"all encompassing trip\\" of No Code.
B0000683DH|5.0|By far one of the best Star Trek films made, adding all the special features and deleted scenes only added to the greatness of this movie.  Even if you  have the original edition of the DVD I'd have to say the deleted scenes, commentary and other special features are definetly worth the cost of this Director's Edition!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Originally heard Chapter Four on the Madden 2004 soundtrack and thought it was amazing... Little did I know that I would end up buying a cd that is worth its weight in gold. This alblum is absolutely amazing. I only thought bands like this existed in my dreams...I was wrong...
B00000ILBK|5.0|I have to say that this film would probably only appeal to the more intense Star Trek fans.  I myself think it was great! Lots of humor, great acting, awesome special effects, everything that we've come to expect in Star Trek movies.  However, the story was more of a classic Star Trek story, almost like something you'd see in a tv episode, which I don't think would appeal to many fans, but again it is most definetly a great Star Trek movie.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I can't believe this album is getting a few negative reviews.  Anyone who appreciates good music, period, will agree this is 5-star material.  What I suspect is, the bad reviews are coming from disgruntled thirteen-year-olds who bought it expecting fourteen variations of \\"Seven Nation Army\\" and instead got the most versatile album from Meg and Jack to date.<br />It opens with the now-overplayed but still amazing \\"Seven Nation Army\\" - quite possibly the best album opener I've heard since \\"Come Together\\" on Abbey Road. <br />Then you're taken through a wonderful tour of rock and roll's many faces -- the punky and blistering \\"Black Math,\\" sultry \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\" (in which Meg sings) and simultaneously tender and rocking \\"I Just Don't Know What to do With Myself.\\"<br />The second half of the album serves up the beautiful \\"I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart,\\" which stands out with Jack's piano and masterful slide guitar (not to mention the surprisingly confessional lyrics).  Then we're taken through \\"You've Got Her in Your Pocket,\\" an acoustic, Paul McCartney-esque ballad (and no, I don't say that lightly).  Then comes perhaps one of the best tracks on the CD, the down-n-dirty, bluesy \\"Ball and Biscuit.\\"  <br />Finally, there's the second US single \\"The Hardest Button to Button,\\" a song that may take a few listens to warm to but is ultimately very, very cool.  Then comes \\"Little Acorns,\\" a metalish tune you'll be singing all day to.  And don't forget the upbeat punker \\"Hypnotize\\" (you'll like it if you loved \\"Fell in Love With a Girl).  <br />\\"The Air Near My Fingers,\\" although Jack doesn't like it too much, is one of the standout tracks.  I can't describe it; you just have to hear it.  Don't forget \\"Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine!\\" which will have you stomping to its hollers and tamborine. ;) <br />Buy it. Now.  It will deserve the Grammy (Album of the Year) if it wins, because it is an amazing, timeless piece.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This was an excellent Star Trek film! Though sad in many ways for various reasons, I belive this film was a great film with great acting &amp; awesome special effects.  A must have for even the most casual Star Trek fan!!
0553213105|5.0|In pride and Prejudice my favorite chapter was seven because I thought it was hilarious how Mrs. Bennet wanted to send Jane to Mr. Bingley's house in order for her to get closer to him, even though it was raining and she had to go alone on the horse.  I thought that was really hilarious because it determined that Mrs. Bennet just wanted her daughters to marry her no matter what.<br />  I think this book is appropriate for teenagers like me who could understand the meaning of the book, and in some situations be connected with the characters.  It relates to me because just like Elizabeth didn't marry because of the money, I know that when I marry, I'm going to marry for true love not because of the wealth the man I marry has.<br />  A literary device that I appreciate was that Jane Austen used imagery. She helped her readers feel as if we were with the characters.  For example when Jane was sick, Elizabeth went to visit her on foot trails and she arrived with soaked and dirty stockings to the house.<br />  I like this novel because it made me realize that you should not judge a person with out knowing them.  I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading love and realistic characters.
B000127LW2|5.0|I started watching Star Trek TNG but lost interest after it ended. When Voyager started i was thrilled to finally see a woman captain in the big chair.The story line was unique having them stranded so far from home.I think what ultimately made this the best ST ever was the Crew of Voyager. It was a perfect blend and balance from Tom the prankster to Tuvok the voice of reason. Chakotay the stable rock and foundation to B'Elanna and her fiery temper and the all inquisitive holographic Doc. I have tried to give the new Enterprise a chance but it hasn't grabbed me and i have yet to see the depth in these characters as in Voyager. I'm relieved that it's finally coming out on DVD and hope to see ST. Voyager The Movie soon!!!!!
006019250X|5.0|The only other books I'd put in this genre are Hesse's Siddhartha and Chefitz's Seventh Telling - let me know if you can think of another (but not if it's self-help!) This is not self-help literature, o modern day skeptics. This is a modern-day classic. You may feel challenged to rexamine your soul and your path in life, but not due to a self-help book with a thinly veiled plotline and dogma, such as Daniel Quinn's stuff. No, this is good writing - a beautiful tale.<br />Another reader points out that Coelho's female characters are given no opportunity to dream for themselves, to grow in life. This is a good point. Also one reader argues that the Christian element of his stories, in general, detracts from the universality - also true. Nevertheless, I don't feel that there's an overpowering sense of Christianity in this particular book of his - this, his masterwork. Still, another good point. However, this is an extremely well-written tale, and worthy of anyone and everyone's attention. Coelho is not perfect, as none of us are perfect, but he is one of the most inspiring people alive today. Read this book and see if you don't agree.<br />I read this book and bought 20 copies of the Illustrated Edition to give away. While living in Israel I bought two copies in Russian and gave them to friends. Argentian friends, Russian friends and I discussed the book in Hebrew, having read it in English, Russian and Spanish. Everyone agreed it was one of the most important books of their lives.
B000063S6Z|1.0|This ranks down with Pink Floyd's Division Bell for the worst album. A fellow Moby fan borrowed it and I offered to let him keep it... he came back an hour later saying that I couldn't get rid of it that easily. This is just an empty, thoughtless, terrible excerise of sound bereft of melody or harmony. It just meanders and wastes your time.

0141439513|3.0|I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.<br />  I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.<br /> One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.<br />I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.<br />BY Manuel Rosales
B00005AQGH|5.0|There is a lot of crap our there these days, so make sure you spend your cash on something actually worth it.  This cd by the late 2pac is one of the best rap albums ever recorded, hands-down.  You hear lots of cats running off at the mouth about \\"classics\\" but in this case it really applies.  From start to finish you have one fantastic song after another; Pac had the realest skills out there and they shine on this cd.  I think the guy was a genuius.  If you you don't have this one, pick it up soon.

B0000C9JFO|5.0|Do you remember that first day in school, when you were a wide-eyed kid and wondered if you'd make any friends and got butterflies in yr stomach wondering who'd eat lunch with you?  And then a few weeks later, you found your group and wondered why you worried in the first place?<br />Well, this movie is a tribute to those days. It's about a French student who travels abroad to Barcelona and moves into a melting pot apartment of other exchange students. Like (the superior) \\"Lost in Translation\\" the film gracefully captures the feeling of being lost in a foreign land, only to find your home when surrounded by other similarly lost individuals. It's an idea you'll understand if you've ever stayed in a hostel or struck up a conversation in a random coffee shop on vacation.<br />The cosmopolitan cast and the happily featherweight plot earn this 4 stars. The 5th is for the undeniable true star of the film: Barcelona. The camera loves the city, and I loved how the film used the city without turning into a Cinemascope travelogue. I liked this film before visiting Spain, then loved it after coming back. For anyone who knows the joy of a good sangria in La Ribera after a night of tapas-hopping, this movie is for you.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|To be frank I read the book when it came out and didn't like it but once I heard that Schwartz was turning it into a musical I thought I'd give that a chance. The book didn't capture any of the spirit of the original books by Baum, it was negative and unapealing to me, a long time OZ book reader, but Schwartz is one of my favorite composers, Godspell is a masterpiece, so here I am.<BR>I saw the show twice in San Francisco and this CD is just beautiful. Stephen Schwartz has out done himself and the voice talents of both Idina and Kristen take your breath away.<BR>Joel Grey as the Wizard is a huge improvement over the lack luster Robert Morse who never seemed to have any energy on stage in SF. I love the story, wit and the humor of the production something that has been so lacking lately. <BR>To put it simply this musical Defys Gravity and deserves every Tony they can give it!
B0000C0FJB|3.0|All you can hear on this cd is the audience who never shut up for a minute throught this whole concert. You can constantly hear them screaming through every single song and the music is secondary. There are so many live Rush cds that are way better than this. Plus the sound is horrible.
0316666343|1.0|After hearing several of my friends rave about this book, I decided to give it a try.  I was really expecting something great, but I came away disappointed.  First of all I was not impressed with Sebold's writing style.  It seemed rather elementary, like a story I might have made up in Jr. High.  SHe never gives an in-depth description of the characters (what they look like, etc.)  The time frames also get a little out of whack.  Towards the end of the book, I felt like Susie Salmon was no longer a part of the story.  It just became a story about her family living their lives, which for the most part were unrealistic.  I was disappointed about the author's description of heaven.  However, I think the MOST DISAPPOINTING part of this story is when Susie returns to Earth in her friend's body.  Rather than visiting her family, or helping bring her killer to justice, she has sex with her Jr. High Crush.  HELLO?  It was a pretty lame ending to me. After Susie's murder (which occurs in the first few chapters) the book is a downward spiral of boredom.  I definitely wouldn't encourage you to read this book.  I found it to be a waste of time.  If you want a story that is beautiful written as well as interesting, check out The Hours by Micheal Cunnigham.
0061015725|3.0|I think over the years I've probably read 3/4 of Michael Crichton's books...and have liked most of them alot. This book is fast paced and entertaining but I didn't feel that it stacked up well next to a number of his other works. I had the feeling that it was rushed to meet a deadline and ,as a result, lacked a certain originality. The Nano-technology as villian concept is great and seemed to be a natural for Crichton but so much of the book was outright derivative of other stories or films. There are scenes in this book that are right out of &quot;Aliens&quot; and John Carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot;. Maybe the biggest problem for me was the relationship between Jack and Julia. After 2 whole weeks of tension in the marriage and 48 hours of suspicion of infidelity Jack's ready to toss the 14 year relationship away without a single conversation with Julia nor even a question as to why she's behaving oddly? This is the Mother of his 3 kids, including an 8 month old infant. I have a deeper relationship with my Mailman! As we get closer to the end, and it appears that Julia may be the story's central villian it appears that Jack could care less. Talk about marriages made a few feet lower than Heaven! I kept asking myself...who's less human here? The characters or the Nano particles?
B000089QEN|1.0|Vulgar is the only word that completely describes this film. I have never been so sickend by a period movie. The first shot of the movie shows a woman picking her nose. It does not get any better later in the film. The music is hidious also. Don't bother!
B000002KXV|5.0|Two years after Steely Dan called it a day (well, until their 1993 reunion tour, anyway), Donald Fagen released his first solo album, 1982's &quot;The Nightfly.&quot; This is a wonderful album, filled with lots of smooth, upbeat, melodic, toe-tapping tunes that don't stray too far from the classic Steely Dan jazz/pop sound. If you love the Dan, you'll love the Don. Donald's songs are all  winners: the supercool hits &quot;I.G.Y.&quot; and &quot;New Frontier,&quot; Donald's breezy cover of &quot;Ruby Baby,&quot; the cocktail number &quot;Maxine,&quot; the punch of &quot;Green Flower Street,&quot; the calypso hooks of &quot;The Goodbye Look,&quot; the awesome smooth-grooving title song, and the cheerful finger-snappin' conclusion, &quot;Walk Between Raindrops.&quot; Donald's work in the singing, songwriting, and playing departments are all top of the line, as is the handsome production by longtime Steely Dan producer, Gary Katz. Whether with the Dan or on his own, Donald Fagen makes brilliant music. &quot;The Nightfly&quot; is a gloriously cool album.

0385504209|3.0|I liked it, especially in the middle section where all of a sudden I was overwhelmed by the sensation of... dare I say it?... an epiphany, a long standing question had been finally answered.  In the following I will explain my own personal reason why I liked the book, and I hope you might find it interesting.<br />I am an immigrant to the United States.  What I am trying to say is that I do not have a Protestant/Catholic background, or at least a background that would have given me some familiarity to the imageries/ideas of Christianity. (I might add, nor do I have any background in Judaism and/or Islam which would also have given me some understanding of Christianity.)<br />As an immigrant teenager in America, I attended a high school that studied fine art.  As part of the curriculum, I studied &quot;art history&quot; which mainly meant &quot;european art history&quot; (or least it was the way two decades ago).  As anyone who had taken a course in introductory Art History twenty years ago would know, the course work mainly focused on (or at least the most readily available and detailed information were on) Renaissance Arts.  And that's precisely the area I had the most problems.  Regardless of the fact that the Renaissance were a period of re-birth and a break away from Medieval time, a lot of the Renaissance paintings were still steep in images of angels and other Christian icons.  I couldn't understand any of it.<br />Twenty years later, while I was reading Mr. Dan Brown explanations of the oddities of da Vinchi's &quot;Last Supper,&quot; all of a sudden I felt as if I had a new insight to all those &quot;Christian&quot; paintings I tried to decipher long ago as a teenager.  It requires more than a textbook's definition of &quot;Christianity&quot; to more fully appreciate the meaning and subtlety for the imageries I beheld years before.<br />In sum, I guess what I'm saying is that I find the &quot;alternate Christ Gospel&quot; Mr. Browns and others before him have provided somehow completes the pictures for me.  Somehow the alternate story complements and completes the missing link for me.  Somehow I feel as if I can understand those strange Bible stories that had confound me in the past.  Somehow it is no longer so incongruous that the same God could act so benevolent at times can be so vengeful at others.have provided somehow completes the pictures for me.

B00007LTIB|5.0|In the wake of their monster 1973 turkey Tales From Topographic Oceans, Yes lost their star keyboardist Rick Wakeman, along with many of their fans who were just dumbfounded by the expansive double album (if you've never heard Tales, here's what you do- read the Bible while humming \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" over and over again. It's the same exact experience).<br />The next year, with new keyboardist Patrick Moraz brought in to fill Wakeman's huge shoes, Yes recorded what is without a doubt their best album, if not the best rock album ever.  And I mean that.<br />Relayer is not an album you listen to- it is an album you are possessed by.  The first several times you listen to it, you won't understand it- I certainly didn't- but you will be drawn back to it, and with patience, you will not be able to get this ethereal music out of your head.<br />\\"The Gates Of Delirium\\" starts out with a waterfall of keyboards and percussion, gradually leading to one of the pounding, intimidating basslines that will haunt the rest of the song.  Chris Squire, along with drummer Alan White, are the architects of this piece.  Steve Howe's guitars soar like vultures over the proceedings, seemingly threatening the other instruments with unholy wails (if that doesn't make sense to you now, it will once you hear them).  Moraz is certainly not afraid to take the role of the spectacular keyboardist- although unlike Wakeman, he knows when to restrain himself (that's not really an attack on Wakeman, but I'm just saying...) His simulated bugle call at the beginning of the \\"battle\\" sequence never fails to send chills up my spine.  That leaves singer Jon Anderson- he fits in perfectly.  Relayer is, by and large, an instrumental album.  Anderson gives his all for five minutes at the beginning of \\"Gates,\\" singing about warriors going off to battle, and he is not heard again until ten minutes later in the absolutely beautiful and bittersweet \\"Soon\\" finale.  The lyrics recall ancient wars, although they still apply, unfortunately, to current events.<br />And the \\"battle\\" sequence.  I can't really explain it in words.  You MUST listen to it at least once.  It is the true musical equivalent of war.<br />\\"The Gates Of Delirium\\" gives us enough material for an entire album, but there's more.  \\"Sound Chaser\\" is a tour-de-force \\"outer-space jazz\\" (my term) affair that seems to be about the effect that music has on our being (very appropriate for this album).  This is an unrelenting song- Alan White's amazing drumming is the highlight (it's easily his best song in thirty years with the band), but you can't leave out Patrick Moraz's beautiful electric piano flourishes, Chris Squire's blitzkrieg bassline, Steve Howe's engaging guitar solo, or Jon Anderson's sunny, then downright creepy vocals (cha cha cha, cha cha...).  An amazing, energetic piece.<br />And that leaves \\"To Be Over.\\"  This is Steve Howe's song, without a doubt.  Acoustic guitars, electric guitars, steel, sitar...all of them make an appearance in the first minute.  Unlike \\"Gates\\" or \\"Sound Chaser,\\" \\"To Be Over\\" is a very peaceful, relaxed song...\\"We go sailing down the calming streams,\\" indeed.  This is a perfect way to wind up Relayer.<br />And what of the bonus tracks?  \\"Soon\\" does not work as a stand-alone song, only within the context of \\"The Gates Of Delirium.\\"  In fact, this single-edit does not work at all.  As for the \\"Sound Chaser\\" single, it's a pretty cool sampling of the song- completely instrumental except for some of the \\"chanting.\\"  And the studio rehearsal of \\"Gates\\" is a very interesting addition.  I have to mention the last fifty or so seconds, after \\"Soon\\" has wrapped up- there's a little reprise into the \\"battle\\" that ends the song.  I really wish they had put something like onto the finished piece.<br />While many consider Yes's other masterpiece Close To The Edge to be their best effort (an opinion I sometimes want to agree with...but that's another review altogether), Relayer is the bestcombination of the talents of five players into a single album.  I stand by my assertion that this is the best Yes album there is, and I don't think I'm out of line when I say Relayer may be the best rock album ever.<br />Oh yeah, and I've gotta say...this is the coolest album cover I've ever seen in my life.he best combination of the talents of five players into a single album.

B00008LDPU|5.0|After watching the Animatrix, I was amazed at how good it was, but also what a powerful effect it had on me. I'm not ussualy a person who is affected a lot by violence in films or animation, but some of the stuff in this really disturbed me, more than stuff I had seen before.<br />The best and also worst animation in the collection has to the The 2nd Rennaisance parts 1 and 2. Some of the scenes depicted in this come accross as serving no purpose except for the director to serve his total morbid and frankly sick imagination. Another thing that strikes me as a read the reviews is the amount of people saying how hard done by the machines were. The most distrubing single thing that happens to the machines is probably a female machine being torn up and shot by a group of human thugs, or some thousands of bodies being dumped, machines being run over or executed. For one, these are artificial beings, humans have more right to be on the earth than they do period. Secondly, it doesnt even come close to the acts the machines carry out on humans. Against humans we again see the thousands of skulls piled up, but how about a man being ripped out of his mech armour slowly and calculatedly by a sentinel with no mercy, or the tank crews having the turrets ripped off and then being killed? Oh, and then there's the terrible experiments the machines carry out on humans.<br />However, there are some of flaws in this that make me worry less about it actually getting to the stage it does in the future. For one, if the machine city was nuked, there would not be 'no effect' as the 2nd r tries to say, superheat? electromagnetic pulse? War over. I also doubt that having the technology for much more effective weapons (as shown by the large stationary weapons placed on the battlefield) that the humans battle mechs would be equipped with woefuly inadequate machine guns.<br />Overall though, this was a great DVD with the 2nd rennaissance being the highlight, although it can be hard to watch because of the overly vile violence. Another great one is Matriculated.
B00007FOMP|5.0|It's truly a shame that people  write their closed minded comments that trash such a soul shaking masterpiece as this landmark CD! Ever since I was a child this LP has been in the house (my mother's favorite) and even today it's message is just as timeless as it was back then. If you don't understand what I mean...take a good deep look at the very world around you today  and you hopefully will understand. It was a mix of emotions too deep for  a lot of people because it pulled no punches! It opened your eyes and stuck your nose in the mess and asked you   &quot;What's going on?&quot;  plain and simple...  If I am correct this original LP came out  around early seventies and today in year 2003 is STILL in production and demand!  That speaks more than any words can say to me.  Don't try to analyze his message or the music, just sit back and let it make you think and feel as it has done for countless others.
B00000K3UR|4.0|its funny but like most comedies it gets boring. not worth spending $10 for, rent it a couple of times instead.
0385507755|4.0|I'm not a fan of Frey's style.  His histrionics get old after about 10 pages and I was quite annoyed with his spoiled rich kid background.  BUT, despite the minor issues, this book touched me in ways I can't explain.  It's real.  Above all, it's real.  Everything from the depth of his addiction to the resistance to traditional treatment plans reflected my own recovery.  I laughed, I cried, and above all, I said &quot;Holy sh*t - I know how that felt!&quot;.  Frey managed to walk that fine line between uplifting and heartbreaking.  I thank him.  This is a gut-wrenchingly beautiful account of overcoming a struggle with addiction.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I love this cd!! It's as good as the other two. Buy it!!
B000099T2L|5.0|I finally broke down and bought this CD after hearing &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; on the radio.  The other two singles had good beats, but not much substance, but &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; has great lyrics and a nice, easy groove.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were more songs like that on her CD--&quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Speechless,&quot; &quot;Be With You&quot; &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; and &quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot; are other stand-outs in terms of melody, lyrical content and vocals.  <br />Ms. Knowles is able to handle a variety of styles with ease, from old school R&amp;B, to hip-hop oriented tracks. And she's much better at doing the &quot;hip hop&quot; flavored stuff than all the other pop divas.  She is versatile, and that's what this CD showcases. The fact that she wrote and produced much of what's on her CD is also great to see.<br />I am so glad I didn't listen to the naysayers, because I really enjoy this CD (I suspect many of the bad reviews on this site are fake--no way can anyone tell me that this girl cannot sing).  All in all, a GREAT BUY! Go 'head Beyonce!!
B00005UKE0|5.0|With the recent release of Concert for George I found myself exploring Harrison's music once again. This CD package is a must for any Beatle fan. I found it transporting me back to my teen years, with the music as fresh and original as when I first heard it.<br />The incredible synergy between these four friends, resulting in timeless music was the result of each one's special talents.<br />George was always the most introspective. You had that feeling that there was so much more under the surface. When the group disbanded in 1970 everyone waited to see if they were talented enough to make music separately. This CD proves that. There's a spritual dimension to his music that makes most modern music pale by comparision.<br />Highly recommended.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Back in the dark ages, before I saw Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" in its wonderful new DVD incarnation, I believed that \\"The Godfather\\" was the greatest movie of all time. But \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" reigns supreme.<br />That it is the greatest Western ever made goes without saying. Leone takes every shot from every famous (and maybe not so famous) Western, everything we ever thought true about the genre, and turns it on its head -- redefines it, makes it better, makes it feel original and new all over again. This movie does for the Western what \\"Pulp Fiction\\" did for crime pictures.<br />But to mention another movie in the same breath as this one is to bestow undue recognition on a lesser film. \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is without peer. It represents the zenith of acting, writing, directing, cinematography, film editing, sound. I could never imagine suffering through this beautiful movie on pan-and-scan VHS or on any other medium besides DVD. Indeed, DVD was seemingly invented for movies like this. It is almost impossible to believe \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is more than 30 years old! It has been scrubbed clean and digitally restored to a level that rivals even \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"The Two Towers.\\" This DVD is nothing short of miraculous.<br />But so is the movie itself. Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards are greatness personified. And Leone's direction is just magnificent. No other film can touch the style, the grace, the visual excitement of this one. And the music! Each character has his or her own personal score that reminded me of John Williams' work on \\"Star Wars\\" and the \\"Indiana Jones\\" films -- indeed, Cheyenne's theme sounds most reminiscent of the \\"Imperial March\\" from \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"<br />This movie tops a long list of very good and important Westerns including \\"Rio Bravo,\\" \\"Unforgiven,\\" \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales,\\" \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" \\"Open Range,\\" \\"The Searchers,\\" and others. It's the \\"2001,\\" the \\"Citizen Kane\\"of Westerns. It is a masterpiece.

But he is the perfect character, you are blindsided by his evil, i don't want to give anything else away!  If anything Halle might not have been the right 'wife', but even she is perfect for the role, they just seem odd as a pair.  And being a fan of Robert Downey Jr., well... he is under used, but ohh what a hotty, at least to this 40 year old he is ;)  see the movie, be amazed at the evil, and this HAS happened my friends, this story comes of pure REAL evil.  Always becareful, you NEVER really know ANYONE.
0385504209|2.0|I have to give Dan Brown credit; he had a great idea for a book.  But he has neither the skill or the ability to carry it out.  I can't find anything in this book that justifies the enormous hype it has received.  The quest for the Holy Grail, and what the Grail actually represents, is fascinating, but Brown tries to wrap it in the stale trappings of a pedestrian whodunit that doesn't do the material justice.  The characters are one-sided and don't really engage us, and the writing is just plain sophomoric.  The idea of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus isn't original with Brown; it's been done much better by other writers, most notably by Jos&eacute; Saramago in &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus Christ&quot;.  I came away from this book with a deep sense of disappointment.  Brown had a good idea for a book, but somebody else should have written it.
B00005JMCW|4.0|When I saw the previews to Freaky Friday, I thought it would be just terrible.  The basic story is unoriginal and the trailer was just horrible.  But then I saw the great reviews coming in on Rotten Tomatoes and my fiance and I decided to check it out.  I was surprised to see a funny, charming, entertaining movie about a  feuding mother and daughter who switch bodies for a day.<br />While the plot originally seems cliche and silly, the movie was actually very good.  The writing is well done and witty, and the acting is superb!  Jamie Lee Curtis is especially good as the mother (turned daughter) - she actually makes it believeable!<br />This is a fun family movie, I highly recommend giving it a chance.  You might be surprised and find yourself laughing at what you originally thought was going to be one of those silly Disney movies that only kids could enjoy.  Freaky Friday is fun for adults as well! I highly recommend it.
B000008LOV|5.0|Boy do I enjoy this album! One of my favorites to really cheer me up when I am blue.  I think the thing I love best is that you can tell they were having a good time recording this album.  Actually, that was the truth, they were just messing around in a studio and came up with this gem.  It's a shame it's out of print, I heard it had something to do with a dispute with the record company, or a victim of George's legal problems in the 90s.  Whatever it was, be nice to see a Willbury's boxed set in the future.  The previous reviewer mentioned the George and Jeff solo albums as a reccomendation, but also don't forget Tom Petty's Full Moon Fever.  Don't Back Down, practically is the Willburys again, sans Bob.
B0000024W3|5.0|It's ironic that most of the albums the public chooses to label as the \\"worst ever recorded\\" are often made by those who are acclaimed giants in the music world; like John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \\"Unfinished Music\\" sound collages, or Creedence Clearwater Revival's underrated, hated \\"Mardi Gras.\\" And like a majority of albums critics hate, Bob Dylan's \\"Self Portrait\\" actually turns out to be a very worthy listen, even if it takes a few listens to get used to for the average Dylan fan.<br />Released as a double album in 1970, \\"Self Portrait\\" was condemned by both reviewers and fans, who were shocked that the spokesman of their generation had not lived up to their standards. But if a performer can release a record that is regarded as a pitiful disappointment after a decade of publicly-embraced masterpieces, but with a grin on his face while doing it, it's not such a bad thing--the album saw critics claiming Dylan had somehow turned his back on his principles and was indulging in a \\"commercialization\\" of his music; critic Ralph Gleason even called for a boycott of Dylan's albums. But the bottom line was that Dylan was fed up with being hailed as a leader; in a biography by Anthony Scaduto, Dylan was quoted about this era: \\"I wasn't going to fall for that, for being any kind of leader...and because I wanted out, they all started to rap me.\\" And that's the goal that makes this album so enjoyable. Didn't he tell us not to follow leaders in the first place?<br />The title suggests that \\"Self Portrait\\" will resemble some kind of personal diary, but rather it's more of a curio, featuring some lesser known original material, a few ragged live cuts with The Band from the Isle of Wight festival, and covers of songs by the likes of the Everly Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel, and the equally brilliant singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot. The album often finds Dylan in a musical limbo--there's pieces of his folk period, his rock period and even his country period; it's almost like he can't decide which style would be best to use, so he employs them all. Strings and overdubbed vocals tread through the album. There's even that honky-tonk voice that first appeared on \\"Nashville Skyline\\" that comes straight from Dylan's nasal tones--it sounds like a mix of the voices of Warren Zevon, Hank Williams Jr., and Supertramp's Rick Davies. But it's an enjoyable voice nonetheless, and Dylan offers some very good music; songs that resemble the \\"Basement Tapes\\" like 'Woogie Boogie' or 'Little Sadie' add a loose feeling that suggests Dylan wanted to have as much fun as he could, knowing \\"Self-Portrait\\" would be despised. Despite any bizarreness, the album is packed full of fine moments like 'Days of 49,' the absolutely delightful 'Bell Isle,'  and infamously dogged covers of 'Early Morning Rain,' 'The Boxer,' 'Blue Moon,' 'Let it Be Me,' and an exquisite if eyebrow-raising version of 'I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know.'<br />Consider it as Bob Dylan's own experience of \\"Stage Fright;\\" his former backing group The Band released the album of that name the same year, their reaction to the dregs of being made a public figure. But it only took them two years to reach that disdain, while if Dylan had taken ten to reach his, it certainly didn't show until in shocking confrontational form when \\"Self Portrait\\" was released.<br />\\"Self Portrait\\" may always be recognized only as an infamously disappointing release, but it's actually one more reason to ignore the widely accepted opinion. \\"Self Portrait\\" is more of a statement than most people choose to recognize; Bob Dylan wanted desperately to discourage those who saw him as a prophet.

At first I liked only Daniel Day Lewis' role as Bill the Butcher, but now I hate the whole film altogether.  Even Leonardo DiCaprio, who was phenomenal in the groundbreaking masterpiece &quot;Titanic,&quot; can't save this hot mess.  And getting Cameron Diaz is the worst casting decision I can think of.  I mean, I was having these &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; flashbacks whenever I saw her face.  But worst of all is that Scorcese big time dropped the ball on this project.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|It is, as Arnold would typically say, simply terrific to finally discover the movie re-released as a DVD. Curiously enough, as someone who is featured as a member of the audience at Mountain Park when the sequences featuring Arnold guest-posing there were shot, I suppose I was a bit player in this movie. As it turned out, I was invited by Ed Jubinville, who ran the event, and got the chance to meet Arnold after the show. Yet my fondness for this expansive and revealing look into the intense subculture of bodybuilding is based more on the way it opened up the world of physical fitness and bodybuilding, which up to that point had been the subject of crude jokes and ridicule.<br />This in many ways is a documentary, and photographer and videographer George Butler and author Charles Gaines (who wrote the original best-selling book, \\"Pumping Iron\\") took quite a risk in pushing this cultish film into the mainstream. Indeed, it originally played in arthouses and didn't become a hit until later. Yet it provided the spring for success Arnold needed to prove he could both emote and act (not many people understood the film was in fact scripted, such that many of the so-called stories and events were derived from the experiences of others,written into the film to provide a plot that otherwise didn't exist. thus events such as Schwarzenegger's father's death just before the Olympia (never happened that way), or Ken Waller plotting to undo Mike Katz.<br />Likewise, the whole Mike Katz teeshirt routine. Still, at base this remains a fascinating look into the otherwise mysterious world of competitive bodybuilding, although the story described herein depicts a world that no longer exists as it did twenty five years ago. Nowadays bodybuilding is a big-money enterprise, and it has changed in the process of so evolving. People are in it for the money and the fame, and drugs play a much bigger part in the calculation than they did then. In that sense at least, it has lost its innocence. Still, for anyone so inclined, this is a memorable and intriguing story, featuring a numbner of world class strength athletes such as Schwarzenegger, Louis Ferrigno, Franco Columbo, Dave Draper, Serge Nubret, and Mike Katz, all then in their prime. This is a terrific movie, and one that I am sure you will enjoye.

B0000DJZ7W|5.0|This is a fifth French album of Celine Dion. And it is great! For Celine singing in French is singing from her heart. Celine Dion, a french-canadian, started her career by singing in French. It is French that defines Celine's personal identity as it is in our mother tongue that we can best express ourselves. <br />Generally, Dion's French albums are better than the English ones. They all have soul, they are more subtle, they are carefully planned and released. &quot;1 fille &amp; 4 types&quot; (a girl and 4 guys) continues this tradition. Tender tunes, meaningful lyrcis, and great vocals. <br />Is the new French album for francophones only? No. But it helps a lot if you understand a bit of French :-) <br />What describes the album: Acoustic, guitar, vocal.<br />Tout l'or des hommes (All Of Man's Gold) a first single from the album sounds very guitar. This might be the flavor of the entire album. Jean-Jacques Goldman admits that it was his idea to make this album more acoustic, more guitar. Jean Jacques Goldman, a long time collaborator oversaw Dion's &quot;D'Eux - The French Album&quot; in 1995 and &quot;S'il Suffisait D'Aimer&quot; in 1998.<br />So the bottomline - &quot;&amp; fille &amp; 4 types&quot; is a brilliant CD with a heart and soul, and you've gotta have it :-)

Awake was a great CD but this CD shows that Godsmack might not have any more good ideas. If you want a second copy of Awake buy Awake again instead of buying this CD.
B00005QCYD|1.0|This movie was horrible! It shouldn't be allowed to carry on the Jurassic Park name. I mean, The Lost World was pushing it. This one just sucked. Granted, seeing members of the original cast was cool, even if it was brief. Still, that can't save this movie. Reasons this was so bad: 1) The dinosaurs all looked fake, probably because this movie relied mostly on computer generated effects. 2) The little boy they were trying to save was so annoying, why they didn't just leave him on that island I'll never know. 3) There were hardly any deaths, which is what made the first two exciting. 4) It wasn't directed by Steven Spielberg, the guy who did the first two. 5) The plot was way jacked up: for instance, why would Grant EVER go back? The reason they gave in the movie so did not convince me. They made out like Grant would do anything for money which, he learned in the first film, was a bad idea. Anyway, the point is: this movie blew. Take my advice and skip this one. Oh, and I totally agree with the other reviewer who made the comment that those who like this movie are idiots.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Truly a work of art and a well put together CD. Maynards vocals are excellent, along with terrific lyrics and well composed musicianship. Weak and Powerless is one of the best songs I have heard in quite some time. This CD is strong from end to end.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|This DVD is an amazing collection of Guns N' Roses music videos.  Guns N' Roses was probably one of MTV's favorite bands throughout the 80's &amp; early part of the 90's.  If you are expecting concert footage &amp; interviews with this DVD you'll be disappointed.  But if you are like me and don't care for all that stuff and just want to see the videos this DVD is for you.  This video includes the classic MTV &quot;hair&quot; generation classic's Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O Mine, &amp; Paradise City.  Plus, in my opinion, one of the top ten music videos ever made in &quot;November Rain&quot;.  Rare music videos that MTV probably will never air again like, Live &amp; Let Die, Yesterdays, The Garden, Dead Horse, Garden of Eden, Estranged, &amp; Since I Don't Have You.  Plus two huge video smash hits like Patience and Don't Cry.  The DVD is missing the video for You Could Be Mine &amp; also I remember there was a rare video for Knockin On Heaven's Door that also is not part of this DVD.  But I'm not complaining one bit.  It's just great to see these videos and remember the days when rock ruled MTV, before rap music became MTV's one and only obsession.  A must own DVD for not just GNR fans, but collectors of music video DVD's.
B000089RVX|5.0|this is really really good, but evanescence is not an original. there is a band called lacuna coil who in my opinion are 9358235985 times better than evanescence. its pretty obvious that evanescence ripped off lacuna coil's image, but despite that fact, the cd is still a good one.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Sarah, i always loved your music, your voice, your lyrics, they were so inspirational. My first album of yours was Surfacing, i bought it because of the single building a mystery. i was wowed over that album, it was full of hits, every song was good. then i bought, FTE and B sides and other rarities. i came to love yuor music and lyrics, i wanted more. so imagine my joy when i heard that u would be coming out with a new album after 6 years! i was first in the record store to buy afterglow, u even grew out ur hair and there was a huge poster in HMV with ur words about afterglow. a new and evolved sarah i thought. i couldnt wait to play the cd. i heard fallen. i was smiling, i said sarah was back. i played the next track, uhm, it started off ok, i kept listening, and i expecting something more, but that was ok, i was only into the 2nd song, no big deal, then came the 3rd song, ok i was hpoing this one would come back up,no. ok, i went to the next song, no, nothing sounding great or jumpinmg out at me, i started getting worried, ok next song, still not the sarah i knew, well ok i thoight to myself, i still got at least another 45 minutes to go right, there must be some hidden gems further into the album. i listened again, no, i skipped into the next song, still no, ok i thought, its sarah, and i was a bit consoled by the fact that there was more quantity as i was only on track # 9, so i skipped to 10, it still didnt come, i listened to the end, anticipating the next track, stopped, my worst fears had come true, she only put 10 songs on the album. oH mY God, i almost died of shock and horror and disappointment. NOOOOOOOOOOO another short album with no content or quality!!!!!!! i felt dissed and wronged by sarah.<BR>this was bad- this was real bad , the whole thing. i was mad, mad at sarah, i have always hated when artists do that- put only like 40 minutes of music on an album, and sarah albums were always short but u could always count on the fact that she would have afew good songs in there, but this time , no, only fallen lives up to her old standard, after getting married and having a child u would think she would have somethings to say about life and profound things, it just wasn't happening, and i'm beginning to fear sarah is spending all her time changing diapers and have neglected her music.
6304712499|4.0|This movie was good, Great special effects(probably the best special effects I have ever seen in a movie). Bad acting however,<BR>and the clown is really annoying. It's  cool when he turns into the violater. Don't ever see the PG-13 verion, that was bad. If you like the action figures and comics of Spawn, then you'll like this, its very good.
B00005UW7G|1.0|I have to agree that the sound quality in this DVD is terrible; without reiterating the remarks on the general 'dead' sound, i will add that there is no real sound picture--the sound never seems to be coming from the actors on screen, and this is part of why the production seems lifeless and boring--it's more like a CD with pictures than a movie with properly imaged sound.<br />Also, i'm not sure i agree with such a dreary palette for the visuals..
B00009RDG9|2.0|This would be a standard Tommy Lee chase picture except for all those scenes the other reviewers describe as &quot;realistic&quot;.  Tommy and Benny apprarently have no muscle, no tendons, no arteries.  They just hack and hack and keep on hacking.<br />I like action and maybe I'm getting old but I am so damn tired of seeing over-the-top butchering of arms, legs, torsos.  Enough already!<br />As for the story, its entirely cliches, start to finish.  To make things even worse, we're supposed to feel sorry for Benny (war vet snaps cliche).<br />What a terrible waste of two fine actors.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The answer to whether this album is for you lies in the answer to this question : What Did You Think Of The Strokes' Debut, 'Is This It'.<BR>If your answer to that question is that it left you cold, being nothing more than a lame attempt to approximate past glories of NYC, be they The Velvet Underground, Television or Ramones and somehow failing, somehow being not quite right, then there is absolutely nothing here which will change your view of this band.<BR>If however, you thought 'Is This It' was nothing less than an instant classic, the very (distilled) essence of the excitement of rock 'n' roll, then this will be an absolute treat for you.<BR>For there is no great departure, you could even possibly argue there's no departure at all: the second album by The Strokes sounds exactly like the first album by The Strokes. Except?<BR>Well, except everything has been emphasised, everything has been accentuated, everything is -if you'll excuse the 'Spinal Tap' reference- 'One Louder'. The guitars are louder, the drums are louder, the bass is more pumped-up and if Julian Casablancas' vocals aren't exactly louder, then they're scuzzier, more distorted, more...messed up. And therein lies the excitement at the heart of this album.<BR>From the opening lines, the glorious non-statement of intent that has a perfectly mangled Casablancas intoning &quot;I want to be forgotten/And I don't want to be reminded...&quot;, this is all about the art of the effortless. Which means quite simply that every song on here is as great as the others, in much the same way it was with the debut. There isn't even a hint of filler.<BR>And then the interesting nods to the future, the hints of reggae and other little flexing of the musical muscles (fleeting admittedly, the formula is there for a very obvious reason : it works...) which suggest the next stage. And suggest that Part 3 of The Strokes Story is going to be a very exciting place to be. <BR>Like this.<BR>That absolute.  <br />Postscript. There's no argument that this is a short album and at 33 minutes long some may feel short changed. Alternatively, you could, like my mate, just listen to this album for the first time and then when it's over turn to me with a massive grin on your face and say, &quot;See, I told you. 33 minutes. All great albums last 33 minutes.&quot;<BR>It's that simple.<BR>Absolutely.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Except visionless network executives, that is.  Never have I been as drawn to a TV series as I am to this one.  Firefly is a still largely undiscovered gem that needs to be seen to be believed.  The entire production is better than most motion pictures and leagues better than anything I have ever seen in a television show.  If you haven't seen it, you should.
B0000CDL3W|3.0|This is not the new Bible of science fiction. This is supposed to be the last episode of the saga about thE fight between machines that take over the world and men who are nothing but easy preys for these computers. Of course John Connor has to be saved along with a girl, who cares about which one provided she can lay some eggs. And this couple has to be saved by being led into the atomic shelter of the President of the United States just before the machines erase life from earth with all the atom bombs men have accumulated. Judgment Day cannot be avoided. This is one recollection from the Bible. But only one man and one woman, plus maybe a few descendents, will survive. That is definitely not the Book of Revelations but a new version of the Genesis. In other words, when machines have become the supreme authority of the world, when they have killed God since no one can believe in religion anymore when they are plugged on the Internet and its ungodly blabla, there can only be a catastrophe coming, the end of the world that in a way selfdestroys, and the promise of a new beginning - which will lead to the same catastrophe in a few hundreds of centuries - that sounds like or smells like a rewriting of the Bible in a new very apocryphal version. And do not ask this film to have any complex psychology. On one side machines that have no psychology at all, only a plain programmed mission. On the other two human beings who are terrorized by fear, fright and some other versions of dread. All the others are nothing but props necessary to hold the setting. But it is entertaining because of the very total unbelievableness of the fable. If you can suspend your disbelief for more than five minutes, you must not have seen many movies lately and I would advise you to get to the cinema more often. By the way, the special effects are rather colorful.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B000059ZLH|4.0|I've been on this planet for over 44 years and I'm a HUGE rock  music fan who also plays the drums.  I was turned on to these guys by another drummer in 2002 (thanks Mike D.!) and have collected all of their work in both Dream Theater and Liquid Tension Experiment.  I have NEVER seen a band with so much individual talent...I mean NEVER.  The story and music on this DVD will send you on an emotional roller coaster and will leave you breathless and wanting more.  Mike Portnoy is THE best drummer I've ever seen (Modern Drummer's best Prog Rock drummer 10 years running - Hall of Fame inductee 2004)- and I've seen a ton.  I'm blown away by his ability to incorporate odd time signatures in his music.  If you're not sure about buying this product, just read the bios of the band members - Mike Portnoy (drums), John Petrucci (guitar), Jordan Rudess (keyboard), John Myung (6 string bass)and James LaBrie (vocals).  If you're a true music fan (no matter what genre), you'll find this to be one of the best displays of individual talent available.  Have you ever heard of a keyboard player in a progressive metal band who teaches classical music???  That's right, Jordan Rudess attended the Juilliard School of Music at the age of NINE for classical piano training.  Okay, so why only 4 out of 5 stars?  This puppy needs to be re-mixed (Currently in Dolby Digital 2.0) to at least 5.1 and some of the visuals are quite annoying.  Nonetheless, this is still the most powerful, moving show I've ever seen on DVD.  I saw Dream Theater live in 2002 (6th row center stage) and I ended up leaving the concert with my jaw dropped around my ankles - I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of talent these guys displayed.  I recently purchased DT's \\"Train of Thought\\" (from Amazon) and Petrucci pulls off this 2 minute riff 8:36 into \\"In The Name of God\\" that will leave you wondering if this guy is really human or some sort of machine!  Most bands, DT included, perform tributes to other artists, but Iguarantee you NOBODY can reproduce what these guys do.  It simply can't be done.  I'm looking forward to seeing them live in 2004.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|As a Maiden Fan ,and owning almost all their CD's. I can tell you this is an AWESOME CD for what I consider New Iron Maiden. Define NEW Maiden you say ?, that's Iron Maiden After Powerslave and Starting with Somewhere in Time. It just seems that <BR>&quot;Somewhere&quot; started a newer more modern,crisper,and clearer, multi track ,sound then before. However , just like Jimi Hendrix and Marilyn Monroe , some names will live forever and so will the CD's Piece of Mind (a true 10),Number of the Beast, And Powerslave.<BR>This CD is a 9 on a 10 scale , but not better than the previous one Brave New World (10 on a 1 though 10 scale). <br />But this CD is really good and brings back the Bruce Dickerson back to his old &quot;air raid siren: form.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I had been a fan, and believe that Enigma has certainly moved the ball of its vision forward with this offering.

No soy seguidora de ese gnero y es por eso que me encuentro bastante atnita.<BR>Pero, al ver que se tom un buen tiempo para trabajar en su 2do album, me dije:- esta chica va a hacer algo completamente diferente- y lo hizo...en grande. Al salir Stripped, una amiga(fantica de christina) me lo prest y qued impresionada.<BR>Stripped es un album que est lleno de diferentes humores, es como un calidoscopio, te lleva en un viaje hacia los sentimientos personales de la artista , pasando por mensajes universales y hasta te da una vuelta para divertirte.<BR>Las letras, estn colmadas de melifluidad, rebelda, osada, fortaleza, madurez, solercia en definitiva. <BR>Pero su voz sigue desarrollndose y uno realmente puede apreciarla y sentirla en cada una de las canciones, sea el mensaje que fuese uno siente que ella verdaderamente lo est expresando.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|Ok so it's like eating cotton candy, not a ton of substance, but enjoyable none the less.  I enjoyed this action/con movie with its car chases and plot twists.  I realize it's hardly original, but what is these days?  I never saw the original, so I can't compare, but I'd probably watch this movie again some time, so that's a good sign to me that it wasn't too bad.  That said, I'm not sure if it's more than a rental movie, after all, once you know the plot twists and what's coming next, it's hard to get excited over it again.<br />While there were definitely things in this film that stretch the boundaries of  being even  remotely probable, it was still enjoyable and I give it a recommendation to those that like films in this genre.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Althogh Whitney's voice has changed a bit, she still at least HAS A VOICE! Much better than any other Christmas album out there now. GREAT GIFT for friends and family!
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is not only my favorite Radiohead album but one of the best rock albums I have ever listened too. It is rock, but an intelligent and a little melancholic one. Not too hard and not too whiny. I am a little bit of a weired Radiohead fan I guess because I prefer this album to all their others (Ok Computer is second but I like this one best). I love nearly every song on this album, especially High and Dry, The Bends, and Sulk. My type of music is usually Oasis, Blur, Coldplay etc. The Bends is a great mixture between these three beands, just a little bit more intelligent. There isn't any other band or even album that gets me in the same mood (although I have really tried to find one). If somebody knows one I'd appreciate it if you would let me know, but thus far this is the best!!!
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I was extremely excited when I realized Whitney Houston was releasing her first Christmas album. I have studied voice for years and have always considered Whitney to have exception range and depth in her music. However, the album One Wish did not represent that same old Whitney Houston. Her songs are breathy and airy. She doesn't seem to be able to maintain proper breathing technique. And I found it quite amusing how she adds her own words when she  can't remember the real words. I loved Little Drummer Boy with her daughter (I would have bought a whole album of her daughter's) but then Whitney can't even let her daughter sing without adding comments in the background. The only saving grace for this album would be Joy to the World, which was recorded when Whitney filmed the movie The Preacher's Wife. My mother actually gave her album of this cd to me not knowing I too had unfortunatly bought this album. My advice is to stick with Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas album.
0316096199|4.0|I read the 'Lovely Bones' before reading 'Lucky' and I must admit that I was initially skeptical reading 'Lucky.'  However, Sebold's account of the rape and her experience reveals that she is strong, yet human.  The effects of the experience lingered with her long after it occured.  In addition, it is quite enlightening to see how her personal experience may have influenced her &quot;fictional&quot; writing in the 'Lovely Bones'.  What a therepeutic mechanism for overcoming such a devestating event!
B000002BHE|5.0|FALLING INTO YOU came out in 1996, three years after Celine released her third album, THE COLOUR OF MY LOVE. This album is probably the best Celine Dion English-language album. The album shows Celine's vocal abilities at their best, especially on the song &quot;All By Myself&quot;. Celine hired the same producers since her 1990 English-language debut album, UNISON and also worked with adult-contemporary top-producers. There are 15 songs on FALLING INTO YOU and all of them could've been top 10 hits, three of em' did become top 10 hits including the smash #1 hit &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;. If you really love Celine Dion, you can't deny that this is probably her best work and the sales proove it since it sold 32 million copies worldwide including 11 million copies in the U.S. alone. Not only that, but at the 1997 Grammy Awards, FALLING INTO YOU won two Grammy's including Album Of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. The album made Celine Dion a superstar diva and paved the way for 1997's LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE.
6304025831|5.0|\\"Casino\\" is one of my favorite mob-related films, right up there with \\"Goodfellas\\" and the first two \\"Godfather\\" movies. I am also a fan of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. The dynamic chemistry between both actors really translated well from \\"Goodfellas\\" to \\"Casino\\". Martin Scorcese is one of the best film directors in the past couple of decades. \\"Casino\\" may not have not been a box office smash for Martin but artistically I thought it was right up his alley. I am not a big fan of Sharon Stone but \\"Casino\\" is the only movie that Sharon was able to pull off a convincing film role as the drug addict/prostitute Ginger. Granted that the film is well over two hours, time flies by whenever I watch the movie.  Based on gangster Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal and stylistically modeled after \\"Wiseguys\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Casino\\" takes the viewer to the humble beginnings of then booking agent Ace Rosenthal who eventually rises through the ranks in the world of gangsters and soon becomes the operational manager of a Las Vegas casino. The film is narrated by both DeNiro and Pesci ala \\"Goodfellas\\". One of my favorite scenes is when DeNiro scopes out the hustlers who are trying to cheat the casino out of as much money as they could possibly get. And another favorite scene was when Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) took a pen and stabbed a guy in the beginning of the film. I am not a Don Rickles fan only because I find him to be an obnoxious, loudmouth, unfunny comedian but he was actually pretty good in the movie and that is because he wasn't trying to be funny. As I have stated earlier, I never cared for Sharon Stone but her performance as Ginger was downright convincing. Eerily too convincing perhaps. Frankly Al (Robert DeNiro) should have dumped the twit right away. Ginger was more in love with his money and power than Al himself. I think the problem with \\"Casino\\" is that Martin Scorcese tried to capitalize on the success of \\"Goodfellas\\" too soon with \\"Casino\\". Had he waited a few more years and in between films, \\"Casino\\" might have been a box office hit but compared to \\"Godfather 3\\", \\"Casino\\" is a hit.d in between films, \\"Casino\\" might have been a box office hit but compared to \\"Godfather 3\\", \\"Casino\\" is a hit.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This movie is brilliantly cast with Tobey Maguire as a jockey who never gives up, Chris Cooper as the humble but gifted trainer, and Jeff Bridges as the kindly owner of the great horse Seabiscuit.  The cinematography is beautiful and the story is heartwarming.  The stock market crash and subsequent recovery is compared to the lives of the three men who surround Seabiscuit with their talents, after each has fallen on difficult times in his private life.  This is a movie which should appeal to a wide audience and become a classic.
B00004BZ16|4.0|Daniel Ortega must had wet his pants the day he found out that there was actually a band stupid enough to go along with his  perception of a communist society. The Sandinistas of Nicaragua were the 1980's answer to leftest sentiment with no hope for a  capitalist vision. Politics aside, this album will only target two kinds of fan bases. People who are exposed to music and don't believe in prejudices of other genres and styles or the typical leftest ANSWER crowd who believes that the US military is nothing but a superpower that should be taken over. Like I stated, if you don't belong to one of these groups this isn't the album for you. <br />\\"Sandinista\\" was once declared The Clash's answer to The Beatles \\"White Album\\" when it was released in 1980. Unlike \\"The White Album\\", \\"Sandinista\\" didn't hide behind goofy diddles or nonsensical song titles, but straight politics between listener and musician. Joe Strummer and company mixed up thirty-six tracks (over two and a half hours of music) that led the listener from one end of the spectrum to a completely opposite province. <br />Honestly, at a time when politics are at the pinnacle of our culture. The Clash were able to move beyond the political structure and capture authentic music that many music fans are being denied these days. In my opinion, this is the perfect triple album. It is the reason vinyl lps were invented. It's hard to sort out songs on a cd but with the six sides of vinyl it was easy to place which songs go where. \\"Sandinista\\" may not be the greatest album ever or the most believable but it was honest, direct and to the point. The way an album should be presented.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien series is without a doubt one of the best ever pieces of filmmaking created on film.  Not only does it have an amazing storyline, a strong female lead, some of the scariest creatures ever created, as well as some great action sequences and chills to boot, but it also has real depth and a strong sense of perseverance.  The first two films are still the true gems, with both Ridley Scott &amp; James Cameron at the top of their game.  And the Extended and/or Director's Cut versions only make the films even better.  But Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are still very good installments.  Although most of us are still angry with the direction that Alien 3 took, more and more are admitting how strong a film it actually is today.  And with the resurrection of Ripley in the fourth movie, who knows where the series will take us?  Earth?  The original home of the Aliens?  Only time will tell.<br />I just finished looking at everything on the Alien Quadrilogy.  Took a long time too.  Lots of archival reading to get through.  Very thorough.  Enjoyed the special editions to Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection a lot, though I preferred the original opening to Alien Resurrection and the original ending to Alien 3 from the theatrical versions.  The commentaries were pretty good.  Too bad Sigourney Weaver only participates in the original Alien and none of the other films (and even then, she doesn't say all that much) She does discuss ideas for Alien 5 with Ridley Scott towards the end (maybe she wants him to direct part 5?????).  My favorite had to be the &quot;Aliens&quot; commentary parts with Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrickson, and Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez).  Bill saying that he's not getting paid to record this commentary but is at least getting free beer and reuniting with his Alien costars, was a highlight.  The commentaries for the theatrical versions are the same as the ones for the director's cut/special expanded editions, only some comments are omitted here and there, except in Alien 3 &amp; Alien Resurrection.  Some additional comments are made at the end of the theatrical cuts of Alien 3 and the opening of Alien Resurrection, since significant changes were made to the films.  The segmented documentaries are also very detailed from the first film to the fourth.  Lots of great information!  The real empty feeling is the absence of David Fincher during the Alien 3 &quot;making of&quot; (except when you see him during the actual filming days) as well as from the commentary, since the director's from all the other installments participated.  Some disappointments were that not all the extras from the original Alien DVD Boxset were included in this new one, such as Ridley Scott's own personal audio commentary by himself along with another separate additional bonus audio track of different music cues by Jerry Goldsmith and some other cool things to listen to while watching the film (like the original audio track during filming where you can actually hear Ridley giving Sigourney direction as she moves about the ship towards the end.  The original featurettes from the first boxset are all missing too.  Plus the bonus 5th DVD from the original boxset that you had to mail away for to get in the states isn't featured here either, which is a bit surprising.  And for me, I was just surprised that the Aliens theatrical trailer was shown Pan &amp; Scan, when a letterboxed version does exist (I have it on my Big Trouble In Little China 2 DVD Special Edition).  I'm just glad I didn't sell the original boxset as I originaly intended.  I like retaining all the extra material made available.  Still a great 25th Anniversary Boxset Collection...
1565847032|5.0|This is an outstanding book for anyone who has heard about Noam Chomsky and would like to explore some of his ideals. <br />Whether you agree with him or not, does not get away from the fact that this is an excellent book for the beginner reader or the vivid fan of Chomsky as the book is broken up into many sections of different topics that Chomsky discusses.<br />The only down side to this book would be if you are not ready to open up your mind. If you believe questioning your government is unpatriotic, then this book isn't for you. Just because you question your government, it doesn't mean  you don't love your country.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Potentially the album that displays their unabashed debt to heavy metal in the most obvious manner, 'Train Of Thought' is less of a departure for the band as some have argued. Certainly, the grinding intensity of much of the music here surpasses even 1994's 'Awake' opus in terms of sheer metal mayhem, but almost all the trademark stylistic elements of Prog-Metal's flagship titans are still evident. Where 'Train of Thought' falls short is not in its songwriting prowess or artistic development: rather, the album feels like an interesting and in some spots profound experiment that unfortunately restricts the band into a self-imposed format that only hampers the blazing outpouring of skill we've come to expect.<br /> Its interesting to look at this album as a companion piece to 2001's 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence', and not a diametrically opposed rethink of direction as many seem to dub it. 'Six Degrees' explored the bands roots in 70's symphonic prog bands, with a full disc suite packed with melody and grandiose hooks. 'Train' sees them embrace the heavy metal aspect of their sound, stripping back any bloated ideals to an incandescent core. At least, thats what I believe was intended. What emerges here is an album that is resplendent with ingenious ideas, but  never seems to synthesize the elements into a coherent statement like thay have achieved in the past. Opener 'As I Am' immediately recalls 'Black' album era Metallica in its driving riffage and stop-start structure. The lyrics seemed like a powerful wake up call to me on first lsten, urging detractors to approach this album with no preconcieved ideas. As a lead single and entry track it works well, yet I feel it seriously lacks longevity, and could even detract from the albums impact over time. 'This Dying Soul' gets better and better with each sitting. Extending some of the musical ideas inaugurated on 'The Glass Prison' but mixing elements effortlessly, the first half of the song revolves around simply one of the best chorus hooks they've ever produced, while the second melts into a furious barrage of guitar and keys that is only beginning to take form in my mind. 'Endless Sacrifice' is another perfectly formed epic, with a driving chorus complementing a dreamy verse. The concluding section is really fantastic, and makes the lengthy song flash by instantly.<br /> 'Stream of Consciousness' certainly owes a stylistic and structural debt to Metallica's 'Orion', especially in the central, epic riff, but 'SOC' may even surpass that classic instrumental. For me, its by far the best thing here, accomplishing almost everything one could ever want a 12 minute instrumental to do (and then some), showcasing almost every shred of talent the band posseses and condensing reams of ideas into a masterful epic. 'In the Name of God' is a massive closer that tackles some topical themes well, although some of the lyrics feel slightly forced. Taking the time to address issues like religious Hypocrisy and pretexts for war doesnt, for me, feel at all necessary on a self proclamied heavy metal album, so I'm glad they decided to end on a thoughtful note. The songs music runs the gamut from breathless build ups to chugging riffs and huge choruses, a 15 minute fabric that allows for plenty of virtuoisty and showmanship.<br />Only 'Honor Thy father' seems rather underdeveloped to me: the chorus is less tham memorable, some sections are downright cringe inducing ('Dont cross the crooked step' anyone?) and only a few parts of the song redeem any interest.<br />As an intentional foray deeper into a core element of their sound, 'Train' is pretty much as good an album as I could expect from Dream Theater. It is lacking in places, and flaws seem to jumpout far more readily here than on anything else they've ever done. The keys often feel buried beaneth waves of guitar, John Myung is even more sidelined than before here (when will the band wake up and realise just how important it is to allow him to write the lyrics for at least one song), and even Portnoy's drums feel slightly less inspirational than before. Dont get me wrong, this is still a great album, and mandatory for fans. New fans would be well advised to start elsewhere though. Worth the money, but not their best, by a long shot.e lyrics for at least one song), and even Portnoy's drums feel slightly less inspirational than before.

B0000DD7LC|2.0|When i heard this album (the whole thing) I was very disapointed because I thought it would be as good as her first album, but I was wrong.  Some of the songs are good like &quot;Harlem Nocturne (intro)&quot;, &quot;Karma (my favorite track)&quot;, &quot;Heartburn (one of my favorite tracks)&quot;, &quot;You Don't Know my Name (the best song on the album)&quot;, &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;, &quot;Diary (amazing)&quot;, then...the album really gets wacker by the minute.  To tell you the truth &quot;Songs In A Minor (2003) &quot; is better than &quot;Diary&quot;, I don't reccomend this album to anyone, save your money or burn the cd, not worth the $10 or $15 bucks, (and I love Alicia, and do think she's tight, but...)
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is another classic from the creaters of Toy Story and A Bug's Life.<br />Albert Brooks voices Marlin, a clownfish who's entire family, except for one lone fish, are killed in an attack by a barricuda.  He is left as a single father raising his son, Nemo, voiced by Alexander Gould.  Naturally, Marlin is now afraid of the creatures in the water, and he tried to protect Nemo at all costs.  This includes keeping him out of school and away from his friends as long as possible.  When Nemo finally gets to go to school, Marlin still can't seem to let him go as he tracks him down on a field trip.  Fed up with his father's overprotectiveness, Nemo swims into open sea only to be captured by a diver's fishing net.  This leads Marlin on a race across the sea to find his son.  Along the way he meets Dora, a fish with a memory problem, voiced hilariously by Ellen DiGeneres, three sharks trying to get over their desire to eat fish, and a family of turtles who help show them the way.<br />In typical Disney/Pixar fashion, the characters grow and mature in a realistic, natural way.  In the end we forget they are even fish, or cartoons.  They are incredibly real.  This is a funny, hearwarming tale that is available on an incredibly fully loaded DVD.  The extras are phenomonal.  It would take about six hours to watch them all.<br />I highly recommend this film to everyone.  This is a family film that can be enjoyed by people without kids (like me), and to any fan of animation the extras are a must-see.
B00004T9UF|1.0|I cannot believe how trash like this could possibly be popular. I mean seriously, all this guy does is drones on by swearing and making seriously offensive lyrics. Another thing is, is how he dumbs down the population by saying that this is music! I swear, some of the most stupid people I have ever met have feminem fans. How do I know, well lets just say he disses his OWN fans and yet he still sells million of albums. He also showed no support for the victims of 9/11. When other bands and artists are doing charities for them, feminem showed no sypamthy for them at all. I could go on and on about how this guy sucks but I'll let this great site do the rest [...] Last word of advice: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP THAT IS FEMINEM!
B00000E3HM|5.0|Karajan's Mahler is not universally beloved. I feel, though, that Karajan tended to be at or near his best in Mahler. <br />I've been intrigued to find that some people who otherwise don't like Karajan's Mahler like this recording. What I find surprising about this is that Karajan is at his most . . . Karajan here, clearly reveling in the beautiful sounds that the Berlin Philharmonic can produce<br />If you're looking for a recording that emphasizes the rougher, more bumptious aspects of this music, you probably won't care for this one. Yes, it's all very smoothly played. Every detail is tended to so that it will all sound as exquisite as possible. But if you're not put off by Karajan's love for legato and sheer beauty of sound, I think you will find that he charts a real emotional journey in this performance. Just to hear every moment in this hourlong performance with every instrument in perfect balance is revelatory in itself, but I find this performance also has real power. And Edith Mathis is pretty close to ideal in the final movement, which has an almost hallucinatory feel in this performance.<br />I think that Barbirolli is still my favorite for this symphony, but Karajan runs a close second, which is not to discount Szell, Britten, and (though still not issued on CD) van Beinum.

0385507755|2.0|A poorly written, mundane account of a rich kid going through rehab. The inconsistantly capitalized Nouns are pretentious and annoying. Frey seems very much in love with himself as super-addict, and is tremendously smug. Unbelievably good luck comes his way thoughout this book, which both made me angry and made me doubt the veracity of his story. Despite what the pub weekly review above says, he's no David Foster Wallace, no Dave Eggers. Hell, he ain't even Dave Thomas, the Wendy's dude.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD arrived in the mail today and listening to it now is bringing back all of the emotions, reactions, and exhiliaration I felt sitting in the Gershwin theatre in early November.<br />For me, there's no competition between Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel. They're both stunningly fantastic. As another reviewer said, in a sense it's truly Idina's show, but the fact is, each leading lady, and the supporting cast, does a phenomenal job. I've been going to the theatre all of my life, and this show impressed me in a way no other ever has.<br />If you're hesitating, don't. Get this CD now. You'll listen to it again and again. You'll relive the show if you saw it, and you'll find yourself enraptured in a new story if you haven't yet.<br />If you aren't tickled pink (or green) by &quot;Popular&quot;, you must be in need of a brain. If you don't shed a tear or two during &quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot;, you're obviously lacking a heart. And if &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; doesn't stir your soul to action and send a thrill through you, then go and hide in the bushes with the Cowardly Lion, because you're bereft of courage and vigor.<br />In other words, no, I guess I have to gush. &lt;g&gt;
6302891272|4.0|I am a student of NIS(nagoya international school), and I saw the 'throne of blood' during my English liturature class. I afraid that I 'm not either japanese nor american, so I thought I would not understand clearly, but since I read Macbeth, and saw some of movies Shakespeare's verson which means I know basic story of Macbeth, and fortunely there was a caption in English, so it was easy to understand. Also I afraid the languages of Shakespeare's, becuase I didn't sure that Japanese can use the magnitude languages which is used by shakespeare. As I respect, the language was not rich as much as shakespear's, but director shows some scenes of interest scenes to cover the language that couldn't translate everything of shakespeare's language. Also it was pretty interest to see the Macbeth of samurai verson. I would strongly recommend this movie for student who wants to know Macbeth's interest.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is simply one of the best cd's out there, from one of the best bands out there. Jack white is definitly one of the primer guitarists in music today. Definitly a good buy if you enjoy blues or garage band rock. I cant give it anything else but a 5 star rating.
6304779356|5.0|This black comedy brilliantly combines terror and hilarity, with more than a nod to it's progenitor, Polanski's &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers.&quot; And, believe it or not, there's a riveting discussion of both films in the book, &quot;The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Interview With the Vampire.&quot;
0316666343|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in years.  Alice Sebold's first foray into literature is somehow both simple and complex as she delves into the human soul through the straitforward eyes of a young girl.  Susie's premature, violent death affects each of her family members in a different (but equally heartwrenching) way.  Their pain is palatable, as is her longing to return to the life of which she was robbed.  Yet the story is full of hope and Susie is able to &quot;live&quot; again, albeit vicariously (for the most part), by following her friends and family.  I found her silent but maturing relationship with her younger sister particularly heartwarming.  I would recommend this book (and have) to anyone.
B00009TB5G|5.0|After seeing the extended &quot;Fellowship&quot; I was incredibly eager to see the extended &quot;Two Towers.&quot;  Again, I was far from disappointed.<br />&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is NOT the same kind of movie as &quot;Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;  It's slower moving, more thought-provoking, and doesn't flow quite the same way.  Nevertheless, it is a fantasic film, and there is a lot of good to say about it.<br />The added scenes did little to dispel the somewhat disjointed quality of the movie, but it helped you to understand things a little better.  The Fellowship itself has broken up, and consequently it jumps back and forth between parties a little bit -- entirely understandable.  We track Frodo and Sam, Aragorn (with Legolas and Gimli at his side), Gandalf, and Merry and Pippin.  That's a lot of stories to keep track of!<br />But there is wonderful footage of all of it!<br />One of my personal favorite things is when they go back in time to Gondor when Boromir first went to join the Fellowship.  In the original release, we never saw Boromir at all, only his brother Faramir.  This flashback provides a little bit of insight into the people of Gondor, and we understand the character of Faramir a little better.<br />Also, when the Ents take Isengard, this new extended version adds the Forest of Fangorn attacking the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep!  I was so glad they put that back into the film!  Huzzah!<br />And the effect of Treebeard himself was incredible as well.  Some critics complained that he was so unconvincing, but I ask you -- if a tree got up and walked and talked, what do YOU think it would look like?!  The Ents were fantastic.<br />One of the best characters in this second film is obviously Smeagol/Gollum.  Talk about complete genius!  This CG character was phenomenal, I have never seen anything so totally convincing.  Understanding that particular character is SO integral to the story!  He was amazing to watch.<br />And, of course, the extras in thisDVD are terrific as well.  It's worth getting the extended version just to watch those!<br />Now, I can't wait until the THIRD one comes out!  ;-)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that others haven't said? This show is as close to perfection as any show can ever come. The cast, the crew, the story - everything perfect from day one. I bought my set the day of release and I held out as long as possible when watching the 3 unaired episodes because I knew that when I did watch them I'd feel the sense of loss that one has when finishing a truly great book. I watched the last episode and I've since re-watched all the episodes 3 times and after each episode my sense of loss for this show deepens.<br />For FOX to cancel good TV shows is to be expected; whoever it is makes those decisions at FOX is completely out of tune with the viewers. But this show, this cast, these writers are TOO GOOD to simply accept FOX' short-sightedness in this case; they all deserve so much more than FOX.<br />I've been a huge fan of Star Trek for over 20 years and no show in my mind could ever came close to Star Trek... until now. Firefly not only beats out Star Trek, it pounds it mercilessly into dust and tears off ahead.<br />Buy this set, watch it, treasure it and HOPE that someone, somewhere seizes the opportunity to bring this show back and give it the long life it so deserves.<br />If only I could give more than a mere 5 stars.
B0000BWVCL|4.0|Who says hollywood sequels are always a letdown?<BR>The X-Men franchise went ballistic with the release of Singer's second foray into Marvel's mutant universe.<BR>Some would complain that the special effects overshadowed the story, to those people I remind them this movie is a comic adaptation, not Spartacus redux. Some may complain there was too much story not enough action in a Marvel big screen extraganza, to these people I remind them if they have ever read an X-Men comic book the comic was always about the characters and story and not neccessarily about da Crash Boom Bang comic effects.<BR>There are more mutants in the sequel we meet Iceman and Nightcrawler, and Colossus has a brief cameo just to name a few, and how could we forget Pyro (ahhh but saying more about him would give it away). Yet this is NOT a case of quantity over quality. The viewer and fan learns more about Wolverine's origins, sees Rogue in blossoming romance and revisits the tension of love triangle between Scott Jean and Wolverine.<BR>I had high expectations when I watched this movie, and honestly say Singer didn't disappoint.
B000089RVX|1.0|How can it be that a recording with no melody, no rhythm, no tune, no variance in pitch, and nothing new lyrically... how can such a recording become a monster seller and command the accolades of the elite music press?  Who is in bed with whom?  Five Grammy nominations can't be wrong, you say?  Sure they can - the Grammys are all about industry self-congratulation and attaboys for selling low-grade junk in volume.<br />I have no issue with the angst of the band, but when it's the ONLY thing that they do at all (never mind whether they do it &quot;well&quot;), then you're better off listening to NIN or some old Joy Division - at least those bands actually made music.<br />Please skip this disc and put Evanescence out of our misery.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is an amazing work of art. everything song on the album has its own world and story to it. also the artwork on the inside goes with the music. favourite songs are Climbing Up The Walls, Karma Police, and No Surprises! SERIOUSLY BUY THIS ALBUM! downloading it is not the same. SUPPORT YOUR MUSIC!
B00006LFGD|2.0|If ever an example of the pointlessness of celebrity duets was needed, then this is it. Barbra and her friends try and out sing each other in a dreary collection of very poor songs. The only exceptions being the duets with Barry Gibb, Neil Diamond and Johnny Mathis. The rest just scream of the record company trying anything to get a hit. As album tracks they may be ok, but all grouped together it is just way,way too much.

B000002UJQ|5.0|As I fan of the Bends, I bought this CD in '97 when it first came out.  Before I opened it, I went to Blockbuster music(R.I.P)...remember when they sold music and let you HEAR it before you bought it?...well I returned it after listening to a couple tracks.....it sounded weird to me after a short listening(I was young and naive).  I got it a year later and it is the CD that made Radiohead my &quot;favorite&quot; band.  Now almost 7 years later, no single album has had such an impact musically, spiritually, and mentally.  But maybe that's a good thing cos RH caused me appreciate music more and not write groups off after a one listen.    I don't listen to them nearly as much as I did before, but this is one album I'll remember when I first &quot;got it&quot;.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only bad thing about buying these DVD's is how upset you will be when you've finished watching them and you realise their aren't going to be any more to buy!  The best sci-fi series produced over the last 5 years with potential to be absolutely huge worldwide (forget Buffy or Farscape etc!) and it get's cancelled!  Just heard that FOX is producing another series of American Idol though so at least you can see the kind of people who have made the decision!  Fingers crossed that eventually it all comes together again!  A brilliant series!

B00004SA86|5.0|I was first introduced to Mahler's music from my music teacher back in primary school, she let me listern to the famous recording of the &quot;Song of the Earth&quot; conducted by Lenoard Bernstein, since then I become a romantic classical era fan! (Mahler, Bruckner, Wagner...)<br />Althouhg Rafael Kubelik's Mahler cycle is bit slower then Bernstein's complete recording, it does shows the lyrical side of the symphonies, which is descrition the natural cycle of living things, from birth to death.<br />I personally viewpoint on listerning to Mahler's cycle as a long requiem mass.  I will normally play the entire cycle in a continued form rather then playing a certain one.

Every song on here is worth the money pay for this whole album. This cd is a better compiliation than Who Made Who, even though this is not a compilation,just to let u new comers know. My personal favorites are, Back in Black, You Shook me all night long, Hells Bells and then the rest are all tied. If you dont own this awesome album, you need it now!!!

Ofcourse this was a more of a twenty something kind of movie, but the dancing was awesome! Jessica does some great sexy moves here. I've liked her since she was in \\"Never Been Kissed\\", and I was really into her \\"Dark Angel\\" series. Although this movie has sort of a weak story line, you know, young pretty girl, rough city, has ambitions, boss is a jerk, dream comes true, the end, I was really into all the dancing! The music was great as well. I recommend this movie!

0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is the original and most amazing novel of all of Jane Austen novels.<br /> The most wonderful chapter is chapter eight where Elizabeth Bennet shows off her witty and exhilarating character. She is very beautiful and has a shining personality.<br /> This novel has amazing, fantastic wording as well as chapters. The appropriate age for this novel to be read would most likely be from 16 years of age and up because younger readers aren't mature or they don't have the knowledge that has to be applied to read this novel.<br /> Jane Austen beautifully brings out irony of fate; everything is expected to go one way but ends up another. For example, when the Bennet family thought that Wickham took Lydia to London to elope. The family thought the worse. They kept in mind that Wickham could possibly try to bed Lydia and not consider that he would propose to her. They were scared for Lydia and Wickham. At last they were found and brought back to Longbourn estate and surprisingly they were safe and engaged.<br /> This has been the best novel I have ever read in my life. I have never indulged in a novel like Pride and Prejudice. I adored the truth and reality that it holds.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I stepped into the lobby of the Gershwin Theater on the rain-soaked night of November  19,  2003, drenched to the core.  My shoes were wet, my friends  were a bit late and I was cranky.  Even worse, I saw that one of the two main stars, Kristen Chenoweth, would not be appearing (she had a cold, I read later).  I was an inch away from turning in my ticket  and heading home to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  BOY, am I glad I stayed.  <br />The night proved  to be one of the most amazing I have ever had in the theater.  The show and Stephen (Pippin) Schwartz\\"s songs, based on Gregory Maguire's novel, just continued to get better as the night went on.  The show involves friendship, betrayal, romance, being different, gutless politicians, balancing ideals against  desires, and about a dozen other things.  It's genuinely affecting and well-staged without the sugary aspects that can turn a lot of people off to musical theater.  The main theme is what's really good and what's really evil?   \\"Wicked\\" is largely seen from the point of view of Elphaba, the green-skinned \\"witch\\" of the east who arrives in the Emerald City full of hope and promise, well before Dorothy blew into town.<br />Melissa Bell, the woman who was substituting as Glinda, the \\"good\\" witch did a very nice job.  The rest of the cast, including Norbert Leo Butz as the prince were extremely talented.  But nothing prepared me for Idina Menzel, who plays Elphaba the \\"wicked witch\\" of the east.  I'd heard her before on the \\"Rent\\" cast album.  But I guess seeing someone live is a different experience. This lady not only has a beautiful voice, she gives a performance that betters almost anything I've ever seen on Broadway.  This is a superstar turn that lifts the audience out of its collecive seats.  Whether it's a ballad like \\"I'm not that Girl,\\" or the roof-raising \\"Defying Gravity\\" number that closes the first act, Ms. Menzel held the audience in her spell.  She spins you between touching moments and thrillingones, with a lot of help from the show's creators who have wisely created showcase numbers  for both stars.<br />Listening to the wonderfully-performed cast album this week,  I finally had a chance to hear Kristen Chenoweth.  She sparkles as much as Ms. Menzel in her numbers. The giddy \\"Popular\\" where she gives Elphaba a make-over is probably her strongest turn.  I've had the chance to see her on stage in NYC (On A  Clear Day  You  Can See Forever).  I'm going back to see the show again on Jan. 13th and am looking forward to hearing her crystalline voice (from the back of the theater this time :(  <br />But for me, \\"Wicked\\" is always going to remind me of the night I learned about a new and budding superstar - Idina Menzel.  Trust me on this.  If you're going to be in NYC, get yourself a ticket to this show!   If you can't make it to NYC, buy the cast album.  If you even remotely like musical theater,  you'll enjoy it a lot.<br />I looked Ms. Menzel's recordings up on Amazon after the show.  Aside from the theater, she apparently cut a CD back in 1998. It's out of print now.  But you can bet it'll get re-released soon.

0790744295|4.0|Director George Romero (Night of the Living Dead) and horror author extraordinairre Stephen King teamed up for this adaptation/homage to the classic 1950's horror EC Comics, and while the film as a whole has it's share of creepy moments, it's more of a fun horror film, and a labor of love for Romero and King.  Five tales are told, beginning with a dead, rich father coming back to life for his birthday cake (yes, you read that right), a simplistic farmer finding a strange meteorite, an insanely jealous husband taking vengeance on his cheating wife and her lover only to get it back to him, a mistreated husband discovering a box containing a monster which he unleashes on his drunken wife, and a man with a severe cockroach problem.  Featuring Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson, and even King himself, plus great gore and makeup effects by the always excellent Tom Savini; Creepshow is a real treat.

B00005JMCN|3.0|First off, I was disappointed with this adaptation of Hillenbrand's well written bio. Maybe because I read the book first, enjoying the authors obvious love of horses and extensive reasearch she and her &quot;helpers&quot; did. I don't know, I found the direction and writing filled with too many Hollywood cliches. Ross' annoying direction, moving the camera in a haphazard way, giving the impression to me that alot of the scenes seemed like practice shots, testing how the camera should move. In some ways, his direction reminds me of William Shatner's direction on Star Trek V. The camera moves with no purpose, and it should. Also, I thought the music score was all wrong for the film. A score can help a story, but Newman's music appears to show the films flaws even more. Overall, I liked the story and the cast, though I felt Ross took a lot of liberties. Which,most of the time, does not bother me. I realize compressing a book to give it a linear feel on the silver screen sometimes calls for such alterations, but I felt they hindered the film -including Macy's turn as the radio announcer, a completely made up character. I was reminded through the whole film of Bob Ueker's role in the Major League films. This was a drama, filled with many hard realities -like the weight issue which seemed to glossed over also - and adding a character that would not have been out of place in A League of Their Own was a lame attempt at adding humor.
B00005JMGC|1.0|This film is not a portrait of the individual characters but simply a theme using characters.  The emotional transitions are non existent. We can not see why certain characters change.  Why does Julia Roberts character suddenly fall in love the Italian Instructor??  There is no romantic precursors to this event.  Why does Julia Stiles character suddenly think Ms. Watson is a great teacher?? We only see a few interactions with them, which are aimless and empty.<BR>  Several reviews compared this film to the great, \\"Dead Poets Society\\".  There is NO comparison whatsoever, except in the timeline and circumstances. \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" used precise character examinations to portray a fluid like story.  DPS was conceived and executed in the way great films are.  \\"Mona Lisa's Smile\\" was conceived and executed in the way a Junior High School play with no adult writer or director does.<BR>  Do not waste your time on this film! You will thank me...
0679720200|5.0|Welcome to Camus' world as he bares his soul open to the benign indifference of the universe. Camus immediately captures our attention with the first three sentences of the \\"Stranger\\". Camus masterfully interplays his character's seemingly cold and unfeeling perception of life's events with his unwitting innocence. The psychology that abounds this story is amazing. <br />I highly recommend this classic book.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera, Whale Rider is an intelligent independent film by director Niki Caro. This is a poignant and powerful coming of age tale and also the story of a people who are struggling to maintain their identity and the old ways. There are strong mythical components to the film. The underwater shots of whales, and a young girl who seems to sense their presence and commune with them, are mystical and breathtaking. And the scenes of Maori dance and the narration of their mythology are extraordinary.<br />The film is set on the eastern coast of New Zealand, which is inhabited by an ancient people, the Whangara. The narrator is a wonderfully expressive young actress, Keisha Castle-Hughes. She gives a riveting performance as Paikea, (called Pai), a twelve year-old Maori girl with the blood of royalty in her veins and the heart of a warrior in her chest. The movie opens with Pai narrating a Whangara myth. Legend has it that the native people came to New Zealand following their leader, Paikea, (who Pai is named for), a boy who heroically rode on the back of a whale. Traditionally, tribal leadership has always gone to the direct descendants of that first leader and always to the first born male of the noble line. Tragedy occurs, however, when fraternal twins are born into that line, a boy and a girl. The girl lives, the boy does not, and the mother perishes along with her son as a result of a difficult birthing. The chain of leadership is broken with their demise. Pai's father, an artist, can not come to grips with the deaths of his wife and son and so he leaves New Zealand, and Pai, who is cared for by her paternal grandparents.<br />Years pass and Pai, at age twelve, has absorbed as much Maori knowledge as she is able from her grandfather Koro, (Rawiri Paratene), who is disapproving of his granddaughter's seemingly insatiable appetite to become a Maori leader. He has never quite forgiven her for being born a female, nor for living while her brother died. She exudes a true warrior's spirit and courage, which her grandfather refuses to see. Koro is desperately searching for a prophet - someone to lead his people &quot;out of the darkness and who will make everything all right again.&quot; When Koro starts a school for young boys, all first-born, to teach the old traditions, Pai is forbidden to attend. She desperately wants her grandfather's love and has some pretty tough abandonment issues to deal with - her father, who left her when she was an infant and her beloved grandfather who is emotional unavailable to her. I will not spoil the plot by revealing more. This film is must-see.<br />The photography and landscapes, both underwater and above, are absolutely magnificent. The acting is marvelous and from the heart. Pai's and Koro's love-hate relationship, the tension between them, is nothing short of powerful. And I guarantee you will need a pack of Kleenex at the film's end.<br />JANAdied. She exudes a true warrior's spirit and courage, which her grandfather refuses to see.

B00009RDG8|4.0|As far as Hollywood chase films are concerned, Tommy Lee Jones has the market cornered. Since his academy award winning performance in The Fugitive, it seems like he's starred in just about every chase flim since. The characters that he plays are all slightly different but essentially the same. But there's three things you can count on with most of these films, and that is they're an entertaining ride from the beginning, there's inevitably an action scene involving water or a water fall, and old Tommy always gets his man, dead or alive.<br />~The Hunted~ moves along quickly, beginning with Benicio Del Toro's character on a search and destroy mission in Kosovo. He mission is successful and he is awarded the Silver Star for Valour, however this success comes with a price - his sanity. As it turns out, the boy is a killing machine gone rogue, currently murdering innocent civilians in the forest, and the only person who can match his skill and apprehend him, is the guy who trained him in the first place. Tommy Lee Jones plays a character based on a real individual, who trains the military Special Forces to survive in the wilderness, track animals and humans with hardly anything to work with, and expertly kill with a minimum of fuss. Now with all the necessary background information firmly in place, the stage is set, and the chase commences...<br />The most fascinating thing to watch in the film is the knife battles between Tommy Lee Jones and Del Toro. One can see that the actors have been expertly trained and have spent many hours rehearsing to ensure these knife scenes come off in a realistic fashion. The battles do in fact run a little too long, as with any fight on the silver screen, but that's the only unreal aspect, otherwise they're extremely believable.<br />~The Hunted~ delivers on all counts - this is a solid action film.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album f**king rules. The music is great. QOTSA really know how to whip up good music. This album features great hits such as, &quot;You think I ain't worth a dollar, but I feel like a Millionare&quot;, &quot;No One Knows&quot;, &quot;Go with the Flow&quot; and much much more. I never get sick of this album. And the bonus dvd that comes with it features a few live performances which is pretty good considering the dvd is free. So if you like good music, then get this album and more of the Queens work. And check out their side projects as well. If want to keep listening to REAL rock n roll, also check out CKY.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|These ONE STAR reviews are not actual reviews, just people that didn't even listen to the new CD.  For Britney fans, you'll love this CD!  It's her most mature recording to date and it's the fans who win.  As her previous CD, &quot;Britney&quot; was one of the best pop records released in 2001, &quot;In The Zone&quot; is one of the most adventurous.  It may take 3 or 4 listens to get it, but Britney is growing up and so is the music.  Both versions of &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; are great, so is the beautiful &quot;Everytime.&quot;  I'm glad Britney is back!
B0000DD7NL|2.0|er.... ....unfortunately the bits that are good are not original and the bits that are original are not good.<br />The music and vocals sounds a lot like Destiny's Child on this album - sung by a soloist instead of a trio. The songs are predictable and Ms Keys has made an album that is very substandard, in my opinion. Ms Keys is supposed to be some sort of great 'talent'. Well, she sounds like she's got writer's block on this album.<br />Not much else to say except a warning - never buy an album where more time, money and effort has gone into the artist's clothes, makeup and photography than the actual music on the disc. If Alicia Keys is the 'future' of R'n'B, then God help us all!
6301095294|1.0|&gt;THAT was the very point. Paul was INTENTIONALLY paying homage to the French new-wave avante-gaurde film directors he apparently admired so much privately. The clueless and UNsavvy English film critics [sic] establishment at the time couldnt [sic] figure out WHAT the point was.<br />Oh, I think the British critics who reviewed this unfavorably when it was originally aired on BBC televison were at least as cinematically versed as Paul McCartney. (By the way, there is such a thing as an apostrophe. It is used to show possession and to mark contractions.)<br />&gt;The &quot;point&quot; was it was supposed to be a...a &quot;non-event&quot; that was filmed. On THAT level it certainly DID succeed.<br />Kind of difficult NOT to succeed &quot;on THAT level&quot;.<BR>  <BR>&gt;The film is now widely credited for offering the first self-contained &quot;music videos&quot;--- an innovation the MTV GENERATION owes to Sir Paul directly. <br />However widely credited it may be, it is ERRONEOUSLY credited. Richard Lester's &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, released in 1964, used &quot;self-contained `music videos'&quot;. Think of the &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; scene. I don't know if Richard Lester was the first, but since &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; was a Beatles movie, it is hard to imagine Paul McCartney not getting the idea from Richard Lester, if you call that an idea.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|In this age of cookie cutter artists, Alicia Keys is a refreshing departure. This CD, like her first offers the best of both old and new styles blended together to offer a ray of hope that R&amp;B continues as a strong source of inspiration. The use of natural instruments and techniques blended with electronics is the key to this artist's longevity in her career. The music truly comes from the soul and NOT a factory. Alicia Keys is a leader NOT a follower. I just hope 20 years from now we are still enjoying her craft, and her career spans the ages, as does her gifted insight to music in general. One other thing I also hope she remains true to her self and her fans, and not go down the path of &quot;I'm too good to speak to you artists&quot; Keep up the music from the soul Alicia, I might be 40 something, but your music is very refreshing. Keep it real girl.
B00009ATIX|2.0|Natascha McElhone may be a fine actress but her 'who am I, where am I?' portrayal of a deceased woman materializing in outer space lacks much conviction of whatever the film is trying to convince us of. There are moments of intense drama here; George Clooney blankly staring at a torn jagged hole in the spaceship wall, but there is also a dreary unsensational flashback romance occupying most of the film that moves like a wedding march to a funeral drum and does little to build suspense or understanding. The movie intersperses to the image of pink neon gasses surrounding the planet Solaris constantly as if saying, to increasing annoyance, 'meanwhile back on the ranch&quot;. &quot;Solaris&quot; could have been intriguing if it had realized it's psychological and cinematic potential as alternative science-fiction. Come to think of it, haven't I seen all this before, albeit on a much smaller budget, in an episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;?
0738206679|4.0|Barabasi's Linked is a pretty good intro to the science of networks.  It covers much the same ground as Buchanan's Nexus including discussions about random v. nonrandom networks, six degrees of separation related stuff, the AIDS epidemic, etc. Linked also covers a several more topics in greater detail than does Nexus including viruses and fads, and Barabasi presents very good discussions of search engines and the good-old-boy network of board members.  Another appealing aspect of the book is that the author and his co-workers were involved in a number of the developments in the science of networks, so we can be sure that the author's explanations are grounded in his own experience.<br />If you want to read one book about networks and you're deciding between Nexus and Linked, I would recommend Nexus, however.  Nexus' discussions are deeper, and its presentation and writing are better.
078322608X|4.0|Nothing special but a good brain twister. This movie has the most plot twisters i can ever think of. The ending is really sad and I truly wasn't expecting it. It is much better then Bruce Willis's The Fifth Element. It reminds me of the matrix, it has that style to it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I've had this cd for a day and I've already had to change the batteries in my cd player!  One of my friends told me about Mr. Groban and I was very impressed by the fact that he's so young yet has the voice of an older performer.  &quot;My Confession&quot; is beautiful and if you ever wanted to win a girl over, there's no doubt this song would do it.  My other top favorite is &quot;Si Volvieras A Mi.&quot;  I don't know what's being said but the sound is so beautiful it could pull at anyone's heart.  If it doesn't, then they've no heart.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What a great CD!  <br />The only song I missed was the one when nessarose becomes the wicked witch of the east.<br />But overall, what an amazing cd...worth waiting the 2 months (I saw the show in Oct) for.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Majestic.  Suitably epic.  Strikingly intimate.  Emotional.<BR>This is how I would describe Hans Zimmer's latest work, the score to Edward Zwick's fantastic epic, The Last Samurai.  Zimmer, who previously defined military theme music with his brilliant work on Crimson Tide, The Peacemaker and The Rock, blends his love of rousing horns with soft, soothing strings in The Last Samurai.  The end result sounds something along the lines of Zimmer's The Thin Red Line score mixed with his Gladiator themes.  Needless to say, it's an aural delight, and listening to Zimmer blend deep Western horns and themes with Japanese flutes and strings sends chills down the spine.  <BR>I'll stop there to avoid retreading too many cliches.  If you're a fan Hans Zimmer's previous work, you'll find this CD easily sliding working its way on to the shelf with your &quot;Favorites,&quot; and if you're a fan of strong, theme-driven orchestral music, The Last Samurai may be right up your alley.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This album is simply one of the greatest albums a person can buy. I picked this album up around 6 years ago and it can still be found in my cd player. The intro to the song (bomb first) is one of the hardest songs in the history of rap targetting Tupac's enemies. Hail Mary is a very deep song that can be interpretted in many ways from religious to a song of hate. Toss it up is a another slap song that can be found in clubs. To live in die in LA is a laid back, chill type of song that really makes u feel that you know Tupac, being in his position of growing up in the hood. Blasphemy is a great song, that refers to Christianity, explaining how Tupac was not a God but rather a disciple not trying to murder his enemies literally, but lyrically. Just like Daddy is a nice song in general but I find it to be the worse song on the album. Krazy is an awesome song, great for blazing too, just chillin and looking back on life. White Man'z World is a self-explanatory song that also describes hard times. Me and My Girlfriend is another original track (he's not talking about his girlfriend,hes comparing her to a gun). Hold ya Head is another OK song. Against all Odds is a deep and slap song. Ask 50 cent, he bit off of it. Overall, this album is one of the greatest. Period.
0780622553|5.0|This movie is truly a master piece. It has such a dark and errie feel to it. The dark atmosphere makes it in a way scary and unpredictable. Jennifer Connely did a great job in acting in this movie. I love aliens and this movie has them in it. It was exciting to, a great thriller.
B000069CWE|5.0|First thing to be said from me is if you don't like hip-hop and are just pretty much a true rocker do not i repeat do not by this album please!!  But this is a great cd and the best remix album I have ever heard.  This album has less of Chester Bennington and more of Mike Shinoda.  This showcases more of his talents of his amazing lyrics.  But to tell the truth I think that this in the end was way crappier than the one on Hybrid.  But probably if you are a headbanger you will love more of by myself and \\"One step closer\\" and \\"Pts. of Authority\\".  But if you are into alternative you will like \\"My December, Pushing Me Away, and especially Crawling\\" featuring the beautiful voice of Aaron Lewis of Staind.  But if you like Hip-Hop you would love in the end, forgotten, place for my head, high voltage, and papercut. Overall this is a great cd.  I am in to all these types of music and love it.  This has a great quality and I am loving it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Set in a future that is believable and exciting, this show is an excellent example of science fiction.  Joss Whedon, the shows creator, says it best when he says \\"Serenity is the type of ship the Enterprise would've just blown right by.\\"    The show is the story of a captain (and his crew) who are just trying to survive.  They pilot a cargo transport doing whatever jobs they can find.  They smuggle goods, steal from the wealthy, whatever they can to make ends meet.  The catch?  They aren't in a battleship, they in an unarmed cargo ship.    The acting is surprisingly good, mostly because the actors play a role that they seem well-suited to.  Acting ability may not be particularly gifted, but when your character seems to fit (fairly closely) your own personality, how much acting are you really doing?  The stories are exciting and interesting.  The characters motivations are realistic.  They have emotions and goals.  They have wants and desires, but they sometimes have to shelf these feelings for the greater good, survival.    Other sci-fi shows often times give the epic fight of good vs. evil.  Here, it can be similar.  The crew is obviously good.  But what do they do when in order to survive they have to steal?  Well, they steal.  The bad guys come after them?  They run.  They aren't super heros, they are simple people caught in a bad situation, life.    I would highly recommend the show.  I am, of course, a fan.  The fans of this show are extremely dedicated.  Odds are, if you are even bothering to read my review, you are a fan like me.  The fans to this show were so dedicated when it went off the air that they raised funds to advertise for it.  They wrote in again and again to try and keep the show on the air.  We failed, but we got something anyway.  A motion picture.  Serenity is a movie follow-up that takes place after the show.  I'd highly recommend both.
B0000009SY|5.0|Do people really understand this album?  All the other reviews rant about the same parts of the album: the beginning and the second to last song.  I used to feel the same way at first when I discovered this album.  But you know, as with any album, the songs you liked best at the beginning are not necessarily the ones you will like best later on.<br />The first part of the album is &quot;easy&quot;, and the Watermelon solo too.  But the more I listened to the album, the more I began to appreciate and really like the songs that were in between these two parts, especially starting when Joe gets out.  This sounds like a structureless piece of music, but listen closely and many times and you will really like that second CD.  Maybe even better than the first one.<br />Don't miss Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up, A Token Of My Extreme, Sy Borg, Outside Now, He Used To Cut The Grass and Packard Goose!
B00000I8UK|5.0|If I were stuck on a desert island and could only bring one CD with me, it would be Eric Dolphy's OUT TO LUNCH.  This is the greatest jazz album ever recorded, it is a masterpeice, a work of art.  This is like peotry like, Shakesphere, like Van Gough, like Piccaso.  This is something that will open a whole new world for you.  Eric's &quot;dolphin call&quot; like solos are amazing and WILD!!!  This is really &quot;out There&quot;(another good Dolphy cd).  BUY IT!!!c  you NEED to hear this.  It is a bit disturbing to some, at 1st, but oh it really isd better then therepy!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I like practically every type of music (except for boy bands). That said, this is my favorite album by any band of any type. Here's how I rate the songs:<BR>1. Welcome- It's like 10 seconds of a monotone speaking. Good for a laugh. And according to the booklet, it's spoken by John Mayer. Go figure. No rating.<BR>2. Have You Ever- What a great way to open a great album. Noodles and Greg blend perfectly and the vocals are cool. 5/5.<BR>3. Staring at the Sun- The perfect followthrough for Have You Ever. Loud and Fast. 4.5/5.<BR>4. Pretty Fly for a White Guy- I've heard it so many times, I'm sick of it, but for the first 50 listens, it's pretty good and pretty funny. 3.75/5.<BR>5. The Kids Aren't Alright- A good song, if a bit of a downer. Great intro and even better chorus. 4/5.<BR>6. Feelings- It's so sarcastic, you'll laugh out loud. It's even good musically. 4/5.<BR>7. She's Got Issues- Sorta funny, nothing good musically. 2.75/5.<BR>8. Walla Walla- Now this is a great song. Funny, good to listen to, fast, loud. Great stuff. 5/5.<BR>9. The End of the Line- Kinda sad, but such a good song that you should still listen to it. 4.75.<BR>10. No Brakes- It's loud and fast, but I don't like it all that much for some reason. 2.5/5.<BR>11. Why Don't you Get a Job?- Funny and catchy as all get out. You'll laugh from the first line. 4/5.<BR>12. Americana- Just a good song. Nothing else to say. 4.5/5.<BR>13. Pay the Man- Kind of a weird ending to a great album, I don't know what to think of it. Just put up with 4 minutes of silence after the song ends to hear a funny mix of PFFAWG. 3.5/5.<BR>As an added bonus, pop it in your computer. It has Karaoke and some funny videos (as well as the music video to I Choose- the song that got me hooked on The Offspring!).
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is da best CD ever. No rapper out there can bring it as well as Eminem. I got all his albums. This one is definantly da best. I love every song that CD. I recommend it to anyone who likes good hip-hop. He is a lyrical genius. Besides Tupac, I think that Eminem is the realest rapper out there. The only people that wouldn't like this CD are f***** punk a** rockers who listen to ICP, Korn, Linkin Park, and all the other corny a** bands out there. I don't care what anyone says, rock sucks. I'll f*** up the next rocker that says rap sucks to my face. Hip-Hop fans, take my advice, buy dis CD!!!

B00000JG41|5.0|This album isnt like their old stuff, which is good for some and bad for some, but all i know is this album has the flow of a pink floyd album, with the lyrics and the feel of a sort of frank zappa/queen sort of bit, if thats possible.  i have a bunch of good music, new and old, and this is one of my favorites, i highly recomend it to anyone with good taste whos willing to get lost for about an hour.

B0000CAQ27|2.0|I haven't seen any confirmation of this being a B-Side album or not, but the quality sure is B-Side material.  In reality, I'm comparing this album to Pink's Mizundastood album, which was an amazing album.  Maybe she outdid herself on that album.  Who knows?<br />What I do know, is Try This is a weak attempt, and upon hearing it, I began to do research if this was actually a collection of B-Sides rather than a full length studio album.  Could be.  I'm not sure.  If this is not a B-Side album, I think Pink needs to reconsider what made her famous in the first place and stick to that.  She curses in almost every song on this album, her poppy sound is totally gone, and it's a flat out struggle to stay zoned into these poor quality songs.<br />Sorry, Alisha.. this album just isn't your best.
B000060P79|2.0|I bought this CD because I like the pop/rock bands blink-182 and mxpx.  I wouldn't go as far as saying these bands are punk, but they do have punk elements, much like simple plan.  <BR>Anyway, this band seems to have formed a plan to apeal to teenagers who are going through problems that teenagers go through, even though the band members themselves are in their 20's.  That is just a little too lame for me.  I thought there would be lyrics for people like me who are past all of that crap and don't want to deal with it.  But no...they wrote songs that whine about teen problems.  I understand they are trying to help teens out with their problems and are at a good age to do it because they have been through it all, but they really need to MOVE ON.  It is very lame to sing these type of songs when you aint even in that era of your life anymore.  What a bunch of retards.  If your like me and you like pop/rock music like blink-182 and the newer mxpx stuff because the lyrics are past all the teen crap or you are a teen and don't want to hear about teen crap, then DO NOT buy this CD.  I did and I wasted my money.  Save your cash and buy some better music that has lyrics that show the band that wrote the lyrics are moving on with their lives or are just not whining about life, unlike Simple Plan's stupid plan to appeal to teens who actually like hearing about the whiney lifestyle that this band must have had in their teens.  That's a stupid way to live and this band is promoting it.  Give me a break.  If you have bought this CD already, trash it.  I don't care how old you are.  Just trash it.  It isn't worth owning unless your a teen girl who thinks the guys look hot.  I'm a guy and this sure as hell is not guy music.  Otherwise just throw it away.  Teen crap is what this band is all about.  In the words of blink-182 in Anthem Part II on Take Off Your Pants And Jacket:  \\"Teenage rules they're... boring\\".<BR>Thank you for your time.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Honestly it is one of the best CDs (if not the best) I have ever heard. It is very powerfull and it is full of passion. It is fresh and new. They don't copy any other band, they have many new ideas. It is not easy to take, it is full of guitars, and has a strong bass!!! If you like it I also recommend to get some live recordings of the Smashing Pumpkins, becouse they are even better on concerts.

B0000C9ZLD|3.0|How can an album be dull, yet somewhat solid at the same time?  Well, The Stokes managed to do it with &quot;Room on Fire&quot;.  Their sound is differen than anything else out there.  A very experimental sound, which I took quite a liking to.  I just wish that on this album, the Stokes would have broadened their range a bit, instead of staying in the same zone throughout.<br />The singer sings in the same range in all the songs, and if you're not paying close attention while listeninng, it sounds like you heard the same song for 30 minutes straight, with the exception of 12:51, which is far and away their best song to date.  Now, with that said, the music doesn't bore me to death.  It's good music, but it's too repetative for my liking.  I'd like to see more highs and lows.  But they played it safe and stayed within the same range.  Fair album, but not the best they can do.
0790729369|5.0|The book, which was a little over the top in terms of pathos, was too much for lots of people. But there's hardly a person I've spoken to who didn't love the movie. Part of the success of the film, a huge part, was the choice of director and actors. Clint Eastwood directed it and costarred opposite Meryl Streep, who played Francesca, a lonely farm wife with a kind husband who doesn't realize what he's got till he's almost lost it.<BR>Eastwood comes to town as a photographer from National Geographic to take pictures of the famous and not-so-famous old bridges in rural Iowa. While her husband and kids are at a county fair, Francesca and the photographer fall into a passionate affair of just a few days duration. Then comes the choice, the scene in which Streep's hand toys with the door handle during a rain as, through the swishing windshield wipers, she watches Eastwood's truck head out of town, turn signal blinking like a beacon calling to her. Stay or go? Stay or go? How will Francesca handle her conflicting loyalties, her passions, her life?<BR>Keep a box of Kleenex handy.
B000002NJS|2.0|The 90's was the decade of alternative music. It was totally different from the 80's when easy listening dance songs lead the charts. Madonna entered the pop scene then and when times changed she did not release any albums for years. She did it well I think. She waited until 98, and borrowed the music motives and topics from performers that made success in the past few years. But I don't really think it is enough to say its a good CD. It is not. It is not bad, but if we compare it to what it follows then we can say it is weak. It is programmed music, and to make it interesting we get some guitar motives occasionally. Madonna does not play too much with her voice while performing, she sings the same way all the songs, a bit powerless and sadly but clearly. Altough it is not her ground, this CD has positive side also. She has the skill of making radio friendly music and at this time she proved it again! <BR>If you would like to hear something impressing and new forget about it, but if you only want to put something easy to sing along music in your car-disc player it is your choice.<BR>The lyrics are very simply just like the music!...
B000002LRX|5.0|Instead of going track by track listing all the signatures of each song, im just going to put it like this...THE KEYBOARDS!! THE GUITARS!! AND HOLY GOD MIKE PATTONS AMAISING VOCALS!!!! buy this cd, its a must have in any collection
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched this when it originally was on HBO and loved it.  It wasn't however till I got this set that I truly started learning about and caring for the men.  I have since watched it many times and every time I do, regardless of which episode I see, my eyes inevitably start to water at one point or another.<br />  I have never seen a film that made me think about things, or change the way I think about things as Band of Brothers did (does).<br />  If I had one wish, it would be to meet the real soldiers that the film is based on, and let them know how I feel.<br />  In closing, I cannot say enough about this movie.  It truly defines the term &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

1565123875|5.0|The innocent child's view shown here of how culture, religion and politics meddle with a society such as modern day Nigeria. Expresses more than the eye reads in detail and complexity as culture enslaves a Nigerian perspective towards every other aspect of life. &quot;Exposes what is yet to said or shown&quot;. A must read book.
B00008ADPF|2.0|Other than better production, this disc is too similar to the band's previous output. Like Puddle of Mudd, Linkin Park, and a dozen other bands, Nickelback talks the talk but keeps repeating the same old steps when they walk the walk. For those who think this is great music, I'm glad you found something to indentify with, but don't get stuck wallowing in the angst.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I bought it last Wednesday (with part of my first paycheck from the new gig! *w00t*). This CD tops her first one. She's one of few performers who can wear the title of artist and wear it well -- she's always honing her craft, and produces marvelous results!! This album is proof that Alicia means biz-nessss when it comes to producing quality music. <br />I have one pet peeve about it, though -- my two most absolute favorite tracks on the CD are the two shortest ones!!  The last track, &quot;Nobody Not Really&quot; is a beautiful song, but it's under three minutes long; the other one that's tops with me is &quot;Feelin' U, Feelin' Me.&quot; It's an interlude, but it's so smooth, it should have been a song in itself. It has a definite &quot;get busy&quot; kind o' vibe.  She plays the Rhodes piano and synthesizers on &quot;Feelin'...&quot; so well that Stevie Wonder, the perfector of the Arp and Moog synthesizers, would be proud!<br />Of course, &quot;You Don't Know My Name,&quot; is the gem of the CD, and &quot;Heartburn,&quot; which is produced by one of the hottest producers (pardon the redundancy) in the biz, Timberland (move over, P-&quot;Dippy&quot;), pays homage to the foremothers and forefathers of funk -- if you wanna &quot;get jiggy,&quot; then this is the song to listen to. The slower songs, &quot;If I Ain't Got You,&quot; and &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot; (which sounds like a combination of &quot;Fallin'&quot; and &quot;A Woman's Worth&quot; from her debut album -- which is good thing) also score big with me.<br />In short, the CD is hot...No, no, it's, scorchin'!!
B0000DD7LC|3.0|though this second album wasnt as dope as her first one, i enjoyed it. i guess i set really high expectations for this cd being its her sophomore album. in this album, i only have 5 tracks that i continually play..KARMA...IF I WAS YOUR WOMAN (lovin it!!)...YOU DONT KNOW MY NAME...IF I AINT GOT U (personally i think this is the best song in the cd)...and DIARY. all the other songs is hard to get into coz they sound like 70's tv show theme songs. her 1st cd i could listen to the whole thing over and over and over...this one i gotta selectively listen to. but Ms.Keys is the DOPEST artist out there! you can tell her music comes from the heart..still worth purchasing!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I realize that this is just a \\"#1 Hits\\" collection, but TONS of LEGENDARY songs could have been added to a possible second disc or something... <br />In My Life<BR>A Day in the Life (regarded as their best usually)<BR>I am the Walrus <BR>Strawberry Fields Forever <BR>Helter Skelter (the first punk-flavored song) <BR>Revolution <BR>I Want You (Shes So Heavy) <BR>Back in the USSR <BR>Obla-di, Obla-da <BR>While My Guitar Gently Weeps <BR>I'm Looking Through You <BR>Norwegian Wood<BR>You've Got To Hide Your Love Away <BR>Twist and Shout <BR>Taxman<BR>Good Day Sunshine <BR>Tomorrow Never Knows <BR>Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds <BR>Getting Better <BR>Birthday <br />Those never made #1, but they sure as hell represent the Beatles better than \\"Lady Madonna\\" or \\"From Me to You.\\"<br />Overall, the CD is good for the EXTREMELY casual listeners, but it is a poor representation of the group. This is what the Beatles did to purposely make the charts (sell the songs to younger market girls. That's a fact that McCartney and Lennon have always stated), not the good stuff they did in the studio. Not the cream of the crop. I'm not saying it's a bad CD by ANY means. . .but the Beatles aren't one of those \\"single disc greatest hits\\" groups - where the artists scrape for B-side material or unreleased stuff to fill space. The Beatles are the best and this CD, while a good intro, doesn't even come close to scratching the surface.
B00008PW2D|2.0|If the 5th season was any good, then the cost would not matter.  This show (seasons 1-4,6) always made me feel better, especially when having relationship confusion. But this season was depressing every week. I would avoid it.
0792164903|5.0|I was amazed the variety of characters that Johnny Depp has played in the past with Edward Scissorhands, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the list goes on.<br />Sleepy Hollow is a master piece that brings out the humourous constable's work and the thrilling moments that revolves around the mysterious town in upstate New York. <br />There are subtle special effects that accentuate the foggy ambience in the town that will surely send a chill down the spine. Hats off to the British visual effects crew!<br />DTS version would have been a boon.<br />This movie is a classic that you would love to keep for time to come.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I won't lie, I didn't think the strokes could possibly top their first alblum.  But I will say, and I know people will laugh at me, but this alblum is better than the first.  You almost come to expect a sophmore slump from a bands these days but The Strokes proved me wrong.

0312263120|2.0|I am starting to doubt the reviews I read online now.  I bought the book because of the reviews.  Anyways, the book had good first half.  Here the author did ok job introducing the plot and the characters, but after everything else fell like to crumbles.<br />I agree with the other reviewer, who said that the characters were so unreal.  I mean lets face it, if stuff that happens  on the book did actually happen nobody would be skeptical about the problems.  Even a false alarm in an org. like NSA, they check it.  I wanted to stop reading, but like the habit I have to finish what I started I had to read to end.  Then the end was something to make you wanna throw the book in the fireplace (hey at least is useful for this winter) or sell it back.<br />Anyways, don't take my review into account.  Make your own judgement, but before go to your store and flip to the pages b4 buying.

B000021Y77|5.0|An exhilarating fast-paced action movie from start to finish. This movie has excellent cinematography with a story that is as strong as the filming and the acting.<br />Lola receives a phone call from her wanna-be crook boyfriend, Manni. He complains to her that because she was late from picking him up, he mistakenly lost 100,000 deutsche marks meant to be given to Ronni, a big-time crook. If Ronni does not receive his 100,000 deutche marks within 20 minutes, he will kill Manni. This phone call starts this movie on an action-packed, fast-paced movie where Lola tries to get his money and catch up with Manni before it is too late.<br />Tom Tykwer does an excellent job at showing us what cause and effect really means. He shows Lola bumping into people on her way to Manni, and how life for that individual turns out with a show of photographs.<br />There is even an animation part where Lola's mother is talking on the phone while her television is on, and on the TV is an animated Lola running down the stairs of their apartment to get outside, as she is actually doing it.<br />Tom Tykwer keeps you visually stimulated, as well as audibly intrigued with the background tech music.<br />The acting by Franka Potente is great. She actively portrays a girlfriend distressed that her boyfriend may be killed, yet determined to do what she can to prevent this. Franka Potente has recently been seen in an American blockbuster, The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon.<br />Moritz Bleibtreu also does a great job being a not-too-smart crook. He does a great job portraying how desperate his character is when he calls Lola.<br />This movie is pretty interesting, as the movie is the whole 20 minutes it takes for Lola to try to figure out how to come up with that kind of money, as well as the obstacles she encounters along the way. So, as you may wonder, as I did, how can a feature-length movie drag 20 minutes out to be so long? Well, the first time through...yes, you read that right, the ending is not what Lola wanted, so the movie starts over again, and this time when she encounters her obstacles, she handles them differently, until the next outcome happens. In the end, we see her try three times to get to Manni in time.<br />This IS a must-see movie. It is one of the best movies out at this time, and you will want to see this, as you know Hollywood will be doing a re-make on this in the future!is not what Lola wanted, so the movie starts over again, and this time when she encounters her obstacles, she handles them differently, until the next outcome happens.

B00005JM02|5.0|This was definitely the Best Picture of 2003. The story, the characters, and the technical mastery were all impressive. This is PIXAR'S best film. Finding Nemo covers so much ground in its reasonable running time. I hope it gets nominated for Best Picture(OSCARS). It truly deserves it.

B00008S2VG|1.0|let me say one thing.  some of the music on this cd is cool.  madonna is still holding tight to the vocoder and electronica (just like on MUSIC).  however, her lyrics are totally lame, and having listened to MOTHER & FATHER many times in a row, i think the song would be cool if ANY other voice were singing/rapping/sounding foolish except for madonna's.  her voice in this track pains my ears, and wesley willis usually sounded better on any given day than she does here. her shrill, piercing, nasal voice just needs to be put out of its misery. and she needs to be banned from rapping.  <br />\\"my mah-ther died when i whaz five,<BR>and all i did was crah<BR>i cried and cried and cried and cried all day<BR>they couldn't take my loneliness--<BR>i couldn't take their phoniness\\"<br />but the beats and noises are incredible! she almost makes it think that having a mother die is fun and should be a dancing matter.<br />what the hell was her manager/record producer THINKING?  oh, that's right--no thinking necesssary, because there are plenty of fools to buy these overpriced piles of steaming excrement.  stop, madonna, and don't release any more albums until you can give us something with good  (which should be never ever again in this lifetime). take your trillions of dollars and go annoy england some more, you ignorant and pretentious commercial . queen of pop.<BR> and slightly off the subject: your books are terrible and offensively bad.  just stop and retire until you really got something good, fresh, and talented to give us.<BR>This track alone has made me, formerly a huge Madonna fan, totally sickened and disgusted by anything she says and does.  the title track makes me want to vomit (stop your . rapping about lattes, multiple nannies, cars, and yoga classes with the hotties--you are a total moron--from your lyrics alone).<BR>thank you for dumbing down music listeners around the world.  dare i ever turn the radio on again?  the more and more i listen to this album, the worse it gets, and the more i realize what a total joke madonna is with her repetitive cliched lyrics and expensive noise machines and producers and studio engineering.  now that we know how easy it is, maybe any one now knows how possible it is to sell musical turds for millions of dollars.

B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion is one of those artists who's got an amazing voice and a great passion for music. I truly think that &quot;All the Way...A Decade of Song&quot; is indeed a decade of songs. She's got an amazing voice which just feels up the room. <BR>Even though, I love all the songs in the album, but I've got my 5 most favorite. On number one, would be &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot; because it is just so emotional and great. Number two, I would say &quot;Power of Love&quot; and then &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; On number four on my list is &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; simply because I love how she sings it and it always reminds me of &quot;The Titanic&quot; which is one of my favorite movies. And finally I picked &quot;Then You Look At Me&quot; as my 5th most favorite song. <br />I would definitely recommend this album for all the Celine fans and for anyone who likes to relax and just listen to some nice music.

B000000W6F|4.0|For an early album, Gish is spectacular. If you're a big fan of Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie, you'll enjoy much of Gish, incluidng &quot;Rhinocerous,&quot; which has probably become the Pumpkins second signature tune, behind Tonight, Tonight from Mellon Collie.<br />Some parts of the album are a little uneven, especially when compared to the absolutely unmatchable duo of Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Still, the Pumpkins are the Pumpkins, and they have a knack for creating futuristic hooks and smiling choruses in the midst of their avant-garde breakfasts that stand the test of time.<br />If you like the other Pumpkins work before Adore and Machina, definitely buy Gish. If you're a big Adore or Machina fan, probably check Gish out from your local library first... and *then* buy it... because it's a damn good CD!
B000003S0D|4.0|I might get pelted with tomatoes and booed, so to speak, but having listen to &quot;Lizard&quot;, I can say that this is a continuation of &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;. Sure, &quot;Lizard&quot; is a good album, but it is not as great as &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;; my opinion is that &quot;Lizard&quot; was R. Fripp's attempt to recapture that magic from the first album. Both have the same feel and same themes, but you can sense some tension in the album; afterall, the title track was finished vocally by Jon Anderson of Yes. I say &quot;Lizard&quot; is a good album and unique in that it's great as a &quot;relaxer&quot; or background music as well. Some Crimheads might say this was a watershed album, but each album King Crimson is a unique artwork and the journey takes you different places. &quot;Lizard&quot; is a journey well-spent.
0345363132|5.0|My first Penman book. {Is that a play on words?} I love it!!!! I am going to start a study of English history if it is half as exciting as the author has hinted.
B000003S0P|5.0|Toward the end of 1974, this would be King Crimson's last album of the 70's. King Crimson was a band that defied description and form. On one song you get hit with chords, beats that dazzle and on another song you get lured into a lull where you think you're safe. As one person describes &quot;Red,&quot; it is like the music is stomping and marching. I feel that this album was ahead of its time, making one wonder what if King Crimson continued right after &quot;Red&quot;?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is way into the zone. Can't possibly not like it so I'm really shocked how many one-star reviews this is getting.<BR>I've always been a big Britney fan. This album's different from her old stuff. I can't say its better because I was disappointed with the number of ballads.<BR>But I still love every song in the album (Except early morning which makes me as sleepy as I really am every early morning)You should listen to the bonus tracks as well. Here's a rating of each song - <BR>Me against the music - 4/5 not the best off the album. Madonna ruins the whole thing which is surprising because she's actually a good singer but she doesn't seem to fit here for some reason.<BR>Boom Boom - 5/5 Great!! One of my favs. <BR>Showdown - 5/5 Love the beats on this one.<BR>Breathe on me - 4.5/5 Everyone says it sounds like a Kylie song but I don't listen to much kylie so I can't say anything. It's good.<BR>Early Morning - 2/5 Listen to this one 500 times and you may like it.<BR>Toxic - 6/5 Can't possibly ever hate this!!! LOVE IT!!<BR>Touch of my hand - 4/5 Catchy. No comments about the lyrics.<BR>Shadow - 5/5 Lovely ballad. Quite like something she'd have done in her old album.<BR>Brave new girl - 5/5 Doesn't fit in this album but Britney raps pretty well; something I'd have never expected from her. The tune changes to some school girl sort of tune. It's great.<BR>Everytime - 7/5 LOVE this one. I think this will be the video after toxic. Great soft ballad, with the piano playing like a haunter in the background. May bring a tear if you are a big britney fan. <BR>This album shows that Britney's voice is average. Nevertheless, she's made the best use of it to bring out another wonderful album. She's also started writing her own songs (She did co-write a couple in her previous album too and one in Oops {Dear Diary, which sucked}) and they're pretty decent. <BR>Please give us real reviews here. I spent a week trying to get some real reviews. It's either about how britney wears less clothes, kissed Madonna or that she can't sing. <BR>She can sing and you ought to listen to her ballads before you say something like that. Her voice is her only draw back. She's a great entertainer and one-star reviewers are people who want to advertise for other albums here by saying she's trash. <BR>Don't listen to them. You can't be disappointed with this CD
B000003S09|5.0|I'm sure what I'm about to write has been said already and if not on the minds of some folks, but this an awesome album! One must understand when this album was released and its context at that time. While the album isn't topical, it does relfect the growing disillusionment of those who bought into the &quot;peace &amp; love&quot; concept. Toward the end of the 60's, there were artists who realized that &quot;revolution&quot; wasn't going to happen. However, a musical revolution did occur; at this same time, progressive rock and heavy metal were born at this same time from the same nest, so to speak. &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; can be counted among albums like Iggy Pop &amp; The Stooges debut album, the MC5's debut album, Black Sabbath's &quot;Paranoid&quot; and Genesis' &quot;Trespass&quot; just to name a few that reflected the cynicism of the time.<BR>   &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; is more than a time capsule; it is a document of how one man's desire to craft an album and others who saw to its rise can be seen. The music and lyrics are great and go along with each other. Greg Lake reflected the songs in his voice. To say that this album is a masterpiece is understatement; it is a story personified. Very few albums can tell a great stort, and this album can be placed in this category. If you seek an album different from the norm without hype or other fluff, this album is for you.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|For the third and final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Howard Shore has again created an amazing soundtrack. He introduces a new theme, the Gondor theme, which perfectly captures the feel of the movie. The Shelob music is also excellent, as is the music for when Frodo is about to destroy the ring. From the very first time you hear it the music captivates you. Whenever I listen to the soundtrack at home I feel as if I was reliving the movie each time I hear it. Even if you haven't seen the movie, it doesn't matter because this soundtrack stands on it's own. When I first heard that Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen were singing, I wasn't sure if I would like it, especially since I had heard some of Viggo's songs before and was not impressed. But I was completely surprised. Billy Boyd has the most beautiful voice, and Viggo does a wonderful job with his song. The only problem I have with them is that they are both much too short. The ending track, Into The West, is a beautiful song, with perfect lyrics and a haunting melody, except for one thing: Annie Lennox's voice. I just can't get into the song when it is sung by someone with such a harsh, masculine sounding voice. But other that than this is a must-hear soundtrack definitely worthy of an Academy Award.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Ewan sang a song(in elephants love medly) &quot;Don't leave me this way...&quot; what is the song title?
1582432678|5.0|I'm sure the author is glad to hear I finished this book with more questions than answers. She did her job well, telling us this disturbing tale of a woman facing the fact that she has raised a child who is capable of creating such chaos. I believe she must have done a lot of research to have come up with such a chilling character as KK. At first I tried to make myself believe that her own ambivilant feelings were the cause of her son's pathology, but in the end, I realized that just can't be true. Somehow a mother and child collided in midair, then fell to earth to become Eva and Kevin. Which is to say there simply is no reason Kevin became KK. I don't think a different mother would have changed him. The end of the book left me with a glimmer of hope, a twinkle of clarity, maybe. I won't forget this book very soon.
6305280762|3.0|As someone previously mentioned, this movie is a reminder of the days of the blockbuster shown in a large, single screen theater. It's huge in every way. The cast, most assuredly, is one of the best.<br />Why then did Fox decide to give it such a poor DVD presentation. Outside of the fact that they at least didn't give it the pan-and-scan treatment, this is as poor as any release out there.<br />If ever a movie screamed to be released in a version enhanced for widescreen TV's, this is it. And wouldn't it be wonderful to have some extras concerning the creation of this movie.<br />Oh well...I guess until someone wakes up and releases a decent DVD package, this is all we have. And even it is worth it, as this is what the word &quot;epic&quot; is all about.
B00004S8Q9|4.0|Being a blues rock purist, I found this disc most refreshing, sadly it was the last that we heard from Ray Gillan, due to his untimely passing. Jake and the boys really turned down the lights and cranked up the amps on this record. Granted it is not as stellar as the first album, but there are some great blues rock gems on this disc, especially Fat Cat. If you are a fan of Jake E. Lee, then you need to add this to your collection.<br />Adios from the Texas Coast<br />Craig Williams
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is a fabulous follow up to his first album and PBS special.  Everyone who loves a classically trained voice and just beautiful music will love this album.  A MUST HAVE for your CD collection.
B000002H97|5.0|This album officially made me a Metallica fan! I never really listened to metal that much, except Slayer and Guns n' roses. The 'black ablum' is fantastic. It may have disappointed some hardcore Metallica fans who thought the band had 'soldout' them. Because this album is not as hardcore as their previous albums. It focuses more on the great lyrics and what they mean. My favorite songs are &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Whereever I May Roam&quot;, which features a kick-ass intro and the underrated &quot;Of Wolf and Man.&quot; The best song, in my opinion, is &quot;Sad But True.&quot; James Hetfield's vocals are tight here. Practically the whole album is amazing. Lars Ulrich's does his thing, as well as Kirk Hammett's solos. I also liked the the song that Metallica hasen't really done before: a ballad. &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; sounds like a love song, but the sound is nice and Hetfield's vocals. Since I'm barely a amateur Metallica fan, I'll probably like their last album &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; better when I buy it. The black though will stand the test of time for Metallica because it's their most noticable album to date, despite other fan's grumblings who say this album is soft, they just don't get, IT'S METALLICA FOR CHRIST'S SAKES!
B0000C7PSW|2.0|I went into this album with extremely high hopes, plucking down $18 sight unseen. I was a huge fan of the debut album and greatly enjoyed Poses, even if it did seem to wander into vagueness from time to time. <br />Well, at least I thought it wandered into vagueness. Turns out I was vague on what vague meant until I listened to Want One. Most of what I hear in this album is an exercise in navel gazing. Self indulgent, over produced orchestrations drown out ho-hum lyrics like \\"My cell phone is on vibrate for you\\". The nod to Puccini in \\"Oh What a World\\" is a nice touch but seems to serve no other purpose than to remind how classy Wainwright's tastes are (Ooh he likes opera! Ooh, reminds us of a cute, contemporary Cole Porter!). What's desperately missing is the genuine emotion and vulnerability he brought to songs like Foolish Love, Damned Ladies and Beauty Mark on the first album. Instead we are given intricately crafted beautiful wrapping paper around what sometimes seems to be an empty shell.  Maybe this stuff comes off better live?<br />All that said, I will still probably go out and buy Want Two. I just hope there is less \\"packaging\\" and more of Rufus.
6301966562|4.0|This is one of those rare movies that my father and I can actually share.  We discovered it separately but fell in love with it together.  It's romantic, geeky, a little fantastical, and, frankly, corny, too.  But you just cannot help but love it for its humor and humanity.  <br />It was the first movie he ever bought an original VHS of instead of pirating it off a friend (and considering the pricing structure, that was doubly amazing), and now both of us are itching to get it on DVD before the cherished tape breathes its last.  Every year I hope it will come out in time to give it to him as a Christmas present, and every year, I wind up getting a movie that's a lesser favorite.  Come on, studio wonks, give the audience what they want!
B0000DZEA1|1.0|Once again, the adoring public gets screwed. Howard Shore has worked to get the most amazing cinematic soundtrack in history put on disc, and like in TTT, the good tracks have been removed. In TTT, we saw eowyn's theme cut for stupid monotonous boring tracks like the black gate is close and treebeard. wtf? now we see the music from theoden's rousing speech scrapped like garbage for again, weak tracks like end of all things. howard shore i salute you, u have bee screwed, like all of us, but the editing process.
0316666343|4.0|Susie Salmon tells her story from heaven after being raped an murdered. She describes how her family is coping with the terrible events that unfold from her murder and how life in heaven develops.<br />The book presents a well depicted vision of what heaven is like but the most important acomplishment is the unveiling of what a family goes through as a consequence of such horrible events.<br />The only flaw I can point is that there is a point in which the story moves forward in time very fast creating a gap that would have been better filled with a more thorough depiction of what was going on.<br />Overall a very good read, definitely worth your time!
B00005YU1O|5.0|this is by far the best movie i have ever seen, and i am a huge movie connoisseur. Honestly this movie moves me like no other. Give your brain something to think about and buy this dvd at any cost you wont be let down.
B000005L86|5.0|the congo's have a very unique and excellent sound in their <BR>&quot;Heart of the Congos&quot;.  Definitely recommend this album for a different and awesome experience.
1878424319|5.0|Probably the most important thing to get across to potential readers (and those who merely read it without sincere attention) of this book is that it has the potential to help you create deep and meaningful changes. The author literally transmits teachings through his words, helping you on more than just a consciou level. Conceptually, the book is also very interesting, but it is an experienctial learning that you gain. Very profound book! I also recommend &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer as another book with very very deep and experiential teachings and transmissions.
B00006879E|5.0|First I have to say that I saw Maroon 5 live twice before I ever heard them on the radio.  Even though I had never heard of them before, they impressed me so much I had to go out and buy their CD after the first time.  Well, in the little over a year that I've owned it, I have never gone more than a week without listening to it!<br />I know it's just redundant to say again how unique they are in their sound, but it's great to hear songs that have some depth to them, both musically and lyrically.  Actually, after accidentally leaving their CD at my parents house my mom went out and bought one.  Also, after accidentally leaving a CD recording of one of their live performances that I went to at my sister-in-law's house, she bought &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; too!<br />I would definitely recommend this CD as well as seeing them live, they do kick-a** covers of AC/DC's &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; and NIN's &quot;Closer&quot;!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Jaw wide opened as I listened to this recording.  The new fresh pop/rock score by Stephen Schwartz is breathtaking.  &quot;As Long As You're Mine&quot; is like something I have never heard before and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is everyone's favorite.  GET THIS CD NOW!!!  I am so grateful to have front row seats to this show in February.  I'm going to go put it on now.
B00004R7TP|4.0|Kate Bush began her career at the age of sixteen. Her earlier works are jazz-pop oriented, she then turned to electro-pop in the eighties (with members of the Alan Parsons project). 'The dreaming' is very experimental, the following album 'Hounds of love' (the subject of this review) is more accessible and full of emotions. It begins with a 'hit' : 'Running up that hill', which is a great song. Then, it is followed by the title track, a track with a beat that reminds Peter Gabriel's rythm section on tracks such as 'Kiss of life'. 'The big sky' is another  electro-pop song. 'Mother stands for comfort' is a song with a nice keyboard and drum work. 'Cloudbusting' is in the same vein as 'Running up that hill'. 'Dream of sheep' is a piece where Kate is accompanied only by her piano. It depicts her great vocal skills, and is one of the most emotional song ever released in the pop world. 'Under ice' is a dark song with keyboards accompanying the low accents of Kate's voice. 'Waking the witch' is bizarre as it features clear and roaring voices. 'Watching you without me' mimic the ticking of a clock. 'Hello earth' is a balad featuring the trio backing Kate's voice. All in all, this record is GREAT and I recommend it to all lovers of great female vocals.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|IT'S BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>I'M SPEECHLESS, I BOUGHT IT LAST NIGHT, AND I FINISHED WATCHING THE DVD, IT'S WOW SO AWSOME!!! SO COOL!!! THEY ARE A GREAT BAND(we all knew that) LIVE AND ON THE STUDIO EVERYWHERE!!!!, IT'S THE BEST CONCERT I'VE SEENG ON DVD!!!!! THE TOUR DIARY WAS JUST SO COOL, ONCE AGAIN THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT THEY ARE THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!! I'VE HEARD THAT SOME CRITICS SAY THAT THEY ARE THE BEATLES OF THE 21st CENTURY, AND I AGREE WITH THOSE CRITICS, THEY ARE DA BOMB!!!!!! AMAZING JOB COLDPLAY!!! KEEP THE GOOD WORK!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT STUDIO ALBUM!!!!!!!!!! LONG LIFE!!!<br />DEFENTELY A MUST-BUY!!!! SUPPORT AMAZING MUSIC!!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|This album launched DT in the hall of fame, only in the hard-rock sphere (but unfortunately not in other spheres). It defines a new genre in the metal music : prog metal, as it blends hard-rock intensity (in the style of Metallica) with prog-rock structures (think of bands such as UK, Yes ...). James Labrie is a gifted vocalist, and can be considered as the equivalent of Jon Anderson (Yes) for the metal. This album is full of emotions, thanks not only to James' superb voice, but also to Kevin Moore's fantastic keyboard's work and the many time signatures achieved by Mike Portnoy on drums. 'Pull me under' is a hit that was played on MTV and made DT fame. 'Another day' is a sublime balad featuring Jay Beckenstein's (of Spyro Gyra fame)fantastic saxophone. 'Take the time' begins as a mainstream song (with great choir) and ends as a typical prog song with many rythm changes and virtuosic guitars. 'Surrounded' is great and features anew virtuosic guitar solo. 'Metropolis' is a fabulous epic (i.e., a long track with many rythm changes). 'Under a glass moon' features great vocals. 'Wait for sleep' is a duet between James and Kevin, it is an introduction to the last epic : 'Learning to live', which features a latin section and a finale that reminds clearly Iron Maiden. In a nutshell, this is an ESSENTIAL album that everyone should own.
B000002P5W|4.0|although i do not actually have this album, Bold as Love is an amazing song. I do have the CD Experience the best of hendrix and bold as love is on it. i also play guitar, and every time i play it, can feel the muisic if you get what im saying. and if hendrix plays like that on this album, I garenty you that its good
B00000K32K|2.0|I was very disapointed with this video... When I saw Riverdance I could not take my eyes off the TV....it was captivating. When viewing Feet of Flames I found myself forwarding the tape to get past the ridiculous drama that they seem to feel is necessary.... I found the eruptions of applause whenever FLatley appeared to be excessive... I wish they would stick to dancing w/minimal story plots that seem to be written to stroke Flatley's ego.  Alot like watching the old silent movies with their exaggerated gestures.  I never even finished the tape... I put it in with the other discards that goodwill is picking up this week.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|At least, that is, in Alicia Keys' case. I fell in love with her first album - it must have spent at least 6 months straight in my CD player - and have been looking forward to the release of her sophmore album for quite some time. After purchasing her new cd a few days after it came out, I soon fell in love with it as well. The music sounds different and funkier, but there are a few songs that sound comfortingly reminiscent of her first CD. Overall, she definitely had broadened her musical ability.  Many different types of music can be heard on this CD, which creates a fantastic blend that makes &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; impossible to get tired of listening to. I never thought she'd be able to beat her first album, but I think she did with this one! Go out and buy it!
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|I just got this DVD for a friend for a gift, and I expected merely the \\"disco\\" hits because I wasn't very familiar with their hits.  I had to pop it in and check it out to see what it was all about... these guys are absolutely superb!!!  I can't believe all the songs that I didn't even know they wrote and how perfectly harmonious and well performed the songs are.  I have watched this about 5 times in a two day span because it is so great.  The sound is awesome, and I don't even have a DTS system.. not to mention the high-class setup for the concert itself visually.  Being only 27, I didn't catch the wave the first time around.. but the BeeGees are now my favorite in the \\"all-time\\" category of musicians... This DVD is well worth 10 times the money I spent on it.  Just too bad I have to give it away as a gift.. and too bad Maurice passed away cuz now I want to see them in concert more than anything!!<BR>PS... The Celine Dion duet gave me goosebumps, very well done!
0060278250|5.0|Wow, I must say that this book is truly the greatest. It compares to Lord of the Rings in my standards. I must say, Nix, you have proved yourself to be my favorite author. I recomend this book to all ages 10-15, and also those who enjoy a good fansasy book.
078322933X|5.0|This movie has perfect casting (espically hunky Billy Petersen).  I was on the edge of my seat as I watched Nicki (Reese Witherspoon), become more deeply involved with Mark Walberg's character.  Although I thought I knew the outcome of the movie the way it occured had me clapping!  What a fitting ending for Walberg's nasty character.  It's a hold your breath ending that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I feel like the worlds biggest idiot, but now I really understand what this cd is all about.  I recently saw a commercial which featured a song from this cd, I realized I was listening to a work of art.  I left a really crummy review on August 11, 2003, I called it &quot;Noise for Nerds,&quot; you see I didn't realize that jazz isn't just music it's art. <br /> I listened to the cd again and now I realize my ears were not sophistocated enough for jazz, I had only listened to dumb world music like Brazilian and african, I didn't understand that jazz was improvisation(I was stupid).  Anyway I want to say &quot;I'm so sorry&quot;, for writing things like &quot;This is the dumbest, drollest CD I've ever made the mistake of buying,&quot; I now realize this is the only smart and intelligent decision I ever made in my screwed up life.  You see I was describing my self, I never go outside, I constantly carry a slide rule, and I pick my nose a lot, and I didn't connest with this cd, but now this cd has changed my life. <br /> I now NEVER listen to crudy Brazilian, African, Cuban, Celtic, or early American music anymore. The Penguin Guide gives this cd four stars and a crown, who was I, a nerd, to say it only gets one star.  I give it now one-hundred stars now that I understand the concept of jazz as an improvisational art, i can begin to live.  I need to wear dunce cap for giving it one star in my previous review.  Can you Eric Dolphy fans ever forgive me???  This cd is so good, I am going to college to get a degree, so I can teach a jazz appreciation class and I will use this cd in my class, to teach appreciation of jazz.  Thanks Eric Dolphy for opening me up to a new world of creativity...  I was such a close minded fool before.  I was also jelous because I have to talents as a musician, I was green with envy of Dolphy's talent, I have no talents, oh well jelousy makes such fools of people like me.  All I can say is buy the cd and try to understand it's ART, and beautiful!

B000002UA5|3.0|It's 1969, and Pink Floyd have carried on for over a year since the enforced departure of their troubled frontman Syd Barrett. Since he left, they've recorded one transitional effort, A Saucerful of Secrets, and a mostly forgettable souyndtrack to the film More. Creatively, they're a bit stuck, so they come up with the idea of having each member going off and making half a side's worth of music. The results are mixed.<BR>Richard Wright: Wright, always more inclined towards jazz and classical than pop/rock music, came up with perhaps the most musically complex of the four efforts. Sysyphus, a four part avante-garde suite, encapsulates his more sophisticated approach. It still sounds completely insane, but there's always method behind the madness, and just when it sounds like it's going to fall apart he brings the theme back in for a satisfying ending. This instrumental also contained the germ of an idea that would lead to the side-long Atom Heart Mother.<BR>Roger Waters: Waters was by now developing in to the band's best songwriter, and was also extremely talented and innovative in the studio, playing with tape loops and SFX. Grantchester Meadows was a gentle, relaxing folk piece, without a hint of the anger that would increasingly dominate his music in years to come. Several Species, a mad sound collage, for some reason reminds me of Terry Gilliam's animated sketches for Monty Python. It has the same cavernous, demented sound and surreal humour.<BR>David Gilmour: I'm not a huge fan of The Narrow Way. It has some wonderful moments, and the guitar playing throughout is excellent. But it's incoherent and sounds like several pieces tacked onto each other rather than a suite like Sysyphus. The song itself, part 3, buries the vocals because Gilmour was embarassed about the lyrics. It's not bad, standard Gilmour fare. He'd come up with better stuff on Atom Heart Mother and Meddle. <BR>Nick Mason: Mason is an excellent drummer, and a handy man to have with you in a studio by all accounts. But, as The Grand Vizier's Garden Party shows, this man should NOT be allowed to play by himself. One man, a load of percussion, a recording studio, and no real clue of what he's aiming at does not a masterpiece make.<BR>So the studio album is pretty good, perhaps one of Floyd's weaker efforts, and let down by the second half. The live album is, however, excellent, with a mostly more relaxed, keyboard-dominated take on the four Floyd classics played here. It's an eerie, slightly stoned take on Floyd's late 60's sound. Particularly good is Careful With That Axe, Eugene, with its scary whisper and mental screaming.<BR>Overall, Ummagumma is worth owning if you already enjoy albums such as Atom Heart Mother and A Saucerful of Secrets, but should be approached with caution by fans of The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon.
B00005JKC3|2.0|While I appreciated Ang Lee's direction and cinematography of the film, I found myself becoming quite bored with the story.  There were very few good moments, and they were quickly over-shadowed by the banality of the super-hero genre. Unfortunately, this movie did not offer anything new and spectacular... the best parts of the movie were 1) how high and far The Hulk could jump and 2) the desert landscape and shots in National Parks... and that is why I kept watching.<br />If you want to see a comic-book adaptation, there are much better choices out there.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was the best show released last year, period.  It had a cool cast, fun story lines, and some of the best writing on TV.  It is a real shame we won't be seeing anymore episodes of this great show, I only hope that it moves into the feature film arena.  If you are looking for a DVD set that will keep you consistantly entertained this is it, at the end you will be sad though, because there won't be any more episodes.  This is worth every penny.
B000003TA4|1.0|The people who like this band, don't know what is the good music.<BR>The singer has got a forgettable voice, there's much better singers than Kurt Cobain. His guitar playing is extremely dull.<BR>They're weak musicians, with no conception, with no charachter. One melodie going throgh a song. Boring stuff. Lithium: it's melodie is strained, unmemorable. The music is primitive: they're about a plain 'melodie', and ther's no change in the music. Amazing guitar and drum solos? Where? A great voice with a good vocal range? Not Kurt. And they're very overrated. And they're more popular since Kurt has died. RIP, but he was not a talented musician, not a guitar-hero etc.<BR>I don't want to your take away pleasure. There's many good bands, whom made great music, for example: Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin etc. Buy their albums: they're talented, and they can make good music. Trust me.
B00005ASIL|3.0|My rating is not for the music contained in this package; it's for the inconsideration shown to casual fans of this group. Incidentally, I am anything BUT a casual fan of JT. Outside of a live B-side version of &quot;Jump Start&quot;, I've got everything Tull has ever put out. Obviously, though, I'm not representative of Tull's fan base. Most of them have four or five discs and a &quot;best of&quot; set.<br />Jethro Tull has had more greatest-hits albums than most bands have had regular releases. And STILL they haven't gotten it right! This set is missing some of JT's best &amp; most well-known tunes, like &quot;Skating Away&quot;, &quot;Cross-eyed Mary&quot;, &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, &quot;Teacher&quot;, &quot;Farm On The Freeway&quot;, &quot;Budapest&quot;, &quot;Dun Ringill&quot; and &quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot;. There is really no excuse for the exclusion of &quot;Skating Away&quot;, &quot;Teacher&quot;, and &quot;Cross-eyed Mary&quot;. These songs are infinitely preferable to tunes like &quot;Broadsword&quot; &amp; &quot;Steel Monkey&quot;.<br />A &quot;best of&quot; Tull collection really needs to be two discs. In addition, unlike the approach used for the 25th Anniversary Best Of collection, there is no real necessity in including songs from every album. For a Tull greatest hits package, you've really got to concentrate on the classic 70's period of the band. There's definitely a lot of worthy music on Crest Of A Knave and Roots To Branches, and tracks from each should be included, but 70's era Tull is by far the biggest draw for the casual fan.<br />In my humble opinion, the almost-perfect Tull compilation would look something like this:<br />Aqualung<br />Bouree<br />Locomotive Breath<br />Thick As A Brick (multiple sections edited together)<br />Teacher<br />Skating Away<br />Budapest<br />Too Old To Rock 'N Roll, Too Young To Die<br />Bungle In The Jungle<br />Roots To Branches<br />Heavy Horses<br />Songs From The Wood<br />Black Sunday<br />Farm On The Freeway<br />Witches Promise<br />Minstrel In The Gallery<br />Ring Out, Solstice Bells<br />A Passion Play (multiple sections edited together)<br />Life Is A Long Song<br />Cold Wind To Valhalla<br />Valley<br />Cross-eyed Mary<br />Dun Ringill<br />Moths<br />Nothing Is Easy<br />Dangerous Veils<br />Living In The Past<br />Due to the immense clout I wield with both the band and EMI/Chrysalis, I'm sure my suggestions will be implemented immediately. Seriously though... I think with a song list like this you can satisfy the most casual fans and still show the many musical &amp; lyrical facets of the band to potential hardcore fans. Who knows? When The Best Of Jethro Tull Volume XXVII comes out, they might have gotten it right. Until that time, M.U.  (the original Tull hits collection) and Repeat (volume two of M.U.) should be remastered and combined for re-release pronto!omise<BR>Minstrel In The Gallery<BR>Ring Out, Solstice Bells<BR>A Passion Play (multiple sections edited together)<BR>Life Is A Long Song<BR>Cold Wind To Valhalla<BR>Valley<BR>Cross-eyed Mary <BR>Dun Ringill <BR>Moths<BR>Nothing Is Easy<BR>Dangerous Veils<BR>Living In The Past<br />Due to the immense clout I wield with both the band and EMI/Chrysalis, I'm sure my suggestions will be implemented immediately.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Save your money!!! This cd is 100% crap! Please do yourself a favor and buy yourself something nice with the 15 bucks you will save. Go buy paint and watch it dry because that will be more fun than listening to Britney Spears try to sing.
B000088E6D|4.0|The only reason I probably had a listen to this fellow is because they were playing it repeatedly in a local CD shop.  I decided I liked his voice, and I liked the songs he sang.  Perfect combination!  My husband even likes this CD.  We both had Moondance in our heads for an entire night.  I recommend this CD.  It's something everyone will enjoy listening to so you don't have to fight about who gets to pick which CD to listen to in the car!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Get this dvd set.  The plot, ship, locations, and characters are beyond wondeful.  Anyone who enjoys sci-fi will love this.
0780626966|5.0|As an owner of this collection and many other movies found on the Boogeymen DVD, I have come to find many flaws and errors about this collection but have come to charish it as well. The 8th disc has a game which is said to have an alternate ending but is very hard to unlock even when you use the 20 password. In closing I would suggest, if you are a heavy collector like myself, buying the Scream, Friday the 13th, and Halloween collection.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I frist heard this CD it just jumped out and grabed me. It is the greatest CD ever maade and its just plain outstanding I would have paid $100 for this CD if I had too because ever song is absoultely perfect and if you don't have this CD you should buy it right now and I promise you it will stay in your CD player all the time because after one listen you will want to hear it all the time. Its too bad i could only give it 5 stars because it is the GREATEST CD EVER MADE.
0195073401|5.0|Just like Samuelson's introductory text was for many years a standard in undergraduate economics courses, so is MWG the canonical choice for first-year graduate microeconomics.  It is a comprehensive treatment that leaves out neither the rigorous mathematics that the subject deserves nor discussions of the applications and intuition, and while the size can be intimidating, instructors generally only choose the chapters most appropriate to their own exposition.  The only quibble about the book is that while it covers the 50-year-old foundations but does not go into new developments of microeconomics too much, for which I would suggest _The Structure of Economics_.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Folks,<br />This is one Movie that kept me on my seat.<br />I will not ruin the story, but all I will say is, You Can't place this movie in a certain Genre, till the last scene of the movie. I was sitting there confused between Horror, Murder, Super Natural..etc. The last reveals all.<br />Highly Recommended.<br />...
B00003CY6M|4.0|(If I loved it so much, why not 5 stars? Well, personally, I didn't like the ending.) I believe that everyone wants to believe in the undescribable and the unseen but it's difficult to. It's totally your call when it comes to love. No one is there to tell you the truth. People say that it's right in front of you but you are not seeing it... <BR>Before I watched this film I wasn't expecting much at all. Maybe just a bit of a tear at the end... But what happened was me crying in the beginning of the movie~! But it's not just that, this movie is just so amazing: You feel this sparkling in your heart whole while watching it. I thought it was going to be cheesy...and maybe it is...to most of the people...but who wouldn't want to believe in something beatiful called &quot;fate&quot;?
B00006AG5N|5.0|Presley was the epitomy of greatness in his time. This CD brings alive that greatness and shows how Presley evolved in his music in the 50s, 60s, 70s and now 21st century w/ a little less converstaion. This is a must for any Elvis fan. The 2nd to none CD is also necessary.
B00000IPAX|4.0|What else can you really say about this cd.  It good um not so clean but still extremely fun. <BR>Definately that cd you put on at the party to get everyone in a good mood.
0345350499|1.0|I read this book a number of years ago based on rave reviews by a number of my friends.  I was unable to finish it.  I slogged<br />through 3/4ths of it before giving up.  It was quite awhile ago so I can't go into too many specifics but i do remember flat,<br />unsympathetic, un-likable characters.  The women all seemed to view themselves as victims.  Strong women, even if victimized<br />usually don't have the time to wallow in self pity as these characters seemed to. It all became too irritating &amp; honestly too boring<br />for me.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I am probably the biggest Celine Dion fan in the world and this cd stands out as her best offering so far. <br />Every christmas, this cd is played continously in my cdplayer. the songs are just brilliantly produced, and the vocals are out-of-this-world. I never heard a more hair-raising version of O COme All Ye Faithfull! She sings with so much emotion it is undescribable.<br />Celine Dion's christmas album is a classic and will be remembered for years to come! ! !
0679428895|3.0|Harris does a wonderful job of putting the reader into the everyday life of the Roman world. There is none of the stilted dialogue of so many historical novels, and his settings are vividly clear. The problem is with the peripheral characters, particularly Corelia. Throughout the book you get no feel for who she is or why she and the main character, based on just two brief encounters, should be so attracted as to risk their lives (first she, then he) for each other. The suspense and narrative could have held the reader long enough for Harris to spend a bit of time developing his characters.
B00008EYA5|5.0|This film is incredible an absolute must! Filled with action at all times and a great plot. <BR>With great stars in it aswell.<br />Colin Farrell plays a great part truely made for Cop lovers
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Many people see Firefly as a space-faring drama that is cavorting as a western, but it's probably more useful to see it as the opposite.  Joss Whedon seems to care not a whit about science fiction in the usual sense, but what he does care about is the characters and the myriad of decisions that they must make alone, on the spot, and with real risks to life, diginity, and liberty.  That's a good western.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Anyone remember the 'Breakfast Club?'<br />A tale about a bunch of high schoolers from different cliques thrown together for a saturday afternoon detention. You had the jock, the prom queen, the nerd/geek, the criminal burnout, and the kid that doesn't fit in anywhere. They all pretty much hate one another but not as much as they hate adults who, surprise, surprise, hate them right back! They have to write a 1000 word essay that justifies their existence. By the end of the movie they've all changed and grown somehow and see each other differently.<br />Well in 'Battle Royale' take the same premise and instead of having to write an essay the principal tells them that they have to kill each other...or die!!<br />This movie rocks! I mean it goes for throat and never let's go. I hope that this movie gets the American treatment (ala 'The Ring') because in the hands of the right director it could be an awesome movie! Unfortunately the Columbine tragedy (life is more tragic than fiction) will probably ensure that it never happens.
B000002PB2|5.0|DAWN PATROL is Night Ranger's first- and overall best- album. Although their biggest hits would come later, this album is much more consistent musically than their other albums, excluding compilations. This album is the sound of a band just putting it all on the line and rocking out. The reason some of their later albums- such as BIG LIFE- were wanting in excitement is that they seemed to be trying too hard for the big hits. Here, however, they're just rocking like it's nobody's business. Get DAWN PATROL, MIDNIGHT MADNESS, 7 WISHES, and LIVE IN JAPAN, and you'll have the ultimate Night Ranger library.
B0000C1733|5.0|i can understand how people could be disappointed that &quot;aeroplane&quot;, &quot;love rollercoaster&quot;, &quot;around the world&quot;, &quot;the zephyr song&quot;, and &quot;can't stop&quot; aren't on this album, and i'm kinda surprised that they aren't.<br />but, imo, &quot;tear&quot; and &quot;universally speaking&quot; are the best songs on &quot;by the way&quot;, and so i'm glad one of them made it to this album.  i say, take &quot;by the way&quot; off, and add &quot;tear&quot; to the tracklisting.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am still working my way through this monumental set, but I went straight to the extended version of the mess that was Alien 3 to see if they could add some coherence to the film and fill some of the plot holes.  They did.  Did you ever wonder how Ripley could announce that she was carrying a queen and not just an ordinary Alien?  A deleted scene where they find the carcass of a \\"super-face-hugger\\" on the floor explains that.  A deleted sequence where they actually caught the Alien and a crazed inmate released it gives much more sense to the back half of the film.  The film was shot beautifully, but the butchers who cut it down to the magical two hour run are the ones who made it into the confusing mess that we all remember.  The added 41 minutes on the  extended version make all the difference in the world.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Please dont get me wrong. I love Megadeth and have been a rabid fan for more than 12 years. But what is upsetting is coming after the world breaking Rust in Peace, this album surely is a letdown. I love this album but for a few weak songs but all in all, I expected Marty/Mustain team to put another molten piece of metal like Rust. But what you get here is a easier, more instant food metal. My crib is that M/M team are so prodigiously talented that they could do much more than this. The best song on the album is Ashes in your Mouth, with killer, neverending leads this song can be taken and put on Rust album. Skin is a great opener and there cool headbanger tunes here like Symphony, This was my life, but the weak songs are Psychotron, High speed dirt and Captive Honor, in a row 3 weak songs? Megadeth has never done that ever again. If you like old school metal, any Megadeth, Anthrax, MEtallica you will reallu appreciate this album. Countdown is a must for any metal fan, I really like hence the 5 stars but it is still a letdown.
0553213105|4.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of the best books I've ever read.  The intricate style Jane Austen used to write this love story made it so the reader was sucked into it in every turn of the page.  The way all the characters interact and the vivid picture the book gives on every person helps the reader understand the contents of the story and the reason the main characters act in the manner that they do.  Apart from love, this book also has mystery and suspense.  The novel never takes the reader to a dead end, but instead takes him/her to a sort of maze where anything can happen.  This book is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on his toes and because of its contents dealing with society and its morals on being prejudiced, it is appropriate and a must read for any age group.  In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; the chapter that interested me the most was chapter 8.  In this chapter Elizabeth is taking care of her ill sister when she joins Miss Bingley, Darcy, and Mrs. Hurst and the topic of an acomplished woman arose.  In this little dispute of the upper class, a vivid description of an accomplished woman is given where a woman is accomplished when she has mastered all of the fine arts and has read many books.  This was my favorite chapter because it gives an insight into the prejudiced mind of the upper class.  To them an accomplished woman is one who has mastered the fine arts, but the only people in the 19th century that could afford the classes that helped a woman master anything were the upper class families.  In laymens terms the only way for a woman to be considered accomplished was if she was rich and famous.  The fine arts that were considered refined were the ones that could not be studied by just anyone and those were the art the upper class studied to feel superior.  What made this my favorite chapter was the way Elizabeth reacted during the dispute.  Even though she was being put down, she did not say a word to fight back.  All she did was listen and let the birds chirp.  Her pride was too great to let anyone tell her differently and that's exactly what I liked.  Even though she was lower class, she had more respect and pride than the ones that were believed to be high and mighty.  This book is appropriate for people of all ages. As long as the person reading understands the meaning of big words, this is a great book for them. This is so because of the morals of the story, and the connection you can make with the present time.  This book shows you how and why some people feel superior to others and how in the end, the people they looked down upon ended up being the greatest people they've ever met.  As you read this book, you come to realize that what you are learning is priceless and meaningful.  &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; gives you an insight into a problem facing every average person and, if read right, the solution to being prejudiced.  If you haven't read this book, read it, and if you have already read it and understood it, read it to some one who hasn't,  or give your book to someone you like or appreciate.
B000088E6D|5.0|It's no small wonder that the Bee-Gees would allow Buble to re-release their 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart'and choose to do the background vocals for him - they obviously care a great deal about their finest work and knew that Buble could do it proud. And did he ever. It's my top song on the album.<BR>I'm a brother's Gibb fan, and would never have known about Buble had it not been for info on their board a long, long while back. I smile now thinking about trying to figure out how to pronounce his name! Now I consider myself a Buble fan as well. <BR>His recent Larry King appearance singing Christmas songs from his newly released Christmas album &quot;Let it Snow&quot; proved to me that Buble is a serious and deserving leader in the world of great singers --- rich tones and passion and respect for songs written with those qualities in mind. <BR>His popularity is not surprising, he's talented, good looking and by all accounts is a nice 'kid'. Yes, I watched the Dateline show on him and was struck by his sincerity and family closeness - his grandpa must be a sweety.  <BR>He is what the music world and we as music lovers have been waiting for for so long! And I say it's about time!
B000002UZ6|5.0|Tina Turner's success story is a middle-finger up at the cuts and bruises that dominated her early life. The better half of the Ike & Tina duo of the 60's, she lived a life of Hell. Success for her was easy but her marriage to Ike was a nightmare. She finally broke free in the 70's and made a phenomenal comeback in the early 80's with the Grammy-award winning landmark album \\"Private Dancer.\\" With her iconic voice, sultry moves and gorgeous legs Tina Turner became THE defining voice of female rock.<br /><br />The success story of Tina Turner cannot be better chronicled than in her greatest hits collection from 1991, \\"Simply The Best.\\" I do not actually own this album - my dad does. He's had it since it was released, and he played it in his car for years and years. Around five at the time, I grew up listening to these classic hits and they hold special memories in my mind of my childhood. The album topped the UK album chart and spent more than three years in the Top 50. The sales of this album are yet another chapter in Tina's success story with more than 10 million copies sold worldwide.<br /><br />\\"The Best\\" opens the album, and it could not be a better song. This really is one of the best songs ever recorded. The driving beat slaps you in the face and Tina's voice holds you transfixed. Then the saxophone comes in just after three minutes and will blow you away! It has me screaming and jumping up and down like a lunatic! \\"Better Be Good To Me\\" and \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\" are both superb. The former striking the true energy of girl power, while the latter evoking a true sense of old school soul and R'n'B. \\"What's Love Got To Do With It,\\" Tina's only US No.1 single is a mid-tempo masterpiece. \\"Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\\" cries Tina, perfectly summing up her tragic and tormented life. \\"I Don't Wanna Lose You\\" is a beautiful ballad with some fantastic vocals from Tina and was a fairly new song on this album at the time of its release.<br /><br />\\"Nutbush City Limits\\" and \\"What You Get Is What You See\\" maintain the album, while \\"Let's Stay Together\\" was Tina's first ever UK hit single as a solo artist and peaked at No.6 in November 1983. The song earned her a Grammy nomination and has a really funky beat that still holds up 20 years on. It's a real sing-a-long anthem, and will stand the test of time with it's cheesy but very addictive synthesizers. \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" is the oldest song from this album, from way back in the 60's! \\"Steamy Windows\\" brings it right up to date with a racy song about two lovers snuggling up in the back seat of a car, with steamy windows! Coming from the body heat...<br /><br />\\"Typical Male\\" is one of my favourite Tina songs, because you can sing along perfectly to it. The beat is funky and you can shake your booty to it. \\"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\\" was the theme to the film Mad Max III and was a huge hit for Tina. The chorus is wonderfully loud and the verses are lonely and desolate. They create the perfect contrast. \\"Private Dancer\\" flopped somewhat in the UK but was a huge hit around the world. The song has a lyrical ambiguity to it, in that she sings it with suggestion about being a stripper, yet the video (for a younger audience) would suggest she is simply a dancer who dances for random men at a club. Yeah, right. \\"Look Me In The Heart\\" and \\"It Takes Two\\" are my two least favourite songs on the album, but they are easily forgotten with the excellent \\"I Want You Near Me.\\" This was a new song for the album, and has a very soulful and sexy feel to it.<br /><br />\\"Way Of The World\\" was my absolute favourite song on this album when I was a child. The memories are still there, but it's not my favourite song now. As a child you don't understand that Tina is singing about a lover, you think it's all in the family - well at least I did. I had this image of Tina leaving her daughter at home and running off or something stupid like that! \\"Love Thing\\" closes the album in a spectacular fashion, totally different to the previous track. This is a loud and brash rock anthem from Tina and totally rocks the roof! She shouts, and it works wonderfully.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />As far as female hits compilations go, Simply The Best stands along side Madonna's \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" and Janet Jackson's \\"Design Of A Decade - 1986/1996\\" as one of the most essential. Simply The Best is a complete capsule of 80's pop rock that shaped a woman, now in her mid-60's and still looking as sexy and lively as ever. I'm a 16 year old teenage boy and listen to her music. It's fantastic, and she appeals to such a wide audience. Tina Turner is a true survivor and an inspiration to many. The title of the album says it all.erent to the previous track.

1400031354|5.0|I'm an American woman who has spent 12 years living in Africa, and traveled to almost every part of the African continent.  When I discovered the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I could hardly wait to read Tears of the Giraffe.  I was not disappointed.  I can hardly wait to get to the next books in the series.  After saying she would never, ever remarry (in the first book), Precious does get engaged in this book, but continues to pursue investigating her cases while engaged.  There are a lot of interesting developments that I don't want to give away.  She hasn't gotten married by the end of the book, that is left to us in the third book to find out about.....!<br />I found it interesting that the author is a Professor of Medical law, living in Scotland, but having been born and raised in Zimbabwe.  He has published many varied books on many subjects.  I think these are his \\"fun\\" books!  I also think that part of the reason he has written these books is to show non-Africans what traditional African society is like, especially how it is managing to move into the modern age.  By setting it in Botswana, he neatly sidesteps many of the problems found in other parts of Africa, and is able to concentrate both on his story, and on showing us how traditional Africans THINK and act.  I found this especially interesting, having lived in several African cultures, myself.  I also find the series very uplifting and rewarding to read, in addition to being a good story.  I think some of the critical reviews are from people who have never lived or traveled in Africa, and they just don't realize how true-to-life are so many of the episodes-I do not find these books at ALL condescending toward blacks.  On the contrary, they are a celebration of the traditional GOOD values found in black African culture (a nice change from what we usually see in the news).<br />There were several things I especially enjoyed about this book.  I don't particularly enjoy first-person, male-oriented policedetective novels.  This is about a woman detective, who had no more qualifications than you or I, but who just hung out a sign, and used her common sense.  She ordered a text book from London, from which she learned some investigative procedures.  She's very clever.  The book is not written as a first person, blow-by-blow account.  On the contrary, it is written in third person, and is more about her LIFE, going through her becoming a detective, the cases she meets along the way (which we watch her solve), and what we learn about the society as we go along.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning to travel to any southern African country.  It is a light, humorous book, from which you can learn a lot while enjoying a great story.  I found it difficult to put down.  I have now read the first two books in the series, and plan to order every single one.  I can hardly wait until they arrive in the mail!
B000060K4O|5.0|I have a small posse of favorite comedians. Somewhere towards the top of that list, along with Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. He's been around since the early 80s, getting his start on NBC's &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after Chevy Chase left for his own career in Hollywood. Murray worked live for a few years before -- like those prior to him him -- gradually making his way into the film world. <br />I like all of the comedians in &quot;Ghostbusters,&quot; come to think of it. Dan Aykroyd is another great subtle comedian, with a great knack for writing as well as acting. It was Aykroyd, after all, who is primarily responsible for &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; And Harold Ramis, who later became a director, with an impressive resume of such films as &quot;Vacation,&quot; &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; and &quot;Analyze This.&quot; <br />Then there's also Rick Moranis, a meek nerd character who is very underrated and very funny, a sort of Woody Allen Lite. He was Dark Helmet in &quot;Spaceballs,&quot; Barney Coopersmith in &quot;My Blue Heaven,&quot; and that wacky inventor in &quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids.&quot;<br />Yes, one could say that &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is built on a firm base, scripted by Aykroyd, Ramis and Moranis (who is uncredited) and directed by Ivan Reitman (&quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;). It's a clever little story with a simple premise and lots of laughs -- a band of failing friends unite to make a hoax ghost-busting company, but soon real ghosts do show up and they're in over their heads.<br />It starts in New York City. Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stanz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) are three Columbia University scientists laid off after their grant expires with no results from the trio in return. Down to nothing, they cook up the brilliant (or crazy) idea to create a &quot;ghost-busting&quot; company.<br />But they immediately realize that it won't be as easy as it seems to get a little extra cash, because Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men looking for help. Her apartment is infested with strange happenings, and her next-door neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is having problems of his own.<br />They pretend to solve the situation and the men suddenly become a citywide phenomenon, attracting media attention and constant customers at their front door. They become so popular, in fact, that they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), another down-on-his-luck city guy looking for a good-paying job.<br />However, Walter Peck, EPA (William Atherton) doesn't believe that the Ghostbusters are really ridding any ghosts at all, so he has them thrown in jail. But an ethreal baddie named Gozer (Slavitza Jovan) soon appears in Dana's apartment complex, and weird happenings occur, forcing Peck to free the Ghostbusters once and for all so that they can bust the ghost and send it back to where it came from.<br />Sounds corny, huh? It's meant to be. Everything about this movie is campy and goofy, and that is exactly what Ramis, Aykroyd and Moranis wanted when they collaborated. And it is very funny.<br />I don't know, there's something in me that loves &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; humor. Sure, the show has its dry spots, but I love it. Many people I know don't find it all that funny, and not as consistent as something such as &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; but I love to watch it, I love the humor, and I love the actors.<br />Part of that love, I suppose, is what makes me enjoy &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) so much. However, believe it or not, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as you might expect. It is very funny, but it isn't always a howler. It's more of an intelligent comedy, which is odd, since it is made by a band of guys from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and such backgrounds.<br />Murray steals every scene he is in. This, along with \\"Groundhog Day,\\" is the perfect vehicle for his comedic talents, ranging from the constant wise cracks to the constant dry ironic humor that I love so much. They key to his humor is not that he comes up with it, but the way he does it. Any comedian can use the blank glares, but the way he expressionlessly glares at fellow actors is a joke in itself. When Stanz admits that his one fear has always been the Stay Puff'd man, check out Murray's face. This is classic stuff.<br />As much a scene-stealer as Murray may be, he is nearly upstaged by Aykroyd and Ramis, who both provide a sort of counter-balance of lunatics and reason to Murray's flippant characteristics. The scene that everyone remembers it the finale involving the giant marshmallow Stay Puff'd Man, and whenever I think of Aykroyd's performance in this film, I think of that scene.<br />&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is a very famous comedy, and for good reason. It's light, good-hearted, funny, and actually pretty intelligent, built upon a firm cast and script, which -- considering the majority of the actors' and writers' backgrounds of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; -- is almost as surprising as the film itself.

Nevertheless, it was a delightful surprise when I found it was about a lady detective in Botswana.<br />I found it interesting that the author is a Professor of Medical law, living in Scotland, but having been born and raised in Zimbabwe.  He has published many varied books on many subjects.  I think these are his \\"fun\\" books!  I also think that part of the reason he has written these books is to show non-Africans what traditional African society is like, especially how it is managing to move into the modern age.  By setting it in Botswana, he neatly sidesteps many of the problems found in other parts of Africa, and is able to concentrate both on his story, and on showing us how traditional Africans THINK and act.  I found this especially interesting, having lived in several African cultures, myself.  I also find the series very uplifting and rewarding to read, in addition to being a good story.  I think some of the critical reviews are from people who have never lived or traveled in Africa, and they just don't realize how true-to-life are so many of the episodes-I do not find these books at ALL condescending toward blacks.  On the contrary, they are a celebration of the traditional GOOD values found in black African culture (a nice change from what we usually see in the news).<br />There were several things I especially enjoyed about this book.  I don't particularly enjoy first-person, male-oriented police detective novels.  This is about a woman detective, who had no more qualifications than you or I, but who just hung out a sign, and used her common sense.  She ordered a text book from London, from which she learned some investigative procedures.  She's very clever.  The book is not written as a first person, blow-by-blow account.  On the contrary, it is written in third person, and is more about her LIFE, going through her becoming a detective, the cases she meets along the way (which we watch her solve), and what we learn about the society as we go along.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning to travel to any southern African country.  It is a light, humorous book, from which you can learn a lot while enjoying a great story.  I found it difficult to put down.  I have now read the first two books in the series, and plan to order every single one.  I can hardly wait until they arrive in the mail!
B00005JMCW|4.0|The teenage years are hard. Countless films have been made about that era in every person's life, including this year's controversial &quot;13.&quot; And the biggest surprise may be the way Disney handles the subject in &quot;Freaky Friday,&quot; not toning down premises as they have before, but rather allowing all to flow freely and still making it a clean, moralistic family film. <br />Oh, and adulthood is hard, too.<br />&quot;Freaky Friday&quot; was originally released in 1976. The film starred Jodie Foster, and was never exactly the Disney family classic it meant to be (obviously copying &quot;The Parent Trap's&quot; style). It spawned a lot of copies, including a made-for-TV remake in 1995 with Shelley Long, not to mention a string of late-80s films, such as &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;; &quot;18 Again&quot;; and &quot;Vice Versa.&quot; All were different variations on the basic premise of adults switching places with their offspring or younger relations, and the two then coming to appreciate their differences.<br />Now the formula is seeing a steady increase in popularity once again. 2002's &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; (one of the worst of that year) was about a teenage girl who swapped places with a petty criminal. Now Disney is cashing in on something they made some 20 odd years ago, and no one -- myself included -- expected the film to be any good. Surprise, surprise.<br />Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a widowed psychiatrist with two kids, including Anna (Lindsay Lohan), a 15-year-old highschooler with aspirations of punk rock status -- she and her friends get together in the garage of her house and &quot;jam.&quot; (I play guitar and, for the first time since &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; it looks as if the filmmakers put some effort to make the guitar players look like they are really playing the darn thing).<br />&quot;You're ruining my life!&quot; Anna constantly yells. Tess' engaged boyfriend, Ryan (Mark Harmon), isn't sure what's going on between the two, but his attempts at being nice to the kids often backfires. (After Tess removes Anna's bedroom door due to low grades, Harmon tells Anna that it's under the staircase in an effort to make peace with her. &quot;Like I didn't figure that out already,&quot; she says.)<br />When mother and daughter visit a Chinese restaurant and eat some magical fortune cookies, they wake up the next day as always -- expect they're in each other's bodies. <br />And so here come the jokes. One bets that they can make it in school, the other at work. Tess, in Anna's body, acts like a mature adult. Meanwhile, Anna, in Tess' body, acts like a teenager -- she even gets a makeover.<br />But there're problems. There's a wedding and a rock band audition, and since they're in each other's bodies, it presents a major dilemma. But if they want to switch back before their big days, then they'll have to learn to appreciate each other's differences.<br />What a delightful little family film this is! Sweet, gentle, funny, and just plain enjoyable. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, and in the process becomes a lot more. It has streaks of &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Vice Versa.&quot; I've always enjoyed &quot;Vice Versa&quot; the most out of the many, many body-switching 80s films released simultaneously, and now I've found another worthy addition to the genre.<br />Annette Bening was originally cast as Tess Coleman, but then Jamie Lee Curtis stepped in. And I'm glad she did. I'm not a very big fan of Curtis, but she can occasionally be quite surprising, and this is one of those cases. Meanwhile, Lindsay Lohan, the little girl from 1998's remake of &quot;The Parent Trap,&quot; evokes the same great method of adult channeling as little Fred Savage did in &quot;Vice Versa.&quot; As many of my readers probably know, my main problem with &quot;Big&quot; is that Tom Hanks did not act like a 13-year-old, but rather like a 6-year-old. Lohan successfully acts like both an irritating teenagerand a mature adult. The two gals' performances really make the movie.<br />This is one of the most enjoyable treats of the year. Kids will get a kick out of it, and so will parents, and that is precisely the definition of great family filmmaking -- because, let's face it, Disney lost sight of that a few years ago. Looks like they're finally getting back on their feet after a long dry spot.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead poses many questions for viewers but allows few answers. The setting reminds me of something out of a Charles Dickens novel/only darker.Perhaps one could say this is work somewhat like Dickens but with 21st century themes.<BR>    Some have viewed it as social commentary which may include: alienation of modern man in a dwindling post production economy or maybe the power man has over life and death through abortion. These are issues almost any young man/woman faces in the modern era. My favorite scene is the dance number where a young woman continues her routine despite a rather grotesque physical occurence. And of course there is the baby --that wondeful shrieking child. (I don't want to ruin this for anyone so I will say no more).<BR>This is no date movie unless both parties are heavy into the art/philosophy/theme thing.<BR>The use of B/W film is great-A masterpiece -- superb!!<br />tingfish
B000002AS3|5.0|I bought Morning Glory on the day it came out.  I loved it.  I bought Definitely Maybe.  I loved it even more.  Let me tell you that this album is addictive and has some of the best guitar work I have ever heard.  A lot of the songs will get you humming or whistling and will get you up if you're down.  This is a must have album!!  Buy it.  Right now!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Those who fell in love with \\"Wicked\\" on the stage (as I did in early November 2003) will be delighted to hear the CD delivers: The great songs, those glorious lead performances -- they are all here to enjoy again and again. Those who've yet to make it to the show may be in for an even bigger treat, and should brace themselves for ballad-belter Menzel and the ever-brassy and brilliant Chenoweth, as well as composer Schwartz at what may be his peak. Artistically speaking, they're all defying gravity -- leaving all involved flying high.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|this film is not those looking for a &quot;good time&quot; at the movies. after it was over, my friends and i sat in the darkness for at least 10 minutes, letting the whole thing sink in. as a viewer, you get sucked right into paths of destruction with the characters. a powerful story (read the book too) darren aranofsky turns it into a work of primitive art.
B000066NW0|1.0|once i heard this i had a new hate in my life...i know that all of you little pathetic avril loving souls out there are gonna hate me because i am picking on this pathetic excuse for a singer and this sad excuse for an album (what a waste of plastic!!) Heres my top 3 reasons why avril sucks a lot:<br />1. she can't sing...(plus, all her S's sound like SH's, god! go to speech therapy or something!...its so annoying!)<br />2. she's one hell of a freaken poser!...she says 'i can play guitar!', yet i never see her do it...she says shes punk(i love punk by the waay, but avril is JUST NOT PUNK) she has the label 'anti-britney' but most people in their right mind know shes going to turn into the next whorish britney<br />3. she's planning on making a new cd...(more waste of plastic!)<br />i could come up with more but its such a waste of time talkin about HER...i would have gaven this cd a zero, but, unfortunatly they dont give you that option...i know the next people who are going to write more reviews are gonna say not to listen to me...but hey, i speak the truth! dont listen to THEM!(unless your one of those many  peoples that give her a 1...YAY FOR YOU!!)<br />to end this little avril extravaganza...dont WASTE your money!!!!
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the funniest comedies ever made and definitely the best work of the Coen brothers. Two types of people won't like this movie, saints and idiots. To see Jeff Bridges and John Goodman pull off acting in these wildy outlandish characters really shows how amazing they are as actors. If you are a saint you won't be able to get through about 5 minutes of it what with all the swearing, if you're not too bright you won't grasp the oddball humor of the Coen brothers. (see Raising Arizona or Fargo style). For everyone else, you will watch this movie over and over and over and probably go around repeating lines to your friends who will also enjoy this movie immensely. If there is one comedy you must absolutely see of all the Coen brothers movies, this is the one.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Scarred for life is an understatement.  This movie will cut into your conscience like a fine razor.  Even days after the wound will burn, reminding you of what you saw.  But make no mistake, this is incredible film-making. It pushes new boundaries and awakens us to the power of raw, human, reality.<BR>Watch it.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This band is the greatest of all time. the videos are very good and show Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright in perfect harmony. The director's interview and the bonus material are the things that show how music was before the great electronic advance. But I've never heard something like it. MUST BUY.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore has proven his talent beyond any doubt with this, the third and final of the three soundtracks for The Lord of the Rings movies. The music is the perfect score for the three most incredible movies the world has seen, taking us from emotional heights, to depths, to simple and quiet moments with some of the most wonderful music you'll ever hope to hear, regardless of whether or not you have seen, or even wish to see, the cinema trilogy by New Line.<br />I'd hoped to do a track-by-track analysis, but I simply don't have room, so I'll share some of this CD's better tracks.<br />Track 3 (3:38): It starts out with dangerous overtones, as Pippin attempts to steal the Palantír from Gandalf, and the terrible consequences of his deed. Gandalf takes him to the city of Gondor, and we hear the premiere of Shore's theme for the City of Kings. (Actually, we first heard a sampling of the Gondor theme in the first movie, when Aragorn is first spoken of as the exiled king, and again in the motion picture preview released earlier in 2003) A wonderful choir makes way to the splendorous, magnificent theme for Gondor, perfectly capturing all the wonder and awe of the city. Awesome. Actually, the solo by Ben Del Maestro, I have concurred, is the part that plays when the White Rider dashes out onto the planes to challenge the Nazgûl.<br />Track 4 (3:25): A solemn tune, with distinctive Death of Boromir overtones, then the theme for Gondor again, just as grand as before. I believe (I'm big on figuring out which part of the soundtrack goes to which part of the movie) that this is the glorious music that plays as Gandalf rides through the citadel of Gondor, to the very top level of the city.<br />Track 5 (3:53): Not EXACTLY one of my favorite picks, but I had to comment on this one since it is the one with Billy Boyd's solo. In the beginning, it is primarily flute, along with other, somber-sounding instruments mixed in. Gondorian theme again, quieter this time. This, I have figured out, is the sad music that plays as Faramir leads his troops out onto the field. At 2:35 on the CD counter, Billy Boyd begins his quiet, dirge-like solo which provides the background theme for Faramir's suicide charge on enemy ranks. And yes, it is a very lovely, though somber and sad song. Billy Boyd sings it very well.<br />Track 7 (2:09): The action-oriented muster of Rohan's troops. As you could expect, the theme of Rohan from The Two Towers prevails in a heroic and magnificent way. In the middle, there is a quiet moment where Shore makes use of the generally-saved-for-hobbits Celtic-sounding flute. The track picks back up triumphantly before it ends.<br />Track 10 (2:35): Quiet beginning, with Rivendell overtones. Another tune begins, a very royal and glorious as the sword of kings is reforged anew. The end transitions to the creepy Paths of the Dead theme.<br />Track 13 (3:26): Slow beginning, then a very drawn-out tune of hopefulness. Rohan's arrival to Gondor's aid? Then the stunning, dramatic theme for the Ringwraiths is blasted out by the incredible choir Howard Shore commands. It may be the bad guy theme, but it is still incredible to hear. The track is too short, in my opinion.<br />Track 15 (4:02): The last desperate stand of Aragorn's troops before Mordor's endless ranks. At the same time, the quiet flute plays as Frodo works against all odds to climb the mountain of doom. This track and the next are the themes for the most powerful, poignant moments in the movie, and are NOT to be missed. (Referring to the music, but the movie too!)<br />Track 16 (5:13): Terribly desperate, frantic choir plays during the final moments of the climax at Mt. Doom and the Black Gate. A silent moment appears, with a slow solo by Renee Fleming, as Aragorn faces down the Eye of Sauron. Shore makes brilliant use of the choir - well, pretty much any time he uses them for his Lord of the Rings film score, but especially in this case.<br />Track 19 (5:48): Of the three songs (May it Be, Gollum's Song, and Into the West) that Howard Shore has featured on his soundtrack, I nominate this one as the best. It is sung by Annie Lennox, whose voice credit-viewers may recognize from Apollo 13's end credits. Her voice in this sounds somehow a little less feminine, and a little more like a male with a high-pitched voice, but that's just an observation, not a complaint. The song itself is really great. It sings in very poetic, descriptive terms basically of Heaven. For anyone, but particularly believers in Jesus like me, it is an especially inspiring and thrilling song of hope for the World to Come; of heaven. Beautiful. And as usual, the end credits song also includes a bit of the film score after the song. <br />Folks, Howard Shore's soundtrack abilities remain unequaled. For fans of the film, the music is an excellent way to relive parts of the movie when silly things like, say, real life prevent you from going to the theater. For people who haven't seen the movie, this music is awesome no matter which way you dice it. Please, please buy this CD.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is my song to song review of each track on Britney Spears 4th studio album \\"In The Zone\\". I don't really know what to expect because I have not heard them yet with the exception of \\"Me Against The Music\\". Personally, I think Britney Spears is alright. But mostly, she looks good.1. Me Against The Music (feat. Madonna) -  I like this song. It has good bass and a good beat. I love to hear bass. Britney vocals are better than they were earlier in her career. As for Madonna, good as usual.  5 stars2. (I Got That) Boom Boom (feat. Ying Yang Twins) -  I like this song because of Ying Yang Twins. As for Britney, her vocals are good. I liked the southern boys line. 5 stars3. Showdown -  I like the song but the continuous \\"WAYO\\" drives me nuts. I could only wish Britney was singing to me me when she says \\"Would you undo my zipper please?\\" 3 stars4. Breathe On Me -  This is a big step from \\"...Baby One More Time\\". I think the true meaning of the song is about SEX. 4 stars5. Early Mornin' - I like the beat. Great job Britney on writing the lyrics. 5 stars6. Toxic -  I like this because it has a crazy beat. Also, the lyrics of being high \\"Too high, can't come down.\\" 5 stars7. Outrageous -  I like this because it is another song with good lyrics. Plus, R. Kelly is in it. Kinda. I give this more than 5 I give it 7 stars.8. Touch Of My Hand -  I just like this song. 5 stars9. The Hook Up -  I liked this song. But, I am not much of a dancer so I don't particuarly like dance songs. 4 stars10. Shadow -  I like this. But my favorite Britney ballad is \\"I'm Not A Girl\\". 4 stars11. Brave New Girl -  This sounds like Madonna's arly stuff and \\"Ray Of Light\\". 3 stars12. Everytime -  I like this song. 4 stars13. Me Against The Music (feat. Madonna) (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix) -  They should have left the original alone.  2 stars
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For the mindless FOX executive who thought that this show was cancel worthy. All I can say is wow. If you don't own this, what are you waiting for? The scripts are endlessly amusing, with drama, action, and humor rolled into one shiny package. The actors play their roles as if they were born to do so and the plot keeps you wanting to see what happens next. Anyone who even remotely enjoys sci-fi should immediately buy this. Even people I know who don't swear by it.
0385504209|2.0|Don't believe the hype.<br />Eveything about this book is less than you've heard: the history is deeply flawed, the art history is questionable at best, and the theology is ludicrous.  But of course, the book promises to be no more than a thriller, and it doesn't even succeed at that level: anyone who can't spot the real killer has no experience with potboiler fiction.<br />This seems to be the kind of book--I believe Michael Crichton started the trend--that is written in order to be turned into a movie.  I'm sure it will be a success; and equally sure that I won't see it until it appears on Showtime.<br />Read Eco's Foucault's Pendulum to see how a much better author treats similar material in a much more sophisticated way.

B000092ZYX|2.0|I used to have this uncle in the 70's that would argue, usually whenever he was drunk, that Frank Zappa was the greatest rock musician ever. When I was in college, a girl I dated thought I &quot;wasn't very bright&quot; because I didn't &quot;get&quot; the genius of Morrissey. <br />What does this have to do with Radiohead? Basically, if you have given this or any Radiohead album a 5 star review you're musically challenged. Your judgment is impared. 15 years from now nobody is going to be listening to this crap. Like anyone listens to Zappa and Morrissey today.<br />Hey, you can like anything you want. I am sure I regularly listen to half a dozen artists you probably don't care for, I just don't go around exaggerating and inflating their talent or importance. <br />&quot;Radiohead has had a startling impact on contemporary popular music.&quot; In what way?<br />&quot;No band of the 1990s has garnered as much critical and commercial success as Radiohead.&quot; Really? How about Nirvana.<br />I have Pablo Honey and Kid A on CD (and haven't listened to them in years). If you enjoy Radiohead, fine. But don't kid yourself that their music is important or influential. By the time my kids are in college - people will still be listening to original and groundbreaking artists: the Beatles, The Ramones, Nirvana and Radiohead will be forgotten.
B00009TB5G|3.0|I loved the Fellowship of the Ring.  The Two Towers has the every bit, the same high-level attention to detail as it's predecessor.<BR>However, when I saw The Two Towers in the theatre last year, I found myself not enjoying it nearly as much as I did The Fellowship.  Now, after viewing the extended DVD, I think I know why.  The Two Towers just doesn't really go anywhere.  This, of course, is mostly due to it being the middle movie.  Don't get me wrong, the events that occur in The Two Towers are significant to the overall story.  It's just not a story in itself.  There is no beginning, that was the Fellowship.  There are only a few new characters (Eowyn, Treebeard, Eomer, and Theoden, for the most part).  The overall story of Frodo's quest only advances a tiny bit.  Basically, most of the Two Towers is a setup for the battle against Saruman's Orcs in Helm's Deep.  Again, I realize this is important to the overall story, but unfortunately, it's not enough.<br />The Fellowship of the Ring works as both a part of a trilogy and as a stand-alone film.  The Two Towers can't be looked at this way, it only works as the middle story of a trilogy.  That's fine and actually, unavoidable.  But it just doesn't come across as satisfying.

B000065BPB|3.0|I am somewhat of an audio purist. It is almost certain that you fill find these headphones different from anything else you've heard. Mostly what I noticed was how these headphones sort of bring every peice of the sound forth. For example, if you were listening to a peice of audio with the wind blowing .. the wind would sound very .. clear and probably way more clearer than most others you've heard. The bass is enough. I am not one of those people who like thumping trunks. These headphones are pretty close to actually being there in person.<P>In short .. yes these are recommended.<P>Added later ...<BR> .. First of all these don't block out close to 32db .. atbest 10db. Though for this price you won't find anything that attenuates 32db and produces music.<BR> .. Secondly .. yes burning them in makes them sound much better. The bass really gets enhanced by burning them in.<P>Added even later ...<P>Ok, I've owned these for quite a while now .. here is one big negative .. all the pretty plastic you see around it's headband .. is ultra delicate .. shaterred with use for no good reason. The headphones are still usable .. but they look a little ugly now with their metal skeleton sticking out .. !!
B0000CNY27|5.0|Escape from New York was made for less then what most of today's movies make in a day, and still 20+ years later it still holds up pretty well.  Kurt Russell is quoted as saying that Snake Plissken is one of his favorite roles to have played in his career, and I believe him.  Kurt who had been typecast for years in light hearted Disney fair, or even cast as a jungle boy on a forgotten episode of Gilligan's Island (yes its true) was able to spread his wings as the classic anti-hero of Snake Plissken.  Snake must go into the once great city of New York to save the President of the Untied States played with typical english grace by Donald Plesance.<br />  A great escapist movie filled with tight, fast paced action sequences, and pretty good special effects for a director with no money, and decades before CGI.  John Carpenter also arranged, and performed the haunting music that is unmistakable with his movies.  The special effects were also done by a relative unknown at the time who later went on to become the King Of The World. James Cameron.<br />  This special edition is PACKED with extras, and it was a long time in coming, but the wait was worth it.  From its commentary by John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, and Debra Hill to photo galleries to the re-production of the Hurricane Press first issue of the new comic book The Snake Plissken Chronicles.  A beautiful embossed box wraps it all up and keeps it looking nice on the shelf.<br />  Lets talk about the infamous Bank Robbery footage.  Yes its a little grainy, but it has most likely been sitting in someone's attic or garage for the last 20 years.  The scene which i had never seen in its entirety is just excellent and part of me wishes that John Carpenter had been able to digitally restore the footage, and edit it into the final cut as has been done with the Alien films.  The twelve minute segment of Snake robbing the bank, and his subsequent Escape west to the coast with his partner Taylor is a wonderful addition to long time fans like myself.  This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time just for the character of Snake, and the classic tough guy dialogue that we all want to say but only he gets to deliver.  Treat yourself, and buy, rent, or steal this movie.  give it a try and I am sure that you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />  The new Blu-Ray edition put out by Scream Factory is the best version of this movie that i have ever seen.  The the new 2K transfer makes Snake look even younger and even cool than I thought possible.  The small scar on Snake's left cheek which i never noticed before seems to just pop right out at you now.  It really has to be seen to be believed.  Looks as if they filmed it yesterday rather then 34 years ago!!!!!  The new art is great but if you are not hip to change bonus, because the insert is reversible, and has the original Smiling Snake with the shattered Lady Liberty in the background from the original poster art.  Commentary is ported over from the previous Special Edition, and some added documentaries are added.  All in all i thought it was just great stuff, and a fun way to spend the afternoon.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Britney ever since the \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Crazy\\" days. Now that her new album finally came out last month, I was so excited, I could NOT Wait to get it! The tracks on here are sexual, more than her past albums, and she touches on subjects she wouldn't normally. This CD is very matured and her voice is even better.<br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC - Hip, funky, stylish, and great to dance for.<BR>BOOM BOOM - Hot, catchy, and definitely a fun song. <BR>SHOWDOWN - Sexy, great intro, nice speaking, and the Bloodshy and Avant did a great job on this.<BR>BREATHE ON ME - Techno, Soothing, Relieving, and just a sexy song to dance to<BR>EARLY MORNING - Catchy, not as good as some others on here.<BR>TOXIC - Awesome! Great song, the music is awesome, and it's defitely going to be a number one for Britney when it comes out soon!<BR>OUTRAGEOUS - A little too outrageous, The beat is awesome, the lyrics are bit on the edge, but hey - it's a good song to dance to<BR>TOUCH OF MY HAND - Another techno song, a bit touchy though. The lyrics are some of the best.<BR>HOOK UP - Definitely one that could start a whole new trend of dancing.<BR>SHADOW - Produced by the MATRIX it's eery, haunting, and has edge to it<BR>BRAVE NEW GIRL - Techno-ey, most poppy song on the album. A little rap from Britney is included here<BR>EVERYTIME - I'm a true Britney fan, and this one made me cry almost. Just imagine Britney singing this with all her heart to Justin. It would make him feel so rotten for what he did. I hope this is a single. It is my favorite song on the album.<BR>ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (REMIX) - Definitely hot, about as good as the original.<br />I say ditto to what everyone else says with their bad reviews, IN THE ZONE is worth every penny.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'm writing simply to set the record straight.  Alice in Chains was one of the founders of the grunge movement in the early 90's and, in my opinion, was the best band of that era.  Puddle of Mudd came out in 2001, a full ten years after Alice in Chains' first album Facelift.  It is obvious to me that &quot;Fred Dursts Numba One Fan&quot;'s ability to count is as atrocious as his spelling.  It is also apparent that he has no taste for good music, as is apparent by his poor ratings of some of rock's greatest musical icons like the aforementioned grunge leaders, and even the Beetles.  Any serious customer searching for good music should ignore any and all of this moron's input on anything of artistic value.
0385504209|1.0|Such profound material . . I was wondering how he would end it and as far as I am concerned, he was wondering too.  For all the puzzle-solving, intellectual highballing that he puts into his characters, at the end, nothing.  It was a page turner, and I only wish there was something of substance as I turned to the last page.
0385504209|4.0|I thought this was a good book, an attention-keeper, and something that makes you want to learn more about what's going on in the conspiracies of the world.  I probably learned more about mathematical sequences, ancient cults and modern-day tensions in the Church than I expected.  Then again, I didn't expect any of that when I started the book.<br />The only thing that I have against it, is that the death of the Louvre's director is the thread that keeps it going throughout the book.  Whenever a little &quot;pick me up&quot; is needed, we find it in one of the clues left behind by this man.  That in itself is not bad -- but then I realized how much this individual was able to accomplish in the twenty or thirty minutes that he had to live after he had been shot.  In a way, it's almost like something from a Saturday-morning cartoon -- here's a guy who's been shot in the stomach, experiencing an agonizing death, and still has presence of mind to leave a large amount of clues behind for others to find.  Truly amazing.<br />Great read, makes you want to dust off those old math books and look for pictures of honey bees and sunflowers.  Now I know whey they were in those books.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|X2 is better than your average sci-fi film but is still firmly seated in that three star category. X1 had hardly any action and was mostly about setting up characters, a plot and a story. X2 has gone for more action with less character setups. It has also tried to put the bad mutants and good mutants together fighting against a new evil.<br />The opening scene with Nightcrawler assaulting the White House is well done and we learn more about Logan's past. However Singer does still get bogged down on introducing new characters and forming many various plot lines that all need to be covered in the space of two hours. This leaves X2 very disjointed in parts and it does not flow evenly or smoothly because of it. Many viewers may feel themselves attached to one story and forgetful of others that can sometimes play out as little more than just an excuse for screen action candy.<br />The truth be told, X2 is not a bad film and is watchable but does seem to bursting at the seems with too many characters trying to do their own thing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly DVD collection is excellent.  The behind the scenes stuff, the 3 unaired episodes, and the acting is fantastic.  That Fox cancelled this show only goes to show you that they have no idea of what they had (but were smart enough to market it as a DVD collection- go figure).  The director commentary on &quot;Out of Gas&quot; is particularly outstanding - listen for the comment on the Red Button.<br />The DVD &quot;fades&quot; between selections are a bit slow and the tech breaks down (streaks on the screen freezes between selections), but the show comes through clearly.  This is a must-buy for anyone who liked the series.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|Anyone who says part one was way better is smokin somethin crazy. I had to force myself to like the first one. It tried to be a street racing movie but only had one race through the whole movie! This one has way better stunts, way more racing, hotter girls, better location, and the best part is there is no Vin Diesel. Whoever thought that guy could pass for an actor should be slapped. Tyrese comes in for his first major role and does great. He is super funny and you can tell in the acting that Paul Walker had a much better time acting with him in this one. The story behind the movie is all that irritated me. While busting a drug lord seems cool I think they should have kept it closer to the racing, which is the one way part one is superior. The soundtrack is way better in this one. It has no one from Murder Inc. in it which is a good thing, and its just packed with some of the best hip hop tracks I've heard all year. I really hope they make a third one.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I'm truly convinced that people that give this train wreck 5 stars want to be thought of as artsy, hip, and cool.  A movie shouldn't have to be be watched 20 times or researched on the internet to figure out what the hell it was all about.<br /><br />The people probably can't wait for Vincent Gallo's \\"The Brown Bunny\\" to come out so they can 'love' that too.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|This is one of the cutest movies ever. The story is sweet and heartwarming, Disney's trademark. Ellen Degeneres does a great job of voice acting an absent minded fish. This movie is really just hilarious. My favorite part is all the scenes with crush. Total surfer guy dude! This is a great family movie but it's also fun to watch for anyone.
B00005JMGC|1.0|This movies was extremely disappointing.  Julia Roberts did her typical shallow performance. However, this time she had company in the director, writer, and supporting cast accompaning her in this shallow parade.  The one good thing about this movie is Kirsten Dunst.  She has the talent and the ability to be a great actor.<BR>  There were no transistion in the characters emotional evolution.  We can not see why all of a sudden Julia Robert's character, Ms. Watson, falls in love with the Italian teacher.<BR>Is it merely a physical attraction?  We do not even see that evolve.  We saw her only a few times interacting with the members of her class, so, how does she affect them so deeply.<BR>There is no emotional substance in this film.<BR>  There are so many gaps in this storyline and that in combintation with the generally poor acting makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Save your money and better  yet your time and go see another movie.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Thanks again Agi for the great review.But I'll have to wait till I save up to get this one. Its pretty expensive, so much so when I saw the price it made me choke and I spat me porridge all over the monitor.I'll leave that for me mum to clean up. But I'm looking forward to getting this one, and when I do I'll update the rating, but after reading the Agitated ones review I'm sure its going to be 5 stars.........Well Agi's not quite right its not 5 star material but its very close. This is a lot better that the song remains the same. Though It shows its recording age by not being totally clear and the instruments are not too easy to pick out on the sound stage, but it's a fine effort and the music is top draw. I'm glad I splashed the cash on this,  but the my monitor has suffered with fine scratch marks where me mum cleaned the porridge off with a brillo pad. For music I give it 90% and recording 75%.
0345363132|5.0|Penman has written several exceptional historical fictions that are a delight to those interested in literature about the middle ages.  Of them all, this is the best.  She has done an exceptional job in bringing Richard III the life, as a real person with both strengths and weaknesses.  She makes her characters live in a full way, not two dimensional but in reality.  I highly recommend this to anyone who seeks more knowledge of the late Middle Ages in England.  It is a bit long, but well worth the time spent.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Essential is such a relative term, and there's no way Bruce could ever satisfy every fan's definition of the term as it applies to his work.  What I love about Bruce is his sense of irony.  Who else would include a bonus cd with many songs that so few of us had ever heard?  The spirit in which he included that bonus cd is really quintessentially Bruce, so I'm glad he did it.<br />As for my own disappointing omission?  <br />4 words:  <br />&quot;One soft infested summer . . . &quot;  <br />Maybe &quot;None But the Brave&quot; atones for it.  Whoever Bruce was singing to in Backstreets, he's making peace with in &quot;None But the Brave.&quot;  Beth knows.  Sentimentally, I'd have also liked to have seen &quot;Drive All Night&quot; from THE RIVER make it, too. And where's &quot;She's The One?&quot; And &quot;RAMROD?&quot; And . . . <br />I'm glad to read that so many other reviewers like &quot;Lift Me Up.&quot;  And I'm REALLY happy that Bruce had the guts to put &quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot; on this!  <br />Thanks for everything, Bruce.  Again!
B00005JM02|4.0|Finding Nemo is enjoyable.  Finding Nemo is a great family movie.  But, in the comparative scale of all things animated (computer-mated maybe a better term with Pixar's fare) Pixar's Nemo falls short in comparison with the likes of Lion King, Toy Story, and A Bug's Life.  It is great, yes, but not that great to be in a league above.<br />Pixar as a production studio is simply amazing with the streak of creativity they have maintained.  While Disney churns out retold classic after retold classic, Pixar comes up with truly original story-lines that puts the joy of creativity square back in animated tales.  The voices are dead-on matched up with the characters.  Ellen Degeneres as Dory the Blue and Yellow Tang Fish is apropos.  Albert Brooks as Marlin the Clownfish is equally engaging.  But perhaps the best performances are turned out by Barry Humphries as Bruce the Shark fighting his very nature by leading a non-fish eating club.  The most subtle turned performance though is William Defoe as Gill the salty old-timer and leader of the aquarium.  At first, you envision a Scar from the Lion King but then realize there is depths to the character as a sly wizened dark gravelly voice gives way to layer upon layer of tough love leadership.  It is truly an engaging performance.<br />The movie has many laughs and much drama but in the end fails to enchant as much as the other previously mentioned animations.  Look for the most entertaining moment in the movie though when a underwater mine is set-off.  The screen shows the explosion and then flashes to two sea-gulls bobbing innocently above on the sea's surface.  The inevitable bubbles rise.  One seagull looks accusingly to the other.  It is subtle, if you blink, you'll miss it.  The scene cuts away quickly, but you will find yourself howling in delayed laughter when the joke hits you.  True moment of artistic humorous genius, I'd say.<br />I'm not steering you clear of Finding Nemo, but comparatively you may find it falls short of the animated greats, in my humble opinion.t of the animated greats, in my humble opinion.
B000002897|4.0|The best way to describe this album is 90's hippy/alternative rock. I liked it a lot. The songs seem like they arent really hard but playful i dont know how to explain but you have to find out. if you buy nirvana or PJ just get this album its a good one. Ive only heard of this band and i got it and it was great. Although i wasnt really impressed with mark lanegan's voice. thats why some of the songs which were mar haevy like 'dollar bill' or 'winter song' werent the greatest
B0000AQS0F|4.0|If your a FireFly fan buy it now. The shows are great, good sound, widescreen (Fox never showed'm that way) and lots of the plot arc of makes sense (since Fox showed them out of order so things were very strange). The only complaint is the quality of the DVD Menus and such. The graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. Not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows. <br />The missing espisodes explain alot too - why Irna was leaving at the begining of 'Objects in Space' (my fav) and more of Mal and Zoe's history. Plus of course you get to see a real live alien (or is it.....) <br />Enjoy
B000002H97|3.0|I remember when i first got into and justice for all... i liked it because it was so complex and well structured and timed you can tell how hard the band had to work. The black album if your getting it is a lot more simpler with a lot more groove orientation. A lot of people who have been metallica fans say this album sells out because it sounds like every other band that wass out at the time, it sounded like more of a sound garden album rather than a metal one. This is true to some extent. James' voice fits with this record i think this is the best his voice is going to get i actually noticed it in this album. seriousely ride the lightning and master of puppets you tend to forget they had a singer. I really didnt like the drums in the album just because to me lars is better at drumming when hes fast and just all out hes not an alternative drummer. Kirks solos were different. they were great dont get me wrong but for some reason i just liked them on the previous albums better. If you just started out a metallica fan i suggest you get ride the lightning or master of puppets before you get this
B0000X2EOW|5.0|Cant wait for this edition to come out... I have loved this movie ever since I was a little kid...  Its a great story how friendship and believing can help you out and conquer even the darkest of the things...  The extras look awesome esp. the added drawing by Brian Froud he is my fave faerie artist
B000084T18|1.0|When my friend let me borrow this i was like oh cool  eveyone i know seems to love this so much i should too. When i first started listinig i thought it was ok but then i got to P.I.M.P that is possibly the worst song of all time especially since most of the kids i know sing so horribbly i thought maybe the actuall song was better. ITS NOT. what made it worse was some of those kids decided that it was there new theme song. WHY. I did figure out how it got so bad, it was produced by emeinem. <br />If you like rap listen to DMX or Bone Thugs N Harmoney
B00009W0WM|5.0|No matter how many times you've seen Casablanca, I guarantee that you will see things you never realized were there in this disc. I just finished watching it on a high-definition monitor, and it is simply the best restoration of an old B&amp;W film I've seen.  Even better than the recent digital restoration of Citizen Kane. There is absolutely no grain, no dirt and a wealth of vibrant detail that hasn't been seen since the original release prints were in theaters 60 years ago (and maybe not even then.)<br />Yes, the extras are nice, especially the Roger Ebert commmentary track, but this disc would by worth buying without them just for the superb picture.  It's like seeing this wonderful classic for the first time again.
B00005JLWN|5.0|It's a shame this movie wasn't advertised better. I only saw it because the movie I originally intended to go watch was sold out. The fighting scenes are some of the best I've seen without becoming overly unreal. Christian Bale's performance is intense and brilliant; his character radiating an aura of deadliness. It probably wouldn't be fair to compare Equilibrium to The Matrix, but I'll compare leading actors: Christian Bale is a delight to watch compared to Keanu Reeves. When I watch Keanu's performance in Matrix I can't help but feel I'm watching a male model (with all the associated connotations) given the power of god and told to go save us all. Keanu looks cool, but the guy is one-dimensional as an actor.
0973275324|5.0|I have read 3 of Robin Sharma's books during a particularly trying year and all three have given me confidence and helped me organize my energies to become more positive and successful in my personal, professional and spiritual life. The book gets a bit preachy &amp; hokey at times, but the message is real and easy to apply to life. I reread chapters over &amp; over if I am having a bad day or I want to focus my energy on a goal I want to achieve. I have given this book as gifts to many friends who are at crossroads in their lives, and all have thanked me. A great gift for anyone. I highly recommend it
B0000DZEA1|3.0|There's just no other way to put it: This soundtrack is a disappointment. The Two Towers soundtrack was, in my opinion, a piece of musical genius, especially with the Rohan themes and variations thereon. Much is also true with the Fellowship theme on the first soundtrack. There are a few good tracks here, but nothing absolutely magnificient and tantalizing. And the end track by Annie Lennox was just plain crap. We have Enya on the first soundtrack, who is very involved with Tolkien and fantasy literature; thusly, her music well entraps that feeling. Much was also true with Emiliana Torrini, by whose voice, which sounds like Bjork's, Tolkien's world is captured and well-executed. Into The West just sucks. It sounds like a bloody pop single, and I'm sorry, but there's just no excuse for that. Pop belongs on teen movie soundtracks, NOT the most ambitious movie ever produced. Likewise, it is a disappointment to my high expectations. The movies themselves get progressively better, and, at the end of the Two Towers soundtrack, it would seem the music does as well. Then Return of the King came out, and while the movie was better, the soundtrack was just a letdown. In conclusion, if you're looking for a really amazing soundtrack, don't waste your money on this.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I am going to keep this short.  This CD rocks.  It is nice look back at an often under-apreciated Beatles album.
0066620996|5.0|I am highly recommending this book, along with two others, to all of my students and clients.<br />Jim Collins' research is of extraordinary value. Every executive should read this book.<br />The others two books I am recommending are &quot;Strategic Organizational Change&quot; by Beitler, and &quot;Primal Leadership&quot; by Goleman, et al.<br />Read all three!<br />Dr. Burke
B000002KE2|5.0|First of all, I LOVE this album!  For me, it is the best of B.S.'s albums that I have heard (i.e., the first five).  The music is (for the most part), nice and heavy, hard-rocking, and the singing and playing is polished, professional, and totally \\"tight\\" and together.  The songs are all very good, too.  <br />Most of the songs (with the exceptions of \\"Changes\\", \\"FX\\", and \\"Laguna Sunrise\\") are pretty heavy and hard-rocking.  I'd say that the overall sound of this album is similar to \\"Master of Reality\\", which I also like very much.  However, I wouldn't call songs like \\"Snowblind\\" and \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" peaceful :) <br />I don't mean to pick on the other reviewer's choice of words, or his English; however, I don't want anyone to have any misconceptions about this album, since it is, in my view, packed with superior, rocking metal :)  However, the several \\"soft\\" songs are also very nice.  \\"Changes\\" and \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" are both very pleasant, peaceful songs; the latter, in particular, is rather beautiful and soothing.  <br />I highly recommend this album/cd, and enthusiastically give it 5 stars!
B000059GEH|5.0|This is a magnificent movie. It is artful, filled with humor and it's just good clean fun. It is an excellent choice for parents who have girls--like mine--who idealize Marylin Monroe. I can let my 5 and 8 year old watch this classic without any qualms. Betty Grable is fabulous as is Laurne Bacall. The dialogue in the movie is worthy of being memorized. If you like old classics, you'll love this movie. We sure do.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A few thousand years ago the great Latin poet Horace strung these words together in a valiant attempt to describe the scene of a young woman weaving flowers into her hair in a sea cave. Horace's poem is a record of the inherent, transient beauty in the world. The literal translation of simplex munditiis means beauty that is simple in its elegance. Debut albums rarely achieve such a timeless, breathtaking quality, but Norah Jones' new album is worthy of Horace's epithet. This is not a simple album, but one that is as naturally sublime as the subject of a Horace poem. <br />Blue Note has just released Jones' first album, Come Away with Me, which would make it easy to file her away under jazz. But that would only be half of the story. Jones defies easy classification. Though only 22, she has created a complete, original style that straddles multiple musical genres. <br />Back to the jazz half. Her voice often has a sparse, vulnerable quality in the tradition of Billie Holiday, where an impressive vocal range is sacrificed for tighter, more profound dalliances on a smaller scale. Underneath the timid beauty though is a glimpse of power as raw and romantic as Etta James' &quot;At Last&quot;. Jones has digested a healthy dose of the great female jazz vocalists, but if musical influences were colors she would be swathed in a magnificent multi-colored frock. She can take songs from a multitude of different genres and rub enough jazz on their edges to conjure the genie of Nina Simone. Jones is a younger musical sibling of Simone, but enough of her own woman as well. Both women peel back the edges of jazz music to reveal the medium's vast depth and the infinite possibilities found there. Jones' can hear enough jazz in Dylan's &quot;I'll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot; to interpret it and make it her own as brilliantly as Simone did with &quot;Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues&quot; so many decades ago. <br />Jones' version of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; makes it seem like Hank Williamswrote the song over a few carafes of red wine in a smoky corner of the Five Spot. Her unabashed emotional honesty on this song is as close to the essence of Williams as a ride in the limo where he died at 29 on a cold New Year's Eve. The steel-stringed clunk and twang of Williams' rhythm guitar is transformed into a majestic bass line that anchors the other musicians as they take off on Texas-tinged jazz journeys of their own. Jones, who grew up in Dallas, frequently credits her mother's record collection for her eclectic tastes because it exposed her to musicians as diverse as Ray Charles and Willie Nelson (who she recently opened for and sang a duet with). <br />Jones' own compositions, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; and &quot;Nightingale&quot;, are concrete evidence that she is quite familiar with the work of Carole King. King is as much a part of the piano and songwriting, and even singing, of Ms. Jones than any of the jazz singers to whom she may be compared. Both women can write songs that feel as open as they are independent . <br />At a recent concert at the Fez in New York City, Jones came out on stage, smiled nervously at the audience, and immediately started in on the piano. There was only time for a second or two of introductory applause. A few notes came out of the piano and then her voice, like a breeze in August, blew through the room. Our conversations stopped in mid-sentence and we hung transfixed for the next hour. The proverbial pin could have been dropped. We were grounded only when Jones, who comes across as being unaware of her immense talent, paused to introduce a song written by one of her bandmates or to refer to herself as a dork. <br />Jones' band, which at Fez consisted of Adam Levy on acoustic and electric guitar and Lee Alexander on upright bass, work excellently off one another. Their music has enough jazz in it to allow Levy to make a few improvised solo runs on guitar and for Alexander to prove that he is capable of much more than providing a solid backing beat. This is also true of their work on her album, as well as that of Jesse Harris who contributed a number of songs to Come Away with Me. It is a testament to the promise of Jones' music that guitar legend Bill Frisell stopped by her first recording session to play on a track. Perhaps even stronger testament to Jones' merit as an artist, she was produced by Arif Mardin, who can list Aretha Franklin, the Modern Jazz Quartet, and John Prine on his resume. <br />Norah Jones and her band create music that is refreshing. It is as exciting as the lights of a city skyline on a Saturday night. As introspective as a letter written by candlelight at 2 a.m. And as soothing as a deep massage. It would be hard to a lick a label and stamp it on Norah Jones' music. She has an understanding of the very essence of music, as if she had on X-ray goggles that allowed her to see its bare bones. The music is unique enough to stand on its own, without need for a genre label, and for that reason it feels fresh. If you'd like to hear an artist that's just begun to hit her stride, then come away with her.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Something's Gotta Give was a sheer delightful fantasy. What a trip and about time. Just because a female is over the hill doesn't mean it's time to put her out to pasture. All the actors were wonderful and the story line as well. We're not talking Dr. Zhivago, folks, this is a comedy! Waiting now for Something's Gotta Give II.  Frances McDormand needs a man as well, and SINCE there was one left over...why not? On second thought, how about just sending ME the leftovers.
B000002C1V|5.0|what is there to say about this album? Its completely different that any other Floyd record and is the most untogether album they ever did. But that doesnt matter because the songwriting and heartfelt vocals by Waters make this the most personal and effective album they did. Of course everybody likes the Wall better and it had alot of hits and you hear Comfortably Numb and Hey you and Another Brick and Run like hell on the radio every day for the past 20 years but I have to say that id rather hear some stuff off of the final cut any day before Wall songs. Im not going to go through a list of the songs because each one is great in its own way and this is one of those albums that you have to listen to the whole thing and not just select songs. Its definately one of my favorite albums of all time.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I'm talking to you honestly.<br />I've been listening to Soundtracks and Instrumental compositions for 7 years now.<BR>And I can tell you The Last Samurai is the best piece I never heard before.<br />No compostions are ruining this CD.<BR>Every compositions have depth, you can feel and see the feelings in each piece.<br />wow absolutely wonderful!<BR>A sincere congratulation to hans Zimmer again<BR>One of my favorite composers of all time.<BR>I wish I could do what he's doing!<BR>God Bless you Mr.Zimmer<br />I recommend this Score to everyone who likes instrumental pieces and Hans Zimmer's compositions.<BR>Don't miss it... go get it!<br />Have a nice day!<BR>JD Free Soul
B000002J03|3.0|Most of this album was recorded kind of quickly on the road in between gigs in 1969 and i think they kind of rushed it. heres the tracks and my opinion<BR>WHOLE LOTTA LOVE- a classic song unlike anything they ever did and will always be great<BR>WHAT IS AND WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE- one of the best songs they ever did and also has one of the best guitar solos<BR>THE LEMON SONG- this is basically a remake of the song \\"KILLING FLOOR\\" with a different title. its good but not great<BR>THANK YOU- their first ballad and a real nice vocal, great song<BR>HEARTBREAKER- a classic zep riff but much better live<BR>LIVIN LOVIN MAID-unfortunately whenever they play Heartbreaker on the radio you have to sit through this. Jimmy page said its one of their worst songs and I have to agree<BR>RAMBLE ON- an ok song but very overplayed<BR>MOBY DICK-starts off great but the drum solo is kinda boring and everyone knows it but doesnt want to admit it<BR>BRING IT ON HOME- one of the better songs on here with a great riff<BR>so i guess overall i do like this album, even a weak Zeppelin album is still better than most bands great albums, but the next 3 Zeppelin albums are way better than Led Zeppelin 2
B00005JLEU|3.0|This movie drags on with very few moments to keep you interested.  I think it is cultural differences, though Japanese animation is truely inferior to Disney classics.  However I give it three stars because the director seemed to put his heart into it and tried to be as original as possible.  The sad thing is, with all its originality it hardly entertained me or moved me.
B0000TAZBK|3.0|This set contains all three wonderful albums, but that's it.  If you divide the price by three, you'll see that you'll end up paying MORE than if you were to buy them individually. Ripoff.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was always a fan of Christina Aguilera but I must say that it was this album that solidified Xtina's spot in my extensive music collection. A lot of people had preconceived notions about this album following the release of the single 'Dirrty', which was a shame because the rest of the Cd is both inspiring and incredibly personal. Christina shows off her vocals in each song and explores a variety of music styles (rock and roll in Make Over, gospel in Soar and Singing my Song, Latin vibe in Infatuation and of course her signature ballad in Beautiful) and manages to shine in every single song. My favorite songs include: Can't hold us down, Walk away, Cruz and Impossible (f. Alicia Keys). If you liked Christina's style before, this album may surprise you and it may take a bit to get used to. However if you decide to buy the Cd - you will not be disappointed as 'Stripped' is easily one of the best albums of 2003.
0061015725|2.0|The Premise of this book is very tempting, When we move into new technology (Nanotechnology) we believe that we are in total control of these developing technologies and that nothing can go wrong. Yet many times some thing does, some time with a disastrous outcome.<br />With this book how ever Mr. Crichton goes to great pains to make sure that even the simplest reader will easily be able to predict the ending. He does this so often that it becomes obvious that there is a suprise ending comming straight out of left field.<br />It seams that Mr. Crichton was rushed on this book and just wanted to get it done.
0676973779|2.0|After seeing all the hype surrounding this book and reading nothing but good reviews, I had to buy the book to find out for myself. And after putting so much expectation on the book, I began to read. While I was reading I realized, it wasn't that great!<BR>Sure, it has it's good parts. But I found myself dragging through to the end- when I usually finish a book in a few days, this took a few weeks. It's a bit unexplained at times and it trails off at parts. I just wasn't as impressed as the rest of the world. I think I just had too many expectations. But, to each his own!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A perfect circle is back with a whole new twist.  If you thought this was going to be anything like Mer De Noms, you are mistaken.  This whole cd is much more layered and darker than mer de noms.  Its not as heavy though, not saying mer de noms is really all that heavy but this one isnt.    Maynards vocals are absolutley angelic, he really is great.   The music is very atmospheric, creating a real mood for each song.  Buy this cd, its great, go see A Perfect Circle live and support a great band.  In times like these where 9/10 of the stuff on radio is crap, atleast there is one band out there that are really creating real music, and that band is A Perfect Circle.<BR>Best Songs on this Cd are : Blue, Gravity, Weak and Powerless, and The Noose.
B0000931OG|5.0|After owning this album for about eight months, I randomly came across the hidden track stowed away on this album.  If you begin rewinding the CD just as 'Ambulance,' the first rack, plays, and go back 6:50 you'll find a rather strange track apparently known as 'Me White Noise.'  It's a sort of strange electronic track that features Phil Edwards, who also narrated the title track of 'Parklife.'  It's not really top drawer material and doesn't belong on the proper album, but it is quite a bit of fun and serves as an instant B-side.<br />  As far as the album itself, I initially had a bit of trepidation as Graham Coxon, Blur's phenomenal ex-guitarist, left the band shortly after recording began.  While his avant-garde guitar tones are indeed missed (except for 'Battery In Your Leg,' which does feature some totally eerie guitar from Mr. Coxon), Blur has still managed to put out their best album ever.  There isn't a bum track on here and there are multiple highlights which basically include the first six tracks, 'Sweet Song,' and the already mentioned 'Battery In Your Leg.'  Damon Albarn, the band's now sole creative master, has learned much from his stint with Gorillaz and Mali Music, and has crafted a wonderful album.  While 'Blur' and '13' included heaps of experimentation, it all comes to fruition on 'Think Tank.'  The best analogy I can think of is late 70's Bowie.  'Think Tank' creates many new combinations of sound with electronica, North African music, and Brit-pop meshing in a very coherent and catchy way.<br />  I do not hesitate in calling this the best rock album of the year and I would suggest running and buying it now.  While all signs point to Blur's creative downfall with 'Think Tank,' they've instead managed to create their greatest masterpiece.
B0000009RX|3.0|This was my first Zappa album growing up. It is still one of my favorites, and should be 5 stars. I took 2 stars away because of the way they just chop the ends of the songs off. I played the hell out of this album and know all the little snorts and pootz by heart, and they are missing. Its not just this album either, it seems to be all the old Mothers stuff is like this. If they were to fix this situation, I would trash my current copies, in favor of the &quot;restored&quot; copies. If you are new to Zappa, this is a great album, but its sound properties need to be reworked. You would be better off with a good vinyl copy though.
B00000I07Q|5.0|Solid. Pure Gold. DIAMOND certification, and as precious as a ruby. No other band but Van Halen could match such talents (as far as musicianship, attitude, and songwriting skills go) to make such a priceless album. Although, only one track lightly displeases me (Love For Sale, which isn't all that bad when it comes to Jon's vocals), and I understand why 'Ride Cowboy Ride' is on there (to boost and introduce 'Stick To Your Guns'). Here's my personal and specific rating for every track:<br />1. Lay Your Hands On Me - ****, One of the most memorable rock beats and lyrics of late and of old.<br />2. Bad Medicine - *****, Simply the second best song in music history, only second to a track off of Bon Jovi's first album.<br />3. Born To Be My Baby - ****, one of the better tracks in Bon Jovi's history, to say the least, considering David's <BR>keyboard-playing<br />4. Living In Sin - ****, Definatly one of the best rock choruses of all time<br />5. Blood On Blood - *****, Clearly a rock classic about childhood and early adulthood<br />6. Homebound Train - ****, Truly shows just how talented these musicians are, especially Ritchie with the opening and continuing riff<br />7. Wild Is The Wind - ****, A great, powerful & wistful power ballad that with be stuck in your head for weeks (and that's a good thing)<br />8. Ride Comboy Ride - (explained in top part of review)<br />9. Stick To Your Guns - ****, a spectactular acousic-electric collaboration, not to mention Jon's excellent vocals<br />10. I'll Be There For You - *****, quite possibly the greatest rock ballad known to man, including the distinctive acoustic guitar intro and outros<br />11. 99 In The Shade - ***, a great intro, but when the beat changes from a supposed 3/4 rhythm to 4/4 rhythm, and Jon comes in...well, you get the point.<br />12. Love For Sale - (explained in top part of review)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|WICKED is one of the most throughly satisfying cast recordings I have heard in a while! Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are both fabulous, and I'm so happy that Stephen Schwartz is back on Broadway. My favorite songs from the score are \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\", \\"One Short Day\\" and, of course, \\"Popular\\", the most humorous song in the score. No surprise that this musical is currently the second-highest grossing musical on Broadway. I cannot compete with reviewer Toniann Scime's eloquent sentiments, but I can say that the WICKED CD is wicked good!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This was the 1st album I ever bought from Van Halen, and it still remains one of the rock/metal statements ever to be heard, to this day. There's no bad track, or track you'd ever want to skip. This album has so many of their most memorable recordings, including &quot;On Fire&quot;, their first song ever recorded, and is jam-packed with greatest hits. Runnin' With The Devil, Jamie's Cryin', Atomic Punk, Little Dreamer---I love 'em all. Definately worth its weight in gold, all the way.
B000092ZYX|1.0|OK Computer, The Bends, and Kid A were good.  This one, not so good.  Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.  I have ears and everything.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|I saw this show on Broadway shortly after its opening in November. The considerably talented cast, direction, and special effects were ruined by a weak score and a terrible book. The show basically had everything going for itself except the show itself. Stephen Schwartz's score is so boring, chuck full of power ballads that &quot;sound pretty&quot; and subsequently bored the HELL out of me. During intermission, I said to a friend &quot;If there is ONE MORE POWER BALLAD I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF.&quot; The book writer couldn't come up with any original jokes so she just made lame references to the movie. One or two would have been cute but since they were made consistenly throuought the show, it just made me hate it even more. Kristen Chenoweth was hysterically funny, however, and stole the show with her hilarious antics. Everyone else in the show was also wonderful. But the plan fact is, the show was terribly written.  I hated this play. Hated hated hated hated hated this play. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it. I hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated hated this play. If you go see this and you hate it, don't say I didn't warn you.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is impossible to describe in only 1,000 words. Iron Maiden is back, and this proves it.<br />My friend said this was only alternative rock, not really metal. It's obvious he didn't actually LISTEN to the music.<br />The lyrics are once again amazing. Brave New World is connected to the novel by the same name, if you've read it you should recognize the connection pretty quickly. But unlike most musicians today, Maiden continues to deliver with depth while still kicking ass.
B000089RVX|5.0|A wonderful 'debut' CD. Shows off the talent of Amy Lee's haunting voice. Also besides the vocal, the background is almost erratic, but flows together well- from loud rock with percussion and guitars to almost lyrical with a solo piano.<BR>The only bit of criticism on this CD is that her voice keeps the same quality and uses the same notes on every song on the whole CD. <br />1-Going Under: a bit overplayed- good song though.<BR>2-Bring Me To Life: again overplayed, even mopre so then the first song. But still a very good song.<BR>3-Everybody's Fool: This one went on and off whether or not I liked it or not so many tiems I can't keep track. Insightful lyrics- quite a few people that I know really like to sing along with this song.<BR>4-My Immortal: wonderful lyrics, full of emotion- this song really shows off Amy Lee's voice.<BR>5-Haunted: Probably my favorite song on the CD (though I love them all). Very 'haunting', good vocals and beat. Lyrics aren't too memorable, but the sing as a whole is. Also I love the bass- I turn up the volume in my car and the whole thing shakes and shudders... its fun ^-^<BR>6-My Tourniquet: A good song- not quite certain all the time what she is referring to with the lyrics... the first verse or so sticks in my mind.<BR>7-Imaginary: an amazing combination of hard beats with a lyrical tone- one of the best contrasting songs on the CD.<BR>8-Taking Over Me: Good song, bit more rockish then the one before- starts off slow though. Good quality.<BR>9-Hello: very, very pretty. very depressing too- beautiful.<BR>&quot;Has no one told you she's not breathing/Hello/I am your mind, giving you someone to talk to/Hello...&quot; <BR>10-My Last Breath: a faster song on the CD, the chorus sticks in my head. Sounds sort of tech-ish.<BR>11-Whisper: a good final to this CD, I especially like the ending (chanted Latin phrases)<br />Overall, definitley worth buying- heck, even my parents like it (which is sort of scary.... oh well)
B0000844I8|4.0|I've never seen the TV series that this movie spawned; this is a review of the movie on its own terms.<br />This movie is _so_ close to being great that it's frustrating not to be able to award it five stars. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin had a terrific idea here and _almost_ sustained it for the length of a feature film.<br />The essential idea owes a lot to Robert A. Heinlein's _Tunnel in the Sky_ (and some of the plot details show debts to other Heinlein works as well). There's this stargate, see . . .<br />Well, that's enough about the plot, just in case you haven't seen it yet. For SF geeks like me, the first hour and a half is like a wet-dream come true. The ending doesn't exactly fall apart or anything, it's just that it doesn't manage to remain at the high level of the first two-thirds of the movie.<br />As Col. Jack O'Neil, Kurt Russell is terrific as usual (and I happen to think he deserves far more credit as an actor than he's generally gotten). James Spader is a bit hammy but generally credible as Daniel Jackson, the absent-minded academic-outcast astro-Egyptologist dweeb. In lesser hands these two characters could have devolved into cliches, but these actors manage to keep them alive. Of course there's also Jaye Davidson, the special secret surprise from _The Crying Game_, here used very effectively in a role I can't say anything about without spoiling the plot.<br />David Arnold's soaring score is just awesome. You'll want to plug your DVD player into your sound system for this one (if you don't have it there already).<br />And the plot is intellectually engaging for at least most of the way through. The, um, foreign culture in question is nicely evoked and fleshed out, with a few cinematic nods to everything from _Dune_ to Indiana Jones to _The Man Who Would Be King_, and without too many of the oversimplifications that always threaten films of this sort.<br />I have no idea at all how well the TV series has done in sustaining this stuff. But the movie stands quite well on its own.<br />The _Ultimate_ DVD set includes both a 'director's cut' and the original theaterical-release version -- plus some nice commentaries and interviews. The interviewees include (who else?) Erich von Daniken, whose _Chariots of the Gods?_ was part of the popular literature of my youth. If you've even heard of him, you'll probably like this movie.vie stands quite well on its own.<br />The _Ultimate_ DVD set includes both a 'director's cut' and the original theaterical-release version -- plus some nice commentaries and interviews.

078322933X|4.0|This film is along the lines of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; about an obsessed boyfriend that wont let the girl of his dreams out of his life. But when her father tells him to stay away from her, he becomes crazy and violent as he destroys anything that stands between him and his girl. A great psychological thriller!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I am listening to The Beatles LetIt Be... Naked as i speak on the vh1classic listening party. I never heard the original album so I'm reviewing this from a different perspective than other reviewers. Ofcourse I've heard the hit songs before(title track, Get Back, The Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe). I'd heard the song Two of Us once when my local classic rock station used to have a program called the album side at 7. I'm giving this album 4 stars because I love the Beatles, but to tell the truth this album is pretty dull compared to others. When you think about it these songs were just leftovers.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Is that you should avoid this film as if it was crawling with Ebola.  It's utter nonsense, with hardly a cranial cavity on its' shoulders, much less a brain.  The acting is so wooden I have half a mind to use it to make furniture.  The plot doesn't make a lick of sense (something about a wicked corporation that runs the world and makes a new, deadly man-made virus, for no apparent reason), and the action sequences are utter trash, with no sense of urgency for the characters, because we don't care about them anyway.  &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is crap on celluloid.  Avoid as such.
B000002UAO|4.0|This is a quality Beatles CD.  It is clearly one of their top five recordings to buy.  Michelle, Girl, Think For Yourself, Norwegian Wood, and Run For Your Life are all stand out tunes.  I personally prefer the White Album, Abbey Road, and Help before this.  But nonetheless, I say its high quality all the way.<br />Let me make a few comments about the Agitated Reviewers clearly miguided review.  The Beatles came well before Oasis. So how could the Beatles have ripped off Oasis?  This Agitated Reviewer needs to think twice before he reviews once as he only annoys his audience.<br />Furthermore, whereas I do not like Led Zeppelin, I can note their influence on a generation of music fans.  It is now twenty five years after their last recording and they are much more remembered than Duran Duran will ever be.  Duran Duran is clearly a one trick pony band that has a limited audience and vision.<br />I am all for expressing one's opinion even if it differs from the masses.  However, one must do their homework before writing inaccurate testimony comparing the Beatles vs Oasis as well as Led Zeppelin vs Duran Duran.  Why compare Zeppelin and Duran.  The styles differ wildly.
B00005JMCW|5.0|FREAKY FRIDAY is the finest, funniest feature film I've ever seen! Jamie Lee Curtis is hysterical and Lindsay Lohan is remarkable as well! They are a great match. It is hilarious and fun for the whole family. It's a movie you can watch again and again.
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 seems to be a fine blend of many musical styles.  The lead off track Harder To Breathe is a crunchy New Wave Rocker with powerful guitar licks and strong vocals.  Not Comming Home is another rocker. Howeer the wah wah guitar licks take on a funkier tone and the stylings somehow are reminiscent of the modern boy bands particularly the Back Street Boys.<br />Other tracks have more of an Rhythm and Blues feel.  The Sun seems to ofer a compelling organ track which is somewhat reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's mid seventies work. Sunday Morning seems to combine the Rhythm and Blues vocals with some fine piano jazz chops. There are some intriguing ballads as well.<br />If you like a variety of musical styles, Maroon 5's Songs About Jane is a good addition for your music collection.  Good songs, instrumental embelleshments, and vocals complete the package.
079284131X|4.0|This was a great horror film.Chucky is up there with all the cool horror villons like Michel Myers,Terminator, Jason,Leatherface, and freddy. The movie about a crook who gets shot but puts his soul into a &quot;Good Guy&quot; doll so he can get his revenge on the people who killed him. I know that sounds really really bad but it's<BR>much better than it sounds. The movie has a slow beging but gets really good. Like all horror flims it had three sequels and the<BR>first one is still the best. This movie is really cool and if you like getting scared you will love this, it's great.
B000002HHB|4.0|Tigerlily is a bittersweet progression. I miss the Natalie era Maniacs. I miss the way they could meld exuberance and significance so seamlessly that their music spoke not only to your heart, but to your mind--a part of me wishes she had never left the band.<br />But listening to this album, I also understand why Natalie had to leave the Maniacs. She had outgrown them, and in this album, she ventures into layers of maturity that the Maniacs never explored. Her music becomes darker, subtler and more personal. Had she stayed with the Maniacs, it is unlikely she could have dragged the band into this kind of territory. It would have been against their natures. After listening to this album, one can sense what Natalie meant when she complained about the constraints of music making by committee.<br />In Tigerlily, Natalie begins the exploration of the dark places of the soul that she would take so much further in her next album, Ophelia. In so doing, she alienates much of the fan base that followed her from her Maniacs days.<br />This is music for pensive folks. It doesn't spare the listener any of life's woes. Those expecting more of the upbeat tempos and youthful enthusiasm of the Maniacs will be disappointed. These are songs about the wiles of catastrophe, the death of loved ones, spiritual drift, unrequited love, jealousy, and the disintegration of a marriage. Dark? Yes. Sombre? Very. But also moving, heartfelt and sympathetic.<br />And, above all, talented. Natalie's voice is rich and vibrant, her song-craft first class, and her musicianship exemplary. Does she skirt excessive sentimentality? Of course she does. Show me a worthy songwriter over the years who hasn't. Such risks are inherent in the kind of emotional territory she wishes to explore. But we absolve her of such excess because she reaches worthwhile destinations.<br />Fragile optimists should avoid this album. It is too apt to shatter brittle perspectives. Nor will it appeal to the cynical or the jaded. But those with a contemplative bent are well advised to buy it. This is an album with enough substance to sate even the most introspective appetites.
B0000844IT|4.0|Before I start let me say this has nothing to do with Evil Dead 2<BR>(this is Evil Dead 3 if you did not know). Anyway, this movie was<BR>great. I think this is Bruce Campbells best movie. If they remade this(with Bruce Campbell still as Ash)with better special<BR>effects it would be the best moment in movie history.This movie<BR>is a horror/comedy,like Scary Movie? No, this is nothing like scary movie becouse it makes up it's own comedy instead of taking<BR>sceanes from other movies. The plot is about Ash(Bruce Campbell)<BR>who get the book of the Dead and is sent back in time were he brings back an undead army. the only bad  thing is Ashes cach phares like &quot;Groovey&quot; this DVD is really good
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I reviewed this once already, but it's been buried somewhere in one of the earliest pages and I can't find it. <br />If we look at the rating it's a disappointing 3 1/2 stars. Yet, if you dig through the reviews, you'll find that most people love it and have given it 4 or 5 star ratings. There is large and vocal subgroup, however, that hates it and has given it just 1 star, bringing it's ranking down.<br />My personal opinion is that the album sounds great. Let it Be was never a completed album. It was abandoned and given to third-parties -- first, Engineer Glyn Johns, then to Phil Spector. The Beatles were barely involved in its production, and the end result was subpar. <br />Yes, the old album had its charms. The background dialogue was endearing and there was a rough, unpolished feel that lent it a uniqueness. Yet, in truth, it was an album that was largely not loved. For the most part, only serious Beatles fans could enjoy it, and for years, fans and the musical press belittled the album and always maintained that Spector's heavy production ruined the album.<br />This new version sounds excellent in comparison. \\"Across the Universe\\" is particurly exquisite. The addition of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is great as well. \\"I've Got a Feeling,\\" which is a new mix, sounds more lively, and \\"Let it Be,\\" \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" all sound excellent, although none of them is the revelation that \\"...Universe\\" is. <br />Most people who dislike this album seem to hate it solely b/c they view it as a McCartney vanity project. This belief is not only among amazon.com reviewers, but among some in the mainstream press as well. This is unfair, and, for the record, I'm a much bigger John Lennon fan than Paul McCartney fan. For one thing, \\"Let it Be\\", \\"...Naked\\" was not produced by Paul McCartney. It was his idea, but he left its production entirely up to the team of Allan Rouse, Paul Hicks, and Guy Massey. Paul and Ringo approved their version with no changes. <br />George also approved the project before his death, and it's often forgotten that after a flirtation with Spector's \\"wall of sound\\" production on his All Things Must Pass album, George lost interest in it, clinging to a much softer, stipped-down sound on his later albums. In fact, he wrote in the liner notes to his ATMP 2001 reissue that he had to resist the attempt to reproduce it -- redoing it in the same way that \\"Let it Be Naked\\" was done. <br />It's true that John couldn't have approved it, but the sad truth is that John can never be here to approve another Beatles project. If we were to halt all Beatles productions for the lack of John, we would not have the Anthologies, the 1 album, or any of the other post-1980 releases! We'll never know what he would have approved of. Would you rather the Beatles not do anything since John's death? Yoko has the right to speak for him, and she has approved the project, even being quoted as saying \\"Now this record is showing it how it was. The Beatles were incredible; they didn't need any help and I think this version especially shows that.\\" Besides, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" has been added, and \\"Across the Universe\\" shines in this new version.<br />Both version are on sale, so pick the one that you find to be the best musically, and ignore the Paul-bashers. If you're a newer fan, a casual fan, or someone who is not familiar with the LIB album, you'll probably prefer this one. It's polished, complete, and sounds coherent. If you're an older fan, or someone who's very familiar with the original, then you'll probably not appreciate this reissue as much. It's true that it's not \\"as the Beatles intended,\\" but neither was the original. Neither is \\"more valid\\" than the other -- they're simply two different takes on the same album, and the music-buying public now has two options instead of one. Is that so bad?
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie really, Really, ROCKED!!!!!! This one is WAY better<BR>than the sequels. This was Keanu Reeves best movie sence &quot;Speed&quot;.<BR>If you like Sci-fi movies,Kung-fu movie, or a movie with good acting then you should get this. It's is perfect wich is something you rarely see.There no DVD fetures but you won't care becouse the movie is so good.Not as good as Animatrix, Akira or Spawn but it's still perfect. If you liked any of the movies I sayed earlyer you'll love this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show!!! fox is stupid for letting this show go.  How well is this dvd selling?
B00004R99J|3.0|My two year old enjoys this movie and she could care less about history, political correctness, or the myriad of other issues a movie like this brings up when watched by adults.  When it came out in theaters, some time ago, my now teens went to see it and came back with the report that it was filled with spiritism and new age undertones, thus scoring for them, less than stellar marks.<br />Disney generally has great animation, and the visuals here are not bad at all and if that's enough, and you can stomach all the political messages hidden in the dialogue, then this movie is worth watching with the younger set.  It certainly isn't entertaining enough, in my opinion, to watch over and over and hardly scores as high as many of the other Disney movies.
6302054230|5.0|Well, the message behind Life Of Brian, to take a line from Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" extols people \\"don't follow leaders,\\" and blindly at that. This biblical send-up has sight gags, barbed and hilarious lines and situation, funny voices, which all flow like milk and honey here.<br />The setting is in Judea, AD 33, and Jesus is preaching his Sermon on the Mount, you know \\"Blessed are the cheesemakers\\" or was that \\"Blessed are the Greek\\"?  But there is quite a bit of disharmony going on in the back row.<br />My three favourite scenes have to be the stoning, the Roman grammar lesson and the scene where Brian (Graham Chapman) is first brought before Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin).  When one Matthias is sentenced to be stoned for committing blasphemy, saying \\"Jehovah,\\" the lynch-mob crowd mentality is demonstrated by an automatic launching of a stone at that word.  As the Jewish priest (John Cleese) says, \\"Now look, no one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle.  Do you understand?  Even, and I will make this perfectly clear, even if they do say Jehovah.\\"  Guess what happens?<br />The second scene:  After falling in with the People's Front of Judea, led by Reg (Cleese), Brian is instructed by them to write \\"Romans Go Home.\\"  He is caught (gasp!), but because this is Monty Python, he gets a grammar lesson from the centurion (Cleese) on duty, so remember, it is not \\"ROMANES EUNT DOMUS.E<br />And the third scene brings me out in giggles the same way as the Roman guards, not only because of Pilate's gay lisp, but because of his friend's name, which has the guards trying hard not to dissolve into laughter.  His friend's name?  First name is Biggus.<br />Another theme that's brought into light is the way a conquering people brings some benefits to its conquered, and Dr. Davies, my Western Civ. teacher, showed this part of the video to demonstrate it.  Reg (Cleese) rhetorically asks his PFJ cohorts what the Romans have done for the Jews?  To which they list the aqueduct, wine, irrigation, among other things, to which Reg reluctantly concedes.  The punchline is that the Romans to some extent, have brought peace to a previously unstable region.<br />Palin has the best roles as \\"Big Nose\\", an ex-leper, a crazed prisoner, and Pontius Pilate, and Cleese does great as a Roman centurion, Reg, and the ill-fated Jewish authority figure.<br />Eric Idle does best as a stuttering Roman guard, a vendor who teaches Brian how to haggle, and Stan, who wants to be a woman and be called Loretta.  BTW, Jesus is played by Kenneth Colley, who was Admiral Piett in both Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi.<br />This movie is ingenious, irreverent, cheeky, but not offensive or blasphemous.  The lines and jokes are at their barbed best per usual, but the jokes involving crucifixion are the boldest:<br />As I said, the main message is told by Brian to the people who blindly see him as the Messiah:  \\"You've got to think for yourselves.  You're all individuals.  You're all different.\\" And you'll enjoy this movie,... even if you do say Jehovah!list the aqueduct, wine, irrigation, among other things, to which Reg reluctantly concedes.

B00005JLYW|2.0|They should have stopped at one film, it would have been enough, but if people will go and see sequels, I guess, why not make them?  I'll say the same here as I did about the first film, it's a nothing better to do rental movie.  It isn't boring, but it's similar to the Austin Powers type movie, the spoofing goes over the top and gets a bit monotonous  and predictable.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Best photography, best directing, best music, best casting, great old cars, what an absolute great movie. The only objectionable thing is one short nude shot that didn't have to be put into the movie. The language could also have been toned down without causing any damage to the movie. Overall, \\"A\\". Loved it. Can't wait to see it again.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|\\"Some of you might die on this quest\\" says the John Lithgow character Lord Faraquaad of Duloc, \\"but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make\\".  There's plenty to love about this movie besides the great writing and wonderful banter between Donkey and Shrek, the animation is superb and the story has lots of under lying humor and subtly.<br />I've probably seen this about thirty times at least, because it's one of my two year olds favorites, and it's definitely a movie that appeals to young and old alike, the teens get into watching it too and even with multiple viewing it's never boring.  The dvd has some good extras including a great music video.<br />I'd highly recommend this to any as one of the greatest family movies ever, it's worth owning and watching over and over.
0613180771|4.0|Notice, most of the reviews that gave one star were Japanese.<BR>The reviewer, kent gives numerous reviews with one star, in order to lower the rating of this book.<BR>I think this was a very thoroughly researched and informative book. <BR>My main gripe with this book is a comlete lack of acknowledgment of the Armenian Genocide. It cites the German Holocaust and Stalin's to his own people. The Armenian Genocide and the Rape of Nanking have some similarities. The Turkish and the Japanese don't acknowledge what happened and changed their histories to put a better light on themselves.
B00005B36H|5.0|One of the main reasons I like this album, is that it's enjoyable on so many levels. If you don't feel like taking the time to read into all their songs, that's fine, they're all perfectly awesome regardless. However, if you decide to take the time to decipher the songs, you're in for an experience. Each of these choices are enjoyable in their own. I also really like how this album was able to stick with one main underlying theme, yet make their songs completely different. So, all in all, a great album.
0060012218|5.0|I found this book to be a very quick and good read. I really enjoyed the story, and how it was realistic. I particularlly like how not everyone lives happily every after. The story is a great story about finding yourself, and reaching out to others. It delt with the issues of peer pressure, and alienation, which as we can all remember was a major thing in High School. I was particularly moved by the side story of Brian Bund. While, I found it a little hard to believe what he does in the end, it is still a great side story.<br />If you like this book as much as I did I would also recomed Alex Sanchez's books Rainbow Boys and Rainbow High.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten...what an AWESOME album. Every song on this album is worth a listen, even if you're not a big fan of Pearl Jam. Ten is an album that comes from the heart, which is lacking from most of today's music. So, in short, I'm not gonna say anything that hasn't been said already, and just say that this is a supreme album.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I ordered this CD online from mymusic.com and I recieved it in the mail today. I can't believe I couldn't find it at the store!! I've listened to this whole CD already in one day, and I love it so much! Let me just tell you it's much better than One Heart. And even though it's French, I still enjoy it and somehow I love Céline more better in French than in English. I think she sounds better in French! Also even though this album is yet French, don't let that bother you, you will still enjoy it like I have enjoyed it. I reccomend everybody pick this CD up today before they run out! <br />P.S.<BR>My favorite songs are: Tout l'or des hommes, Le vol d'un ange, Apprends-moi, Je t'aime encore, and Reteins-moi. <BR>Also let me say that there is an English version of Je T'aime Encore on One Heart, but the French version is better!
B00004W5A6|5.0|I respectfully disagree with A Music Fan from Ellensburg, WA USA  - listening both on a friend's Marantz player, and my Esoteric transport / DAC combination, there are distinct differences between the CD release and the SACD on both systems.  The SACD provides a delicious sense of depth and dynamics, and 'air' on the live tracks, that is lacking on the Redbook release.  In addition, the shimmer of cymbals and the attack and release of SRVs guitar work (whether during ferocious or quiet work) is much more detailed and distinct on the SACD - the leading and trailing edges of notes are much easier to discern and follow.<br />In any case, you can't go wrong with this disc.  Highest recommendation!
B0000DZEA1|3.0|i haven't gotten the soundtrack but im looking for PIPPIN'S SONG  the one he sings to the king..and i can't find it  ;_;  so if you find it please email me at   moonieme@hotmail.com   thanks soo much...i love that song sooo much...just saw the movie today....me and my friend both cried.  lmls.   huggles snuggles and cuddles!  thanks
B00005JM02|4.0|This is such an excellent movie, no words!  Animation is the best ever.  Heartwarming story, with life lessons to be learned.  Characters are memorable and their lines catchy and unforgettable (mine mine mine haha).
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is one of the most amazing grunge cds.  Its for die-hard Nirvana fans, people who don't want to buy all of Nirvana's cds just to get these songs, and for people who want to be introduced to one of the 90s most brilliant and influential bands.  I love this cd, the songs are brilliant, and every listen to this cd makes me want the old grunge period to come back, with Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins and others putting out more brilliant cds.      Here are my favorite songs from this amazing cd.   The first few (excluding \\"You Know You're Right\\") are from Nirvana's earlier years.   1.) The first track, the unreleased \\"You Know You're Right\\" is dark and heavy, but is a great song.  2.) \\"About A Girl\\" is a great song from the earlier Nirvana years and has a definate Beatles influence.    3.) I didn't like \\"Been A Son\\" too much but yet it's better then most songs that a lot of bands are putting out now.  4.) The same goes for \\"Sliver\\", although most people love this song.   Here we move into classic \\"Nevermind\\" material in the next few tracks.  5.) \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is a definate classic teen anthem that most people know of when they think Nirvana.  It is a classic, definately not overrated.  6.) The same can be said for the slower \\"Come As You Are\\".   7.) \\"Lithium\\" is another one of my favorites - catchy and brilliant.  8.) The same can be said for \\"In Bloom\\".  9.) The same can also be said for the equally great \\"Heart Shaped Box\\".  10.)  I didn't like \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" very much but that doesnt mean its not good.  11.) \\"Rape Me\\" is a classic thought-provoking and melodic song.  12.) \\"Dumb\\" is a little different then most Nirvana songs but it is great and catchy too.   The next two songs are live.  13.) \\"All Apologies\\" is a great song, a classic.  14.) I haven't listened to the live cover of \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" by David Bowie enough to have formed an opinion on it.      Though it may or may not be an attempt to cash in, this is a brilliant album andi reccomend it to all.      My favorite tracks are \\"You Know You're Right\\", \\"About A Girl\\", \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", \\"Rape Me\\", \\"Dumb\\" and \\"All Apologies\\".
B000059ZLH|5.0|I was turned on by Dream Theater by a guy from my high school reunion.  Since then, I've been watching Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York EVERY single night and find myself getting hooked more and more - I start with the cut HOME (my fav) and then go from there.  The talent of these guys is truly amazing!  And get this -- my Mom who is in her 70s loved them too (I took this DVD to our Christmas party and everyone was mesmorized)! I've been a RUSH fan for years (as well as the STONES) and I must say that these guys are off the charts -- what I find amazing is how right on target their rhythms are and I adore how they go back and forth - from good and slow; hard with stops - to deliriously fast.  Just writing about them sends me.  If any of you love RUSH - check out these guys - I think you'll find much pleasure.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is turely one of the best cd's i have ever listened to. it is a little short, but the song;'s are amazing and the lyrics are unbelievable...buy this, u will not be disapointed. i listened to it ever day in my study hall and still listen to it and not sick of any of the songs
B0000DZ3EA|2.0|Being a Gabriel's fan for a long time, I agree that much of his early work is forgotten in this compilation. But Peter Gabriels's greatest song, a remarkable moment in his career, that highlighted an important scene of a great moive, Cameron Crowe's &quot;Say Anything&quot;, the amazing &quot;In You Eyes&quot; is, again &quot;left behind&quot; in this collection. In his first compilation, &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot;. the song was completely forgotten. Now they do it again. If you listen to any live Gabriel CD or watch any of his marvelous 2 DVD shows, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; is the last song played, the climax for the presentation. There's absolutely no excuse and I consider an offense to a fan who wants a remastered compilation or to someone who wants to know Peter's work better the absence of this song in the compilation and take 3 stars of my revie just for this reason.
B00005QCVY|2.0|I am extremely concerned about the populous in the United States.  Despite the acting and holiday cheer, this movie sucks.  Its feel good message is just a reminder of how white america can struggle through all of its problems and eventually end up with the beautiful wife and 2.5 kids behind a white picket fence with friendly neighboors.  It is particularly disgusting when Stewart explores his own non-existence to find his wife to be a pathetic librarian that has no life to fill without being married.  I am mentally repulsed at the &quot;father knows best&quot; themes that have permeated all of our psyche's  I say boycott this movie and start fighting the man that tries to shove it down with your throat.  Viva Anima!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was an amazing show.  Plain and simple.  It was given a horrible time slot (friday @ 8PM, no matter how good a show is, if i can, i'm going out on a friday, not watching TV) and was shown out of order.  No wonder people couldn't get into it.  Some station would be smart to call up Joss and ask to get this show up and running again.  Put it in the old Buffy time-slot, ain't nothin' good at that time now.
0345452577|5.0|Jonathan Kellerman never disappoints me. A stand-alone, but it was nice to take a break from Delaware. If you enjoy his reading style, you'll love this.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I've been listening to DT for the paste 10 years, and I have to say I think you can actually hear them grow and expand their style for every album.  This album just kicks a$$.  It's like Mirror and Lie for an entire album.  <br />I gave this one 4 starts because SFAM is still my fav, but I love how everytime these guys put out an album it seems like a new style.  Not compared to SFAM, it's 5 stars.  IMO &quot;In the Name of God&quot; is the best song on the album, featuring tones of wordly music as they make their statement.  <br />My only beef with this album is JP's soloing seems to lack the tastefulness he usually displays.  JP always blows me away, and sometimes I just want to hear more.  This album, there's just a little too much.<br />Overall, this album is great.  I never know what I'm gonna get from these in terms of style, and they have never disappointed me.  If you're one of those people who complain when a band has a wide range of styles, you'll probably not like the heaviness of this album.  If you like melodic metal that kicks a$$, you'll LOVE this album.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater's latest opus is another solid effort from progressive metal's titans, although it does not reach the level of their greatest works. One of the band's most admirable strengths is that, like Rush and the other truly great progressive bands, they have never been afraid to change:  a different sound is apparent on every album. With Scenes From A Memory, they tackled the concept album head-on and ended up with a masterpiece; with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, they fully-embraced both classic 70's progressive rock as well as newer edge music influences. With Train of Thought, they delve straight ahead into unabashed heavy metal.<br />This is apparent from the opening track, As I Am, which lashes out at the listener with a brutal metal riff, only to lead into a memorable melody and an anthemic chorus. This might be their best chance for a hit single since Pull Me Under; if so, it is well-deserved. This Dying Soul is where the album begins to get truly epic -- a lengthy piece with great solos and some keyboard interplay. These two songs are so ferocious that they are really almost simply straight-up heavy metal -- without the &quot;progressive&quot; label attached. Still, fans of the band's immense instrumental skill need not fear:  the band, always among the best musicians in rock, positively tears it up throughout the album, unleashing many mighty and impressive solos. Guitarist John Petrucci, who some have accused of holding back on the band's last few albums, in particular, is a monster here, unleashing solo after blistering solo. Singer James LaBrie is also in fine voice here:  his voice is surprisingly well-suited to metal, and he is soaring and beautiful when the song requires it.<br />Endless Sacrifice is where things change. A delicate acoustic intro leads into a story sea of mixed emotions -- a great piece of songwriting from the band. Here, finally, the keyboards come in at full force, and we have true progressive song on our hands. Petrucci also unleashes one of his best ever guitar solos here, thereby keeping the metal thread running through this suite. Honor Thy Father is another metallic effort, with some variety thrown in. It features some truly vitriolic lyrics from drummer Mike Portnoy as well as a monstrous metal intro. Vacant is another piece of welcomed variety. A slow mood piece, featuring lyrics from LaBrie, it shows the true beauty of his voice and how good he sounds on songs of this type -- something that is easy to forget, given the band he fronts. Stream of Consciousness is a standout on the album:  an amazing 12-minute instrumental that ranks among the best things the band has ever recorded, it eclipses even the masterful instrumentals on Scenes From A Memory. The entire thing is built on one mighty central riff, and all of the instrumentalists show off their skill on it, as it builds and builds to a wondrous crescendo that leads into the final track, In The Name of God. This is the album's masterpiece. One of the best songs the band has ever written, this is one of those pieces that slowly builds and builds -- in this case, until it reaches the central solo, which is, perhaps, the best the band has ever laid down on tape. Petrucci unleashes a blazing guitar solo that is among the best ever heard in progressive rock. An epic chorus assault then ensues and the song ends in a burst of classic keyboards. It is a fitting and forceful end to a grand effort. <br />With all of this rightly said, it must also be noted that this album is not perfect: it certainly is not a masterpiece along the lines of Scenes. For one thing, the band's lyrics here are below par. As I Am is a ringing declaration of independence and individuality, Endless Sacrifice is moving, and Honor Thy Father is an admirable chunk of vitriol, but This Dying Soul and In The Name of God seem forced. Also, there are some musical moments here -- in the two tracks for which Portnoy penned lyrics, This Dying Soul and Honor Thy Father,and just a tiny bit during In The Name of God -- which experiment with contemporary music to a detrimental degree. These faults aside, this is still a fine and admirable effort from Dream Theater, a band that, once again, has embarked upon a new musical path. In the end, it is not among their very best records, but it is a definite improvement upon the sometimes flat and lifeless Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. It is a must for fans of the band, although neophytes should start elsewhere.
B00004TDTO|5.0|In 1974, Steven Spielberg was basically an unknown director who had just directed his first motion picture, THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS. The movie came out on April 5th, 1974 and received glorious reviews but failed at the box-office, earning $7 million domestically. The producers of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS were disappointed at the box-office, but they knew that Steven Spielberg was a director to watch. Meanwhile, a script of the novel JAWS by Peter Benchley was being written and the producers of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS got an advance copy. Steven Spielberg, while visiting the producers at their offices, noticed the script of JAWS on their desk. Thinking that the script was about dental work, Spielberg was not interested, but brought the script with him. After reading the script, Steven Spielberg flipped out for it and called the producers to inform them that he was interested in directing the movie. The problem was that there was already another director attached to the project. So, Steven said that if the director would drop out, he would direct it. After the release of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, Steven got the call from the producers saying that he was hired to direct JAWS. The three male lead roles were handed out to Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Principal photography on JAWS began on May 2nd, 1974 at Martha's Vineyard. The cast and crew had many difficulties during the shooting, especially the budget, which was of $9 million at the beginning, but by the end of the shooting, it was of $12 million. Universal Pictures almost cut the production many times, but the shooting was fininshed by the end of the summer of 1974. The movie had it's first screening in March of 1975 and it was getting some big buzz. Many of the cast thought that the movie would fail commercially, but they were proven wrong when JAWS opened in June of 1975 and quickly becoming the highest-grossing movie of all-time by making $261,2 million domestically. JAWS was also the first movie to passthe $100 million mark. After JAWS was released, Steven Spielberg became the most popular director in Hollywood and started production on his next picture, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. In March of 1976, JAWS was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture. Though it did not win the Best Picture Award, it won three awards. Through the years, JAWS has stayed has one of the biggest success in movie history and proved itself to be an american movie classic. In 2000, JAWS was released on DVD with loads of extra features and became one of the most popular DVD's of all-time.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I've been a sarah fan going back to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and really love her music and have all her work.  On my first listen to Afterglow I was captivated by Fallen, but then the rest of the songs just didn't grab me.  And like some of the reviewers here I was very disappointed.  There aren't really any songs that jumped out and grabbed me like some of her past cds.  The songs here have more consistency and like others have said are a little polished and have this beautiful quality to them (some called it bland).  But for some reason despite this initial disappointment, I kept playing the album, over and over and over. And then I realized why I keep playing Afterglow, it is an album not a collection of songs.  Surfacing always struck me as some great songs, but it was really hard to listen to it as an album in one sitting without jumping around, or skipping songs, or repeating songs.  With Afterglow I have almost no desire to alter the flow of the songs, one to the next, but when the album is over I want to experience it again.  Fumbling has this quality too for me.  And then the songs started to come through and I realized Sarah and I are probably at similar life stages.  And then I checked and we are almost the same age.  Women in their mid-late 30's can really develop a great sense of self and wisdom, and be much more secure.  The passion is still there, the hurt, the lessons, the stupid mistakes we seem to repeat, but there can be a little less of the anger because we're finally seeing the patterns and growing through them. It's easy for an artist to channel passion through anger, but to channel passion through the afterglow of joy is much harder. Maybe I'm reading too much in here, but the more I listen to this album the more it really talks to my soul and echos all the things I too have figured out over the last 6 years. The lyrics are strong Sarah, but the music is more sublime.  I think Train Wreck epitomizes this, the music is so beautiful and almost peaceful about how yet again we fall passionately in love and are heading yet again for disaster but we keep trying.  If you are a Sarah fan, please give this album more time. If you are a woman with a little experience under her belt listen to this album. The more I listen to Afterglow and put it in the context of my current life, it really resonates.  On first listen I thought what a polished, produced, nothing.  Now, I think this work is brilliant and is well on it's way to being my favorite Sarah album surpassing Fumbling.  It is without a doubt my favorite album of 2003.  Sarah McLachlan is a truely amazing artist in that she has always exposed her inner self on her albums.  ...

B00005JLWN|5.0|I still can't understand why I never saw this movie in the theaters.  I was totally surprised of the visual and mental revelations that were made.  Equilibrium presents us with the (very plausible) idea that humankind have figured out how to finally maximize our societal obsession with efficiency.  I won't say how, but the idea is realistic and startling.  There are enforcers for the system, as played by Christian Bale, and their job is to ensure the continuation of the society.  They are expert gunfighters who are sent to the toughest battles.  The action sequences will blow you away.  Not only are they incredibly artistic and original but they are down right cool and will stun any action-movie junkie.  All-in-all the movie is AMAZING!!!!!  It's number 4 on my list of ALL TIME BEST MOVIES beat out only by GLADIATOR, MATRIX, and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON.  p.s. Don't let the last one scare you, I know it's not for everybody :).
B000002UE9|5.0|This album is a unique flow of:<BR> <BR>1-Happiness<BR>2-Energy<BR>3-Very good production<BR>4-excellent guitar work<BR>5-Fun<BR>It  sounds halfway Kiss/Motley crue but<BR>with better sounds and arrangements<BR>Once played you'll never stop singin' songs like Nothin but a good time or Good Love<BR>If you like HARD/ROCK-GLAM/METAL this one could become your favourite CD <BR>believe me
B000089RVX|5.0|The first thing that struck about this album is what a great voice Amy Lee has.  Her vocals provide a unique contrast to the heavy metal sounds of the band.  It's quite refreshing to see a female vocalist enter the rock scene and hopefully Evanescence is around to stay.<br />Some people have commented that all of the track sounds similiar, but I really don't know what they are talking about.  Listen to &quot;My Immortal,&quot; a slow, sad piece with the main accompanyment being piano and violin and &quot;Going Under&quot; which has a heavy guitar for most of the song.  And yet both of these songs allow Amy's voice to shine.<br />&quot;Bring me to Life&quot; was my initial favorite, but &quot;Holding My Last Breath&quot; has grown on with it's powerful lyrics and beautiful rhythm.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I LOVED this CD! I never bought the original one because I had heard so many bad things about it, but I was compelled to buy this one because I'm a huge Beatles fan.  Let me tell you, as a teenage girl with a love for Beatles music, this CD rocks!  Every song is fantastic, there's no point in listing my favorites, because that would include each and every song on this album.  <br />Some people complain that there wasn't enough on the Fly on the Wall disc- I just don't understand how that can be a logical complaint.  Hello?  They didn't even HAVE to give us &quot;Fly&quot; in the first place!  We should appreciate the fact that we got it as a bonus and that the CD wasn't listed as a double album, which would've made it too expensive for me to buy.  Some people complain about how much Paul did to this CD- he didn't work on the actual remixing of this album at all, and neither did Ringo.  They approved what was done to the album and didn't change anything at all.  And George approved of this before he passed away, contrary to what some people are saying.<br />The Bottom Line?  This is an excellent album.  Each song has that unmistakable Beatle feeling to it, the kind that makes your soul soar.  It's about the music, and this music is fantastic.  <br />Peace, love, and Beatlemania forever!
B000084T18|5.0|this record is the saving grace of hip hop. i don't get these idiots who can't realize..
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I'm not gonna go into the whole rundown of the movies.  Others here have already done a fine, fine job.  I just need to vent about two things.<br />1)  I just got the darn 4-DVD box set about six months ago on ebay, and I thought I was in hog heaven then.  Extra scenes, some added footage, small documentaries.  I thought I had the definitive DVD set!  Imagine if next year, they come out with a 7-DVD set for THE GODFATHER after we've all bought the 5-DVD set, thinking we had the definitive version!  I just hope THIS IS IT!!!<br />2)  ALIENS 3 is just NOT a good movie...no matter how you slice it or reedit it.  It's got atmosphere to burn, and lots of great-looking sets and sweaty character parts.  But when the pedal hits the medal and all heck starts breaking loose with the alien...the action becomes incomprehensible.  Lots of shots of men running around and looking scare as they slam doors shut.  I still have no real clear concept of just WHAT all these guys did.  The climax just TOTALLY disappoints in every possible way.  David Fincher went on to direct some great movies, but this ain't one of them.<br />But, even with that big flaw, it's still great to have this set available.  Many more years of debate over which is the best (ALIENS) lie ahead, but although there is no definitive answer, this SHOULD BE the definitive set...I hope!
6303823351|5.0|This is a hilarous movie.  Fans of A Hard Day's Night and Monty Python will love this movie.  This outrageous movie is abstract and funny.  But, of course the main point of this movie is to see the Beatles, and see them we do.  A friend of mine complains &quot;this plot is as thin as a piece of paper!&quot;..........I have never seen a person miss the point of anything so much in my entire life.  As if anybody cares about the plot, that is actually what makes the movie so funny, the plot doesn't matter!  To top off this wacky adventure is plenty of great Beatles music.  This movie is so enjoyable in every way.  This is a great feel-good movie.
1400034779|1.0|I bought this book after reading all those fabulous reviews ,it was so boring  that no matter how hard I forced myself I couldn't go on reading after the 40th page .You could feel that the writer was a novice from the start
B00005JKC3|3.0|As a long time comic fan I have sat through some horrible interpretations of my favorite heroes on the big screen.  Everyone remember Dolph Lungren as The Punisher??  While watching The Hulk last night on DVD I couldn't help but smile as I saw old Jade Jaws leaping across the desert, hammer throwing tanks and riding fighter jets into the upper atmosphere.  Sure, he looked cartoonish at times, but come one people!  This is a fifteen foot tall, green, muscle-bound behemoth we're talking about.  The battle scenes looked cartoony because they were supposed to look cartoony.  In a few scenes, most notably when Betty discovers him outside the cabin, The Hulk looked very realistic.  The tenderness and love on his CGI face spoke volumes.<br />What about the plot?  It served the action well and the pace really picked up nicely about a third of the way through.  Granted, the start of the film was somewhat repetitive and slow but the moment Bruce hulked out the first time we picked up a boatload of steam and just kept right on going.<br />I have heard a lot of people bemoaning the fact that the origin story was changed substantially from the book as well.  The only thing I have to say about that is that the origin fit the time well.  When The Hulk first debuted The USA was just tied up in a period of history commonly known as The Cold War.   There was a genuine fear across the nation that we might be attacked with nuclear weapons and the science fiction of the times utilized that fear to it's advantage.  Now we have chemical and biological weapons to worry about instead.  Genetic engineering and nano-technology hold greater possibilities of wiping out the human population of the world than nukes ever did.  Fear of man's dark side getting access to it's greatest power... That's what The Hulk was about in 1966 and that's what he's about today.<br />I'm not saying that Ang Lee has bested himself over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but this is a fun popcorn movie that remains true to the spirit of the comic that spawned it. This film is loads of fun while The Jolly Green Giant breaks stuff and was cut beautifuly in a panel style that comic book lovers will really enjoy. If you want to shut down the old cerebellum and just have a fun night on the couch go ahead and give Hulk a spin.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|A good action movie.  Angilina Jolie is an Awsome Lara Croft. I will watch it again.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|i hated this movie. no more to say.
0440234743|4.0|Grisham has often been accused of writing books tailor-made for film adaptation.  Well, ironically (to me at least) this is Grisham's MOST cinematic book in a long time and yet isn't a movie yet.  Here's why I like it (and would like to see a decent film adaptation):<br />1)  It has a humdinger of a beginning.  Rich guy summons his family for the reading his will.  They think they're in clover.  Then, he quickly signs a new will, basically totally turning their expectations upside-down and then the promptly commits suicide.  And this all happens in the first 20 pages or so!  FUN!<br />2)  He leaves his money to someone the family didn't even know existed.  A child of his, now working as a missionary in an obscure part of the South American jungle.  And to find her, the man's law firm sends a broken-down, recovering alcoholic partner...hardly a like &quot;detective.&quot; This character has more shadings than most of Grisham's heros, and would make a great part for a middle-aged actor of stature.<br />3)  Lots of exotic locales.<br />4)  The family members are all extremely unlikeable...they are stock villains, but so darn funny in their befuddlement.  Lots of great parts for character actors.<br />5)  A very delicate, unusual love story develops...one that is unpredictable and even touching.  Great woman's role here.<br />6)  A typical satisfying ending for Grisham,but this one feels honest and earned...unlike the pat and ridiculous endings for work such as THE STREET LAWYER or THE RUNAWAY JURY.<br />Grisham is still not the most subtle and delicate of writers.  His prose veers wilding from over-the-top comic to serious.  But this story has an appealing weave to it, and for me was a true &quot;page-turner.&quot;  I honestly wanted to see what happened next...all the time.<br />As much as I can recommend a Grisham novel, I recommend this one.  It's funny, surprising, touching, dramatic and mostly well-written.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Nathan Algren:  \\"Life in every breath . . .\\"<BR>Katsumoto:  \\"That is, Bushido\\"<br />These words from the movie \\"The Last Samurai,\\" perhaps best define the essence of the music on this soundtrack.  Every note of music is recognizable, and with it carries a stringent dedication to the movie.<br />I have seen several movies in my day, and I haven't met a movie in a long time in that the music carries such feeling, and emotions.  However, I believe that in order to fully appreciate the music, one must first see the movie.  Only then can a connection be drawn from music to film.  <br />After seeing \\"The Last Samurai\\" (three times now), I have concluded that the true soul of the movie lies in the spirit of the plot, epic filmography, and the articulation of moments through the music.<br />The only let down of the CD was the lack of features and layout design.  The front and inside cover look like they were thrown together at the last moment.  And I would have preferably enjoyed more bonus features such as movie trailers, and maybe even clips from the movie to accompany each track.  However, the movie links preferably compensate.<br />Orchestral background music is a must in any movie that will in time be considered a classic.  Hans Zimmer's beautiful articulation from film to sheet is must have for any classical music collection that strives to be great.
0393317552|1.0|Jeez, can you say RAMBLING?!<br />To me the whole book is just a bunch of convoluted and verbosely-written essays on the evolution of mankind and its &quot;I wanna rule the world&quot; attitude. So there were some &quot;thought-provoking things&quot;, but I couldn't get past the prologue without wishing I was reading a world history text book instead.<br />Too bad I have to finish GGS if I want to pass the class I'm taking. I see a lot of bias and meaningless dribble in this book. Unless your life depends on it, don't bother reading this thing.
B00005JMGC|5.0|I won't go into to much of the storyline since many other reviewers have. This was a wonderful movie that tells us that  we should do what we want to do and not what others choose for us to do. I thought this was going to be a movie preaching feminism, but it wasn't. <br />This movie protrays the society girls of the 1950's and how they dealt with life. Should they become a good wife and mother that everyone expects of a women in this period or become the person they want to be no matter what it is or invovles. <br />Kirsten Dunst perfectly plays the girl that does everything buy the book, and does things as people and tradition dictate. Eventually she comes to relize everything isn't perfect and some things can not be hidden or ignored. She relizes that a smile on your face doesn't mean your happy. <br />Julia Roberts was great as a forward thinker. Her personality seemed to fit this role well. Her character pushed people to be happy in what they chose. She just wanted to make sure it is what they chose. I love that she never conformed and wasa  freespirit to the end. <br />This is a great movie for starting a conversation about what you are, want to be and what you want to get out of your life.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Starts off pretty good but then gets a bit strange when the walking dead arrive and other mutants arrive.
B00006CXSS|5.0|HBO has outdone themselves with this series. It's not just a movie, it's more of a documentary/film on the Easy Company in WWII, following them from training to post war occupation. The acting, characters and storyline develop so you're sucked into watching them all (which I did over a 2 day period). This film made me sad at times, maybe me smile at others and generally had me in awe constantly.<br />This needs to be shown in history class along side the Universal News Reels to give kids a good taste of war.<br />Very well done, it's worth the money.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Like the new Moody Blues Christmas collection, its been<br />awhile since I'd bought anything from either group and I<br />really enjoy them both. Great spirit that is different<br />than all the crap out their. So much from their past gives<br />these songs what they need. Highly recommended Christmas<br />music that should appeal to many, just give it a listen!
B00005JLR6|4.0|My degree of discomfiture with a film is indicated by the amount of movement in the foot at the end of my leg crossed over the other knee. Half way through IN AMERICA, the appendage began to twitch. By the film's end, it was positively hyperactive. Perhaps it was because my expectations were so high.<br />IN AMERICA begins as an Irish immigrant family - father Johnny (Paddy Considine), mother Sarah (Samantha Morton), daughters Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) - con their way through U.S. Immigration at the Canadian border. Ostensibly just on vacation, their true intent is to take up illegal residence in New York City. Johnny hopes for an acting gig, but ends up driving a cab between unsuccessful auditions. Sarah, a teacher, must settle for waiting on tables. Home is a derelict, drug and addict-infested apartment building which seems not to perturb in the slightest any member of the family, especially the two girls, who seem positively thrilled to be there. (The viewer might be forgiven for wondering how bad life was back in Ireland if this dump was acceptable. The question is never answered.) Downstairs lives the &quot;man whom screams&quot;, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an enraged Nigerian painter who's emblazoned &quot;Keep Away&quot; on the outside of his apartment door. As it turns out, Mateo is dying of an unspecified disease (though the script suggested to me that it was AIDS). In the meantime, Sarah becomes pregnant. Her doctor says that if she goes to term, either her life or that of the child may be endangered - again, for unspecified reasons.<br />Sarah and Johnny previously had a third child, an infant son named Frankie, who'd died back in the Old Country after 1) taking a tumble down the stairs, and 2) developing a fatal brain tumor. Both Johnny and Sarah are wracked with guilt. In the ending credits, the film is dedicated to a real-life Frankie, who, as I understand it, was director/writer Jim Sheridan's brother and who died at 10 years of age. I think perhaps this connection, overt or otherwise, caused Sheridan to over-sentimentalize the script.<br />At one point, the two girls go trick-or-treating on their first Halloween, and go door to door in their squalid tenement. After relentlessly pounding on Mateo's door, he opens up fit to kill. But he's immediately tamed by the girls' incorrigible sweetness and spends the rest of his screen time eating out of their hands, so to speak. The whole thing seemed too corny, and it was about then that my foot began to fidget.  Finally, toward the film's conclusion, the improbable treatment protocol of a case of apparent RH-Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn - contrived solely for maudlin effect - caused me, after thirty years' experience in blood banking, to roll my eyes and send my abused foot into overdrive.<br />All movies manipulate the audience, but IN AMERICA went over the top, in my opinion. I've seen it touted in respectable rags as &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot;. Puhleeze! Compared to such outstanding pictures as THE HUMAN STAIN, MASTER &amp; COMMANDER, MYSTIC RIVER, BARBARIAN INVASIONS, SEABISCUIT, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, VERONICA GUERIN and perhaps a couple of others I've yet to see, IN AMERICA isn't even close.<br />Four stars is too much, three too little. 3.5 is just right for something too schmaltzy for my curmudgeonly sensitivities despite some fine acting performances, particularly those of Morton and Considine.I think perhaps this connection, overt or otherwise, caused Sheridan to over-sentimentalize the script.  <br />At one point, the two girls go trick-or-treating on their first Halloween, and go door to door in their squalid tenement.

B00005NTJK|5.0|I've always considered this to be one of the better Jethro Tull recordings simply because they aren't trying too hard to sound like something in particular (Songs from the Wood) or get out some sort of cryptic deep message (Thick as A Brick or Passion Play). It also features a particularly talented line-up of Tull, which, for various reasons, was ill-fated (as were nearly all line-ups of Jethro Tull!). Its really some of Martin Barre's<BR>best (the solo on Too Cry You A Song; the background guitar on Jeffrey,Michael Collins and Me)<br />So, if you want Tull after they stopped listening to Roland Kirk, but before they started listening to Martin Carthy, get this album.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|Josh Rouse has been, quietly and without the benefit of a huge record company's promotional machine, putting out great album after great album. And, already apparent in his prior release Under The Cold Blue Stars, he's not interested in milking anything he's already done for guaranteed kudos. 1972 is a lovely set of songs, with the kind of balance between a unity of theme and diversity of moods that confirm the power of albums, over the &quot;immediate-gratification&quot; glory of churning out singles. The whole thing is a gorgeous homage to the seventies without the cheap sentimentality that could result from looking back at the music of any given past decade. Among other beauties, there are gorgeous things like the eponymous 1972 or Sparrows Over Birmingham, the groove of Love Vibration, or the rising arrangement in Rise. And all of it touched by the wild honey -wild, not processed- of Josh Rouse's voice.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This review is from a casual fan of the band before seeing &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. <br />This is simply the best concert film I have seen.  The production is great, the music energizing.  Visually, you couldn't ask for more.  &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; will not only make you  appreciate the brilliance of the Talking Heads, but of director Jonathan Demme as well.  I could watch this film over and over again. The DVD is a visual improvement over the video version. The only thing I envy is that my brother was in the concert crowd and saw this being made - lucky stiff.<br />As for the reviewer who commented on David Byrne leaving the stage during &quot;Genius of Love&quot; - I doubt it was out of a lack of respect for the other members of the band.  Rather, he was changing into the famous &quot;Big Suit&quot;.  Better that the Tom Tom Club play a song (and do it well) instead of dead time on stage.  The scheme worked brilliantly as the entrance of the Big Suit is a major highlight of the film.
B00005JLTN|2.0|In a word, I found The Matrix Reloaded to be a disappointment. I suppose you could make the argument that it is unfair to review this movie independent of the 3rd movie in this trilogy, since the point of this movie seems to be to set-up the finality in the 3rd movie. But other than serving that purpose and providing a few entertaining special effects and a revelation or two that are unexpected, overall this movie was a big let down for me. Other than a couple of interesting scenes and special effects, the majority of the movie was dull and difficult to sit through. A lot of people that saw this movie raved about the car chase that occurs at the end of the film, but I was not impressed by it.<br />Particularly annoying are the love scenes between Neo and Trinity. Their blooming and destined love for one another was not as sappy in the first film, but in this movie it borders on being as sappy as some old Hallmark card. Why does Hollywood feel the need to continually bombard us with these absurd images of romantic love? &quot;Now we are even,&quot; says Trinity. I'm quite certain that the movie could have done without that trifle remark or the entire scene for that matter. What was the need for that entire scene anyway? Love conquers all else, even logic? Please!<br />What was so great about the first film was its originality - original concept, original camera work, the twists and turns of the plot. This film had none of that. If the meaning of this film was to explain part of the first one and set us up for the last one, then how about just dividing this film in half. Tack half of it onto the first film and tack the rest of it onto the 3rd film. But then again, the real purpose of this film was to get a few more million bucks out of the public. At least that was a success.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I was very disappointed with this one.  It is boring and dull and just draggggssss on.   A great actor and plot were wasted on this movie.   I wish I had read more reviews before buying it!
B0000669JL|4.0|This is an okay record, with one of the best Marley songs, Redemption Songs, but really it seems a bit thrown together. No one 1 album can really give you Bob Marley. Sure, it's got some hits, but there's more than what's on this disc. Go explore Natty Dread or Burnin'. Compilations seem to betray Bob.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|\\"X2: X-Men United\\" is the widely admired sequel to \\"X-Men,\\" one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as \\"different\\" from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part \\"irrational fear of the unknown\\" plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.<br />This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner.  Perhaps when it came to \\"X2,\\" director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, \\"X2\\" starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time.<br />There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy \\"comes out\\" to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their \\"ordinary, average\\" child (whom they had just considered \\"highly gifted\\") has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance (\\"We still love you no matter what you are\\") on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life.  \\"X2\\" could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.  And it was scenes like this one that made the original \\"X-Men\\" soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  \\"X2\\" doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.<br />Every so often, \\"X2\\" feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a \\"terrorist\\" organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clich&eacute;s.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?  Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.<br />People seem to be enamored of \\"X2,\\" even more, perhaps, than they were of the original \\"X-Men.\\"  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view \\"X2,\\" for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.  I have my fingers crossed for \\"X-Men 3.\\"cting modern day action film.<br />People seem to be enamored of \\"X2,\\" even more, perhaps, than they were of the original \\"X-Men.\\"  I wish I could count myself among them.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is an eighties classic I remember from my days in elementary school. It's the perfect adventure fantasy that paved the way for movies like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Before Willow people hardly stepped into the fantasy realm on screen. It was hard to accomplish but you get no let downs from Ron Howard and George Lucas.  The DVD is amazing. It has every ounce of information you ever wanted to know about Willow. Warwick Davis' commentary is superb and he made me believe it was 1988 again and I was still in elementary school. Now that I am grown I still love Willow and I hope a new generation of children will continue to see it for the gem its worth. This is perfect family entertainment. Skip the VHS version because you are missing a lot. This DVD is one of the best DVD releases. Usually when a DVD claims \\" Special Edition \\" you get a snotty little photo gallery and boring director's commentary with nothing to show for it. The Willow DVD proves that just because a film is old doesn't mean its stale.  I recommend this DVD highly! Warwick Davis' commentary is the best I've heard on any DVD. I wished Val Kilmer could have joined Warwick but... Warwick does a great job at bringing you behind the scenes of the film and capturing the time it was made.  You'll love it!<br />By the way, does anyone remember the cute little Willow cards they gave out in cereal boxes back in 1988? What a great movie experience!
6305079900|5.0|I'll be back!  This is one of my most favourite Sci-fi's of the Eighties by far!  T2 was a good follow up, T3 lost the genius of the first two completely and was just a cash-in follow up.  The effects are probably a little outdated on T1 now, but the story is in depth and the acting excellent which cannot be said for T3.
B00004RF9I|4.0|Both the previous reviews seem right on target.  This movie is a cherished treasure of American film during a major cultural transition.  Seen today, without context, some of my students couldn't understand the satire.  The blur between news and junk has become so obscured, they didn't see the big deal.  The intelligent--or, rather, I should say--the informed students understood what was so funny about a radical communist demanding--nearly to the point of gunfire--a percentage of the residual runs.  Amazingly well-acted, this script is for fairly intelligent people.  No, this movie is not a geek-fest for just the smart people, but the smarter you are, the more you'll be able to get the jokes.  Of late, the only film since &quot;Goodfellas&quot; to match the morbid, smart humor of &quot;Network&quot; would be &quot;American Beauty.&quot;<br />[Well, Solondz's &quot;Happiness,&quot; is nearly as good, and, possibly Burton's &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; or &quot;Ed Wood.&quot;  I'm not sure, off-hand, if they're before or after &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;]<br />PS:  The only reason I give the DVD 4, instead of 5, stars is because, while the film is a masterpiece, the DVD needs further features and a crisp re-mastering for it really to live up to the quality of the source material.  Basically, the movie's a must-see that was hastily thrown onto DVD without the extra care such a masterpiece deserves.  Where's Lumet's commentary?  Dunaway's?  Anyone's?  Where are the neat historical tie-ins that could make such a movie understandable to an un-informed audience?  Mmmm...?
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is one of the best CDs you can ever buy. All the songs are great. Some say that CD1 is better that the second one, but i like CD2 better, so lets just say there both good. It may be expensive but trust me its worth it.
B000089RVX|3.0|I have found this album to be a little overhyped. For their debut, it's really great, but aside from that, it has many, many flaws. Firstly, like it or not - most songs sound the same... similar song structures, same power chords, same rhythm. Many songs start very promising, like they are gonna deliver something extraordinary or epic, but they soon flop and just follow the usual formula or end up abruptly or with a cheesy and badly made fade-out (master guy should be fired for this!) I also have a problem with how the songs follow each other... they just don't blend so well.<BR>This record is also very overproduced. Many useless sound layers and choirs are thrown into the mix... I guess they tried to make it more complicated... but failed. Songs with piano &amp; Amy singing are good, but too much like Tori Amos.<br />I'm not gonna say that this album isn't addictive, some songs certainly are, but I honestly expected so much more...<BR>That said, I'm not so sad about Ben leaving. I cannot say he is a great guitar player... no great riffs here. No spectacular song writing. Maybe Amy will force herself to bring something really new into the group.<br />Only the time will tell if this band is really worthy. If their next release proves to be really great (or at least better than this), then I will love their debut much much more. Because I still cannot get the feeling out of my head that they are just another &quot;original&quot; band with good management that made $$$ with overhyped and successful debut and then drifted into the history. Everything here is too much polished and forced for a debut... but only the time will tell. Still Amy has a beautiful voice and their videos are great. :)<br />Great tunes on Fallen: all singles, Tourniquet, Haunted, My last breath, Whisper.
6305181810|2.0|This is the film that proved my theory: Claire Danes is not leading lady material. She is better as a supporting role.  Her acting style is repetitious and draggy. Matt Damon was terrific as usual. Too bad they didn't find him a fitting love interest.  Danny DeVito is a hoot. There are a lot of famed cameos in the film. I'm not into lawyer films so I found it rather boring and slow at times. If you're into these kinds of films, you may enjoy it.
B000002L9W|5.0|Funny how when we thought Dave Lee Roth was going to play full time poppy albums after Van Halen, he couples up with probably the current best guitar player in the world and an incredibly gifted bass player.  Shame they split after Skyscraper, but this album especially, was fantastic on release.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is a mindless bob your head up and down album.  All those who hate it don't get it.  It's meant for a person who wants mindless good time.  It's that simple.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is their best, some may argue that sgt pepper is, but i disagree. I never get tired of listening to the music in this album, i can listen to &quot;TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS&quot; everyday. But in sgt pepper you can only have enough &quot;A day in the life&quot;. This is the best album of the best band in history and it truly is a must buy. All the songs are amazing including the classics HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE, TAXMAN, ELEANOR RIGBY and my personal favorite SHE SAID, SHE SAID. great melody and lyrics
B0000BWVCM|2.0|For the reviewer who stated that fans of the comic book will like this film, i think your wrong, the movie did the comic no justice, especially towards my favorite character, Wolverine. The story in the movies are almost completely changed from the comic book, i was in utter shock with #1 and #2. Not only does the movie drag on about an hour too long it's just a complete  disappointment to hardcore X-Men fans atleast to ones i know. I'm in disbelief at how Wolverine's character was distroyed.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|This is beyond doubt one of VH's best albums ever.  Great relaxed/spontaneous guitar work, with songs and lyrics that are witty and sometimes funny.  Fair Warning came out a year later and then the VH direction changed for ever.  But even 23 years on I can play this remastered CD, and I don't want to switch it off till it's finished!  Classic in your face rock!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is a good time, bob your head up and down album with feel good music.  All those who hate it don't get it.  It's meant for the person who wants a good time with catchy music and lyrics---it's not the Beatles or the Stones.  It's that simple.
B000002UAO|4.0|This is not the best album of the beatles, i stll believe their best album is REVOLVER and the second best is MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, but Rubber soul is a great album nonetheless, when i first listened to it,I liked the songs Nowhere man, norwegian wood, in my life, michelle and drive my car, and i thought the other songs were filler, but as i listened to it longer the other songs grew on me and i seemed to like them more and more every listen. Songs like run for your life, the word, think for yourself, if i needed someone, are classics. I still think this is not their best but it sure is a good one. A must buy<BR>The person who said that the beatles ripped off Oasis is just amazingly ridicluous, how can a band from the 60s rip off a band from the 90s? Im an oasis fan and became a beatles fan because liam and noel kept ranting that they admired the beatles and they are better than the beatles, so i became curious. I also liked noel's cover of helter skelter from &quot;familiar to millions&quot;.
B00009W0U4|2.0|I understand Noe's philosophy and reasoning for making this film... other reviewers have covered this.  Violence portrayed as reality rather than entertainment, etc. etc.  Sure, I get it.  But the fact remains that the filmaker(s) refuse(s) to allow there to be any hope or faith in humanity.  The banality and beauty in the ending scene (the first chrologically) between the romantically linked characters illustrates NOTHING.  Apparently, we are all predestined... which is a trite and infuriating belief system as far as I'm concerned.  One does not need to BELIEVE in what a film SAYS in order to LIKE it, I realize... the message of this film is simply too childish for me.<br />I believe that this film was important for some people to see... hell, I believe it was well made for the most part.  However, being able to recommend it is a whole other story.  It's simply too painful and stupid at base.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satrioni brought the guitar back to earth with this album.  No fancy 'play as fast I possibly can' rubbish on this.  'Always with me, always with you' is still one of his best compositions ever. A guitar genius.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Ok, who's left out from Marvel comics that hasnt been filmed yet?<BR>Well, of all the lines of &quot;super heroes&quot; that have paraded through the screens the last decade this has got to be the most entertaining adapration I've seen even if it's riddled with flaws from beginning to end.<BR>Explanation needed here, and I'll start out with the flaws:<BR>The movie commences in an admittingly very slow pace because those not familiar with the Hulk story need to be introduced to it. Fair enough and it's not that dramatic really as this actually results in the whole film being more compact. It could have been much more pacey and faster when it comes to the first 45 minutes or so.<BR>Then as the Hulk finally makes his appearance (and whoa that is some appearance!) other needless mistakes appear as well such as the Hulk being able to make tremendous mile-long leaps as he literraly bounces off mountain tops. The filming however, is so good that even that doesn't annoy as much as it could have.<BR>Being that the Hulk is portrayed as having such abilities he should be practically untrappable but yet he gets trapped on several occasions all for the need to set up mammoth fight sequences and showdowns.<BR>Then you have the army general responsible for containing da Hulk in his army bases who seems unable to learn any lesson even that involves whole neighborhoods being destroyed or half his personell and equipment being squashed as he gets constantly convinced by his daughter (and simoultaneously Hulk's amore) to &quot;give him one more chance&quot;. One more chance at what exactly? Well, the Greenman is beyond such niceties as every time he's loose the earth trembles but no, the general is there again always prepared to go soft and let this indestructible creature wreak havoc extraordinaire.<br />But then the positives are actually overwhlemingly dominating the negative aspects of the film. <BR>First of all Lee's (the director) excellent editing with multiple frames and freeze frames that pay hommage to the authentic design by the comic makers.<BR>Then of course the action scenes themselves. Once the film kicks in and the Hulk appears you wish it'd go on for another 3 hours. We're talking about some of the most entertaining, funny, and at the same time 100% convincing action scenes seen on celluloid. Now, that is bizzare in itself because it envolves scenes where the Hulk dismantles tanks and throws them 100s of meters away, chews at missiles and spits them back, or holds onto fighter jets to be almost launched into space, and finally, takes on a squadron of fighter hellicopters and blasts them as if they were annoying lil mosquitoes. Huh? Yes, all this does actually seem incredibly believable and filmed in such frenetic pace (in pure contrast with the film's beggining) that it guarantees some serious jaw-dropping.<br />But there's actually more than just the mindless brute force of the Hulkman that makes this film work. Subtle but hardly unnoticeable political touches are there as well as the Hulk's father (Nick Nolte) tries to instill in him some political conscience with anarchistic overviews. &quot;What about those in uniform and the crimes they've done??&quot; he screams at Hulk in one sequence. &quot;What about the poison of religions&quot; he continues and urges his green creation to keep on the struggle. Nolte incidentally is a very good cast here as he's a glove-fit for this role.<BR>The only character that comes across as being particularly poor is the army general but then again why would anyone with a functioning brain mind that? It is after all an army general and as any person dedicated to destruction and catastrophic &quot;secrets&quot; isn't ferociously smart to begin with the general's IQ makes actually sense. Neither is the Hulk for that matter but this is a different proposition.<BR>He comes across, as, yes, a mindless organic machine set on totally pulverising anything that angers him/it but you can always feel an &quot;agenda&quot; beneath his green skin that you can identify with.<BR>Tremendous action film and adaptation, incredible filming, great camera work, stunning effects are the specialty of the day here.<BR>Makes the Spidermen and Batmen of this world look like kindergarten boys with issues and sets new standards.<BR>The laugh factor in the film is incidentally extremely high even though there aren't more than 1-2 actual funny lines to be heard. That's primarily due to the fact that the Hulk's anger reaches at time hilarious peaks and you cant help it but laugh. Once you see the sequence with the tanks you'll know exactly what I mean...<BR>By all means, DO see this.
B000005JA8|5.0|I regard this as my favorite album.<BR>incredible musicianship and composition and great eccentric with lord van vliet as the head.<BR>And it certainly isnt because im a pretentious idiot as<BR>many of the one star reviews tell me.<BR>the music is atonal, which musicly is common as any pop, and is as dated as western classical within the last hundred years.<BR>i dont think its 'unlistenable' as even some of the 5 star reviews say. I like it because the music moves me and its complexity stimulates me into excitement and enlightened states of mind.<BR>not everyone is ready for it though the first time they hear it, because it is different. Its as wild and imaginative as the captain himself
1883217040|5.0|This is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book to work through, but a reference work that will offer much to the ongoing study by a serious student of jazz music.  It offers mode-by-mode analyses of major scale and melodic minor harmonies, looks at different techniques practicing and for constructing solos, outlines the basics of reharmonization, and has a thousand other little details that are very helpful.  Each point is accompanied by examples from classic works in the jazz repertoire.  This is a book that can only be digested over a period of years.  I recommend it highly to anyone studying this music seriously.
0714834491|5.0|I came across this book in the local bookstore, randomly finding it while buying a gift certificate for christmas.  If you're into artistic expression in any way, buy this book.  It's full of delightfully random illustrations, quotes, and wisdom.  If you're not the artistic type, I'd suspect you'll find this book a bit tedious or perhaps even pointless.  If, however, you are a creatively minded person who enjoys some visual delights (some of the pictures are just amazing to experience) and some mental stimulation, go for it!  This would make a great book to pick up and open to anywhere, then see what you find.  I've paged through a lot of it, looking at things.  I'm now attempting to start from the beginning and read through it.  This book is incredible.  Worth owning without a doubt.
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is the greatest album of all time. naysayers must look at the facts. Excellent lyrics and instrumentals, a good story, and some of the greatest songs off all time (my personal favorites are &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot;).  I hope you agree.<BR>Also check out the other albums from Pink Floyd(the greatest band of all time), they are also very good!<br />P.S.  It is SUPPOSED TO BE SAD AND DEPRESSING!
B00000055E|5.0|2pac's best album. I love his music and this album is a classic. combining gansgta rap to his angry voice. Buy this one if u r a BIG fan of 2pac. also reminds of good times with Biggie (B.I.G)<br />I tried to get it from different stores when it came out but this album was always OUT OF STOCK finally i got it (along time ago) and It is still in my CD player. Never got out from there.<br />For me this is the best rap album EVER! and also 2pac's greatest work.
B000021YQV|5.0|See the problem with this album is, it's just too good. I normally listened to alternative rock, then I heard Chop Suey! on MTV and fell in love with this Nu-Metal phenomenon. The album opens with the solid and powerful anti-government &quot;Prison Song&quot;. The lyrics are just so well thought out and seem to make no sense at first. After you look at the lyrics and analyze them, they still make no sense. It seems like incoherent babble, but it really works well.  Song for song was the best album I had ever listened to in a long time. There are a few songs like X and Jet Pilot that don't fit, but the other tracks more than make up for it. Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials were all really big radio and music video hits, but there is so many more hits on this CD. Forrest and Psycho are two excellent examples of System's immense musical talent. If you don't own this album, then go out and buy it. Now! Forget Korn, Disturbed, and Slipknot, System of a Down blows em all away!<BR>[Bo}~
B00005JKC3|1.0|the Hulk, a simple story in real Marvel Comic life was turned into a long boring science fiction. The maker of this movie obviously never read the comic in his life. For one it's starts off so slow that the kids will be fast asleep or wrecking some other part of the house before he even turns a shade green. It gets so idiotic that I thought I was watching a twilight zone or Star Trek movie<BR>Stay away from this bomb
B0000009TJ|4.0|The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life was the second of three albums documenting Zappa's '88 tour, which turned out to be his last. Zappa compiled an incredibly tight band -- for the first time in eons, a complete horn section, and a solid band with two rhythm guitars/vocals, bass, several men manning keys and synth, percussion and drums. The band rehearsed tirelessly for four months before launching into a tour in February 1988. Unfortunately, while this band played incredibly tight, infighting broke out between percussionist Ed Mann and bassist Scott Thunes. Zappa was outraged, and cancelled the tour in July, before audiences in the South, Midwest, and West of the US got a chance to hear the band. As the title suggests (not without a little venom), this album is dedicated to those would-be audiences. Most of this album material is, in fact, for the fans. Its full of novelty covers, and an array of Zappa oldies and other rarely heard gems. Material from the original Mothers and the beloved '74 band are present in particular. <br />Disc one begins, after a blistering solo by Frank in HEAVY DUTY JUDY, with a reggae rendition of Johnny Cash's RING OF FIRE, done because, as FZ explains, Cash cancelled his appearance on stage at the last minute. A run through of ZOMBIE WOOF that collides rather strangely with a cover of Ravel's BOLERO is rather interesting. (NOTE: European and Japanese editions don't contain BOLERO because of regional copyright laws). The highlight of the first disc, however, is a rather mellow (and, as always, beautiful) 7 minute rendition of ZOOT ALLURES. This is followed by the revisiting of the melodic MR.GREEN GENES. Although its one of my favorite FZ songs, this cover does nothing new with it. FLORENTINE POGEN, on the other hand, serves here as a vehicle for an aggressive FZ solo. Even better is the impossible and inexplicably brilliant ANDY, my favorite track on One Size Fits All that, perhaps because of its difficulty, was rarely played live. Thunes attempts to replicate Tom Fowler's incredible bass line on the original, but it lacks the flare (and definitely the tone) of Fowler. Frank grinds out a solo. It concludes with INCA ROADS and SOFA -- neither the best versions available of these songs, but its nice to hear them again.<br />The second disc begins with short covers of Hendrix and Cream numbers, done in soundcheck and more tongue-in-cheek than anything. They flow into an energetic LETS MOVE TO CLEVELAND. The BROTHER A. WEST track is Zappa providing the audience with a right-wing evangelist to \\"add some balance.\\" West goes off on the \\"demon-possessed\\" Zappa while the audience is in an uproar. The linear notes say nothing, but this was actually a friend of Zappa's, not really a preacher. The running joke on the album is about Jim Swaggart getting caught with a prostitute, hence the number of \\"Swaggart\\" versions on this album. Zappa fills these out with some fantastic guitar work -- another version of THE TORTURE NEVER STOPS (as many times as its appeared on an FZ album, it seemed like it really never would stop) is actually worthwhile, and probably the best version out there. Zappa breaks into a lengthy killer solo. My favorite track on the album is an unlikely version of one of my all-time favorite FZ songs, the ERIC DOLPHY MEMORIAL BARBECUE. The STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN finish is hilarious -- you're getting ready for FZ to launch into a solo to blow Page's away, when the horn section jumps in and replicates Page's solo almost note for note. <br />This album doesn't represent the best of the '88 band -- the incredible Make a Jazz Noise Here album gets the title. But this album, a little funner then MaJNH, is still a great piece. If it doesn't showcase the more musically astonishing aspects of Zappa, it features some great guitarwork, some good humor, and some interesting selections of material.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I just can't stop listening to the whole CD!
B00005JM1F|5.0|This movie is a great because of the hilarous story in combination with some of the greatest co-stars I have ever seen. Some may not think Old School is that good, but they're wrong. With such memorable quotes as &quot;Frank the Tank&quot; to &quot;Your My Boy Blue!!&quot;. Rember this movie gets funnier with every viewing, I am not the only one who believes this. To quote someone who wants to remain anonymous &quot;I saw this once and I found it very funny, then I saw it again and it made my all time favorites list&quot;.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This CD was really good! One of my favorites of Metallica. Unlike a lot of other bands they actually sound really good live. The orchestra adds a lot to it too. Now I will do a song breakdown<BR>Disc 1<BR>1.Ecstacy of Gold: Introduction to the album, not anything too great but worth the listen 7/10<BR>2. Awesome song! One of my favorites, even if it is only instruments it is a great song! 10/10<BR>3. Master of puppets: Good song, sounds really good with the orchestra. 9.5/10<BR>4. Of wolf and Man: An alright song, glad they had it on the album but not my favorite. 8/10<BR>5. The thing that should not be: Ok, not my favorite 7.5/10<BR>6. Fuel: Cool song 8.5/10<BR>7.

But that is surely no reason to not buy the CD. Buy it, definetley!
B000069HKH|5.0|The Boss has not gone away....he still is capable of putting out gems like this one.  From beginning to end, this is solid!
B000002H33|5.0|This album is very possibly the best offering yet from Metallica. What it definitely is, is being one of the best albums I've ever heard, regardless of category. It's only true competitor of best Metallica record is Black Album. I have a very hard time deciding which one is best, and I probably will never be enough sure of which, I'm sure enough of though, that Master of Puppets is a legend. A truly truly fantastically wonderful album. Heck I almost get teary-eyed when I write this :P<br />It's a near perfect album, from start to end. My absolute favorite song is Master of Puppets, which is my favorite of all songs from Metallica. It's heavy, great riffs, and...it has THE most beautiful solo I've ever heard. I'm speechless about it really. But the entire song is great. <BR>Other favorite songs of the album include Battery, The Thing That Should Not Be, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), and Orion. But all songs are really great. Orion deserves special mention too, it's the best instrumental song I've ever heard.<br />So is this the pinnacle of Metallica? It has higher tops but also deeper lows than Black Album, which may be a more even record, sometimes even counts more, sometimes the higher tops counts more. So I might never be able to tell which one that is my favorite Metallica record. I know it's not Justice for All anymore, which is it was in the beginning when I had first bought it. <br />Anyways, Master of Puppets is definitely one of the, lets say 20-30 best albums I've ever heard.
0385512104|4.0|I liked this book a lot, for the most part, but found it a bit long toward the end. That sounds strange, when you consider how short the book really is, but it's kind of like a movie in which one theme informs everything else. What was that movie with Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwartzenegger? &quot;Twins&quot;? I mean, that was the whole gag, that the two guys were so incredibly disparate yet were supposed to be twins. After awhile, even if you find the gag funny at first, you're bound to get tired of it eventually.<br />Don't get me wrong. I think Haddon did an absolutely incredible job of capturing the world and mindset of a type of autistic child. Having done that, however, as long as he stayed true to the character, there couldn't be any growth or change in Christopher's ability to discern emotions and learn from his mistaken impressions. In fact, he would never be able to see them as mistaken.<br />Still, the book was a good read, really different, and a fantastic accomplishment. But what does the author do for an encore? It'll be interesting to see.
B000088E6D|5.0|I believe Mr. Michael Bublé may well be THE NEXT ONE! For me to admit that ANYONE could hold a candle to Mr. Frank Sinatra is saying something. <br />I sat enthralled during Mr. Michael Bublé's show at the Pantages Theater in Minneapolis last July. That night, if you closed your eyes, you would have been taken back to that time when music WAS music, when words and lyrics meant something and when people paid respect to great entertainers by really listening....and showing their appreciation with ovation after ovation. And that was the kind of show Mr. Michael Bublé put on. He's an entertainer like the Ratpack were, you got your money's worth every time. Mr. Michael Bublé deserved every penny........<br />I have probably heard his self-titled debut album a few thousand times by now, and never tire of it. I can honestly say, only one other singer in the world can make me feel that way. Mr. Frank Sinatra. <br />Oh, I may not be a pro music critic, but I know that this Michael Bublé album has been my gift to many friends (17 albums as gifts to date) and I have received warm thankyous from each and every one. They have all now become Michael Bublé fans. You try to please that many people and see how many love what you gave them!  <br />This album has declared that the NEXT ONE IS HERE!
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree is not your average band compared to what is wide spread in America.  Unlike the groups that get all the masses worked up over them just becasue of sex appeal and not talent, Porcupine Tree actually has talent.  They know what they are doing.  <br />The cd itself is a masterpiece.  Hands down.  You can't listen to is and not get hooked on it from the start of the rumble and beauty of Blackest eyes to the melodic Trains.  Lips of Ashes is an underrated jem of the cd.  Not to many people seem to really get into this song, it will take some getting use to.  The Sound of Muzak is a great song making a statement about the music field today and how it's going down hill, how talent is a rare thing.  Gravity Eyelids is a gripping piece.  It starts out slow, melodic only to reach in middle with a harder feel to it and finally ending the way it started.  Wedding Nails is a great instrumental that has a different feel to the album.  It's a bit on the faster paced side but that doesn't take away from the songs at all.  Prodigal is a song that is the middle of the total sound of the cd.  It's a mix of every type of song on the cd I feel but it holds on it's own as a excellent work.  .3 is a slow moving song that some would pass over as a bit boring but really it's quiet interesting.  It to is also passed over by several who say it is just filler.  It's really a great song about war.  The Creater has a Mastertape is another fast paced song.  It's chorus is very catchy and the way it is structed seperates this song from the others.  Heart attack in a Lay by has to be one of the most beautiful songs on this cd.  It's another melodic songs and sad at some points but incredible none the less.  Strip the Soul is and song of epic proportions.  The pulse the the bass mixed with Steven's voice, the drums and guitar create an amazing and hard hitting song.  The closing song, Collapse the Ligth into Earth, is one of the greatest closeing songs of any cd I've heard to date.It's piano and strings are magnificent.  <br />This is a cd of amazing proportions that is incredible to listen to.  It never grows old as well as Porcupine Tree's previous stuff.  This will be one of the groups to stand the test of time.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is a classic and will be recorded as one of the best movies ever(by professional critics and us reviewers). This movie is depressing at times, but it shows that the true human spirit can get you through rough times. This movie has you cheering(or shocked with happiness) at the end. I hesitated to watch this movie after my friend 'made me borrow it' but when I sat down to watch it I was in awe and went to buy my own copy within days of seeing it.
0385504209|3.0|Here are the things I liked about The Da Vinci Code: short chapters and fast pacing, intriguing riddles, ideas about alternatives to the basic story of Christianity with which I wasn't all that familiar. However, and it's a big however, the writing was pretty stereotyped and unsophisticated. In the hands of Thomas Harris, for example, this would have been dynamite. Still, it's a fun read, and I'm sure Dan Brown could care less what I think of his writing abilities or lack thereof. As the old saying goes, &quot;he's laughing all the way to the bank.&quot;
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is a true masterpeice that any Heavy Metal fan will love. Everything sounds excellent on this album, From James Hetfield's powerful lyrics, to Kirk Hammet's amazing guitar solos. Cliff Burton's bass is also heard alot on Master of Puppets which makes Puppets even more special because it is Cliff's last album as he was tragically killed when Metallica's bus crashed. The Album starts out with a sort of errie sounding spanish guitar which really helps to set the mood of the album. The song then blasts into all out Metal Mayhem with the song &quot;Battery&quot; and the Mayhem continues even more with the title track &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot; The Album then leads into The Thing That Should not be which is perhaps the heavist track on the album,as it is a long powerful beast of a song with extremly heavy guitar and powerful vocals. Track number 4 Welcome Home (Sanatarium) is perhaps the best song on the album and a definate Metallica classic. The song is dark masterpeice that really illustrates how well Jame's voice improved since Ride the Lightning. It also shows how great a guitar player Kirk Hammet is with the melodic guitar solos. Followed by Welcome Home (Sanatarium) is Disposable Heroes which is a really fast powerful and intense song about the horrors of war and the abuse of military power. After the thrash of Disposable Heroes. The album in my opinion looses its power a little (not much) with Leper Messiah. Leper Messiah is one of the shorter tracks on the album but it packs a punch none the less. (Just not as much as the previous tracks.) The Album then enters the amazing intrumental &quot;Orion&quot;. Orion starts out heavy and then slows down into a tapestry of Melodic Beauty and then finishes off with more heavy guitar. The track really makes it clear how much Metallica had improved since Kill Em' All and Ride the Lightning. The Album finishes off with Damage Inc. which is my least favorite track on the album. Damage Inc. is nothing amazing lyrically or intrumentally but it still is a good track and does a decent job of capping off the album. Master of Puppets is an album in which you will find yourself listening to all the way through not skipping a track and when your done you will only be craving more. Master of Puppets is a brilliant album that no Metal Fan should be without!
B000002UAX|5.0|It seems we get those who hate it and those who love it.  Personally, I'm a Beatles fan.  Oh sure, people say they're overated and the album's overated and they're the boy band of the 1960s.  Fine, fine, have fun with your ranting.  I liked most, if not all the songs on here.  And you know, even if they were the boy band of the 60s, which I don't really believe, at least not in their older days (come on, boys bands do not survive with that much facial hair), who cares?  I find people extolling the virtues of Hendrix and Dylan and then bashing the Beatles to be humerous.  <br />Anyways, the album.  The only song on the first CD that annoys me sometimes is Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.  I love love love Why Don't we do it in the Road?  It's such a random, weird, crazy, and sort of intense song.  Really easy to learn the lyrics too.  While my Guitar Gently Weeps is a gem too.  Piggies is a humerous one by George, and ones like Rocky Raccoon and Bungalow Bill add to it to.  Happiness is a Warm Gun, love that one too.  Yeah, all but Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da come with my seal of approval on that side.  <br />Second side, all but Revolution 9.  Sexy Sadie and Savory Truffle are perhaps my favorite on that side.<br />Like always though, music is all opinion.  So take mine or leave it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie had me wondering what was going on the first time I saw it. I was thinking 'this is backwards', and of course it was, but the way it was written has you guessing even more how things happened to lead up to the end, when that's what you are watching first. It is a switch from seeing a movie and being able to guess the end of the movie after watching five minutes of it.
0156027321|5.0|This magical book is one that has stayed with me long after I finished it. I was sorry when I reached the final page because I didn't want it to end. I love the way Martel uses language - simple, but profound and powerful. It necessitated reading slowly, and re-reading to savour it's simple complexity.  &quot;I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.&quot;<br />Martel leads us into the fantastic, rendering it believable. Of course there is a tiger named Richard Parker. Of course one can live on a life raft with this dangerous creature. Of course a person can be a Hindu, Christian and Muslim at the same time. He spins his yarn into credibility - we want it to be a true story. We want it to be believed at the end.<br />Like a simmering pot of stew cooked all cold, dreary day, this gem was a feast to the senses and to the intellect, on many different levels with many different textures. I haven't enjoyed a book this much for quite some time.
B00004VWA7|4.0|I'm writing a review for the folks who aren't familiar with Jaco Pastorius, but are curious coz they might have heard him mentioned somewhere.  Coz honestly, if you're not a bass player or move in the jazz circles, I can almost guarantee you've never heard of the guy.  Ya see, I found this cd in the jazz section, and was a little disappointed upon first listen at the lack of a traditional jazz sound.  But, I'm not the type of person to disregard a cd or make a complete verdict upon one listen.  Well, it didn't take me long to really get into this.  Pastorius is every bit as good a bass player as &quot;they&quot; say.  This cd is certainly proof of that.  It's obvious that it was recorded in the 70s, coz some of it has a kind of funk sound.  Other songs sound like caribbean music with dashes of jazz thrown in here and there.  In fact, this cd seems to lay the groundwork for the formula Les Claypool uses with his Frog Brigade-minus the humor.  Some of it is kinda trance-y, and some kinda dance-y.  There's alot here, and it's never boring.  You really can't go wrong for the low price of this cd, so you might as well take the plunge.  So take a break drooling over Claypool for a bit and check out Jaco.  It's not-but it should be required reading for those into the bass, and those who just like jazz fusion....or hell, just anybody.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britneys new Cd is definetaly the best of this end of year, it has a very varied rythyms, it has excellent dance tracks like &quot;Me against the music&quot; and &quot;Toxic&quot;, OUtrageous is also a very good song! So come on people and go buy it now! Its the best Cd of Britney ever! Congratulations Britney! U did it again!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Many people criticize this album as being too basic to be awesome.  They have no idea of the raw power behind the White Stripes.  This is taking music back to the garage band days and that raw, powerful feeling of listening to merely a guitar riff and a drum beat.  Jack and Meg White embody pure simplistic brilliance in this album to create something no one has ever seen.  People have been too caught up in their wave of computer edited pop and brainless rock to remember what real music is about.  Thanks to the White Stripes, music can start over again at the beginning and a new direction can be taken.
B000000OE7|5.0|&quot;Made in heaven&quot;,last queen's studio album (and not accomplished at all) shows how much we will miss this band's music in our times.their mix of rock and pop with a bit of their own style sounds stunning especially on &quot;You don't fool me&quot; or title track.Freddie sounds amazing too althugh many of his unfinished vocal parts were sung by other members of the band (they don't sound bad luckily).the music is sometimes quite dark although Mercury had knew that he can do nothing about his sickness and it seems that he is in peace with world.lyrics are sometines desperate but many times Freddie tells us that he never gave up.that album is the prove of it.<BR>as their last album &quot;Made in heaven&quot; is truly representative and melancholic.a goodbye to musical bussines straight from other world.Freddie,we will miss you.and anyone who haven't heard it - buy it now!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Basically i think a lot of people who are dubbing this album in terms of it being poor or not as good as the previous release from this extremely talented artist are perhaps blinded by commercialism, i understand that some of the songs are not as initially catchy as her previous debut, yet this is not to be diffrentiated with as being poor only an avid fan of music or a musician in their own right can appreciate the depth and quality of this artist and of the talent that is so clearly displayed in this album.<BR>   It is beautifully laid out and i only wish that other artists such as alicia keys would wipe out the talentless artists that continue to dominate the charts... cough cough the cheeky girls WTF!!!! <BR>HARLEMS NOCTURNE is stunning i hope her following album explores her talent as a pianist even further!!!!<BR>she is amazing NUFF LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!
B000003S0D|4.0|King Crimson's &quot;Lizard&quot; is one of their most underrated albums.partly because it is a bit more odd sounding than &quot;In court of crimson king&quot; or &quot;Red&quot; but also becuase of Gordon Haskell's appearance as lead vocalist.well,i do not say that Gordon is great singer but his characteristic voice gives some new colour to Crimson's music.just listen to opening track or &quot;Indoor games&quot;.and his bass playing is superb.<BR>&quot;Lizard&quot; shows that Robert Fripp is a amazing composer.Fripp do not shows us here all his guitar tricks and crazy riffs,mostly he creates gentle atmosphere with a use of acoustic guitar or mellotron.if you got used to his distorted and raw sounds from later albums you will be suprise how melodic he sounds here.<BR>all the compositions are fine,especially the long suite placed at hte end of cd.&quot;Prince rupert awakes&quot; features Jon anderson's vocals and wonderfull atmosphere.Fripp experiments here with melody and sound on some parts especially on intruguing bolero part.what can i say more - definitly &quot;lizard&quot; is a standout album,not as strong as Crimson's most famous works but still insteresting.the true is htat this album features a few dull moments but in the end it leaves you not dissapointed.<BR>if you like progressive music and of course Fripp's distinctive tracks,&quot;Lizard&quot; will not let you down.amazing album.
6302891272|4.0|My name is Amy and I am a student at Nagoya International School in Japan. I watched Kurosawa's &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; in my English class a few weeks ago, and prior to watching that I saw many different versions of Macbeth including Polanski's version. I believe that in this adaptation of Macbeth, the actor who played Washizu, did an excellent job of portraying an extremely doubtful man prior to killing the king (or lord in this case).  Kurosawa did a great job in showing how Asaji was the main drive behind the murder of the king, that without her, it's doubtful that Washizu would have ever followed through with the murder. Also in that scene, Asaji discusses &quot;ambition&quot;, the exact word which is used in the original play, &quot;Macbeth&quot;. I believe that ambition is an extremely important theme in Macbeth and it was wise for Kurosawa to use it. Although &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; was a very different style than the original &quot;Macbeth&quot; play, I think that Kurosawa changed it enough to make it very interesting compared to the other versions, yet he kept many important themes, which were necessary to keep the original story alive.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Aguilera has a very pretty voice.  Her duet with Lil Kim in &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; song has one of the best beats in any of her albums.  I rank this song ****** six Stars.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Someone complained that these guys are not &quot;Influential&quot;. 99% of the bands out there today will leave absolutely no mark on the world. What does &quot;influential&quot; mean anyway, and how could you possibly know today whether or not Radiohead will be influential tomorrow? Hey Michael Jackson and Madonna were influential, but I don't own any of their records.<br />Atleast there still are some bands who stick it all out, and do something original. Their stuff is courageous, talented and moving, and all without being completely out of left field (i.e. adventurous) or pretentious. There sound is unique, yet apealing. Personally, I got into them after reading a positive reference about them from Geddy Lee of Rush. <br />So, if you are looking for the &quot;influential&quot; music of today, good luck with your crystal ball. In the meantime, Radiohead rocks like no other band around today. If they don't move you musically, I'd love to see what does? Britany and Madonna?
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce has a very good voice but not as controlled as Mya.  She and Jay-Z go well together but I would like to hear more solo performances than other featred rappers.
B0000AQS6U|5.0|CD 1 (The very best)<br />The collection of songs here is very good, you'll find her biggest songs in just one cd which for me is very good because I hate albums that come in two discs. Because every time that you want to listen to one or other song you have to switch cds. The only two mistakes that I found with this collection is that they didn't add her 1987 Top 15 hit &quot;We all sleep alone&quot; and instead of that song you'll find &quot;A different kind of love song&quot; which is a good song but wasn't a hit and the other mistake is that &quot;Bang, bang&quot; appears in its original version. The new version from 1987 is much better. <BR>Some of the songs here are: &quot;If I could turn back time&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Save up all your tears&quot;, &quot;Strong enough&quot;, &quot;I found someone&quot; and &quot;Take me home&quot;.<br />CD 2 (Live, The farewell tour)<br />Cher's Farewell Tour was very good, the songs were very good chosen and the show was very Cher.<BR>In this cd you'll find almost all the songs that she sang. The missing ones are &quot;Save up all your tears&quot;, &quot;A different kind of love&quot; and &quot;All sleep alone&quot;. Cher's voice and music are very good live. On the shows she sang in a medley her early hits &quot;All I really want to do&quot;, &quot;Gypsies, tramps and thieves&quot;, &quot;Dark lady&quot; and &quot;Half-breed&quot;. That's the version that you'll get of those songs in this cd.<BR>There's nothing left to say about this cd 'cause we all know Cher (whether you love her or hate her).<BR>The only thing that I'd recommend is to buy the Farewell Tour DVD.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This is by far THE BEST Star Trek The Next Generation movie of all time.  The space battle in between the Enterprise-E and the Reman Warbird Scimitar was very fun to watch.  Also Cmdr. Riker<BR>and Cmdr. Troi get married in this film.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|The tough lady is back with a very good album that shows a more mature Pink who knows exactly what she's doing. Her 2001 cd was a very big success but it seems that this new production until now is just being a moderate hit. The first single &quot;Trouble&quot; went nowhere but that doesn't mean that the album is not good.<br />In this special edition you'll find a DVD that features the &quot;Trouble&quot; video (which is very good), a photo gallery, an interview with Pink, lyrics and a day in her life.<br />The cd has wonderful songs like the second single &quot;God is a DJ&quot; and &quot;Tonight's the night&quot; or one of my favorites &quot;Waiting for love&quot;.<br />This cd has in my own opinion the same direction of &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. If you don't have that cd I can tell you that Pink sings rock songs but she also likes some balads which are very good with her amaizing voice.<br />I really recommend this cd.
B000066NW0|1.0|First off, I must say that due to reasons beyond my control, I could not give this CD the rating it deserves (ZERO!!!). Anyways...<br />WHY was it decided that punk was the cool new thing to love? Don't get me wrong, I love it, but this certainly isn't it. Avril's just a new marketing scam, designed to rob you of your hard-earned cash. And that goes for all the other groups people are considering punk these days (Blink 182, and their millions of clones!) But now onto Avril. Is she punk? No way!!! Can she play guitar? Nope! And she's sure not a good role model either. She's a spoiled brat, and her music is terrible. PLEASE people, spend your money on something worthwhile. Together, we can bring down the pop-punk empire! That is all.
6304708521|1.0|It's pathetic to see so many reviewers parroting a bit of McCartney hype. In &quot;Anthology&quot; McCartney says he &quot;defends&quot; Magical Mystery Tour by pointing out that it includes the only performance of John Lennon's &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; on film. In other words, he &quot;defends&quot; Magical Mystery Tour by blaming John Lennon for it. This is typical of McCartney's behavior since Lennon was murdered He deflects criticism of himself by issuing Lennon a backhanded compliment. In any case, the most obvious problem with his remark is that there is NO performance of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; here. The scene in question can't even be called lip-synching considering that the mouths of the Beatles are obscured by animal masks. <br />According to Rolling Stone (December 14, 1967), &quot;The original idea to make a TV film about a bus tour was Paul's. He thought it up in April while on a week's vacation in America and started to work out the song, `Magical Mystery Tour' on the plane back to London.&quot; The film was shown on BBC television on December 26, 1967. The British papers called it &quot;Chaotic, appalling, naive, puffle, flop, tasteless, contemptuous, nonsense.&quot; A front page review in the Daily Express allowed, &quot;I cannot ever remember seeing such blatant rubbish.&quot; According to Rolling Stone (February 1968), &quot;The visual ideas of the wonderful 'I Am a Walrus' are literal -- there are lots of egg men and a walrus, but the film tries to move the way the song moves, so that one finds a silly one-to-one relationship between the juxtaposing of sections in the song and the editing of the filmed scene.&quot;<br />At the time McCartney defended the film by remarking, &quot;It was a mistake because we thought people would understand that it was 'magical' and a 'mystery tour.' Maybe we should have had someone saying: 'We are going magical now, folks.'&quot; By the time of &quot;Anthology&quot; he seemed to have abandoned that line (it was pretty feeble anyway), but we nevertheless have reviewers here parroting IT as well.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Despite Britney's other albums which were by far, much better than this one, her vocals and sense of style has gone down at a rapid pace.  Listening to this CD repeat the same beats and same moans and groans over and over for too many songs was too much to take.  She is quickly losing any relation she once had to being a true musician.  Spare yourself the agony and money and just replay your other CD's.
B00009NOF4|5.0|Not as good as Kid A, Amnesiac or as breathtaking and scary as OK Computer this is nevertheless a great CD. It deserves a 4.5 (out of five) rating. <BR>The music here is intense and relevant. After 2 more experimental Cds they went back a bit to their earlier sound (but not entirely). The Gloaming, 2+2=5, Sit Down Stand Up sre more experimental in sound but some of my favorite, but there are plenty of rocking songs to choose from as well. This is the best band going right now, learn to appreciate their art.<BR>Great show in Vancouver!
B00006RINF|4.0|The mindless masses who watch MTV have no choice but to believe that Lacuna Coil is an Evanescence rip-off since Evanescence has had comparatively much wider rotation there. But because they rely on MTV for their \\"education\\", what can you expect?  <BR>Too bad they'll never know that LACUNA COIL has been around LONGER, and does what they do BETTER than Evanescence ever could.<BR>So the battle is on, and when all the dust settles the victor is Lacuna Coil--hands down--due to better song arrangements and a much better singer in the sensuous form of Cristina Scabbia. I'm not particularly a fan of either band, but the facts are the facts to this musicologist, friends. They have thrived in the global underground for years, a sort of \\"secret\\" that fans don't want revealed to the rest of the world. But this recent Evanescence lunacy has brought forth the truth on a grand scale, which is that Lacuna Coil is by far the better band with the better (and sexier) singer. <BR>L.C. doesn't write songs fit for MTV like \\"the other band\\", they write songs for musicians and those who understand the nuances and subtleties of cerebral songwriting. Compare \\"Heaven's a Lie\\" to \\"Going Under\\" and L.C.'s superiority shines through. Case dismissed.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I love this DVD.....THe preformances are so cool.....i like all the songs!....the only bad things is that they edited the sound......But its worth havin it.....
B0000TB01Y|3.0|With one incredible number followed by something not so wonderful followed by something incredible, the score is incredibly uneven. Scwartz's newest score screams out, &quot;A WORK IN PROGRESS&quot;. The harmonies are nothing short of wonderful. &quot;No Good Deed&quot; is a masterpiece. However, some songs are amateur: &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot; as examples. Who knows? Maybe it's brough to life on stage. But for now, it's a frisbee, if you ask me.
B000071JTQ|5.0|Lacuna Coil's latest album could possibly be considered their best. I haven't heard one track from any of their albums that I disliked. Lacuna Coil's sound is like no other. Evanescence stole their sound from Lacuna Coil. I strongly recommend that every gothic music fan purchase this cd, and I also strongly recommend that you NOT buy an Evansence CD. &quot;Shop Smart, Shop S-MART&quot;- Ash from Evil Dead
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Six months after the original Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves)begins to have nightmares about Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss)plunging to her death. Meanwhile, the rebels have returned to the city of Zion to learn that 250,000 sentinels are digging towards them in order to seek Zion and wipe out the human resistance. The Oracle gives Neo instructions to find the keymaker and seek out the source.

0553212443|5.0|Aside from the Bible, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is probably the most familiar and well-known book ever published.  Scores of film adaptations have been made over the years, taking Dickens' story of one man's redemption to all the corners of the globe.  The name Ebenezer Scrooge immediately brings to mind the miserly curmudgeon whose life and very nature were radically changed after the visitation of four ghosts one early Christmas morning.  Jacob Marley, Scrooge's former partner, returns in spirit form to warn Scrooge of the ponderous chain he is forging in life by his penny-pinching, selfish, Christmas-hating ways.  Then, of course, the ghosts of Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future come to call for an increasingly troubled soul who comes to see the worthlessness of his purely materialistic life.  A Christmas Carol offers a truly amazing character study.  Scrooge, this seemingly incorrigible fellow, quickly becomes a sympathetic character as we view the circumstances of his life.  From a lonely boy rejected by his father (who blames him for the death of his wife in childbirth), we see a sensitive soul, one quite capable of feeling and expressing both happiness and love, grow greedy and cold, shutting even the woman he loves out of his life.  Completely broken down by the scenes revealed by the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge's transformation is remarkably real and powerful.<br />Little need be said about this timeless classic, as it is a story virtually everyone knows in some detail.  The message is clear to all of us, as well.  Dickens, the social conscience of the 19th century, illustrates the humanity and worth of even the lowliest of society's members and casts the harsh light of truth on those with the means but not the desire to help their fellow man, giving new life to the cliché &quot;you can't take it with you.&quot;  Dickens briefly alludes to the religious aspects of the holiday, but he vividly evokes the true and rightful spirit of Christmas in humanistic terms.  This is a timeless story that will forever be a part of each Christmas season.  Not only does it impart lessons of the highest order, it never fails to charm and delight you no matter how many times you have previously read the story (and watched the movie adaptations) over the years.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Wow!  The number 1 reason I am purchasing this CD is for Pippin's song to the Rent-a-king for Gondor!  That was most B E A Utiful!  Definitely the best of the Trilogy, especially having the most &quot;crying parts&quot;!
B00000K19E|4.0|For those who care, the full length commentary was not at all helpful. I would have bought the DVD otherwise.
B00006IU73|5.0|I heard this band's song Blackest Eyes on the radio one day, and it struck me odd. When it first started playing, I figured them to be another boring rock band with no talent. But then afet a few minuets I realized that this was something like I'd never heard before. A cross between new metal and Pink Floyd? I definititly had to check them out. So I did, and found out that Porcupine Tree has been around for some time.<br />Now, about the cd. I love Trains, espially the banjo in the middle of the song, and when it goes back to the chorus. But all the songs are great, and they all are a work of art. I espially love The Sound Of Muzic, because it tells about popular music is declining rapidly. With &quot;nothing bands&quot; like Creed, Nickelback, and pop punk bands like Good Charlotte on the top otr the rock charts, one of the wonders of the world IS going down.<br />Songs like the Gravity Eyelids has that phychedelic feel to them, you feel like you should be taking acid or something when you listen to it. And the Creator has a Mastertape and Heartattack in Layby have thrashy feel to them, but also have good melodies. The last song, Collapse the Light Into Earth ends the cd beautifuly, with its soothing piano and vocals. <br />Any fan of good, progressive rock will treasure this cd for years and years. Its that good. Cd's like this don't come around very often, and I wouldn't be surprised if one day this cd is considered a classic among progressive rock.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I read some of the bad reviews and most sounded like they were by people who had only seen 1 or 2 episodes AT MOST.  The series did start cold, with maybe a little too much emphasis on the western aspects of the series.  But colonies, no matter how far into the future, are going to be dirty, low tech, thinly populated planets where local traffic will likely be on horseback half the time unless by then someone has invented a cheap universal fuel source.<br />This series is all about the crew and the relationships between them.  Just like Buffy, these relationships develop over time but, unlike Buffy, there's a history to them, which is why it might be hard to get into it at the beginning.  By the time we get to the episode where Jane turns in the doctor and his sister, we know what that's going to do to the captain.  Whedon doesn't just gloss over that - he spends the whole last 15 minutes in the confrontation between the two and it's an entirely believable discussion of Jane's lack of mores and whether or not he deserves to be in that crew.  The fact that at any second the captain could just space him adds that extra edge to it.<br />If Whedon had been allowed another year to develop these characters, I'm sure that the acting and scripts would have been touted as emmy-worthy (though, of course, ignored as all SF is in emmy-land).  So, 3-4 stars for the first couple of episodes, 5 stars across the board for the rest of them.
B00005JMCW|4.0|First off this is a cute movie and well whorth viewing and maybe owning. The dvd would disort and stop on my pansosnic dvd player in my bedroom. I decided to try it in my pc dvd drive and it plays fine so it most have a unusaul encryption.This is a warning to people out there with older dvd players, rent it first to see if the disc is competibale with your player or you may end up watching it on your computer like me.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I think This is a great CD.<BR>You don't judge a thing so quickly before really paying<BR> attention to it.<BR>I must admit it, I wasn't really fond of this album at the very <BR>first time when I listened to it. However, after listening to it<BR> for over 10 times I begin to enjoy it.<BR>I think that's the charm of her songs:They don't impress you as <BR>the the first moment you hear it, her voice and the melodies <BR>penetrate into your heart unnoticedly and slowly.<br />Listen to it for more times, then you can criticize it if you still dislike it.
B0000AI45P|5.0|People in this review have been writing that the album is mediocre and unsatisfying, but I am sorry to say that they are a little off. Television is one of the greatest and most innovative true punk rock bands that have existed. They are among the grandfathers of all the facets of punk such as Gang Of Four, James Chance, and such and such..<br />Truly, Marquee Moon is an AMAZING album. It's just dripping with inspiration.
0783229526|5.0|Upon seeing this movie at a friends house a while back, I immediately bought it for myself. While it seems that people either love it or hate it, I suggest that you watch it at least once. Fear and Loathing is full of hilarious situations and some memorable one-liners, such as a stand-off between Raoul Duke (Depp) and a lone highway cop (Busey), or Depp exclaiming, \\"We can't stop here; this is bat country!\\".<br />While many critics accuse this movie of being shallow and annoying, it is probably because they are too full of themselves to understand what it's about. On the surface, it's about two rambling, drunk, and drugged crazies roaming the west, but it's full of witty humor (it takes several viewings to catch it all) and fantastic underlying themes that seem to be lost on the majority that can't appreciate this fine work of art.<br />While it's not excessively graphic (ala Requim for a Dream), Fear and Loathing does contain many scenes of drug use, and constant language. Obscene? Certainly. But if you don't take it at face value, it's a wonderful thrillride aiming to find the true American Dream.<br />Buy the ticket, take the ride. It's well worth it.
B00005GL0U|3.0|Yes, without question, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the Beatles best album.<br />BUT, it must be stated that this CD IS NOT the best quality release of this album.   This relatively recent Toshiba release of Abbey Road is IDENTICAL in sound to the 1988 EMI CDs, the same digital masters being used. <br />The ORIGINAL 1983 Toshiba CD (although taken from a 30ips tape copy) is without question SUPERIOR in sound quality than the official 1988 EMI CD.  The 1983 Toshiba CD has far better bass and high-end detail.  The depth and fluidity of the bass is impressive. The overall effect is a CD that sounds &quot;alive&quot; compared to the EMI CD.  One only has to compare the orchestra swells during &quot;Something&quot; to notice the difference.<br />Unfortunately, the 1988 EMI CD was subjected to nonsense such as compression and noise reduction that only flattened and DEGRADED the sound quality!  The result was a CD that took an excellent sounding recording and made it sound dull, lifeless, and actually NOISEIER thanks to the compression.  One wonders how good the rest of the Beatles catalog COULD sound given the proper mastering.   <br />If you love this album and care about sound quality make an effort to obtain a copy (or CDR copy) of the ORIGINAL 1983 Toshiba. <br />The original 1983 Toshiba CD is The Real Deal!<br />Lance, Beatles fan...
B000002NHN|5.0|I listen to music at work, and we are usually sharing cd's.  I was looking through a co-workers cd's when I came across this one.  All I can say is WOW.  I love every song on this cd and will soon be adding it to my collection.
0823016285|5.0|Yes, this is a book meant to be used by artists and enthusiasts, and it is good for that.  I am using this book in another way.  For people with NLD (Nonverbal Learning Disorders) and on the autistic spectrum (Pervasive Developmental Disorder(PDD), Autism and Aspergers) it is an invaluable instructive tool for teaching how to read facial expressions, and how we use our musculature to form these expressions. I'd been searching for a book like this for years, but was looking in all the wrong places: psychology, social skills, spectrum disorder studies, and psychiatric tomes directed toward the therapeutic community.  Then I found this book, serendipitously, at an art store.  I am so grateful! My son has high functioning autism, and is terribly frustrated trying to understand non-verbal and social language cues.  This book satisfied him in every way, and he now studies it. Not only is he learning the difference between subtle facial expressions, but he is learning how these expressions are made, physiologically. He is becoming more expressive himself, and more able to understand the clues of every day social interactions.  I have given this book as a gift to Speech/Language Pathologists who deal with Pragmatic Language skills, to Occupational Therapists, to psychologists and psychiatrists who run social skills groups to help kids and adults navigate the social maze, and to my nephew, a professional clown (on the order of Bill Irwin and Jeff Hoyle, not Emmet Kelley) who is fashioning an act involving social cluelessness (a very common subject in commedy, when you think about it).  For these reasons, I highly recommend this book to professionals and parents who are the mentors, friends and teachers of NLD and spectrum disorder people and those people themselves.  Terrific.  I give it the highest possible marks.
0321200683|5.0|Enterprise Integration Patterns is part of Addison-Wesley's new Martin Fowler Signature Series, which Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (PoEAA) is also a part of. I was very satisfied with PoEAA and the same can be said about Enterprise Integration Patterns. It has the potential to become a classic.<br />The authors' writing style is a pleasure to read -- no ambiguous statements, no unnecessary babbling. The book is structured to suit both cover-to-cover reading and a &quot;dive-in&quot; approach for situations where you're looking for a solution to a particular problem. After an introduction to the field of enterprise integration, and a discussion of why the book concentrates on the messaging integration style in particular, the reader is given a hierarchical catalog of patterns revolving around a small set of &quot;core&quot; patterns. The book's coverage is in my opinion very well scoped.<br />I must also praise the look of the book; besides the layout being familiar from prior works and the proven pattern catalog structuring, the authors have used graphics very efficiently. Not only the authors define a vocabulary for integration patterns, but they have also come up with an expressive visual language for illustrating the patterns using simple notations that can be easily drawn without CASE tools.<br />I found only two downsides for this book. First, the title can be slightly misleading as the book focuses on messaging as an integration style and only briefly mentions alternatives such as RPC, file transfer, and shared databases. However, I don't know a single person who doesn't read the back cover before buying a book, so I wouldn't count this as a big issue. Furthermore, the reason for focusing on messaging is thoroughly argued in the book. The second downside is the code examples, which are presented using varying languages and products and seem somehow disconnected from the text.<br />In summary, Enterprise Integration Patterns is a great book. It's worth reading and re-reading if you're working with systems integration projects or writing integration software yourself. Yet another book that makes me think, &quot;I wish I had it back then...&quot;at book. It's worth reading and re-reading if you're working with systems integration projects or writing integration software yourself.

B000002LCD|3.0|the soundtrack to Madonna's movie Who's That Girl, hit record stores in July 1987<br />BEFORE:<BR>Madonna was the biggest star on the planet.  Three smash albums in a row and 5 #1 singles.   As her fans were buying concert tickets to her Who's That Girl tour, they were awaiting the soundtrack to her new movie.<br />AFTER:<BR>Who's That Girl the movie was not a box office success,  however it was a cute fun wasy to spend 95 minutes.  The soundtrack faired better, as 2 of Madonna's 4 songs from the soundtrack were hits.  Who's That Girl went to #1 and Causing A Commotion peaked at #2 for 3 weeks.<br />I have always loved the Who's That Girl era of Madonna.  I've seen the movie countless times.   The album is total hit and miss.   We get three great songs (the two singles plus the UK single The Look Of Love) and one not-so-great song (Can't Stop).   However, the low score comes from the other artists.  The only non-Madonna cut I like is Michael Davidson's ultra-cheesy SAW produced &quot;Turn It Up&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, neither of the hits off this album have been released on compilations,  making this cd somewhat a rarity amongst Madonna fans (as many stores never stock this title).I only recommend it to Madonna diehards, and those who love 1987-era pop.   Let's hope WTG and CAC will eventually make a box set or something, both are great &quot;lost&quot; Madonna classics.
0380789035|5.0|Shadow has been in prison three years and is being paroled soon. He's let out early due to his wife's death. With nothing left to go home to, Shadow is approached by a man who calls himself Wednesday who basically wants him to be an &quot;errand boy&quot;, but Shadow's job description goes way beyond that as he travels across the country with Mr. Wednesday. He learns about himself, life, beliefs, and people.<br />This was my first Gaiman novel. I've read some of his comics, but this is the first novel that I've ever read by him, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I like mythology, and this presented a whole cast of &quot;godly&quot; characters for me to figure out. That's some of the fun in the book, recognizing mythological characters and saying, &quot;I know who that is!&quot;<br />Despite what Shadow (and others) see as character flaws, he was perhaps one of the most endearing characters that I have ever encountered. Despite what he's been through, despite everything, he seems to have no trouble accepting what he's told by these gods. It's obvious he's a bit skeptical, but the side that believes seems to outweigh the side that doesn't believe.<br />That gives Shadow somewhat of a naive quality. This made him very likable, very human, even though you don't know much about him or his family. You don't even know his real name, but you can tell that he's a good man, and while others think he's big and dumb, you can see that he obviously isn't.<br />And the gods were amusing for the most part, they've &quot;adapted&quot; to the ways of new world by using what they know to get by. So, we have goddesses who are prostitutes, gods that are embalmers, gods that specialize in conning others, and a whole range of gods in between. And you have the new gods--Internet, media, etc--who want to get rid of the old gods.<br />But what really made this story really enjoyable for me was the fact that I was tricked. I'll admit that many of the things in this book is obvious, but while I was paying attention to many minute details, I missed the most obvious thing of all.<br />This book wasn't without flaws like any book. There were some odd sentence structures in the book and sometimes didn't even seem necessary, but the sheer force of what a good book this is made most of that easy to overlook. I will definitely reread this in the future., but while I was paying attention to many minute details, I missed the most obvious thing of all. <br />This book wasn't without flaws like any book.

B000051Y0G|5.0|Cyndi Lauper released her signature album, She's So Unusual, in late 1983<br />BEFORE:<BR>Cyndi was a struggling Long Island singer who had one album with a former band (1980's Blue Angel), but after that fell apart, was broke and singing in resteraunts.    However, her image and style and voice couldn't leave her unsigned too long.<br />AFTER:<BR>Cyndi was at the forefront of popular music. SSU had no less than 5 top 30 singles, she was on MTV constantly, she won tons of music awards.  She's So Unusual went on to sell 7 million copies, and for a brief moment in time, she was the undisputed queen of pop.<br />Can you believe it's been 20 years now since this album came out?  When Cyndi put out Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Time After Time, it was a revelation.  I believe Sisters Of Avalon is Cyndi's finest work,  but in terms of a mainstream pop album, Cyndi never topped this in that regard.  Not one filler track on this, all 10 songs (well, 9 if you count He's So Unusual/Yeah Yeah as one) were ready to release.   Of the non-released tracks, When You Were Mine stands out, she took a Prince classic and made it even better.<br />For many pop fans, this is where it began and ended for Cyndi.  I don't agree with it since almost all of her albums are great (I have not been won over by At Last though) ,  but if pop is your thing and you only want one Cyndi cd,  this is the one to get.   If you love this cd and also love more Lillith Fair-esque female singer-songwriter music,  also check out Cyndi's 90's work, especially Sisters Of Avalon.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this movie.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  And with the adding of some humor and the 43 minutes of extra scenes, you can't get much better!
B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's self-titled debut was released in July 1983<br />BEFORE:<BR>Madonna Ciccone was a NY club sensation. Moving to NYC from Bay City MI with less than $50 to her name, Madonna slowly made her way up.  Before the release of this album, she had already scored one huge dance single with Everybody, and was climbing the dance chart with Burning Up at the time of release.<br />AFTER:<BR>While not an overnight success (when the album peaked, it had been out 15 months), Madonna's debut proved to be &quot;the little album that could&quot;.  Lambasted by critics at first, and at first resisted by a disco-backlashed radio environment.  Madonna quietly crept into the nations conscience in 1984.   Borderline, Holiday and Lucky Star have all become radio standards.<br />Madonna's debut is one of the greatest dance records ever.  Released not too long after Flashdance began to make dance music accepted again, every single track off this album was played in clubs around the world in 83/84.   There is no &quot;substance&quot; song on this that Madonna has added as she got older and wiser,  but in the terms of this album,  it was amazing.   Like A Virgin was the blockbuster,  but &quot;Madonna&quot; was a stronger album in my book,  and it also lasted on the Billboard album chart for FOUR YEARS.<br />Every song is a classic on this.   Still one of her best.
B000002G87|5.0|This is easily Eric Clapton's finest hour, and the most passionate ode to unbounded love since Wagner's Tristan &amp; Isolde. There is nothing even conceivably wrong with this album. Clapton &amp; Allman were an explosive guitar team, and Duane delivers in a huge way all the way through. Bobby Whitlock provides crucial support, and the Gordon/Radle rhythm section is elastic, yet as steady as a brick wall.<br />Everybody knows the story behind this, so I won't bother rehashing it. This is the aural diary of an utterly damaged man; and that diary is permeated by his love for his best friend's wife, and the pain that obviously entails. It's fair to say that Pattie Boyd was married to two of the most consequential giants in rock, and they both produced some staggering work around this time. Whereas All Things Must Pass is preoccupied almost exclusively with transcendental concerns, Layla is almost painfully carnal. There was some cross-pollination occurring, though. The Dominoes were the backing band for the ATMP &quot;Apple Jam&quot; disc, and George reportedly appeared on &quot;Tell The Truth.&quot;<br />It's difficult to point out the &quot;highlights&quot; of the album, since all of the songs are incredible. From the panicked vocals and powerful riffing of &quot;Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad,&quot; the massive angst of &quot;Anyday,&quot; the fluid soloing of &quot;Nobody Knows You...,&quot; the overwhelming beauty and sense of loss of &quot;Bellbottom Blues.&quot;<br />The only work that can approach this masterpiece of loss is Bob Dylan's Blood On The Tracks. Eric Clapton bared his soul to us on this, and emerged a broken man. Thankfully, he eventually restored himself, but he never again achieved the grandeur of Layla.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|Madonna became a superstar with the November 1984 release of Like A Virgin<br />BEFORE:<BR>Madonna was just coming off a very successful 5 times platinum debut.  Her fashion and look was making it's way into malls across America, and she was the only female of the time to look at all a threat to Cyndi Lauper.<br />AFTER:<BR>By the time it was said and done for this album, the unthinkable happened.  Madonna wasn't just the biggest pop star of the moment, she was the only person to rival Michael Jackson. 1985 was owned by her.  Like A Virgin went straight to #1 on both the single and album charts, and 3 other tracks went to the top 5 too. The album eventually selling 10 million in the US alone.  And don't forget Madonna's big-screen debut in Desperately Seeking Susan, and her soundtrack hits Crazy For You and Into The Groove.  With Like A Virgin, Madonna turned from more than a pop star into an icon.<br />19 years on.  Like A Virgin is the most dated of Madonna's recordings, but that doesn't mean it's not without charms.   Her voice hadn't yet grown into what we know today,  but at her age (26) and the style of music, it doesn't matter.   What can be said about the music that 100 people before me haven't said?   All in all, for Madonna's 3 &quot;big 80's pop albums&quot; before she grew into a deeper artist,  it isn't as dancy as her debut, and it's not as addictive as True Blue,  but it has it's own charms.<br />However, I would argue that this is Madonna's worst studio album.   It's not at all an insult considering she is my all time favorite recording artist.   But while I can't put my finger on it, this album lacks something the others have.<br />I would still recommend it to anyone into mid-80's nostalgia because the album defined an era.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes have made another incredible album.  Julian Casablancas' vocals range from the almost lazy ones which lull you in to the grainy ones you can feel emanating from deep within.  It's enough to give you chills sometimes.

B00008NG5V|5.0|This is a great CD to add to your collection.  Perfect for road trips, hanging out with friends, homework (college!), and general relaxing.  It's one of those great records you will always love to have.  When all of those trendy albums get boring or go out of style, you will find comfort in the warmth and familiarity of this CD.
B00003CX5P|1.0|yes that is correct this is a blatent attempt to make another Lord of the Rings but only their directer George Lucus is not as much a genius as Peter Jackson :) a little history lesson here folks, 'kay? ;) three years ago a brilliant film directer desided to take a really huge book that few people had read about and to make the best movies ever. that book was Lord of the Rings and that man was Peter Jackson, loved worldwide for bringing such joy from his creations of hobits, elvs, dwarvs and ents and orks. this man is a hero to millions and I'm not kidding you!<br />George Lucus is seeking to be a competer in the big movie game and brought back his old Star Wars movies with big loud special efects to do so but he has learned that special efects do not make a classic movie experiense because so many people have hated his new Star Wars movie. Peter Jackson should call mr. Lucus and explain this to him because Lucus certainly has the connectiuns to get a big movie (he is friends with Steven Speelberg) made but he has no ability to tell a story so that you care about his characters.<br />So there you have it dont say you were not warned when you buy this and it's so bad!
B000002A46|1.0|I read all these reviews saying how great this album is...I have one thing to say dont be fool, but those darn lies. Mariah Carey christmas album is a waste of time, and shouldnt be allowed on the music shelf. Number one it so freaking boring you cant even get into of the songs...She had me wonder why did she even do one if she not going to bother to sing the darn songs right. Its seem like a 35yr old bat trying to act like she 16..Sorry honey you are way far from 16, and this album is CRAP. I wouldnt recommend it on my worse enemies!
B00012QM8G|4.0|Schlinder's List is quite frankly one of the most moving and powerful films ever made. It is also one of those unique films that actually lend itself to a ton of dvd extras, of which there are few. Sure, the film can speak for itself but it would have been great to see featurettes on the survivors of this or the Holocaust in general. I know there are other places to find such information but this dvd could have also been used as a historical document as well as a film; take a look at the 3 disc Black Hawk Down to see what I am elluding to. I know that Spielberg also had another 90 minutes that he cut from the rough cut of the film and it would have been great to either see this footage incorporated again or as an extra on disc 2 with comments on why it is so cut. I'm sure it wasn't because it was bad, but merely a time issue. Film students could really benift from such lessions. Overall, I say buy the film but let your voice be known that more would be even better.

0671027344|5.0|A sweet, sensitive, thoughtful book about life, love, grief, and friendship which reminds me as much of Ordinary People and Rule of the Bone as The Catcher in the Rye.  Its unusual structure serves its narrative structure well; it allows Charlie, who turns out to be a warm, thoughtful, wonderful character, to control even when he feels least in control, and us as readers to feel in his absences the longing and hope that all teenagers must feel--at least, those as sensitive as he.  And, of course, in Sam the writer has created a love object as endearing as any I can remember.  Bravo to Chbosky and a sincere thank you for reminding us that love is to be acted upon, not just felt, and that, to feel infinite, one has to &quot;participate&quot;.

B000077VR3|5.0|People seem so divided about this DVD.  Some love it, some hate it, but very few seem to be \\"in the middle.\\"  Put me on the side that loves it.  I think the sets were wonderful, the script terrific, the story \\"just right\\" and the acting jobs \\"on the money.\\"<br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" walks a very fine balance between tragedy and comedy and it never makes a misstep...something that would be very easy to do.  I have to ascribe this wonderful tightrope dance to both the excellent screenplay and the excellent acting of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  I can't imagine anyone else in the parts.<br />I think \\"Moulin Rouge\\" will appeal more to romantics and lovers of fantasy than it will to others.  You certainly have to be able to accept the premise that \\"true love never really dies\\" in order to appreciate this movie.  I do.

B0000TAZBK|5.0|Loving The Lord of the Rings movies makes me read LOR's related books. Of course, the music by Howard Shore is unforgettable. The spirit of the movies. It is so great that I have seen the movies many times. I pretty much like The Lord of the Rings: Motion Picture Trilogy Soundtrack, which helps fulfill my dream. It contains just what Amazon.com says. If you do not have any one of the CDs, this set is excellent, for it has the three CDs from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Return of the King. Well, no special DVD, which I want to have. Unfortornately, those trading cards inside are like \\"small\\" DM, kind of fragile. I put them aside. I thought they were like those YU-GI-O cards released by KONOMI, but I was wrong. Maybe you will like them since there are many pictures of charaters in the movies. \\"May it be\\" is my favorite song, and you can listen to it. I bought it with a CD single, but now I can listen to many because of this set. It rocks.
0385504209|5.0|This is the kind of book you loose sleep over - I couldn't put it down. The plot is fast paced and keeps you wondering every step of the way. The only problem I had, was trying to decide whether to spend time on the incredible details and history or keep going to get to the end. One thing is certain - I will re-read this book for the history and the plot!
0553579908|5.0|A Game of Thrones ( Book 1 )  made all the other Fatasy novels I have read, less thrilling. A Clash of Kings simply blew the everything out of the water. The in the beggining I thought the series wasnt so great after all, as it lingered on a character I didnt know. But A Game of Thrones was so good that I decided to read on. Im glad that I did. I highly recomend this book ( After A Game of Thrones, of course ), to all that have an open mind and can handle some explict content. This series will have you clenching your fist, it will make you sad, happy, mad, and you may even throw it down in disgust at some points ( In a good way ). The overall design of the books and chapters are amazing. You know each character so well and you choose sides, for both sides seem good. <br /> Tyrion Lannister steals this book as the main character. His clever wits and his disablities are his weapons, and he rules Kings Landing, for the evil. But you also feel for him, for his past has made him what he truely is. <br /> The only downside to this book is the lack of Robb Stark. I would have rather read his thoughts and feelings of the war more often. I also belive Rickton should have a chapter or two in there. But none the less this book is fatastic by all means and to learn a Book 4 is going to be released has made my day.<br /> Go out and read it, it will make whatever your favorite novel is, seem less.
006016848X|3.0|I was advised to read this by a professor during my study of marriage and couples counseling.  The beginning of the book turned me off with is overly simplistic stereotyping, but as I kept reading I found some of the generalizations to be eye opening and fairly accurate.  Unfortunately, by the end of the book Gray takes to pushing his other materials: books, audiotapes and seminars.  All in all I think this book is probably worth reading (although I'd wait for the paperback), especially for the lay person.  This books is probably particularly helpful for people who have little experience in psychology and who generally do not spend a lot of time thinking about relationships.
B00005QK3B|5.0|Marillion's best effort. The music is as magic as Wilkinson's artwork. Steve Rothery's guitar is full of emotion, and Fish's voice is amazing. The bonus CD doesn't add anything new, you can only notice that the demo version of the album is more dynamic. It's a milestone in the history of prog rock, so just listen to it and enjoy!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had seen most of the actors on this cast recording in other shows so knew I would be impressed but honestly I was completely blown away.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in the musical theater genre but better yet... go see the show if you can.  The sets, make-up and costumes are phenomenal.  The lyrics are beautifully written without being cheesy or forced and everyone involved very obviously enjoys the show.  This is one I hope stays open for a long, long time as I am already a 'repeat offender' seeing it :-)
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Neal Morse is one of the greatest voice of today's progressive rock music. He was already recording solo efforts when he was still a member of Spock's Beard. The reason why he left Spock's Beard remains to me a mystery. In fact, the music on this monumental record is similar to the music he used to play with Spock's Beard. Fortunately, unlike Spock's Beard last album ('Feel euphoria') and Neal Morse's previous records, this album ranks among the best records ever recorded since the revival of the progressive movement in the nineties. It is very close to 'Snow' and ingredients specific to Spock's Beard are here : beautiful vocals, pop sections, latin sections and symphonical parts (but no canon  la gentle giant this time). This album features Dream Theater's drummer : Mike Portnoy, which is a very busy man as he played the same year with John Arch, OSI, Transatlantic on tour and Dream Theater. This is a concept album that will appeal to all fans of Spock's Beard featuring Neal Morse, and symphonic rock in general.
B000002UB3|5.0|On the verge of splitting, and just after recording the slightly disappointing (please note, fellow reviewers, one 's', two 'p's) Let It Be, the Beatles came up with this work of genius (no 'o' in genius) for their final hurrah. It's their best produced work by far, and perhaps their best period.<BR>Kicking off with Lennon's Come Together, the songwriting duties are shared fairly evenly on the first side. Lennon writes Come Together and the incredibly cool I Want You (She's So Heavy), Harrison and Starr get one song each, Harrison's Something (his best song ever, one of the finest love songs of all time, covered by Sinatra etc etc) and Starr's jolly little ditty Octopus's Garden. If anybody is slightly underwhelming here it's Paul McCartney. Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Oh! Darling are pretty good, but they're by no means his best work. Fortunately everything sounds so impressive that it doesn't really matter.<BR>The second side starts with another amazing Harrison song, Here Comes The Sun, which (just in case there's anybody reading this who hasn't heard it - long-time cave dwellers, kids etc) manages the neat trick of being joyful without being at all corny. Because features some amazing harmonies which Freddie Mercury was almost certainly listening to attentively and some mystical lyrics, but is not quite up to the highest standards of the record. The rest of the side is taken up with an incredible suite of songs, leading to the triumphant The End, in which each member has a solo (brilliantly, Ringo's seems to mostly consist in repeatedly hitting a tom-tom), and ends with the refrain 'and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make'.<BR>Finally's there's Paul's nice little song Her Majesty, which was originally at the end of Mean Mr Mustard - in fact it starts with the final chord of that song. Far from being Paul stealing the last hurrah, as some have suggested, it was simply a happy accident that the band didn't want to waste, and it makes for aclassic ending.<BR>So that's it. The last Beatles album. Well, until some fool decided to take Phil Spector off Let It Be...
B00005JMCW|4.0|When a mother and daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan) are observed arguing with each other, a woman gives them magic fortune cookies that switch them into each other's bodies.  Actors Curtis and Lohan must then play as if they were the other person trapped in their body, and they both do a fine job.<br /><br />This updated version of the Jodie Foster vehicle works on all fronts -- the two main actors do a great job with their switched personalities, the supporting cast is very good, the script is funny and the situations are entertaining.<br /><br />DVD extras include a backstage pass with actor Lindsay Lohan, 1 deleted scene, 2 alternate endings, a few bloopers and 2 music videos.<br /><br />Good family film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this show when it was on TV.  My wife and I watched it all the time.  We were crushed and confused when it was taken off the air.  The characters were fun.  The chemistry was awesome.  The writing was where it should have been, not over the top.  Everyone involved with the show deserves a HUGE &quot;thanks!!!&quot; for a job well done.<BR>Now it is on DVD.  I picked it up the day it was released.  I was greatly saddened when I watched the shows again.  They never should have taken that show off the air!  The acting, directing, writing, sets, casting, props was the best I have ever seen in a Science Fiction show (and I love Farscape).  The DVD will forever remain my favorite DVD series of all time.  We were watching the show the other day and our daughter (19) and boyfriend (19) stopped over.  They both loved the show too and asked when the &quot;Movie&quot; was released to DVD because they missed it at the big screen.  She gasped when I told her it was from a show that was cancelled prior to the first season.  She wants to see all the episodes now.  The fact that she is not a scifi/fantasy fan makes that even more special.  <BR>This is a very special story.  If they could only get the writers, actors/actresses, set crew together with that same spark.  Remove all TV execs who feel they 'understand' the viewers. They could bring a story to the world that would rival Star Trek in following.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|This is a remake of a mediocre caper film made with Michael Caine, whose role is reprised by Mark Wahlberg; also in this update are Donald Sutherland, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron.  You'd think with that cast, early locations in Venice and a reputedly spectacular car chase, you'd have a decent action film here, right?  Unfortunately, the script is tepid at best, with poor Donald S. having to utter some of the goofiest lines I've heard in a while.<br />DVD extras include featurettes about the driving, the cars and the stunts as well as an 18-minute making-of feature, a trailer and 6 deleted scenes.  The film can be heard in English or French with optional English subtitles.<br />There is nothing new or remarkable here, though it's harmless enough if you like these actors or want to see a few minutes filmed in Venice or would like to see the Mini-Cooper car chase.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is a Romantic Comedy of the very dark variety.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays one of the most wicked femme fatales (Kathryn) you will ever encounter on-screen.  Reese Witherspoon portrays the typical all-American, virtuous midwestern girl (Annette).  In between is a womanizer, Sebastian, played by Ryan Phillippe.<br />All of the characters in the movie are fabulously wealthy, but more than a few are deficient when it comes to matters of the heart.  People who enjoy eye candy will enjoy some of the sets of this movie - particularly the lavish indoor swimming pool @ the cottage.<br />Sebastian and Kathryn make a bet: can the suave playboy score on Annette?  This, along with a web of insidious sub-plots form the core of the movie's plot.  In each and every case, Kathryn and Sebastion outwit everyone else in the film in order to manipulate circumstances into their favor.  Occasionally, they even dupe each other.<br />Over the course of the film, however, Sebastian's character begins to change, albeit slightly.  Meanwhile, Kathryn remains the cold-hearted and sadistic wench she always was.  It is a credit to the acting ability of Phillippe that the change in character becomes apparent and we're actually compelled to care for him by the end of the film.<br />To answer the $60,000 question on whether a sweet innocent girl can have a significant impact on a life-long playboy, watch the film.  However, be prepared for one of the darkest comedies you will ever see.  It's downright cruel - intentionally so.
0375414053|5.0|I paid full price for this book at an airport bookstore, and despite the disconcerting expense, the book did a stellar job of distracting me on my flight.  Never fond of flying, I was quite comfortable and happy while traipsing through the life of Kate Reddy, British woman, wife, mother of a five year old daughter and infant son -- and investment fund manager.<br />What I found most interesting was Kate's imperviousness to her family's misery, and her own, as she routinely misses the children's milestones and avoids intimacy with her husband, all the while refusing to cede any authority or control that comes with the title of \\"Mom.\\"  While the story unfolds in a jolly and humorous style, it's apparent that no one is happy, and she herself is merely another rat in the rat race, nowhere near as fulfulled as she thinks.<br />I found myself rooting for her to quit her job and stop the grief she was foisting on everyone.  However, she claimed throughout the story that giving up her job -- her one source of control, satisfaction, self-hood -- would drive her mad.  Maybe she just wasn't seeing that she was, in fact, ALREADY mad?<br />So then I wondered, why doesn't her HUSBAND quit HIS job?  The family was desperate for a full-time adult, and he earned somewhat less than his fund-managing wife.  Wouldn't it be a natural solution for \\"dad\\" to stay home? However, the husband is poster boy for \\"Incompetent Dad/Husband\\" in the style of 80's TV sitcoms, where dads knew nothing, and families routinely outsmarted them.  His fondest wish is for a woman who stays home, cleans, raises his children, and dons provocative lingerie after hours, although he's smart enough not to say so.  However sadly obvious that the children are missing the thoughtful attention of their parents, the family never even discussed full time fatherhood as an option to solve their problems.<br />Anyway, eventually Kate experiences an epiphany, and the story shifts from pathetically sad-yet-funny to proactively problem-solving.  I appreciated the long overdue climax, and I would recommend this book to any woman who honestly and sincerely doesn't HAVE to work quite honestly in order to feed her children.vely problem-solving.

0226264211|1.0|This outdated and stupid book, written more than forty years ago, continues to sell and spread its blurred vision of &quot;Capitalism RUles It All&quot;. Friedman must be proud. Total capitalism has won. Any miserable governmental initiative related to social welfare is seen like an atrocity that will make stocks to fall..<br />Friedman clearly despises the average, poor human being. He's a basket case, in my opinion (a rich one, selling this junk of a book along the world.) Certainly, if he was younger, he would now  be some kind of CEO intenting to fire another thousand employees to make his stockshare raise their value. Christ, he thinks that even the post mail should be given to private hands!!!<br />This book is outrageous, immoral. It tries to induce the reader that all the plagues are due to government intervention. When it comes to corporate greed, he dismisses this problems simply by saying that the greed from one corporate checks the greed from another. Nevermind about monopoly! It would never last! (h&aacute;, h&aacute;!). This book is comedy, a bad one by the way.
6304286961|1.0|This movie is the one work that tarnished Morrison's image the most. In this movie, Morrison's drug abuse and screwed up behavior are often portrayed as the product of inner genius and a philosophy of life. In reality, drug abuse is only drug abuse, and screwed up behavior is only screwed up behavior. This generic romantic presentation of the Doors is quite frustrating, and very limited in scope. There is just a lot of quasi-intellectual rubbish, and not much substance to the story. There were twenty or more factual mistakes in the film, and they will be revealed when a person has done their research. Val Kilmer also, in my view, has deficiencies in how he portrayed Morrison. His singing voice was not always up to par, and not for one second did he abandon a warped and stoned kind of persona. What Kilmer was best at, was his depiction of Morrison's moves and behaviors on stage. 'The Doors' is the most popular exponent of the largely accepted romanticized view of the Doors. The jarring factual mistakes make this the worst of all such works, however. Everyone would be much better off listening to the Doors' music (the first six studio albums), which stand as an impressive and creative body of work.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie does a great job of going back into history, portraying the actual events that happened at Pearl Harbor! Ben Affleck, Josh Harnett, and Kate Beckinsale do a wonderful job at playing their roles! I love the plot and story line of this movie! Great action sequences and also a very good documentary from the History Channel as a special feature! A great buy for anyone!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|like everyone else i was really excited that sarah was releasing a new cd, but listening to 'afterglow' killed that pretty fast. i hate to say this, but its not a very good cd. the music is very dull and sarah's voice is no longer lush and full, but flat and just well...dull. for want of a better word, the whole cd is dull. the lyics cannot be faulted, they are beautiful, but the music is not what you would have expected. though there are a few instances where you can see a glimmer of the old sarah, these are nonetheless fleeting. it sounds terrible, but i think sarahs happy personal life may be interfering with her music! bring back the rich and emotion filled music we know! Lets hope the next cd is better. In the meantime, i have surfacing and fumbling towards ecstacy on repeat :)
B00009XITQ|5.0|This movie is great!! I was just given this as a gift! You would think this would be a teen movie that is really kidish and boring, but it's not like that at all! It's got a really good plot to it and it really draws you into the story. There are some really good fashion tips from this movie as to what is in style and how people are dressing now. Overall, this movie was really cute and a good buy for anyone!
B00008G9JN|5.0|I find myself drawn to the memories of buying this album when I was 13. It was a mature record for me but, I was completely floored by it's incredible musicianship and the songwriting of Ian Anderson. It remains today as one of the most riveting musical experiences of my headphone years. Velvet Green, Hunting Girl, Cup Of Wonder, the title track are all incredible. <BR>The entire CD is a tour de force for this band at the pinnacle of their powers. It was an era of &quot;Punk&quot; and &quot;New Wave&quot;. If you listen deeply, you will hear a &quot;new&quot; Jethro Tull sound in the music here. It is a &quot;new wave&quot; of Tull in production and it's overall development. &quot;Timeless&quot; in theme and sound. Which is not something to be said about many of the bands from the revolution of the &quot;Punk&quot; and &quot;New Wave&quot; era. Songs From The Wood: Unquestionably one the finest Jethro Tull albums in their catalog. I will enjoy this music forever.
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie is AWESOME!!! It has non-stop action from start to finish! Denzel Washington's role is superb and he won an academy award for it! I am pleased to say that this movie is one of my favorites! Very action packed, a non-stop thrill ride, and knockout entertaiment! <BR>There is a very good plot and Ethan Hawke did a fantastic performance as well. This movie keeps your undivided attention throughout the entire thing. You do not want to leave your seat for fear of missing any of the action! Excellent buy and an entising experience!! :)
B00005A46T|1.0|First of all these guys have to be as bad as bands like GC, or Simple plan. They have no talent. All you nu metal fans are just wanna-be... goth kids.If you want some real metal try listening to some Metallica cd's from the 80's, or pantera, slayer, black sabbath the list goes on.I dont know what gets me more mad, these guys giving a bad name to metal or GC crying like a bunch of pansies.
B00005JMCT|4.0|I went to see this movie at the theatre the day it came out and I was in kind of a bad mood, but when I got done watching this it lifted up my spirits. I thought it was halarious!! The only downside was that a few of the original characters didn't make an apperance in this movie! But even without them it was still a great comedy! I recommend this to all! :)
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is the best movie Al Pacino has ever been in, if not the best movie I have ever seen!  Everyone has to see this movie.  The acting is amazing from the first scene when Tony (Pacino) is being questioned.  Scarface is a constant thrill ride as we watch Tony go from a funloving immigrant from Cuba rapidly turn into a complete disaster.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays Pacino's love interest and she is absolutely gorgeous in the movie.  Scarface was one of her first movies.  If you are a Pacino fan you HAVE to see this powerful movie.
B0000C1HLF|4.0|Get ready for another action packed thrill ride from Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu. This includes some more new guests as well, such as, Demi Moore and some appearances from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This movie is overall a good buy and has good special features.
0812550706|5.0|I'm usually disinclined to the sci-fi genre, so I had misgivings when I saw &quot;Ender's Game&quot; on my summer reading list freshman year. I expected a plot-driven, purely theoretical novel, a book that would examine machines in more detail than it would humanity. How wrong I was-- I have never read a novel of such emotional impact. &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; through its starkly and brilliantly defined characters, takes the reader to the very core of human behavior, from manipulation and murder to love, empathy, and redemption. While the plot is superbly captivating and suspenseful, to me it serves as a device to illustrate much grander ideals. The internal battles that each character struggles with are as immediate and compelling as the raging inter-species war. Realism and idealism face off in a world where they cannot coexist-- Ender's fundamentally loving and nonviolent philosophies are swallowed in the immediacy of Earth's desperate situation. Valentine, Peter, and Ender together create an intriguing triumvirate of pacifism and moderation, conquest and ambition, and all that lies between the poles. This is no ordinary sci-fi paperback; &quot;Ender's Game&quot; catapults itself into a stratosphere beyond which any other novels of the genre have reached. A triumph on every level!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Why people review albums without listening, I do not know. Anyway, In The Zone is definately my favourite Britney album to date, all the songs are good in their own ways and the album contains so much variety. You've got chilled out vocals and melodies with tracks such as Early Mornin, excellent and seductive vocals on Breathe on Me plus dance til you drop tunes like Outrageous, MATM and Toxic.<br />There's something for everyone on this album, just go out and buy it, you're bound to find something you like :D
0345452577|2.0|When I saw a new Kellerman book, I snapped it right up and went right home to read it. I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN!!  Guess what? When I finished it--still nothing. And Jeffrey was not even an interesting character.  Why do authors who have great books and great characters have to leave them behind and do something DIFFERENT? Bah Humbug!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|THE TWO TOWERS is the slowest of the three films mainly because the characters split up and many new characters enter into the scenario.  Additionally, a lot of exposition must be added to explain many of the new cultures, people and scenarios.<br />Overall, FELLOWSHIP was smoother b/c the group stayed together.<BR>In TWO TOWERS, we have not only the viewpoints of the villains but also three heroic viewpoints.  Going back and forth takes time, but, to its credit, this is true of the books.<br />The extended version gives us more insights into the split personality of Gollum, Faramir's loving relationship with Boromir yet tense relationship with their father, more with Merry and Pippin dealing with the Ents (and a hostile tree) and extra clips at Helm's Deep.  Look for the end fight banter between Gimli and Legolas.  A favorite of the creators but one that had to be taken out.<br />The true value of the DVD is in the LONG commentary of the creators, which gives us more insights into the characters and story development.  Examples include:<br />(1) Why different suits of armor were used for different races and what they represented (i.e. the uruk hai have armor for the front but nothing in back b/c they will never retreat; the elves have elegant armor to reinforce their elegance as an elder race of Middle Earth);<BR>(2) Why Faramir changed from the books in attempting to take the ring;<BR>(3) Why Aragorn had the pretend death in the movie;<BR>(4) lots of info and interviews with the stunt men at Helms Deep who fell off the walls;<BR>(5) swordplay instruction for almost all the characters (with real swords);<BR>(6) Why Gimli would never marry;<BR>(7) Sean Astin remarking on how Andy pulled them back at one point and ripped off Sean's wig.  He was quite ticked!;<BR>(8) Andy Serkis playing Gollum and growing into the character;<BR>(9) the different styles of swords by each race/culture;<BR>(10) the designing of Rohan with an emphasis on the horse culture;<BR>(11) CGI forgraphics;<BR>(12) Why Shelob was moved from book two/movie #2 to movie #3;<BR>(13) How they got all those people to ride horses (i.e. turns out their was a womens riding club nearby which volunteered with wigs and beards);<BR>(14) viewpoints of various scenes by the actors;<BR>(15) the introduction of Gollum, which includes many drawings, his CGI design and the overall studio design makeup;<BR>(16) emphasis by the drawers/painters of various scenes/background, including the moonlight waterfall forest area where Gollum was almost shot by arrows;<BR>(17) How Viggo (i.e. the Aragorn actor)broke his toes during one footing; and<BR>(18) extra scenes of the Helms Deep battle, as well as some additional fight scenes with the Wargs.<br />Overall, a great piece of work!!!  Sterling silver quality.
B000089RVX|1.0|I bought this album based on hearing one song off of it. While Amy Lee's vocals are quite good, I was shocked at the poor technical quality. There are several digital glitches in the recordings. Didn't anybody listen to this before it was released? This album will not help future sales of Evanescence.
B000003S0D|4.0|Although certainly one of the weakest Krimson albums (not saying much, is it?) this is still a pretty good album. The album is more of a whole expirience for me rather than a track-by-track one, which isn't a bad thing. The whole feel of the album is extremely Jazzy and progressive, which works well. The weakest link is definately the vocalist Gordon Haskell, as another reviewer said, he sounds amateurish and very weak compared Greg Lake. The high point of the album is the 23-minute Title track, especially the Prince Rupert Awakes track, in which Jon from Yes guest vocals. The lyrics are also very good, more exotic and strange than before.<br />Overall, it is a great and underrated album from the ProgGods of King Crimson.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I ordered the cd after seeing the show for the first time on November 6th... I have been listening to it non-stop since it arrived here Tuesday afternoon.  I saw the show a second time about two weeks after my initial visit--I'm planning to go a third time in January.<br />This is a fabulous show--not only because of the amazing story, but because the music moves you even without being there to see the action.  While it's great to get the CD, it's so much better to see the show so you can understand what's going on, since it's just the songs, and not all the dialogue.<br />My favorites are \\"What is this Feeling,\\" \\"Dancing Through Life,\\" \\"Popular,\\" \\"I'm not that girl,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"As long as You're Mine.\\"  I encourage anyone interested to check out the official site at [...]<br />Besides WICKED, the only other musical I've ever been into was Phantom.  But I was never half as obsessed with it as I am with WICKED.  Idina Menzel does an amazing job as Elphaba, Kristin Chenoweth is the perfect Glinda (think Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods).  I can't say enough good things about the cast or the show. :-)
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore's score for the final installment of Lord of the Rings is a delight for the ears. It truly matches the great scale of the battles and dramatic moments that unfold on the screen. Shore's ROTK score picks up where The Two Towers left off by expanding on the kingdom fanfare that he created for the Two Towers with Towers' tracks like &quot;The Riders of Rohan&quot; and &quot;The King of the Golden Hall&quot;.<br />What is most prominent in the ROTK score is the use of a heavy drumline who's involvement in the score keeps growing as we come closer to the colossal &quot;final battle&quot;<br />Indeed the entire score is a build up for the Battle of Pelennor where the epic battle of Gondor is played out stridently with horns, and a choir. Sadly the CD is missing most of this. You will have to journey to your local theater for a complete appreciation for all of Shore's musical efforts.<br />It's a great CD even if most the of tracks are incredibly short. My neighbor(also a lover of classical music) was clearing fallen branches in his yard when he heard me playing track 4 &quot;The White Tree&quot; which which starts slowly and builds to a rousingly powerful crescendo of horns and rushing strings. He came to my door and asked what I was playing.  I told him it was the ROTK soundtrack. Do you know that this man left the mess of branches in his yard and jumped in his car and headed off to the nearest music store! Fans of great epic scores won't be dissapointed.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|If it is true that they saved the best for last in terms of the film, then the soundtrack is likewise, the BEST of the three movie scores.<br />Breathtaking and majestic.  Annie Lennox does it justice with the theme song.  You can almost picture the images from the movie in your mind as you listen to the music.<br />I highly recommend this.  It'll leave you wanting more.
B0000640VN|3.0|This delightful comedy in which two people torn apart in time falls in love gives you lot of entertainment.<br />Hugh Jackman as Leopold Alexis Elijah Walker Gareth Thomas Mountbatten is delightful, to say the least. He's what every woman would want of, as their suitor. Meg Ryan reprises the shades of her earlier roles as the distressed damsel and succeeds yet again. Director James Mangold..
B0000399WI|5.0|this movie is one of my favorites of all time. tim robbins and morgan freeman blend fabulously well together with the support of several very good fellow prisoners who's actual names i do not know. tim robbins plays a man who is falsly accused of murder and sent to a prison called shawshank. he is unlike any other man there. i dont want to give away the ending and by saying anymore, i will. so thats it. one thing i must insist on to anyone who watches this is watch it the whole way through without getting up to piss or anything because it will ruin the movie. so go out and rent this as soon as possible and prepare to be amazed. if i could, this movie actually deserves six stars. this is so good.
B00008L3NK|4.0|This is all very well done. Harnoncourt is one of the best Strauss conductors alive, and the Vienna Philharmonic can play this stuff in their sleep, though they're wide awake here. When these musicians are in a groove it's Viennese swing. The DVD is a different version and better version than the PBS broadcast, which is rather dumbed down. Here, you get complete performances with only occasional extra-musical interruptions. No host, thank god.
B000089RVX|5.0|With an ever-deadening music scene and ever-declining music sales, Evanescence is bringing the music scene to life with its unique Goth-metal-balladeering sound.<br />This entire CD resonates life, spirit, strength, and vitality.  It is a breath of fresh air when compared to the overtly commercialized propoganda that is passed off as &quot;music&quot; today.  Simply put:  the American public is getting very tired of the malarkey that the music industry is spinning and calling music.  It's tripe and trash, for the most part, and simply isn't worth purchasing.  Thus, the declining sales.<br />Create good music and people will buy it.  Create bad music and people will not.<br />We, the people, are not as bad as the majority of music today would have others to believe.  The ears of the heart always recognize good music, and Evanescence is five stars good.<br />I'm already looking forward to their next CD.  Until then, I have made copies of the CD to listen to in my car and at work, while the original remains at home.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is a great CD! It really brings out a new sound that was not present in previous Chili Peppers music, and lots of good guitar melodies. Some of my favorites are &quot;Californiacation&quot;,&quot;By the Way&quot; &amp; &quot;Scartissue&quot;. I recommened this CD to anyone, not just previous fans.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|I was late coming to appreciate Derek Trucks (took the Allman Brothers latest, HITTING THE NOTE, and The Flecktone's LITTLE WORLDS on which he makes a guest appearance, to get my interest). Quickly I've collected the last three of his Band's recordings and this has become my favorite. It holds together well.<br /><br />My first impression of Trucks is that he is the incarnation of Duane Allman, or at least part of him. I'm not the first to get this impression. It makes me happy to feel our culture is getting stable enough to begin recognizing such continuity. Now, if we can just do so without enshrining the pop artists in religion (a la the tulkus of Tibet).....So after taking notice of this guy I go back into my collection and hear him on a Col. Bruce Hampton retrospective, playing electric sitar with the Col. at age 3. And Derek is playing slide! This guy obviously has natural talent, but it is talent he is serious about developing too.<br /><br />What matters is that he can play well, and encourage others to do so too. Trucks plays like a whale moving easily through the depths, and his band moves easily between styles, from reggae to jazz to blues, to latin, middle eastern, and oh yes southern rock. (This CD is predominantly jazzy, check out JOYFUL NOISE for more eclectic variety.) I really like Kofi's flute playing here. It is a treat to have a modern and young band use the flute prominantly. The sense of creativity and exploration is refreshing. These songs are nothing flashy in isolation, pretty underspoken actually, but together make a soothing, uplifting and yet grounding experience.<br /><br />The bonus (on computer) interview is great, it really opened my eyes to this young artists intelligence and depth and gave me cause for joy about the future of music.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let It Be (either version) is often cited as one of The Beatles' worst recordings. It's worth considering how it would be received if it had been made by, say, an unknown band that fell off the face of the earth after making it. My opinion is that people would hail it as a classic. That's how good these guys were. The standands they set for themselves -- and the expectation we had and continue to have of them -- were simply amazing.<br />On to the Naked release, in my opinion the production makes most of these songs better than they were in the Spector version. In general, the differences amount to fewer strings and more Billy Preston. A couple of exceptions to my preference for the Naked mixes: I like Spector's version of Let It Be much better, as the heavy guitar line in the middle of the song provides a needed contrast. The version on Naked is much closer to the version released as a single. Second, I like the original version of The Long and Winding Road, because Spector's treatment provides a little distraction from the fact that it isn't that strong of a song, lyrically or musically. <br />I never bought the Anthology sets (no need, given that I have all of the CD's and LP's) so I didn't realize that at least some of these takes were already available. I don't mind the two deletions (Dig It, Maggie May) and I love the addition of Don't Let Me Down, which I only had on the 1967-1970 LP. But that's just me.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears... the biggest female pop icon to grace our radiowaves since Madonna. With sales of 55 million copies worldwide concerning her first four albums,fan-mania not seen since the days of the Beatles, a merchandise empire of vast proportions, she is an icon, the symbol of our generation and will be what people remember when they look back on these times in years to come. She has spawned countless imitators such as Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson and CHRISTINA AGUILERA (!), and has even been successful enough to create a whole legion of 'Anti-Britneys' such as Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne, who have only ironically served to cement Britney's reputation as trendsetter, you know you've made it, when a world-wide backlash occurs! She has topped the Forbes poll, performed ceremony stealing performances (ahem..Madonna anyone?), signed the biggest and most lucrative deal with Pepsi in the company's history, has earned countless revenue for sold out world tours and who's actions, no matter how fickle have mostly created major controversy and speculation worldwide. She has been named a questionable role-model for young girls due to her infamous dress sense which has been imitated but never bettered, and her brands of bubble-gum pop and most recently R'n'B, are as well known to most people as baked bread! Britney has had a rollercoaster of a career and only time will tell if she is able to hold onto the momentum of world's biggest pop act, but anyway onto the album review....<br />IN THE ZONE<BR>This record is Britney's most personal yet, and is a major ride through the sensualities of early adulthood of which she is currently living through. Britney's 'party year' has been documented well in the media for the past year and during her 'absence' (HAA!), prententious contenders such as Jessica Simpson and most noticeably Christina Aguilerah ave been eyeing for the pop-princess crown, but alas, their efforts have amounted to nothing. Britney began her comeback in August of this year with a scandalous performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in which she performed with Madonna, Christina and Missy Elliot. The scale was nothing short of spectacular and the infamous kiss which our favourite princess and Madge shared which the peak accumulated to has become iconic. Of course, Madonna also locked lips with Christina too, but the humiliation which Chris most likely suffered through, after she was barely acknowledged probably made her wish she never accepted. This set the pace for the Madonna-Britney duet then in the making 'Me Against the Music', the video which featured the past and present pop queens frisking around each other with lesbian undertones was a suprise flop in the U.S., although a major hit worldwide. However this had no effect on Britney's album sales. 'IN THE ZONE' was released on November 18th and flew straight to number one on the Billboard album chart, and sold 603,00 copies in the first week. What's more, it has already been certified double platinum in five weeks, a great achievement no matter how you look at it.
B000026C3T|5.0|a very good compilation of their best work.  Some really good stuff is missing, such as the rest of IV, but the earliest to the latest is here. For the cracked out Communication breakdown, and Whole lotta love, to D'yer mak'er, All my love, and Kasmir, this is pretty thorough.  Of coure, it has the prerequisite black dog and stairway, 2 of my favorites and many others of course. The sound quality however suffers a bit on some songs, as I notice they are more muffled.  I can only guess this is due to the poor original recordings.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had not known that this show was on DVD, I turned round so to speak and there it was; I was thrilled.  When it was on the air I tried like crazy to see the episodes but you know how Friday nights can be.  This show drew me in immediately.  Each character has a certain something that brought me close.  First class.  Unfortunately it could not stay on the air, there were no bumbling fathers, unruly children, no getto booty babes, no eating of larva, no black/white stereo types.  The writer would not let FOX insert a laugh track over fart jokes so the plug was pulled.  If only the FOX execs were on life support, I'd gladly return the favor.
B000007492|5.0|My God.  Supertramp. How could I have missed out on this and so much classic rock, having to instead be subjected to the sonic nightmares of today?  Ok enough melodrama, this hits album is greatness. Crime of the century is definitely Supertramps best, followed by Breakfast in america.  Appropriately a great # of songs from both albums are here, including my favorites: The logical song, Bloody well right, Take thel ong way home, Crime of the century, Dreamer, and Hide in your shell.  They can only be called masterpieces.  pop perfection if you will.  However on a critical note, the lyrics just dont fit the music. The music is catchy, happy, melodic.  The lyrics dark and often brooding and apocalyptic. Still, dont let that sway you, this album is very lcose to musical perfection in my humble little 21 yearo ld opinion.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys has done a superb job on her second CD. She has injected herself right smack into old school. Her full bodied musical effort conjures the street corner harmony of The Delfonics with a generous tinge of Teena Marie inspired musicianship. To just say I absolutely love this CD doesn't even come close to describing the total listening pleasure it gives me. The many no-talents ( 50 Cent, G Unit, Ashanti...) spitting out jive CDs need to take notice of this more than stellar CD.<br />It is in a class all to itself.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John. Damn. 30 top 40s since the 70's, countless platinums, an amazing personality and charisma, timeless music, and the wonderful lyrics of oft neglected Bernie Taupin. It really doesnt get any better. This compilation covers his 30+ years very well, although Id personally include a few songs like &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;country comfort&quot;. Also, where is the border song? It was on the 70s hits album and I cant see why such a great song was ommitted here. Still,  nitpicking aside this album is enjoyable from beginnig to end.  The Disney singles could be a bit overplayed and tiresome now, but otherwise this is pure rock/piano GOLD. Nay platinum.  GET IT NOW.
B0000DIXRU|3.0|This album is alright...<br />I'm not giving it 3 stars because of the change like some people might have mentioned, I knew Anathema would be changing as soon as I first listened to &quot;A fine day to exit&quot;.<br />This CD is just too mixed up with different sounds. I think they should have stuck with ONE sound...female vocals, computerized vocals, 1 or 2 more &quot;hard&quot; songs and the rest reminds me of stuff from &quot;judgement&quot; and &quot;a fine day to exit&quot; Its too much, they are such great musicians and some of the songs are amazing but this album as a whole just doesn't do it for me. In a way I think this was just an experimental album, maybe the next will be a little bit more focused, I'm still a hardcore fan anyways =)
B00001ZWBQ|4.0|Love them, or hate them, the Bee Gees are absolute legends.  This concert demonstrates that in no uncertain terms.  Almost every hit is included here. While some songs have been trimmed to allow for a melody of sorts, it no way detracts from the magic of them.<br />A particular tender and enjoyable moment is when the Barry Gibb teams up with the late Andy Gibb via video for &quot;Don't Throw Away Our Love&quot;.  This will surely give you shivers up your spine.<br />A DVD which has been re-released twice.  The latter features a DTS soundtrack which gives the concert that extra bite!  A law should be introduced so that DVD producers must release concert DVD's with DTS sound at all times.  It really makes a difference.
0316666343|5.0|This book was so great, I would recommend it to anyone. I wasn't sure at first if I wanted to read it, but after I read her other book &quot;Lucky&quot;, I knew that I had to buy it. <BR>If any of you ladies need a good read over the holidays, read &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;.
B000002U9P|4.0|&quot;Private Dancer&quot; came out in 1984, hailed as the ultimate comeback album.  In mid 1986, she released &quot;Break Every Rule&quot; but critics panned it, while others said it came out too late to flow on from the successful &quot;Private Dancer&quot; album.<br />I personally love this album, it contains some great dance tracks &quot;Typical Male&quot; and &quot;Break Every Rule&quot; through to some power ballads &quot;Paradise is Here&quot; and &quot;Girls&quot;.  Mark Knopfler returns after writing the &quot;Private Dancer&quot; track to give us &quot;Overnight Sensation&quot;.<br />In a way, the album flopped.  Radio in Australia picked up &quot;Typical Male&quot; and &quot;What you Get is What You See&quot; but then lost interest. The single &quot;Break Every Rule&quot; was the album's best single, and had number 1 written all over it.  Radio chose to ignore it, and then the album was quickly forgotten about.<br />How does it sound today?  Ok, it has alot of 80's synthesizers sounds through it, but there are some gems on it.  It doesn't have the timeless sound of the &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; album, but is still worthy of a place in your collection.<br />Go Tina!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Get Born by Jet is without a doubt the best album of 2003!! They have resurrected the lost era of rock'n'roll. Get Born has a ton of catchy riffs and is a definate must-buy CD. Jet will surely win heaps of awards at the 2004 ARIA's for this whoop-@$$ debut album.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido's impressive debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; was released in 2000. And Dido enjoyed the wave of success the album received ie. it gained more interest in 2001 and 2002. Over three years later, Dido releases a long awaited follow-up &quot;Life for Rent&quot;.  My first thought was &quot;Why such a short tracklist after keeping fans waiting so long?&quot;. <br />The first listen of &quot;Life for Rent&quot; left me thinking &quot;this is a bit dull&quot;. But the second listen, the album began to take shape.  The actual single &quot;White Flag&quot; becomes the least interesting track which is amazing in itself - perhaps it has suffered from radio overkill?<br />Despite the many negative reviews of this album, I urge all Dido fans to buy the album and give it a chance.  Upon second and third listen, all the tracks start to take shape.  Just a pity we only get 11 tracks.  I consider that after three years of waiting, fans deserve a few more.
B000002J27|4.0|In early 1975, Peter Gabriel stunned the music world when he announced he was leaving Genesis for a solo career. Could there be a Genesis without Gabriel? Equivalent to, say, Jethro Tull sans Ian Anderson, or the Stones without Jagger or Zeppelin without Robert Plant? Most had their doubts, but against the odds, the band soldiered on, and with drummer Phil Collins taking over on lead vocals, released &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; (8 tracks, 51 min.) in February, 1976.<br />Perhaps anticipating the worst, the music industry's collective jaw dropped at the opening sounds of &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot;, starting off the album with a blaze and never letting up: &quot;How can Genesis be so good without Peter Gabriel?&quot; &quot;Entangled&quot; is perhaps the best song ever that Tony Banks and Steve Hackett co-wrote, just mesmorizing. &quot;Sqonk&quot; proves that the &quot;new image&quot; Genesis can rock harder than ever before. &quot;Robbery Assault and BAttuery&quot; showcases Tony Banks' wizzardry on keyboards, just great. The album &quot;tails&quot; off a bit with the title track and the instrumental &quot;Los Endos&quot;, rehashing the musical themes of the album's tracks.<br />But that's minor quibble. It's hard to imagine know, knowing the succes that laid ahead still for Genesis, but in 1975 it was not at all clear the band would survive Peter Gabriel's departure. &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; answered that challenge, and then some!
0767817486|4.0|Many reviewers ridicule the method used to try and smuggle the drugs in this movie, but back in the early 1970's (when the film was based) these kind of methods actually took place.  Yes, people are stupid for doing these things ... but it's hard not to have compassion for them when they are served lifetime sentences.  <br />&quot;Midnight Express&quot; explores one man's time in a hellish Turkish prison.  The tension of being caught and then beaten in prison are so well captured that you almost don't want to look.  One scene that comes to mind is when Davis is hung upside down and beaten so bad, you can almost feel it.<br />Davis performance is exceptional, yet did not give him the career you'd expect.  An excellent actor, who died at the age of 41.<br />The DVD itself is excellent too.  An impressive widescreen transfer, plus a full screen option thrown in for people who dont know the value of widescreen (ie. a pointless inclusion in my opinion).  The DVD also boasts a 1978 documentary of the film, and a trailer.<br />A must own!  One of the best prison films to date, along with &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;.
B000002J2B|5.0|1976 was quite a year for Genesis. In February the band released &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;, affirming that there was life after Peter Gabriel. Less than 10 months later, Genesis came back with another full-length album, &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. (Can you imagine it today?)<br />&quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (9 tracks, 50 min.) is musically more developed and fleshed out than was &quot;A Trick of The Tail&quot;, you can just sense the band (and Phil Collins in particular) becoming more confident. &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot; starts the album off with a blaze. The standout track is the majestic and epic &quot;One for the Vine&quot;, has Tony Banks written a better song before or since? A radio-shortened version of Mike Rutherford's &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; became an unexpected modest hit (paving the way for the more commercial Genesis years starting with &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot;). Steve Hackett's fingers are all over &quot;Blood On the Rooftop&quot;, with beautiful Spanish guitar solos. The instrumental &quot;Unquiet Slumbers&quot;/&quot;Quiet Earth&quot; medley remains a fave of mine.<br />As any long time fan of Genesis knows, this album really is the end of prog-rock Genesis. Although the band would certainly continue to record prog-rock songs here and there, no album would ever be able to recall the heights of &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot;. My very first &quot;real&quot; rock concert ever was when I saw Genesis on the Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; tour in Brussels in June, 1977 (that tour was memorialized with the live album &quot;Seconds Out&quot;). I remember it as if it was yesterday. It has fueled  my love for live concerts ever since.
0783223218|1.0|Even with nothing better to do this film was a total waste of time.  It hurt's to watch each and every moment of this movie-- especially if one compares this cheap imitation, with its overblown, and overbombed scenes to the original Day of the Jackal.  By the last scene it left me calling for the blow up of the first lady to bring some interest to the movie.
B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis toiled away in relative obscurity after the &quot;Tresspass&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; albums, but gained major attention with &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (8 tracks, 53 min.), issued in November 1973 (can it be already 30 years ago?).<br />The reason for gaining the attention was that the band's songwriting had taken a quantum leap. It is demonstrated immediately by the opener &quot;Dancing With the Moonlit Knight&quot;, a gorgeously crafted track. It was also helped by the single &quot;I Know What I Liked&quot;, a likeable singalong and modest hit in the UK. But the strenght of the album lies in the epic &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; and &quot;Cinema Show&quot;, both showcasing Tony Banks on keys, and concert staples for many years to come. &quot;More Fool Me&quot; is an unassuming little track, famous now for having drummer Phil Collins singing lead (which would prove ominous after Peter Gabriel left Genesis in 1975).<br />In all, &quot;Selling England&quot; is, despite the rise in acclaim and attnetion, the last album Genesis album &quot;under the radar screen&quot; but the test of time proves that this is as good an album Genesis released in their &quot;art-prog-rock&quot; era. Simply essential.
0671876813|4.0|Step by step, Honor Harrington moves up in the world.  In the last book, Field of Dischonor, Honor finally defeated her nemesis, Pavel Young (Earl North Hollow), once and for all.  Also, Denver Summervale, the mass murderer from the first books, finally bites off more than he can chew.<br />But, alas, though the Queen, Prime Minister, and Naval Brass support Honor privately, politics dictates sending her away to please the opposition in the House of Lords.  So, without a command, she goes to Grayson to take an active role in running her steading.  Naturally, there are still malcontents like the crazy cleric Marchant and the steadholders Mueller and Burdette who would just love to kill her off and turn back the clock.  Then, to top it all off, the Havenites have decided to invade Grayson again.  Fortunately, Admiral Matthews and Protector Mayhew decide to give control of their growing fleet to Honor, and the Peeps will never know what hit them...<br />This is a great book, the culmination of all before.  With north Hollow out of the way, Honor now takes on Grayson society and struggles to prove that she is not only a hero in war but in peace as well.<br />Honor is good as always, but, like in the last novels, I enjoyed even more reading about her friends and colleagues.  In the last book it was the Queen and White Haven as well as Henke, McKeon and crew (especially the security chief).  Now the spotlight is also on Clinkscales and Major LaFollet as well as the engineers of the Sky Dome Project, Protector Mayhew and High Admiral Matthews, and Reverend Hanks.  It is great when Harrington discovers that her flag captain will be none other than former Peep Captain Alfredo Yu (then also finds out her chief of staff is Mercedes Bingham).<br />All of these characters shine.  Mueller, Burdette, and Marchant are just as rotten as Pavel Young ever was, and danger after danger confronts Harrington from the war with Haven to the Sky Dome Project to wrangling with rival steadholders.  Of course, Honor will come out on top:  it is the journey there that is the most exciting.<br />So read this book...ers.  Of course, Honor will come out on top:  it is the journey there that is the most exciting.<br />So read this book...
B000001E18|4.0|Somewhat surprisingly U2 came back one year after the seminal &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; with another album. What initially was going to be an EP of a couple of songs was fleshed out into a full-blown album while the band was doing the &quot;Zooropa&quot; tour.<br />&quot;Zooropa&quot; (10 tracks, 51 min.) is overlooked in U2's overall output as an &quot;afterthought&quot; but in fact is a strong, albeit more experimental album. The title track is one of U2's best songs, epic in every aspect. The single &quot;Numb&quot; is one of U2's most misunderstood and underappreciated songs. &quot;Lemon&quot; is U2's idea of &quot;disco&quot;, and works just great. &quot;Stay (Faraway So Close)&quot; was later used as a soundtrack for a Wim Wenders movie. &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay&quot; is a great experimental &quot;scratch-and-grind&quot; track. The close-out track &quot;The Wanderer&quot; finds Johnny Cash on lead vocals, eerily preminicious of his later 90's albums. Beware: there is a &quot;hidden&quot; track after that: a 30 sec. electronic &quot;bleep&quot; of sorts... wow!<br />In all, this is a great U2 album, although not as commercially accessible as &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and hence regretfully overlooked. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Can you imagine what it must have been like for Julian Cassablancas (lead singer and main songwriter of the Strokes) to face the pressure after the acclaimed &quot;Is This It?&quot; album to come up with a new batch of songs that would prove the Strokes are not a one-album wonder? I can't, honestly, but somehow he did.<br />&quot;Room on Fire&quot; (11 tracks, 33 min.) stays the same line as its predecessor album, and that is a good thing. Opener &quot;Whatever Happened&quot; sets the tone. &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; finds the band putting some reggae undertones in their sound, and it is the best track on the album. &quot;12:51&quot; (first single), with a tip of the ol' cap to the Cars, is so catchy that it's &quot;barely legal&quot;. Other standout tracks include &quot;Between Love &amp; Hate&quot;, the band's first &quot;ballad&quot; &quot;Under Control&quot;, and the hard-charging &quot;The Way It Is&quot;.<br />So many albums these days are overly long. Coming in at a crisp 33 min., the sound is tight all around and just doesn't let up. If it sounds too close to &quot;Is This It&quot;, that's a good thing in my book. &quot;Rooms on Fire&quot; is excellent all the way through, with not a second wasted. Do you have 33 min. to spare?
B000002J1S|5.0|&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (2 CDs, 23 tracks, 93 min.) is epic in every aspect, and along the way became the breakout album that put Genesis on the musical scene as one of rock's premier bands. Released in November, 1974, it remains as fresh today as it was 29 years ago. (Note to label: what about a 30th anniversary revisit?)<br />CD1 (11 tracks, 45 min.) starts off with the rolling title track. &quot;in the Cage&quot; is one of the highlights, with an unleashed Tony Banks on keyboards. &quot;Back in NYC&quot; is a menacing, hard pounding track. &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; is the hit single, recalling &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; from 1973's &quot;Selling England&quot; album. The ballad &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; became a concert staple.<br />CD2 (12 tracks; 48 min.) is the more experimental side of the album, with tracks like &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, &quot;The Lamia&quot; and the &quot;Colony of Slippermen&quot; medley, just beautiful. One of the things that stand out on the album is the incredible lyrics of Peter Gabriel, as he counts the story of Rael, full of words-smithing and word-playing. (Fun fact: Peter Gabriel agonized over the name of the main character, finally settled on Rael, only to find out post-factum that same name already had been used by Ray Davis (The Kinks) in one of his mini-epics!)<br />This album does justice to the great art of double &quot;concept&quot; albums such as the Who's &quot;Tommy&quot;. Lost in the translation to CD is the great art work (by Hypnosis, also found on Pink Floyd albums such as &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;) of the original vinyl issue. The sound on the remaster edition is exquisite, though. Peter Gabriel would leave Genesis after this album, but Genesis proved there was life after Peter Gabriel, and then some!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I missed the US showing of this film at the Rez Fest in San Francisco, but now thanks to DVD I've gotten to enjoy it.<br />The animation is stunningly smooth, and while obviously computer assisted makes me feel nostalgic for the Matsumoto anime of my youth (Star Blazers, etc)<br />I think the thing that impressed me was the visual story telling quality.  Details are planted throughout to allow you to understand what is going on, withough being heavy handed and over obvious.<br />If you like Anime or like Daft Punk, give this disc a spin, you'll enjoy the heck out of it.  If you like both, you'll love the combo.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I have never felt ill after watching a movie until i watched this film.  Between the horrrific violence of the rape scene and the head bashing in the gay S&M club, i actually felt violated for watching it.  The film seemed more like a snuff film then anything else.  There was no need to make it, and no need for us to watch it.  I don't believe all films should be touchy feely feel good crap (though those films have there place), but this pushed the limit to an unimaginable point.  If you buy this or rent it, be prepared to feel sick (if you have a conscience).  Avoid this if you have a weak stomach at all.
0780021150|4.0|M (Fritz Lang, 1931)<br />It has been said that behind every crime story ever committed to film lies the shadow of M. That may well be true, though Lang (and others) were making crime dramas long before this (the first Dr. Mabuse movie was made nine years previous, for example). Still, there is a great deal here to warrant the speculation.<br />Loosely based on the story of Fritz Haarmann, the Werewolf of Dusseldorf (whose story was also the basis for the more recent Tenderness of the Wolves), M is the story of a child murderer, Franz Becker (the screen debut of the astonishing Peter Lorre), and the simultaneous attempts by the police and a crime syndicate to track him down. The suspense builds quickly (perhaps too quickly; the restored version, released in 2000, is almost twenty minutes shorter than Lang's original theatrical release) as Becker tries to evade both the law and the criminals while plying his trade.<br />The film might have been a simple crime thriller, above average but not really rising head and shoulders above the crowd (in the same way, for example, Hitchcock's The Thirty-Nine Steps is enjoyable, but it's not Psycho or North by Northwest) but for one thing: Peter Lorre. He almost sleepwalks through the first three-quarters of the film in an air of perfect menace, uttering perhaps three lines throughout. Then, in the final quarter, when pressed to the wall, he unleashes a stream of monologues so perfectly acted and inexpressibly brilliant that the viewer can do nothing but stand in awe of Lorre's power to both act like a man in fear of his life and engender the sympathies of film viewers everywhere at the same time, despite our knowledge of his guilt. (As a side note, this is one of the many differences between Franz Becker and Fritz Haarmann; the latter was quite happy to die, at anyone's hands, instead of going back to an insane asylum. He protested not at all on his own behalf, after his capture.)<br />It might also be said that behind every criminal trial since also lies the shadow of M, as the contents of Lorre's monologues are now standard defenses in criminal trials around the world every day. But try not to hold that against this compelling, awe-inspiring film. ****minal trial since also lies the shadow of M, as the contents of Lorre's monologues are now standard defenses in criminal trials around the world every day.

B000002GBJ|2.0|I saw Wakeman on stage at the time of his solo career, and I didn't like it. <BR>I heard his solo albums and I never liked them.<BR>Why? I think because it's too much influenced by old classical music, the kind I also do not like.<BR>With the bands &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;Strawbs&quot;, the progressive trend and orientation of the rest of the group was perhaps forcing Wakeman to dig in that same direction, and that resulted in some really outstanding musical discoveries. <BR>But left alone... <BR>Maybe another reason for me not to like the solo albums is my tendency to favor music in minor (which sounds rather sad) as opposed to music in major (which sounds more &quot;happy&quot; if I can say that)<BR>Apart from this, I have to agree that Wakeman is technically very powerful. And lots of my friends did love these albums at the time they came out.<BR>So I suppose it's purely a question of taste in the end.
B000067IW0|3.0|Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (Robert Weine, 1920)<br />It has occurred to me many times over the years since I read my first book about monster movies how Germany dominated world cinema before World War II, and how that's changed since. Depressing. The Germans could do almost as good a job as the Japanese at expressing postwar angst, one thinks. One wonders why the Japanese have a whole industry of extreme horror and the Germans have, well, Jorg Buttgereit.<br />The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is widely considered the world's first horror film. It really isn't (both Fritz Lang and Robert Weine were both making horror movies for years before Caligari came out, along with Lang's stable of directors who did the films his fevered brain turned out he didn't have time to direct), but it may be the first still widely available. It's also a masterpiece of expressionist cinema, and really should be seen by all serious students of film.<br />The story centers around Francis (Friedrich Fehler, who spent much more time behind the camera than before it), who relates the story of his odd past few days to a man he meets while out on a walk. He, his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, who made a slew of anti-Hitler films during World War II after leaving Weine's stable), and the woman they both love, Jane (Lil Dagover, one of Germany's most celebrated actresses right up to her 1980 death), encountered an odd sideshow at the town fair. Run by one Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), it's an exhibition of a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt, best known for Casablanca) who has supposedly been asleep for a quarter century, and now can be awakened for short periods by Caligari. The day the fair comes to town, a series of murders begins, and Francis becomes convinced that Caligari is using Cesaire to commit the murders. The truth, however, is far more complex...<br />Modern viewers who aren't used to silent film will probably be bored, or at least annoyed; depending on which version you get, the background music can be horribly inappropriate for the material, and let's face it, a lot of moviegoers today don't have the patience for subtitles, much less the cards used for dialogue in the silent days. (One longs for someone to do an ambient/gothic soundtrack for this film, as has been done for Metropolis, Nosferatu, and earlier versions of The Phantom of the Opera.) Also, in the silent film days, and especially in expressionist film, facial expressions and gestures are always exaggerated. Caveat viewer, as it were. Those who have gotten used to such things, however (repeated screenings of Shadow of the Vampire should at least give you the idea), will find much to enjoy here.<br />The main thing to point out is the set design. A thousand-word review cannot even begin to say enough good things about the wonderful sets put together by Herrmann Warm and his colleagues from Die Sturm. Everything in this movie, from the windows to the trees, is completely off-kilter. It's a cubist's worst nightmare; there's not a single right angle to be found anywhere on the set (except, arguably, in Conrad Veidt's lower jaw). The acting gives enough that Weine cold keep the between-scene cards to a minimum and the average Joe can still figure out what's going on, so the film's sixty-seven minutes are far more action than words. Weine weaves together subplot after subplot, and while he could be charged with initiating the idea that love triangles cannot end well in film, it works in the context here.<br />Yes, there is a great deal to like about The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. It's not as chilling as Nosferatu, but it's certainly capable of grabbing hold and not letting go. *** ½on you get, the background music can be horribly inappropriate for the material, and let's face it, a lot of moviegoers today don't have the patience for subtitles, much less the cards used for dialogue in the silent days.

B0000C7GG2|5.0|Most people expect to like a CD from the first listening.  Especially Muse because they have already 2 masterpieces on their name.  OSS was better than Showbiz, conclusion: Absolution has to be better than OSS.  Well, it isn't.  The reason is simple: on OSS there are no bad songs, even no bad moments.  Absolution does have some bad moments but the whole album is amazing!  It's a bit different than OSS, with more variation in the songs.  There are more ballads (blackout is absolutely beautiful), there are some serious ear-attackers (Stockholm Syndrome, The Smallprint).  But you can't expect to be satisfied directly from the start.  You have to let it play some times and each time it will sound better.  The highlight in my opinion is the opening: Apocalypse please!  With the beat of the feet, louder and louder, till the piano comes in.  5 stars from me, one of the albums of the year!!

B0000DCGT0|4.0|Seabiscuit does not disappoint.  It is much more than just a story about horse racing.  Seabiscuit explores a full range of human (and animal) conflicts, dreams, loss, hope and victory.  The characters all experience trials and restoration.  Some of the acting and set that is era-related seems staged and too made up, but the story and the main characters carry the day.<br />I was moved emotionally by the triumph of the horse, the jockey, the trainer and the owner.  This is definitely a feel-good movie, because it gives you every reason to feel good about the events in it, plus since it is based on a true story, it is totally realistic and believable--nothing in it is too good to be true--it is good and true.<br />I think you will really enjoy it.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of work by Howard Shore.  The music is beautiful and truly helped ROTK be all that it could be.  The visual splendor of the movie is matched by the majesty of the music; put them together and you have beauty that can move you to tears.<br />There aren't words to describe the emotional resonance of the Gondor theme.  Listen to it while you see the city of Minas Tirith on screen, and it is unforgettable.  There were also other memorable moments on the soundtrack, particularly the battle on Pelennor Fields and the songs featuring Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen).  And as an opera enthusiast, I am of course greatly pleased to have Renee Fleming in a few of the tracks!<br />I am an avid LOTR fan, but Peter Jackson's movies have shown me again and again how pale my imagination truly is.  I was never able to imagine how the songs in Tolkien's books added anything to the story...UNTIL I watched Boyd and Mortensen sing.  If you had told me before that Aragorn sings at his coronation I would have rolled my eyes.  But it was an amazing moment where you once again realize the impact that music can have on the storytelling in a movie!  (Mortensen composed the tune by himself, by the way.)<br />This said, there is one jarring and unfortunate part of the soundtrack.  After the sublime score for the rest of the movie, &quot;Into the West&quot; featuring Annie Lennox a is harsh and jolting return to our own world.  For beauty, it sticks out like an orc in Lothlorien and leaves you missing Enya's song in FOTR!
B000005J08|4.0|I guess sooner or later you have to deal with this guy John Zorn if you're a fan of adventurous and challenging music. The problem is  where to begin. Among his hundred or so in-print releases, where is the best entryway into the Zorn musical circus? My guess would be  to start here. Just drop the needle on &quot;Snagglepuss&quot; and you get an nice four-minute overview of Zorn's channel-surfing aesthetic: free jazz, thrash metal, film music, punk, lounge, twang (name your genre) all reside together to be called upon at a split-second notice, all executed flawlessly with in-your-face production value. Is it art? Sure, in a recycled-pop-culture kind of way, similar to 1960's visual artists like Warhol and Lichtenstein. Is it music? Er, yes, but it's calculated  to the point of being desensitizing (like porn, a Zorn obsession). Being a true New York artist, his idea is not just to push musical boundries but also to make us question what music really is in our modern times and how it should be packaged. Do I recommend it? Absolutely--whether we want to admit it or not, we all occasionally like being the &quot;M&quot; in &quot;S&amp;M&quot;.  It certainly rocks; it just doesn't happen to be terribly sincere. Of course, it doesn't try to be; you have to admire a guy who can name his poison and then (make you) drink it.
B000005HLV|4.0|There's no denying that this is an essential album in Black Metal, but the influence this had left on the BM scene was legendary in itself.  The only thing that prevents me from giving this 5 stars is the absence of Dead's voice.  We already know why he didn't appear on this album. Session vocalist Attila took over the vocal duties for the album and does an OK job of it. Fortunately the album's greatness does not rely on his voice but mostly on the immaculate production.  Euronymous' guitar sound is copied to death now in the genre and Hellhammer's drumming is second to none. They are what made this album a classic along with the production.  Now if you could only have added Dead's voice it could easily have been ranked as the number one black metal album ever. It's still great and ranks up there with the best.

630467578X|1.0|I might have been able to give this movie 2 stars given that there are a few good action scenes in this movie that made it mildly entertaining at times, in reality I would like to give it zero.  I cannot understand how this movie has been able to get some of the glowing reviews it has.  Perhaps this is just because I read the book before seeing the movie, and had heard it was actually a good adaptation of the book.  I notice even the editorial review for this movie mentions it is one of the better adaptations to film.  That is a laughable concept.  A blank screen for 2 hours would be just as faithful.  This movie too a book that had some social relevance, and parallels to our own society, and warped it into a simplistic, moronic action flick.  All real empathy for the main character is gone with the story being changed so greatly.  The only elements that remain the same appear to be a gameshow where people are hunted, the name of the host of the show, and the protagonist, Ben Richards.  Don't even bother watching it, I want the time I lost watching this back, don't waste your time as well.  Go read the book, people need to do that more often anyway, and see what this movie could be.<BR>I've been called a movie snob in the past, but in a case like this, being snobbish seems like a very acceptable way of being.

B0000009SY|5.0|Anyone who dare disparage this disc is obviously a communist, a reader of Ann Landers or perhaps just mentally deficient. Why do some folks \\"get it,\\" while others are left scratching some unmentionable appendage? After a thorough examination of Joe's Garage, and through our exhaustive and comprehensive research into the field of adequacy and metaretrospective skills, I feel that this phenomena of duality can be summed up with but one word: Stupid. (Race, gender and sexual preference failed to characterize any results in this or any of the studies reported in this article, and consequently receives no further mention.)<br />Unfortunately, one of the essential features of ignorance is that the person so afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is in fact stupid. Moreover, to have such information would be a panacea for the offense.<br /><br />I would like to make some simple points here, and these first points are noncontentious: In many areas in existence, prosperity and gratification depend on comprehension, sagacity, or postulation in knowing which rules to follow and which tactics to pursue. This is true not only for committing crimes, but also for many tasks in the social and intellectual domains, such as constructing a solid and logical argument, or designing a punctilious musical endeavor. Secondly, people contrast widely in the perception and strategies they apply in these areas, with irregular levels of prosperity. Some of the information and conjecture that people apply to their behaviors are reasonable and meet with advantageous results. Others, for example the `I love The Backstreet Boys' hypothesis put forward by many adolescent girls, are imperfect at best and stupid or petulant at worst.<br />Perhaps more debatable is this point, when we argue that when people are stupid in the tactics they adopt to achieve success and satisfaction, they suffer a twofold impediment: Not only do they reach inaccurate conclusions and make inept choices, but their stupidity robs them of the capacity to recognize that they are stupid. Instead they are left with the mistaken impression that they are proceeding correctly. As Charles Darwin judiciously noted over a century ago, \\"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge\\".<br />At first, the reader may point to a \\"contrary-evolutionary effect\\" as an alternative explanation of our results. This theory is propounded by some scientists that believe human evolution is now working in reverse, as demonstrated by the current popularity of low-fat mayonnaise, the electric facial-exerciser and television shows like \\"Survivor.\\" Although this fact appears obvious, stupidity is not invariably correlated with actual statistics or success rates. The abnormal endurance of WWF wrestling and the fact that some of the population vote republican demonstrates this effect. Face it, there is nothing more dangerous than a stupid person who thinks he is smart. Eat more Zappa.robs them of the capacity to recognize that they are stupid.

B0000D14JV|5.0|i saw this movie the day after it was released with my best friend and some other people that were involved in a summer group. i think we all enjoyed it. well i rented it and watched it two more times and i still love it just as much as i did when i saw it in theaters. this is the 2nd best disney movie. only to pirates of the caribbean.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead is great band and they have immense achievements (to me, atleast) both lyrically and musically. They are masters of blending styles, masters of using electronics to enhance their sound, but most of all, they are masters of hiding profound lyrics under the surface of seemingly one-dimensional ones.<br />Despite what a lot of reviewers are finding, I just don't see the profoundness. Most of the time I can devise what they are saying and what they mean to say, but I don't think it's their best work in using this skill. In addition, I am finding Thom's voice to be almost incomprehensible; he has never been the clearest vocalist, and I've accepted that, but sometimes, I cannot understand a word of what he's saying.<br />Overall, a good album. Better than a lot of what's out there; good enough to listen to again. I'd say buy if you are a fan of either this band or genre, and hey, you may like it. I was close to liking it a lot, and we all are different. If you are new to the band, I suggest start with \\"Pablo Honey\\" or \\"The Bends\\" then get to \\"OK Computer\\" and so on. <br />Definitely has the Radiohead aspects, (blended music with lyrical subtleties) it's worth a purchase, but simply, not their best.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|I'd actually give this 4.5 stars if it was possible.  It's a fun, varied, and lush sound (includes lots of different backing vocals, hand clapping, funky percussion, horns, flutes, strings, etc).  Nothing sounds out of place and it all seems in keeping with the \\"1972\\" theme.  Besides the 10 excellent audio tracks on the CD, there is also a bonus DVD that has the music video for \\"Love Vibration\\" (which is pretty funny) as well as some videos (mostly footage of the band playing shot on a hand held camcorder) of \\"Suburban Sweetheart\\", \\"Under Cold Blue Stars\\", \\"Christmas with Jesus\\" and \\"Michigan\\".
B00005QCVY|5.0|They've tried to remake this movie, and never as good. It's a Wonderful Life is Classic Jimmy Stewart at his All American Boy best. Typical heartwarming Christmas story that parallels the type of story told by Dicken's in the Christmas Carol. A man that's examining his life and the meaning of his place in the world and his family at the holidays.
0385504209|3.0|I spent a lot of time last semester in a class hearing one of my favorite professors (a brilliant, highly respected medievalist) making fun of this novel. He had read The Da Vinci Code out of curiosity, and Dan Brown's &quot;scholarship&quot; became his joke of the semester. Anyway, I had to read it so that I could be in on the joke. I did enjoy The Da Vinci Code somewhat, but I certainly don't think this is anything to take too seriously.<br />The book was written as Brown's way of advocating an imaginative reinterpretation of history (which several people have made before). I don't really have any problem with this reinterpretation. It's certainly compelling and interesting to read about. He certainly has the right to write it. If you do much research on the subject, though, you'll find that it's oftly improbable, and you'll find that Brown warped a few facts and ignored others. My main problem with the book is that Brown is audacious enough to predict how these ideas would change Christianity and the world, and his predictions show ignorance, particularly of Christian theology. The ideas here aren't all that revolutionary, and even if they were true, they wouldn't change anything. Just some examples are Brown's ideas on women's role and on God's gender that are already in the Bible (though they've often been misinterpreted) and Brown's ideas about Christ's divinity which don't follow logically from his arguments about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.<br />I did enjoy the novel, though. It is compelling and entertaining, but DON'T think this is great literature (my professor was right about it), and don't take these ideas too seriously.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Incredible! This is one of my fave. movies! A beautiful story yet still heart breaking.  It always makes me cry!  The story line works well with animals rather than people, with great comedy from the sidekicks! Amazing animation. This tale sets an example of respect you should give to others no matter how powerful you may be.<br />I remember seeing this film in the cinema when i was about 5-ish and getting traumatized with all the action during the middle of the film, but the ending gives an incredible feel-good and emotional finish. Most children will also be enchanted with this tale of truth, courage, and strong-minded-will-power.
B00005K3O4|4.0|This late 80's movie is cool. Made in the time when movies actually were scary and interesting, not like todays teen slashing \\"I know who you are going to kill next\\" type of crap.<BR>The graphics are classic and so is the story. I picked it up because I was 6 or 7 years old at the time when the movie was being filmed here in my hometown of Watsonville, CA. The old police station is now a city records building and the restaurant scene has being renovated a couple of times and is now a Taqueria.<br />I think hollywood producers really need to look around here again because there is a lot of potential for another type of movie to be made.<br />To the brothers who made this movie: How about a sequal??<BR>\\"Killer Klowns: The return\\"<br />With todays computer animation graphics, this can be huge!!<BR>Can I be an extra on the set, if so you can e-mail<br /><br />Thanks for the time! Enjoy.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|This soundtrack was excellent, as is all the work done by Howard Shore, although it does not quite measure up to the excellence of the Two Towers soundtrack. The movie was also amazing, and a cinematic masterpiece, and although it was not entirely Tolkien's story, it was a good one none the less. The most breathtaking track on this soundtrack was The Steward of Gondor, sung by Billy Boyd, who played Pippin Took in the trilogy, to Denethor, the steward of Gondor. He sings in this heartstopping high tenor voice, and I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie, but when the song comes about, it is the most beautiful scene in any movie that I have seen for a long time. If you are easily influenced by movies, it will possibly make you cry. Just listening to the track made me misty. See the movie, and buy the soundtrack. I promise you it will be worth it.
0385484518|3.0|spend more time with your loved ones, do the things you say you are going to do and be less materialistic.  these are the lessons this book taught me.  it was well worth the 4 hours i spent reading it, but a little short on the $20 i paid.

B000002H4Q|5.0|Far too many people seem to think that the cure should ALWAYS be depressing.  These people seem to think they know what the cure should sound like more than the cure themselves do. <br />The cure is a fine band and wht i like most about them is their music is, in its entirety, an emotional rollercoaster.  Not all of their music will be sad, because no one is sad all the time.  Don't be turned off by the &quot;too poppy&quot; label of this and other &quot;lesser&quot; cure albums, they are fine additions to anyone's collection.
B000002GJH|5.0|great CD, a tribute album by soundgarden and MLB, along with Ed Vedder (current PJ + Chris Cornell) for Andrew Wood, lead singer of MLB who OD'd.  Probably Cornell's best album.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Please take the time to watch both CDs in this set.  The first is the actual concert in running order complete with all the eastern music that Harrrison is so famous for bringing to the West.  The second, an edited down version that was the theatrical release with fewer songs but containing interviews with the participants with insights into the life of a very private, honest, and spiritual man.<br />As someone who had his musical awakening from the live performance of The Beatles on the Ed Sullivna show - I both laughed and cried when I watched the CD.  The musicians on stage and their reason for being there a reminder that the era they celebrated is quickly coming to an end as the participants age and/or die. <br />Harrison's songs are all gems in one form or another and their covers by the people who new and loved him are excellent.  The love on that stage is evident and will surely stir your emotions and memories of the past.  Whether you lived through the era or not . . . this concert has some excellent music worthy of your ears and is a credit to the love and respect generated by one of the great musicins of our time.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's first hit and the album that defined grunge.  Despite Ten selling more and being a better overall album (in my opinion,)  Nevermind is the album that defined what grunge is.  Kurt Cobain's lyrics are great, and the music is also sweet, simple but amazing hooks and riffs...
B0000C6E4D|1.0|she lost it. what was she thinking. why was this cd even released. uhm... let's see. hmmm<br />I think i'll release a cd and put 1 good song (Fallen) on it, make it a movie theme song to gain a few nominations just in time for an oscar and grammy. and then let's see ,  hmmm....<br />oops i have nothing else to put on the cd, so let's use fillers , yes why not! By golly that's an amazing idea pierre! I shall use 9 other filler songs. <br />and i shall rush this cd out , after all i have to release Fallen just in time for that movie. Yes, Yes Pierre , that's a brill idea. Fallen will sell this cd. never mind the 9 other filler songs Pierre, Fallen will be nominated for an oscar and a grammy and by golly pierre , it will sell this cd! <br />never mind if my name goes downhill from there, never mind if i compromise my integrity as an artist, just get that darn cd out, fast and snappy! It'll win a grammy Pierre-  and an Oscar too. Yes oh yes! and everyone will buy it because it has Fallen on it and Fallen will win a grammy and an oscar Pierre! Yes oh Yes Pierre! Let's do this!
B00005JMCN|4.0|Like &quot;Breaking Away&quot; and &quot;Hoosiers&quot; this feel-good film is a great antidote to the blood-and-gore Hollywood keeps churning out.  With no special effects gadgetry or flash, this film makes you laugh, cry and cheer all on its inspiring human drama.  The cast works well together (Tobey Maguire is superb) and Randy Newman's score is wonderfully evocative.  There are many minor flaws and some laughable historical revsionism about the Depression but who cares when you watch some of the most exciting race scenes since Ben-Hur.  This is the only film I paid to see in the theater this year and one of the few I will own.  Do yourself a favor and see it.

B00005JMGC|5.0|The \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\", directed by Mike Newell, is a story about women in society during the 1950s, when they were expected to become educated and then get married and become a mother.<br />PLOT SUMMARY: Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) portrays a single woman in the 1950s who, freshly graduated from graduate school, gets a job working as an Art History professor at the exclusive Wellesley College for women in Massachusetts. Katherine is shocked when she learns her students have already fulfilled the requirements in their syllabuses by the very first class, and decides to stray against the rules by showing the girls modern art and teaching them that they have a choice in life besides becoming a housewife and mother. Katherine shares a special bond with her students, though a few students really stand out. Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is a \\"proper young lady\\" who quickly gets married because her family wants her to and soon learns about marriage the hard way--she becomes rebellious towards Katherine's teachings in the meantime; Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) is a bright and intelligent girl who gets into Yale Law School but must make a choice when she falls in love with a man; and then there's Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is kind of like Katherine herself, except Giselle is a \\"player\\" and likes to fool around with guys...especially men who are a lot older than her. Through these students, Katherine learns about herself and life as she goes against school board rules.<br />MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: The film was a bit feminist in my opinion, but since I'm a bit of a feminist myself, this only made me enjoy the \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" even more. The acting, of course, was spectacular. I was quite surprised by the acting of the younger cast, though I always knew how talented these young women were and expected nothing less from them. Julia Roberts is as good as ever...she never fails to impress me. The storyline was wonderful and so was the dialogue and overall message of thestory. The directing, costumes, settings, etc. were all brilliant. If you are a feminist and like feel-good movies, then you will certainly enjoy the \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\".<br />I highly recommend the \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\".<br />100/100<BR>A+
B0000B1OFL|3.0|This is one of those movies where the actors have a lot more fun than the audience.  The car chases are swell, Charlieze looks gorgeous, but that's about it.  The closest thing to humor is the Napster joke and its a sidesplitter.<br />Come to think of it, even the car chases aren't that hot.  That's because the premise--a traffic jam--isn't conducive to much excitement.  Like that movie they made a few years ago where the cars go against traffic.  Yawn.<br />Mark Wahlberg is stuck with this insincere smile that's as phony as Tom Cruise'.  Oh--for those who want to see more of the &quot;handsome&quot; character, that's Jason Statham.  Pick up a copy of his movie The Transporter and you'll see stunning action sequences--in a movie that probably cost 1/10 as much to make as The Italian Job.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|wow i thought it was just plain bad do not buy it
B000002C1W|3.0|I did like this CD when it first came out, and of course the tour was spectacular.  I was never fortunate enough to see the Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, or The Wall tour.  But I seen Pink Floyd twice during Momontary Lapse, and once during Division Bell.  I also seen Roger Waters 4 times solo, all after Pink Floyd's split.  When this CD first came out, I thought it was a clever reinactment of the Floyd concept albums.  After the dark rather dreary &quot;Final Cut&quot; it was a good change of pace I thought.  But after listening to this CD over the past few CD's now it sounds boring and contrived.  In an interview with Roger Waters the year this came out, Roger said when asked if he thought this was a good album he said it's a good &quot;Copy&quot;.  And thats exactly what it is, an attempt to copy Rogers style, lyrics, and post Dark Side Pink Floyd.  But it failed, and if you dont believe me look at the current and ongoing sales of Momentary lapse Of Reason or Divison Bell compared to the earlier Floyd CDs.  They sell as good as ever, even &quot;Final Cut&quot; out sells Momentary Lapse Of Reason by far.  It's not the type of CD that grows fonder with time.  That's why it isnt a good seller anymore and eventually it will probably be one of the few rare Floyd Cds that go out of print.  I mean 20 years from now because Pink Floyd will last that long and beyond.  After Momentary Lapse Of Reason, Division Bell was a better effort.  Perhaps not great but I would give it 4 stars because Gilmour was being true to himself and the band.  He wasnt trying to make a COPY of a Floyd album with a missing critical member.  Perhaps Divison Bell is a lot like a Gilmour solo album, just like Final Cut was like a Waters solo album (except it was just too dark).  The music is beautiful, but the mood of the music is hard to take.  Division Bell is more upbeat, it's mellow, and the synthizied voice and various sound affects and Water lyrics are replaced with honest work from David and the band. I would suggest Divison Bell over this album any day or of course go back and buy Meddle, Dark Side Of The Moon, The Wall, Animals, or Wish You Were Here.  I give Gilmour a lot of credit for STOPPING after Division Bell.  Believe me the releases wouldnt have gotten any better.  This is an example of a band who knew when to quit, although it's too bad they havent done a tour for the fans that would love to see one more show (preferably with the whole group).  But they think they have to put out a new CD, or they are merely a nostalgia group.  I disagree, they could have toured in support of the Echoes release and it would have been most fitting.  It would have been the only tour they would have neded to do, even if it would have been a much smaller tour (instead of the grueling 1 year stadium outings) that I doubt any guys in their late 50's would enjoy.  That is except for the money hungry Stones, who have cranked out albums LOOOONG after their prime and are now charging $75 to $150 ripping off fans and taking advantage of their loyalty.  Pink Floyd never charged over $35, and stopped making the music before their prime was long past.  I give them a lot of credit, for not being greedy, for knowing when to stop, for having integrity of their great library of music.  With the exception of perhaps Momentary Laspe Of Reason, and Delicate Sound Of Thunder, I would recommend almost anything by Pink Floyd.  They still Shine over 35 years later.
0316286850|5.0|I love playing with new looks and colors and this book is the perfect tool on how to make it easy and fun while getting professional looking results. It will help you discover exciting new looks you never dreamed of and the full potential of every makeup tool you own. The instructions on how to accomplish every look in the book are clearly illustrated step-by-step, making them extremely easy to follow. The advice given by the author comes alive with his own funny anecdotes on discovering and experimenting with makeup.  This book is extremely well organized into three sections. The first one covers the basics of what you need to know about each part of your face, how to apply makeup to each, which tools to use and how to enhance and get the most benefit from your strongest features. The second one shows you makeovers done on ordinary people that look like you and me. It includes before and after pictures that show the impact of well-applied makeup on every kind of skin and color combination. The third section is the most impressive part of the book. It shows known celebrities made up like other celebrities that have established iconic looks over the years. (Look for Lisa Marie-Presley as Marilyn Monroe and Isabella Rosellini as Barbra Streisand).  This book also includes a few male makeup techniques, from the conservative (using concealer and powder) to the adventurous (using eyeliner and eyeshadow) to the extremist (using everything from powder and blush to lipstick and a wig).  Although there are three or four extreme looks in this book that I don't think I will ever try, all of the rest can be applied just as they are or with slight modifications. The great advice, easy to follow instructions, funny anecdotes, if not the great photographs alone, make this book a must buy for anyone who uses makeup regularly or sporadically. It's so rewarding that you won't be disappointed.  I recommend buying Beauty: The New Basics by Rona Berg along with this book to complement the makeup knowledge with the best advice on skin care, hair care and beauty products that's available on a printed format.  --Reviewed by M. E. Volmar
B0000DIXDR|4.0|&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; is a coming of age fable, set in the Catskills. It's the film that made Patrick Swayze a household word, shot Jennifer Grey to the top of the world and had the entire country singing 'I've Had the Time of My Life'. The film tells the story of 'Baby' (Grey), a naive rich kid who goes slumming on the wrong side of the tracks with Johnny, a poor dancer (Swayze). The wrinkle; Johnny's actually a great guy. The cast also features Jerry Orbach - as his usual stoic self, as 'Baby's father.<BR>TRANSFER: A really nice update to the previously released DVD's. This one is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen television displays. Colors are fully satruated, rich and vibrant. Fine detail is beautifully rendered. There's a hint of film grain detected, as well as edge enhancement and the ever so slight hint of fine detail shimmering; but these are nothing to complain about. The soundtrack has also been remastered and cleaned up.<BR>EXTRAS: Lots - but oddly enough, none of them include either interviews with Patrick Swayze, or other cast members even talking about his contribution to the film.  It's like the movie happened without him! - Bizarre!!!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: Have the time of your life all over again. Great fun for the whole family.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine's fine vocals shine on this album. Unlike most Christmas albums, it is not full of over done Christmas classics. Instead, you are treated to alot of original material such as &quot;The Magic of Christmas Day&quot;, &quot;Another Year Has Gone By&quot;, &quot;Don't Save It All For Christmas Day&quot; and others. My absolute favorites are &quot;The Magic of Christmas Day&quot; and the spine-tingling version of &quot;O Holy Night&quot;. Unlike the screechy and annoying Christina Aguilera, Celine actually sings the songs, so you actually know what the lyrics to the songs are. Celine shows off her amazing vocal range throughout the whole album without over doing it. She could teach Ms Aguilera a thing or two about how it should be done. This album ranks up there with other holiday classic albums released by the Carpenters and Mariah Carey. Celine's is certainly to be a favorite for years to come.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|\\"Annie\\" is the original movie based on the highly successful Broadway musical, based on the highly popular comic strip character - little orphan Annie. I'm going to refrain from reiterating the story herein, because I have already reviewed the previously issued DVD. Herein, I am taking the opportunity to lambast Columbia Home Video. <BR>TRANSFER: IT'S NOT WIDESCREEN. Enough said! You can't squeeze a 2:35:1 aspect ratio image into a 1:33:1 t.v. screen so you get what film buffs, such as myself, have been screaming about for years - a chopped up version of the movie (affectionately known as pan and scan)that in no way captures either the scope of the image or the director's original intent. This short coming alone leads me to fail this DVD on all accounts. That the cropped image is quite often blurry, at times hopelessly out of focus, and truly a weak transfer for its color balancing, contrast and black levels, is inexcusable. I'd really like to know why Columbia decided to re-release this movie on DVD. Certainly, no updates to the image quality have been made and worse still - the film is missing 50% of its picture. Misguided doesn't even begin to sum up Columbia's blunders on this disc. Also, the audio remains the same strident mix as before. No audio clean up or noise reduction leads to dialogue sounding way too forward and unnatural, while the songs screech, rather than sing, across your speakers. <BR>EXTRAS: Some, but not enough to make you forget that \\"Annie\\" is just about the most miserable looking DVD experience you've seen in a long while. <BR>BOTTOM LINE: To Columbia executives: get a clue! Get a 'really big' clue. To the consumer - save your money!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is one of DT's best. I've been a fan for almost a decade now. I can be one of their biggest advocates among people who haven't heard them, while also being a critic and expecting a lot from the band I love. TOT blows me away with no hesitations about anything. John P. is amazing yet again with both his shred lead playing and his massively heavy (but still tasty) riffs. However, James, unlike the past few albums, has found a very cool voice to go along with the music. They still have a lot of dynamics including slower parts, without getting wimpy as they did on some of the songs from their last few attempts. I hope their tour comes to Seattle.<br />Get this CD!!!
B0000C1HLF|1.0|The movie is 106 minutes long.  I feel asleep, so I don't know how this ends.  The last scene I remember is people jumping off a roof, then back on the roof, then falling to their death, then coming back to life, then villain turns good guy, then dies again.<br />Confused?  I know I am.  The wire work exceeded what was done in the Matrix.  While the Matrix was a fantasy world, the angels take themselves far too seriously to have their acrobatics believable.  In one of the opening scenes, they were all plunging to their deaths in a stalled helicopter.  Had the helicopter impacted with terrain, the movie could have made a good short film.  I forget how they survive, or why the aircraft took so long to drop, but none of this is really important.<br />It was far less cute than the original - no quick thinking and sharp wit, just lots of flips, blood and explosions with no plot.  While Bill Murray brought the classical comical side to Bosley in the first movie, Bernie Mac's style is awkward and out of place.  People are murdered, stabbed, shot, and drop dead all over the place, which should question the movie's PG-13 rating.  The Thin Man pops in to make a cameo, for no apparent reason, changes side, falls off a roof, comes back, then is horribly murdered - this is where I was so confused that turned the movie off in favor of whatever was on television.<br />Oh, am I giving away the plot?  Not to worry.  There is no plot.  Bruce Willis makes an extremely short appearance, then had his name removed from the credits when he saw how bad the movie was.  Yes, this movie makes the Die Hard series look good.  Jaclyn Smith also makes an appearance and provides several minutes of coherent plot line amid the blood, gore, explosions, and comic strip style special effects - making me wish she had appeared much earlier in the film.<br />Gee - I hope they don't make another one.
B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer was one of Kiss' more experimental albums. It was even more concentrated on improved songwriting than before. It is a ultimately the first focused Kiss album but the focus is shunted through abstract-yet-fragmented  atmosphere rather than through diverse song concepts. <br />Could this be some type of progressive metal? Almost like something Blue Oyster Cult or Alice Cooper had come up with. It would appear as such. I do know that this is arguably more of a Bob Ezrin (a 70's Phil Specter in his own right) fanciful design than a signature Kiss album. (Alice Cooper's unofficial 6th member / producer). Not to descredit Bob, (in fact-it's to Kiss' credit that they had him), but his cartoonish-artsy-oriented ways tend to lead bands in other directions than they would have otherwise moved towards. In fact, Bob would even include hints of \\"Destroyer\\" into Nine Inch Nails 1999 effort, \\"The Fragile\\" (which bob provided final continuity and flow for). <br />In '76, Kiss was finally able to dissolve the public notion that they were merely a theatrical-self-parodic band and thus, incapable of releasing memorable material. Kiss was appearing to be at a comic book status . . . which was a good thing if you were living in the 70's I believe. Gene Simmons was now at a sexual status as we'd come to realize. He had disclosed in the 90's that he had bedded hundreds of women (this may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective). Classic songs such as \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Shout it out Loud\\" gave teenagers a soundtrack to display their own rebelliousness. \\"King of the Night-Time World\\" was also a gem for Kiss fans and converts alike. <br />My ownly personal difficulty with Destroyer was Ace's participation. At the time, he had drinking problems and would not show up for rehearsals faithfully. In fact, on a VH-1 Special which aired around the 2002's Kiss Fairwell tour, Ace listened to portions of Destroyer and shockingly admitted \\"That's Not Me Playing Guitar.\\" Does this mean Ace is nothing but a Milli Vanilli (...). I hope not.<br />This is why I'd still really prefer Ace to be up front about his participation<BR> in the making of Destroyer but regardless it's still fun and essential.
B00009MEA5|4.0|i enjoyed the movie. good way to spend a sunday afternoon. i didn't understand the ending. who were those people that got the 500,000?
6304025831|5.0|I like most people may have thought this was going to be Goodfell<BR>as 2.With the same writer/director,author of novel,and many of the same actors.But no way this was more epic,entertaining,raw,<BR>brutal,and foul so naturally I liked it a little bit more.The only similarity between the 2 movies is Pesci is still the standout only in this he is more foul,brutal,and wild and also he<BR>play's a main role.In Goodfellas De Niro is a tattooed,foul mouth<BR>ed,badass in this he's more conservative,clean cut,and a wuss.I<BR>didn't like the charactor that much but it fit the story perfect.<BR>Great movie
B000002A46|5.0|&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; has something for everyone. I highly recommend it.  What makes me play this cd every year besides the amazing production, instrumentation and background vocals of the Price sisters, Kelly and Shanrae; and Melonie Daniels is Mariah's rendition of &quot;O Holy Night.&quot;  It's my all-time favorite Christmas song and Mariah interprets it with such passion, spirit and heart that it overwhelms me every time, humbling me to want to (and often do) fall on my knees as I remember Jesus' humble birth and great Love and sacrifice for me.  Every single person named inside this cd or that had Anything at all to do with this album I sincerely thank you with my whole heart. This cd will be with me forever and it is obvious this is a group effort.  Bravo to you all!<br /><br />I love all of the religious songs best on this album: (however, all the songs are great!)<br />*  SILENT NIGHT--perfect opening, with whispy vocals and lots of trills of Mariah that are her trademark to me.  No other vocalist has ever impressed me as much as Mariah does with this feature of her singing.<br />*  O HOLY NIGHT--what can I say? Perfect in every way!<br />*  JOY TO THE WORLD--Woo Hoo! THIS IS JOY! ^_^ I believe Heaven and Nature IS singing along with this song! Perfect ad infinitum.<br />*  JESUS BORN ON THIS DAY--backed by a precious children's choir. Splendid keyboards, orchestral programming and digital and synth. It's all these intricate details that make this cd spectacular!<br />*  HARK! THE HERALD ANGELS SINGS/GLORIA (In Excelsis Deo)--What can I say? The highest praise which must be heard and approved of by the Angels on High!<br />*  JESUS, OH WHAT A WONDERFUL CHILD--what a perfect ending! Ties it all together. Leaves me breathless!<br />I believe this to be her Greatest Musical Effort and I sincerely appreciate and am touched to the core by everyone's spirit and outpouring of their heart's love for God! May MERRY CHRISTMAS encourage and edify you as you remember Christ the King and the love of your family and friends, His gifts to you.  May your cup overflow with The Joy that only He gives this Christmas and throughout the New Year.  Draw near to Him and He will draw near to you...<br />Soar!he King and the love of your family and friends, His gifts to you.  May your cup overflow with The Joy that only He gives this Christmas and throughout the New Year.  Draw near to Him and He will draw near to you... <BR>Soar!
B00005JMCN|3.0|It seems that every year, there are a few movies released that know even before they are released that they will be in contention for Academy Awards. An all-star cast, a feelgood story, and solid writing and directing make these films shoo-ins based on the hype alone, but more often than not, they fail miserably. <br />This is where &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; differs from other Oscar vehicles like &quot;Men of Honor&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;. It is a good film. Watching this, I could not help but think of &quot;Rocky&quot;, the one small man (or horse) overcoming overwhelming odds to become a great champion and hero to the people storyline. But like in &quot;Rocky&quot;, this story works, and I'll be damned if I didn't end up cheering for that little horse by the end of the movie. The best parts of this film are the stock footage of the depression era woven in with the actual film, highlighting the importance of the horse in such downtrodden times. The reaction of the people to this racehorse was nothing short of amazing, and this is where the movie manages to get its true heart. <br />The performances are solid, but unspectacular. Jeff Bridges is always good, and Chris Cooper nails another role, plus Tobey Maguire is solid as usual as the quiet, brooding character with a little bit of attitude. The directing is solid, and the race sequences are very well done. <br />&quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a very good movie, bogged down by some boring parts in the middle, but entertaining overall. And surely it will be remembered come Oscar season with a couple of nominations.
B000059HB7|4.0|\\"Rio Bravo\\" belongs on the short list of the finest Westerns ever made. I've never been a big fan of The Duke, but I love his performance in this movie -- playful, tough, sharp-tongued, surprisingly sympathetic. Whenver I think of John Wayne (which I admit isn't all that often) I usually remember him for this role, as well as \\"The Searchers.\\"<br />This is just one of the most entertaining movies ever. It isn't a self-conscious, hyper-ironic or ground-breaking Western, a'la Sergio Leone's films, and it doesn't reconsider violence or the use of force to resolve conflict, as Eastwood did in \\"Unforgiven.\\" \\"Rio Bravo\\" was made before it became fashionable to reinvent \\"old,\\" \\"defunct\\" genres and comment on them. That makes it a breath of fresh air today -- something genuinely fun, an action-comedy of the old school. It sure beats the pants off a lot of contemporary movies.<br />The plot is skillfully set up by director Howard Hawks, but the movie isn't solely his vision. I think of \\"Rio Bravo\\" as an actor's film. It belongs to Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, Angie Dickinson, and of course Ricky Nelson. This is an excellent ensemble cast; each actor works well with his fellows, but also makes his or her own character unique and memorable.<br />Dean Martin's Dude is one of my favorite movie characters -- melodramatic in one sense as Duke's drunken deputy, vulnerable and believable in another sense. When you look at Dean Martin's face in this movie, you get one overriding message: \\"God, do I need a drink!\\" The result isn't unintentional humor, but care and concern for the character. Dean puts it all out there, turning in a great performance.<br />Ricky Nelson is the definition of cool as Colorado, the level-headed young drover, and Walter Brennan earns a lot of laughs as the crusty old turnkey, Stumpy. Angie Dickinson gets a meaty role as Feathers, the \\"scarlet woman\\" of questionable reputation. She and Wayne fairly sizzle in their scenes together.<br />What everyone loves most about this movie is its sense of leisure; yeah, there's a fairly urgent storyline, but by golly, Hawks treats the scenario sort of like real life. There's time for tomfoolery, romance, beer-drinking, and song -- witness the inexplicable scene in which Nelson, Martin and Brennan sing \\"My Rifle, Pony and Me\\" and \\"Cindy.\\" Great stuff!<br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" may at first blush sound like a corny old oater. It's not. Anybody who loves movies should be familiar with this one. It's not as revolutionary as \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" and won't be as well-remembered as some of John Ford's work. But if you're looking for a tremendously entertaining and well-acted film, this DVD belongs in your collection.
0802130208|5.0|This is the funniest book I have read since &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and like that book, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; uses its humour to make a larger point. <br />As we follow around the repulsive Ignatius through his misadventures  in New Orleans, we are reminded that there are really sad people out there, people who live the grandest of lives in their own heads, but in reality are nothing more than hot dog vendors. <br />The strongest parts of this novel are the wonderfully catoonish and hilarious secondary cast of characters, espcially the ancient secretary Miss Trixie. Jones the floor sweeper and Patrolman Mancuso are also well drawn here, and we cannot help but love everybody in this story, even the pseudo-enemy Mirna Minkoff. <br />It is intersting how the life of the author, John Kennedy Toole, seems to follow that of Ignatius. Toole knew he was destined for greatness, but ended up committing suicide in frustration because his book was not being piblished. It is a shame, as he never saw this work published, flourish, and eventually win the Pulitzer Prize. <br />This is an excellent novel, one with a towering wit that should appeal to almost everybody who has a hidden cynic within themselves.
B0000D96NX|4.0|Burn My Eyes again, unbelievable album, thank-god they are back and better than ever.  Although i am a fan of Superchanger and burning red, i am aware of the blades they took.  It's great to see a band that has been around so long and has kept Thrash/Heavy Metal well and truly brutal.  I believe the opening and the last song are the 2 best on the album.  None the less they have compiled a sweet ass selection of songs.  Tearing riffs, angry screams, melodies... Hell Yeah.  If you only buy one album this year, consider this to be well worth your dollars.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney should be more serious about singing and learn the art of siging. She can't sing even with the help of eletronic stuff and voices behind. Her producer is making a lot money selling to lost TEENS. CRAP like this only TEENS and people don't know about music buy. The DESPERATE Madonna tries the survive her fading career singing with Briteny and even giving a her a LESBIAN kiss. Britney should get mature and Madonna must learn she is not a GIRL anymore at 46. Don't buy this CD because you will waist your money.
076790592X|5.0|Don't be fooled by the small size and easy readibility of this jewel.  The lessons to be gleaned from the pages of this little book ought never be forgotten.  The importance of life sometimes gets lost in the everyday living of it, but Tuesdays with Morrie drives home the critical need to enjoy every day, every minute that we have.  I'll read this one again and again, and will recommend it highly to the fast-paced corporate ladder climbers around me.  Mitch Albom has looked into the soul of America and touched her heartstrings with a special kind of music.  Bravo!
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem is still pretty cool and this album is definetly worth picking up if you like this type of thing. Rap music with plenty of explicit lyrics by the man himself, and he's still entertaining me well. \\"Without Me\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" are funny. \\"Sing For the Moment\\" and \\"Till I Collapse\\" are very inspiring. \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" is somewhat depressing and very powerful. \\"Drips\\" is a raunchy porno song. \\"White America\\" is a very truthful song about the United States and how the government affects us, including Eminem. Infact, this anti-politician anthem is a great way to start off yet another great CD.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Like everyone one else, I have my myriad of pet peeves with this CD.  But I think it should be reviewed for what it is, not what everyone thinks it SHOULD have been.  That being said, &quot;Let It Be&quot; was always a nice album.  Two Of Us is a GREAT song.  Some of the others are also bordering on classic Beatles.  This CD, however NON essential it may be, DOES bring out the music in a better way. Sonically, it's beautiful.  Yes, I miss the banter and the orchestra (on some things) and I certainly want the meatier Harrison solo on Let It Be, but they are not here so I won't complain.  I will listen to both versions of the CD but one must admit this CD is MUCH cleaner that the original version.  Just goes to show how badly the whole catalog needs updating and remastering!  It still is a nice album with some great tracks but now it sounds much better.  I left off a star because I hate the name (it should have been called, &quot;Let It Be...PHILtered)and the packaging sucks.  I also think the fly on the wall disc should have included the video for Two Of Us that is on the Beatles.com website.  Uh oh, I am now reviewing this for what it SHOULD have been.  LOL.  We should all Let It Be and no one is twisting your arms to buy it.  But please do, Paul needs the money for the new baby's college education (tongue firmly in cheek).  Happy holidays to all.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence's debut CD is probably the best CD of 2003.  It is loaded with some amazing tracks and interesting lyrics.  This album is not for those people who love their hip-hop &amp; R&amp;B songs more than anything else.  The bands style is somewhat similar to Garbage, but with piano mixed in it as well.  In my personal opinion they go down the lines with a band like Nine Inch Nails, but with a female lead singer.  Amy Lee has a beautiful singing voice, probably five-hundred times better than any of those pop chicks.  I definitely would buy this CD if you liked any of the first few singles.<br />One downside to this CD is that the My Immortal song is not the same version that is played in the music video.  But still this version is a very good one with no guitar riffs and just piano.  But if you are solely looking to buy this album for that song inparticular, you should just buy the import single.
B000002UYZ|5.0|and a perfect companion to the 67-70 set. Giving this less then 5 stars is nuts,in plain english!
B00005JM02|4.0|At first I was very skeptical of this film.  Disney has been putting out nothing but garbage lately, HOWEVAH, this is a Pixar film.  Why they collaborate with Disney when they are heads and shoulders above I do not know, anyway....I had seen Monsters Inc, which was extremely saccharine to say the least, so my skepticism was peaking.<BR>A friend of mine said, you need to see this just for the visuals.  She was right.  The visuals are stunning.  But this is not what won me over.  It was the blue fish Dory, with voiceover by Ellen DeGeneres.  The comedy was perfect.  Not too much, not forced.  I would buy this movie just to watch her character alone!  Just about all the voices in this are great.  At no point does the film drag.  The part with the seaturtles was maybe a little overdone, but overall no big complaints.  <BR>If you are a doubter of animation or especially computer animation give this one 5 minutes and you will probably end up watching the whole thing. This is also not specifically a 'kid's' movie, another plus.
B000003TBP|4.0|Beck's Odelay was a big hit in 1996, and it still remains in heavy rotation on the radio as well as in music lovers' CD changers. This album is no ordinary album, however. Unlike most albums, it appeals to more than one or two music styles. This album will capture the attention of country lovers, rockers, hip-hoppers, grunge fans, heavy metal headbangers, and punks alike. Whether it be twangy country boot boogie, DJ scratchin' hip-hop, detuned heavy metal, fast dizzy punk rock, a slow acoustic daze, or just ambient white noise, this album will be sure to please.<br />The first song starts off in the right direction with a &quot;new-wave&quot; sort of feel. It changes directions many times, going in loops and around the bend, even reaching some hip-hop territory. This is something you'll be guaranteed to hear on every Beck album. Hotwax, probably my favorite on the album is a slow rocker with some country twang, layered on a clipped and distorted vocal line. The album continues on with Lord Only Knows, flip flops to New Pollution, and one of my personal favorites &quot;Derelict&quot;. Following through, Novacane hits hard and leaves you numb; while Jack-Ass brings your groove out. Where It's At, the album's big hit is not one to miss out on. As the album scans through, we find &quot;Readymade&quot;, a good rocker about leaving this town and being sick of the same old thing. The hip-hop induced High 5 sounds like a Beastie Boys parody, but it is a great tune nonetheless. Ramshackle is the closing song of the album; But wait...what's this? Hidden track #14 is a continuum of beeping white noise. Brilliant.<br />Beck's Odelay is a timeless classic, but it's also an album to get you laughing as well. Humor is one of Beck's best qualities, and he displays that nicely on this album.<br />Do yourself a favor and give this one a spin.
B00005JMGC|5.0|I am an unabashed fan of the actress Julia Roberts[...]. Since she is not only the star but also one of the producers of this film, I felt it important to reveal my potential bias right up front. This is an historically accurate, thought provoking comedy that succeeds in both entertaining the audience while reminding us how much society and gender roles in this country have changed in the past fifty years. <br />The plot is simplicity itself, and since it has been detailed in numerous print views I will only outline it in summary form. Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) arrives at the prestigious Wellesley College in the fall of 1953 as a new art history instructor. She has a undistinguished background and her capabilities are immediately tested by the students in her class. She soon discovers that Wellesley is more of a finishing school and \\"marriage prep\\" than an institution preparing its student to use their education to pursue careers and or influence the political landscape. When she uses nontraditional teaching techniques and lessons outside the prescribed syllabus, the fact that she is an \\"enlightened\\" and unmarried woman in that decade of conformity means that her goals are immediately subject to the suspicion of not only the students but also her fellow faculty members and conservative parents and alumni as well. There are all the crosscurrents one would expect, including the obligatory romantic conflict between her previous boyfriend and a male faculty member.<br />The genius of the film is in its execution. Its attention to detail and the accuracy of its portrayal of the fifties is astounding, and probably will seem unbelievable to the young women of today. And while Katherine Watson is clearly the central character, this is really more of an ensemble cast with many fine performances. Kirsten Dunst is Betty Warren, the student who becomes Katherine's nemesis as the protector of the status quo and the controlling senior who wants to direct everyone's lives.Ginnifer Goodwin as a shy girl who eventually achieves the self confidence that she has been so lacking does a wonderful job, as does Julia Stiles as Joan Brandwyn, the senior who consciously decides to become the loving wife and mother rather than pursue graduate studies and a career.  Marian Seldes is also well cast as the college president caught between her conflicting roles as an educator and as the administrator charged with resolving the unease that Katherine has caused within the college's constituencies. Lastly, Marcia Gay Harden as Nancy Abbey, who teaches etiquette and whose overchintzed home is where Katherine lives and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Giselle Levy, who believes in living outside the Wellesley lines and defying Betty whenever possible almost steal the spotlight from Ms. Roberts' performance.<br />This is a hard film to rate, as indicated by the diverse viewpoints of other reviewers. I really enjoyed it but in some ways left the theater also feeling a little unfulfilled. The film asks more questions than it answers, and while the extent of Katherine's influence on her students in the short term is acknowledged; the long term impact is left undelineated. In other words, just as in life itself you wonder what will happen next. But since it so wonderfully portrayed the slice of life that it examined, I decided to round up my rating to five stars. However, be prepared: in the end we moviegoers are left to decide for ourselves whether Mona Lisa's smile is one of happiness or is only to be true to society's expectations of her. <br />Tucker Andersen
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie was actually fun... it's hard to find movies that makes you want to keep you in your seat. This was better than the other 'freaky friday's' including the original. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan were great... hilarious and fun. For ppl who think that this is juss a chick flick... (probably only my sister) it's not. And i know a lot of guys who like this film. An example (or maybe their juss attracted to Lindsay?)<br />The dvd ain't bad. The features are light. The picture and sound is great. It's another Disney success. Everything juss seemed to click in this movie. Making it simple and not sooo confusing.<br />Overall a good family film. Worth being on the shelf or cabinet of your dvd collection.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 is an absolute masterpiece.  Geddy Lee is the best bassist in the world and a great singer and probably has alot more money than you MIKEY!  And as for the nerdy drummer.  Every drummer I have ever met thinks highly of Neil's LYRICS and drumming.  In fact, most claim; he is the greatest drummer of all time.  And the band has pretty good looking wifes for NERDS.  As for the album, I disagree with MIKEY again.  I feel Rush's breakthrough album was &quot;Fly By Night&quot;.  2112 is loaded with extremely talented musicianship.  Neil is incredible on the drums, Alex shines on this album and displays his incredible guitar playing(Alex is the most underrated guitarist of all time).  And Geddy's bass is thunderous, and his voice is what really draws your attention to this &quot;mystical album&quot;.  With this album, Rush proved they could out jam any band on the face of the earth!  One of the many highlights on the album is, &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;.  A very powerful song.  A passage to Bangkok is an interesting song, but very good as Alex sets the tone with his incredible guitar work.  If your looking for a masterpiece of an album with incredible guitar work, drumming, bass and mystical vocals, then 2112 is your album.
0385504209|2.0|This book was a bit of a disappointment after all of the hype.  I had read Brown's previous book, Angels and Demons, first -and found the DaVinci Code to be almost entirely the same in terms of plot, character, pace, twists, and ending.  The only difference between the books is the religious, historical topic at the center of the plot.  Otherwise, same book, different secret society.  I found it very hard to finish because of this.  I got bored halfway through, and I guessed the plot twists and endings too easily (because I had been through his writing once before).<br />The historical and artistic ideas in this book are interesting, but the writing is extremely shallow.  Read it if you want a good page-turner, not a great work of character development or literature.  And I would recommend only reading one of his books, because the second is sure to be a repeat and a disappointment.
B00004TCPJ|2.0|Some people like this live Rach 3 performance from 1978, because it is so 'full of profound feeling'. For me, though, Horowitz exaggerates everything so much that it becomes almost unbearable. The deluge of wrong notes, a piano that sounds like nail-scratching-blackboard, much unnecessary banging and an uninspired support from Ormandy's NYPhO make for a performance that will not whet everyone's appetite. Also included: a sonata that sounds more like a Horowitz encore than Rachmaninov. Try Ashkenazy/Fistoulari, Andsnes/Berglund or just about anything else for a better 3rd concerto.
B000001DU5|5.0|I just got my TFF CD today. So cool! These guys were one of the the coolest during the 80s decade. Their sound was sultry, hot and smooth like silk. Good thing cds are made to last for a long time, because if they weren't, I would definitely eventually wear this one out. This one is a treasure!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Though Two Towers was wonderful in it's shortened version, there's just no getting past the amazing additional scenes in the extended version. It helps to open up many secrets lying in Lord of the Rings that the non book readers may not have seen. For instance, who knew that Aragorn was one of the Dunadaine? Well, obviously, the readers of the trilogy, but others may have chosen to politely forget that fact. Also, the special features let you peer into the imaginative world of Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew of Lord of the Rings. So if you want to know more about this thrilling trilogy, I suggest you pick this DVD up.
B0000CD5I6|3.0|If the actual music weren't so good, this wouldn't deserve the three-star rating.  To be honest, the re-recorded songs (Solstice Bells, Christmas Song, Jack Frost &amp; the Hooded Crow etc.) sounded better on the original recordings than they do here.  But they're still really good songs.  The newer ones, particularly the instrumentals are uneven, but work as background music, and this collection beats most shrill holiday fare hands down.  A good antidote to Mariah or Christina, but if you're here, you probably know that anyway.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished the whole series on DVD. I found it extremely difficult not to watch it in one sitting. Every story is compelling and all of the characters draw you in to their world. Its far from typical sci-fi and brings together different cultures in the past and the future to make it feel like today. I HIGHLY recommend this series and I really hope they make the movie that UPN has optioned. Joss has completed the initial script and awaiting approval.
B0000640VO|5.0|Am&egrave;lie (Le fabouleux destin d'Am&egrave;lie Poulain) is the kind of film you just can't find in Hollywood. It's enchanting, magical and gorgeous, with a very endearing story, very imaginative visuals and the perfect actress in the perfect role.<br />Am&eacute;lie (played by the lovely Audrey Tautou, `Dirty pretty things') is a young woman living by herself in Paris, working as a waitress in a caf&eacute;. On the day that Princess Diana's death she finds an old toy box behind her bathroom tiles, and she decides to look for the man who used to own those toys - if he's moved by this discovery, she will dedicate her life to helping others be happier. Obviously, the man breaks into tears at the realization that his long lost, boyhood treasures return to him, so Am&eacute;lie embarks in many a project to help her father, her neighbors, friends and co-workers find happiness.<br />However, Am&eacute;lie herself is not really happy, as she has not found true love yet. She needs a man who shares her dreams and her outlook on life. Thus appears Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz, `Birthday girl', director of `Gothika' with Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz, and `The Crimsom rivers' with Jean Reno), a weird young man who collects torn photomat pictures, discarded by unsatisfied costumers. Am&eacute;lie follows Nino and tries to arrange for him to meet her, in one of the most romantic cat &amp; mouse games you'll ever see.<br />Director's Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ('City of lost children', 'Delicatessen')use of colors and unusual camera angles give an incredible visual styling to this movie, and enhance the magical elements of the story. Another gorgeous element of this movie is it's soundtrack. Yann Tiersen's use of the accordion gives the music much of its Parisian feel.<br />Nominated for five Academy Awards (although it didn't win any of them), including Cinematography, Foreign Language Film, Art Direction, Sound and Original Screenplay, Am&eacute;lie is a movie you'll want to share with a loved one, and that you'll cherish for all your life.ur life.
0679428895|4.0|This book engaged me from start to finish. Though the love story was weak, I found the book very enjoyable. The last 50 pages will grip you!
B00005JMGC|5.0|Mona Lisa Smile is a winner- with more bite than most critics have given it credit for.  Julia Roberts as the Art History Professor who changes her students lives is a refreshing change of pace. Not the mythical character that Robin Williams once played in Dead Poet's Society. She is stubborn, flawed, good hearted, intelligent. And Roberts incapsulates all of that. She's the perfect heroine.  The strong supporting cast features Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Marcia Gay Harden, Ginnfer Goodwin and Juliett Stevensen.<br />Gyllenhaal, Harden, Goodwin and Stevensen impressed me most, but what seemed very predictable, was made surprising, as each character had a bit of a twist to their outward persona (like the Mona Lisa herself). <br />It perfectly captures the time with music, costumes, setting, and beautiful cinematography. It does have flaws, but I've given it a star more because of the harshness of the critics.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This is the most fulfilling and joyful album to come from Mrs. E. Badu.  Please do not sleep on this album.  Worldwide Underground is slammin roots, continuity, love of life, the future, heart, soul, freedom and bliss. It is just nice to just kick back and not head trip on lyrics.  These lyrics lie in the soul not on paper =). If you have a heart and you body loves to move this album is for you.  There is no pain or heartbreak in this album, just love peace and nothingness but raw body breakin beats.  I call it \\"delight happy music\\".  I see that Erica has developed as a person as well and a musician.  It is obvious her heart is straight and filled with love.  If you want to hear of drama and the dark side of someone's personal struggles this album is not for you. If you want to dance and sing until you burst from joy or pass out from exhaustion you should have had this CD yesterday.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is one talented young lady.  She has blended old school into her music so beautifully.  I love the album. I bought it for several people as a Christmas present.  You go girl.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|The music of Wicked was so so.  It wasn't terrible - but most certainly wasn't worth all the praise it's been recieving.  I got the CD because of all the fabulous reviews ... but I would be careful in buying over just that.  I personally haven't seen the musical on Broadway.  From photos I've seen (and the number performed at the &quot;Macy's Thanksgiving Parade&quot;), it looks like a spectacular work of eye-candy and choreography ... however, the music on its own doesn't carry.  There's an inconsitancy in the style of music, jumping from rock-musical (a style which I personally don't prefer, and dominates most of the album) and some typical Broadway.  The text is poorly written as well.  The only song that I felt was well done was &quot;Popular.&quot;  The music is unfortunately wasted on some very talented performers.  It's probably one of those shows where you need the entire in-person Broadway experience.  The CD on its own, though - don't bother.
B00009V7T2|4.0|i do not have anything against them but their sound just sounds and looks like a pink floyd album that was never released. you can clearly see that they got their inspiration from 70's psyc rock. but all in all the record in not half bad i sugest you pick it up if you are a floyd fan this is a great edition to any collection
B000002UAO|5.0|This Beatles album has plenty of classics on it, despite being one of the few that never produced a number one hit.
B000094DUP|5.0|I am Delta Goodrem's BIGGEST fan of all time! and she soon proved to be australia's most successful singer/song-writer ever. with already a staggering 5 consecutive #1 Hits (BORN TO TRY; LOST WITHOUT YOU; INNOCENT EYES; NOT ME NOT I; PREDICTABLE, she is by far the country's most talented artist. And if 5 chart-toppers doesn't impress you, you would be pleased to discover she won a record 7 Australian Music Awards, either wrote or co-wrote every song, and has an AMAZING positive attitude towards work and her fans. Delta gained world-wide support this year, too, when she announced that she was suffering from Hodgkin' Cancer, yet she never stopped smiling (not to mention her chart-dominating didn't falter. )<br />My other favourite songs on her 12x platnuim album are BUTTERFLY, RUNNING AWAY; LONGER' and WILL YOU FALL FOR ME<br />PLEASE dont resist this 19-year'old's AMAZING gift and buy INNOCENT EYES ........ NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|WOW!  There is not one bad track on this CD.  Each piece is carefully crafted and complex.  This guy is a major talent.  If you have the opportunity to see Rufus live, don't pass it up because it even gets better.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|My children (ages 4, 5, 8, 10, &amp; 12), my wife, and me all loved this movie. Usually G-rated stories do not have much depth or complexity, but this one most certainly does. My whole family sat through the entire movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course, it helps that Richard Farnsworth is familiar to all of them, having starred in another family favorite, the Anne of Green Gables series. The kids even asked that we buy this movie, which I plan to do, Lord willing. Highly recommended.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|These guys get better and better!! I listened to the first album and thought it was very well engineered and recorded. But, this album is even better, absoluetly amazing!! Maynard has a way with words to fit perfectly on this album. The guitar sounds are amazing especially on Pet, The Noose and The Outsider. When I read that Paz had quit the band I was a bit disappointed. Anyways, the bottom line is this album is good to the last track. This album was well prepared, well written and well produced!! It's worth every penny boys and girls, so I suggest you go buy it!
B000002H2H|5.0|Although Kill 'em All wasn't a bad CD, it didn't come close to the next three exceptional albums to come from Metallica.<BR>Fight Fire was a great beginning to the album, starting off slow, but going into the speedy metal that would be heard through the rest of this album.  Ride the Lightning was...an audio roller coaster.  For Whom the Bell Tolls continued to focus on the main theme of the album while adding to the classic Metallica hits.  Fade to Black has one of the most frightening beginnings to ever be on a song, and was their best 'ballad' at the time.  <BR>Because I don't feel like going through the rest, I'll leave you with this; Every song on this album has great riffs, great solos, and requires the listener to actually THINK about what is being said by Hetfield.<BR>If you like metal, buy it.  If you don't like metal, you should probably buy it anyway, because I'm sure someone you know is just dying to get this as a Christmas gift.
B00008OWZC|5.0|first truely well done concert from the seventies i have heard in a while. the epic song stairway to heaven's solo is made up much better by our favorite jimmy page. he has truely found great zeppelin work to share with the world and to truely show exactly how the west was won. the late john bonham shows his brilliant talent in songs like whole lotta love and moby dick. page's talent shines through in songs like dazed and confused. plants vocals are very prominent in songs such as bron-yur-stomp. i am a true fan of zeppelin and have tried tweaking a few of their songs for my own use and i cannot find a way to make my music to sound better than the tracks on this truely unforgettable album. the immigrant song is very well done by page and plant. one of my favorites on the album, although i have never liked it much before now. i enjoy this album and i am sure you will to, it is a must have in every cd collection.
B000002H97|5.0|To start this off, I don't compare this to Metallica's previous work, because quite siimply, it isn't.  The band decided to make the songs less complex and have a much simpler, more direct sound.  Although the complexity of the '80's was great, the changes didn't do much to hinder the quality of music that was put forth by Metallica, although, I must admit, this was the start of a very, very long fall for Metallica.  After this album, I noticed fewer quality songs, although they were there, on the next few albums, until the complete collapse that is known as St. Anger.<BR>     Enter Sandman is a good lead song to this album, as it tells the listener the precise meaning of this album.  I feel that Nothing Else Matters and The Unforgiven were the two best songs on this album, though, because it truly showed that Metallica was not only capable of making headbanging thrash metal, but also that they were an extremely talented group that could even pull off extremely slow ballads, such as what we heard from those two songs.<BR>    Although I feel this isn't Metallica absolute best work (that award goes to their second, third, and most specifically, fourth album), it still shows that Metallica can change with the times, and has the talent to do just that whenever they want to.
B000001FYZ|5.0|This is likely the best CD I have ever listened to - and this is coming from someone who is not a big fan of metal.  The first time I heard Crazy World I thought it was all right.  It had Wind of Change on it and that was the reason I bought it.  After listening to it a few more times I quickly realized that absolutely every single song was just unbelievable.  Restless Nights, Hit Between the Eyes and so many others just draw you in.  I would HIGHLY recomment this album.
B00000J7A2|5.0|My maiden voyage with Captain Beefheart begins with \\"Safe as Milk,\\" and now that my mind has been completely blown, I still can't believe I had never heard this album before now. Where have you been all my life?!! <br />While pondering the notion of safe milk (Is it really safe?), I am first lured into the opening blues romp, \\"Sure \\"Nuff 'N Yes I Do,\\" thinking to myself, yes, this is roots. And just when I'm feeling it's safe to go into the water, \\"Zig Zag Wanderer\\" blasts through the ethers better than any psychedelic garage artifact on that Nuggets box set. \\"Call on Me\\" is '60s-soul style Otis Redding  with tinges of jangly guitar riffs, but what follows is pure \\"spit in your face\\" rock anarchy with \\"Dropout Boogie,\\" keeping in mind that this stuff was recorded in 1967 years ahead of Marilyn Manson. And wud about after dat? Well, a Smokey Robinson \\"Ooh Baby, Baby\\" kind of reverie titled \\"I'm Glad,\\" with soulful harmonies that are safe as, well, milk, well maybe. But beware, next stop, the incredible \\"Electricity,\\" an amazing extraterrestrial voyage where Black Sabbath meets Lindsey Buckingham meets Salvador Dali on acid. This track bends my mind as stretchy as a salt-water taffy pull at a sci-fi convention, ending with what can only be described as an unidentified flying object departing terra firma into the universe beyond. And just as I'm feeling like I haven't quite touched down yet myself, along comes a comforting re-entry reference point, further cementing the notion that the Magic Band are definitely walk-ins from another planet: \\"The following tone is a reference tone recorded at our operating level.\\"  This reference tone lands me right smack dab on the Yellow Brick Road humming a jug-band-Dead-like ditty commensurate with my operating level. Then the time-traveling Captain throws me right into the heart of West Africa with the Koto Soto-style \\"Abba Zaba.\\" An amazing, amazing track certainly influenced by Ry Cooder. Then the captain steers my ship of foolsto the high point of the album, \\"Plastic Factory,\\" a rolling roadhouse blues number with mojo harp playing that would make Lucinda moan. (And by the way, what's that he just said? Buffalo boner showin'? I could have sworn that's what he said.) Then we come to \\"Where There's Woman,\\" a bleeding blues ballad that brings to mind Janis Joplin's \\"Women is Losers\\" sung by Tom Waits or Leon Russell.  Next is a Muddy Waters kind of thing \\"Grown So Ugly,\\" that segues into territory nothing short of the template that Led Zeppelin copped for years to follow. This amazing album ends with \\"Autumn's Child,\\" another template for the progressive rock genre and years ahead of its time. Is he messing with my head here, or what? NO, this is not safe as milk just as I had suspected. <br />Well, the bonus tracks, aside from track #13, don't add much to the perfection of the original release. So really, listen to those once through, and only once. Because the original itinerary of this Captain's fantastic voyage is \\"the experience\\" itself of 12 mindblowing, revolutionary rock 'n roll classics. USDA-approved Beefheart, not for the faint of heart.
B00005JKEC|5.0|As a huge Denzel fan, I kept hoping that his character would do something to redeem himself, while hating his character more and more in each scene.  The fact that you are totally convinced of what a terrible person his character is just proves what a great actor Denzel is...and Ethan Hawke is pretty good as well.  While I personally believe Denzel should have won the Oscar for Malcolm X, I definitely understand why he got it for this one!  The movie is incredible.
B00000J7A2|5.0|This is a CD that will totally knock you out. All I can say is, buy it!!!
B000035Z1Z|2.0|This movie fails in establishing a story and characters one could warmly relate to. I mean Meg's character behaves too juvenile (to put it mildly) while the other lead character has no charisma even though the screenwriter tries to make him look like an expert in communicating with a flight-shy and awkward-with-men woman.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore's score of The Fellowship of the Ring is exquisite.  Although I'm not musically trained, I know good music when I hear it.  And this is good music, better and more powerful than anything I've ever heard.  It arouses, in me, at least, more emotion than even Beethoven's  Fifth and Ninth symphonies.<br />How does one describe melodies that make the hair on the back of one's neck stand up?  How does one describe melodies that give goose pimples, send shivers down the spine, or give thrills of joy that send one soaring emotionally?  It's not easy.<br />From the beautiful and lyrical Hobbits' theme to the awe-inspiring Fellowship theme, from the relentless Uruk-hai march music to the incredibly atonal, twisted music of the depths of Isengard, this score touches every facet of human emotion.  It carries us from happiness and joy to deep despair and terror, often within just a few moments.<br />The Hobbits' theme, to which we are introduced during the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; portion early in the film, begins lightly and lyrically, played gently on the flute.  It makes us smile, serving as a perfect backdrop for the gentle hobbits, as they go through their daily routines.  The same melody, when we hear it later in the film, however, played at a slower pace and with heavier sounding instruments, sounds so melancholic that it is difficult to listen to without experiencing some amount of sadness.  The sweetness of the hobbits is being destroyed by events outside their knowledge and beyond their control.  The change in tone of this single melody in many ways tells the story of the hobbits through this entire film.<br />The Fellowship theme is a rousing melody that returns time and again as the members of the Fellowship make their way across Middle Earth.  As I listen to it, I feel lifted up and inspired to be a part of the Fellowship.  I want to stride along with them and be a part of the team.  A great feeling!<br />What to say about music of the Uruk-hai and Isengard?  Towering, unyeilding, harsh, at times painful to listen to, like fingernails on a chalk board.  Cymbals crash at tumultuous climaxes, leaving us breathless.  Powerful tempos keep us on the edges of our seats.  Wow!<br />And always the choir reaching for greater heights.  In sharpening the experience of the power of the ring, the vocals in this score  reach to our very souls.  We feel the power and weight of the ring as the voices in the choir soar around us.  We wear the ring.<br />To Howard Shore, congratulations on your well-deserved Oscar, and thank you for composing the most magnificent musical opus it has ever been my pleasure to experience.
B00005JMGC|4.0|As the mother of three daughters, I was eager to see Mona Lisa Smile.  I expected a movie in which females were exposed to life beyond what they had been taught to expect, and I was not disappointed.  It was rather bizarre seeing young women attending college classes in nylon stockings and pearls, their hair in pin curls when going to bed.  Yet that was their world in those days, the world of the rich and privileged, the brightest and the best.  There were of course the misfits, like Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the only Jew, beautiful, charismatic, and brilliant, who masked her loneliness with promiscuity, and Connie Weaver, not as pretty or personable as the others, who sought comfort in the cello.  But the leaders, embodied by Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) and Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) knew where their futures lay.  Betty married early into her senior year, an extravaganza orchestrated by the mother from hell (a truly hateful Donna Mitchell) while Joan looked for an engagement ring.  Then Catherine Watson (Julia Roberts) came into their lives to show them that they could be more, contrary to the wishes of the Dean (Marion Seldes) and the alumni president, Mrs. Warren.  She succeeded in raising their awareness of art, and to an extent in raising their awareness of their options in life.<br />One truly poignant scene will remain with me for a long time.  Betty, who has begun to realize that her \\"perfect\\" marriage to young lawyer Spencer has serious problems, returns home for comfort.  Her mother scornfully sends her back to her home without as much as a kiss or a caress.  I realized then that she had only had Betty so she could produce a society wedding one day.  Had Betty been mine, I'd have comforted her and listened to her.  Perhaps I would have sent her home, but only after making sure it was the right decision.  Thus Betty's becoming a supporter of Catherine's, after undermining her throughout the year with her editorials in the school newspaper, ringstrue.<br />I left the theater feeling glad that that had not been my world and that my daughters had a wide world of opportunities open to them.  It made me feel good, and it made me think.  What more can one ask?
0385335482|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's novel &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is refreshing and fun to read.  I read it in a few hours the other night and just loved it!  Fortunately I had already purchased the two sequels (Shopaholic Takes Manhatten and Shopaholic Ties the Knot) so I jumped right in and read some more!<br />Becky Bloomwood is a hip English 20-something who has a serious addiction to shopping!  She can't help but stop in the shops after work (she writes for a financial magazine called Successful Saving), and then when she sees that gorgeous scarf.. how can she possibly resist?  So out comes the Visa!  But when that Visa bill comes at the end of the month, Becky can hardly believe she managed to spend THAT much money in such a short period of time.  She then has to come up with some creative solutions to her financial woes, or else her credit cards might be turned off!<br />The antics between Becky and her credit card company and bank manager are hilarious!  Sophie Kinsella writes a lot of it in letter form, which is just plain funny.<br />Becky's relationship with Luke Brandon is the one part of the story I felt could have been better.  I like most of the interactions between them - but I did want more.  We barely saw Luke during most of the story, I would have preferred a few more interactions between them.  I thought the shopping expedition between the two of them was great - especially Becky's reaction when she finds out they're picking out luggage!<br />Overall, it's a fun, light read. I read the entire book in a matter of a few hours and read the sequel later that night.  All the characters are fun and interesting, with unique (yet realistic) personalities.  I highly recommend this book, it's a riot!
B000002IWQ|4.0|Counterparts continued Rush's return to the heavy sound of their earlier releases. This is their best album since Grace Under Pressure. The uptempo \\"Animate\\" starts out the album with a bang and hints at the heavier direction of the album. Geddy Lee's bass playing is in fine form throughout, particularly on \\"The Speed Of Love\\" and on the instrumental \\"Leave That Thing Alone.\\"  His vocals are also in fine form, especially on the excellent ballad \\"Nobody's Hero.\\" Neil Peart's drumming continues to be impressive and his lyrics on many of the tracks, particularly on \\"Nobody's Hero\\", are among his most personal. Alex Lifeson continues to be pushed closer to the spotlight and his solos on the heavier cuts \\"Cut To The Chase\\" and \\"Alien Shore\\" are among his best. His background vocals are also more prevalent here than previous albums. Other strong tracks here include \\"Open Fire\\", \\"Double Agent\\", \\"Between Sun & Moon\\" and their ode to grunge, \\"Stick It Out.\\" Although not containing any tracks as stellar as \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", or even \\"Red Sector A\\", Counterparts is one of the band's better albums and easily their best album of the last 20 years. Highly recommended.
B00008DDSC|5.0|If you come to Secretary expecting a raunchy comedy full of short skirts and spanking, then you'll be disappointed.  If, however, you're a fan of offbeat movies with wonderfully drawn characters then this is definitely worth a look.  The story has sado-masochist, withdrawn Lee (Gyllenhaal) take up a job as secretary at the offices of Edward Grey (Spader), a bullying depressive lawyer.  As the relationship grows in intensity, spanking included, both Lee and Grey wonder how they can unite their inner turmoil to the way the other makes them feel.<br />The acting is brilliant.  Gyllenhall really proves that she has what it takes to be an actress of her generation, easily overtaking other talented competition from Kirsten Dunst and Reese Witherspoon.  Clearly a beautiful young woman she manages to hold herself in such a way as to make her appear the most dumpy, boring, painfully shy girl you'd ever come across.  Sister to Donnie Darko star Jake, she clearly proves herself just as worthy of acclaim as her sibling.  Spader takes a pretty similar role to that he had in Crash a few years ago, though here he adds in a kind of profound depression into his bullying ways and really sparkles with his co-star.<br />When reviews say this isn't a movie for everyone, that's true.  A lot of people like their love stories straightforward, and this is anything but.  Laced with dry humour Secretary traces one of the year's most delicate, beautiful relationships as Lee and Grey find in each other exactly what they'd never realised they'd needed their whole lives.  The ending will leave you with exactly the right amount of hope for love in a world where only loneliness and self harm seem to be the answer for its characters.  Imaginative, different and compelling.
0679746048|5.0|I loved the movie so I had to get the book. Glad I did. The book is even better. Its more real and honest about what happened to Susuanna. You see that she was really a normal girl who figures out who has the power to see who is insane or sane. Doctors don't know it all, they can misdiagnose. Many doctors did back then in McLean Hospital and many across the world are doing so now. <BR>Susanna and Company have their ups and downs but through it all they have TRUTH and Friendship. Trough this they suceed in what the &quot;Sane&quot; people outside the McLean ward can't ever truely have.
0385337388|5.0|I read this book in the middle of internship at a busy NYC hospital, and I believe it is a must read for all interns.  The book is about how internship at one of the Harvard Hospitals breaks several interns, who ultimately decide to continue in psychiatry rather than internal medicine.  While laws now limit the hours we work and I have yet to see a 'tern broken, several points in the book resonate with me and have made me a better doc!  <BR>     Most importantly, my #1 goal is to &quot;buff and turf&quot; the patient--meaning get the patient well enough to transfer them away.  When other 'terns deviate from this policy, I have watched them get overwhelmed.  Other important rules of medicine are reiterated in the book's appendix and are worth reading.  Those who are not in medicine but who are curious about the field should also read this book.  The characters are great and really portray hospital life accurately.  To read this book is to &quot;live through&quot; an internship!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Reading through this page's reviews, one is very shocked: while most of the reviewers love the show, story, and music, it is unusual how so very few dislike it: One reviewer in especially puts down the power ballads of the show: this reviewer obviously has no tastes: the longest running shows on Broadway, and the best and most respected, all have power ballads: &quot;Rent&quot; has &quot;Over The Moon,&quot; &quot;Take Me Or Leave Me,&quot; &quot;Another Day,&quot; &quot;I'll Cover You,&quot; and countless others.  &quot;Les Miserables&quot; has &quot;Stars,&quot; &quot;I Dreamed A Dream,&quot; &quot;Red And Black,&quot; &quot;Do You Hear The People Sing,&quot; and countless others.  And Broadway's respected past is filled with power ballads: &quot;Far From The Home I Love,&quot; from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof,&quot; &quot;Some People,&quot; from &quot;Gypsy,&quot; &quot;Take Me As I Am&quot; from &quot;Jekyll and Hyde,&quot; and the list goes on and on.  So, to the reviewer who spoke out against the power ballads: I don't think Broadway is really for you.<BR>But on to &quot;Wicked.&quot;  In recent years, there has been something of a Broadway Rennaissance, shortly after &quot;Rent,&quot; as a matter of fact, of shows which seem as though they will actually last a decade or more, much as the shows of the sixties and seventies: &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; and &quot;Nine&quot; are just two examples.  And now &quot;Wicked.&quot;  The show is a phenomenon, with extravagent sets and costumes, which manages to have campiness and appeal in combination better than any show since &quot;The Rocky Horror Show.&quot;<BR>As for the score and cast album, the musical is excellent, and the voices do more than justice.  Menzel is brilliant in her broad, loud, strong power ballads, and Chenowith adds bubbly soprano, light and free, just bursting in to operatic broadness when least expected and most required.  And, 40 years after &quot;Cabaret,&quot; Joel Grey can still steal the hearts of audiences, as does this whole blessed show.  And the CD is a brilliant representation of the brilliant combination of storyline, campiness, sentimentalism, and genius which is &quot;Wicked.&quot;
B000002L9J|5.0|When I was younger and cutting my teeth on Alternative Music, 'The Queen Is Dead' was the first album I heard from The Smiths.  It still stands today as one of my favorite albums of all time.  Morrissey's haunting and humorous lyrics (see &quot;There Is A Light That Never Goes Out&quot; and &quot;Vicar In A Tutu&quot;) alongside Johnny Marr's eloquent guitar playing (See &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; and &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;) makes for a fantastic combination, which is truly showcased on this album.  I love the array of emotions....from sadness to happiness to laughter, and back down the line.  I would highly reccommend this album...if nothing else, just for &quot;There Is A Light...&quot; and &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others&quot;.  Classic.
B000002C1V|4.0|This cd is in fact very over looked, it has good songs and melodies but it just lacks the creativity of earlier Floyd material. Heroes return is probably my favorite song, along with gunner's dream and the title track. If only the guitar work was more constant I'd give 5 stars. The bass is awsome (I'm a bass player so maybe I'm biased) and so r the keyboards(I can't remember if this is Rick Wright or not) but the drums fail  to amaze me. It is filled with Roger Waters's remorse of his fathers death and it definately shows in the lyrics. This new kind of hatred for society is good for the music and that is probably y the flashy guitars r not found throughout and the drums r simple. All in all, if u liked the wall buy this, if u like animals, buy this but if u r into stuff like, Saucerful of secrets and Dark side of the moon, then back away right now because it is not the happy Floyd of then, but the kings of gloom and doom that r present in this one. Happy Holidays!! :)
B0000024JN|5.0|4 and 3 and 2 and 1...and when i'm on the mic, the suckas run.  And so it began.  As fresh today as it was way back in 1986, 'Licensed To Ill&quot; presented rap music to white audiences everywhere, through it's exploits of beer drinkin', girlie chasin' and White Castle eatin'.  RUN DMC and LL Cool J's albums at the time weren't recorded in any language that made them difficult for mainstream audiences to understand, for whatever reason they didn't captivate young white America like the Beastie's did.  'Licensed To Ill' is like a fantastic expansion of DMC &amp; Aerosmith's &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, with some non-crossover rap thrown in for good measure.  Synthesized beats, sampled guitar riffs, and all-too-catchy lyrics all compose this fantastic record, and not much else can be said about it that hasn't been said already.  If you haven't yet, GO BUY THIS ALBUM.
0156027321|2.0|I'd heard only good about this book before I picked it up, and it sounded like the kind of story I might really enjoy. As a result, I was surprised to find, about twenty or thirty pages in, that I was already disappointed. It wasn't simply that I didn't enjoy the book-there's always that risk-but I was struck by how poorly written it is. There's no accounting for taste, but bad writing is bad writing no matter how you look at it. I half wonder if I'm missing something, as I wouldn't presume to have a sharper sense of style than the Booker committee. Doubts aside, I might as well own my response to it: I thought the writing was sloppy and weighed down by effort, I found the whimsical mood of the story pretentious, and I felt disengaged from the characters and the plot.<br />It's essential always to tell the truth when you write, the more so when you're writing fiction. Not to do so is a sign of dishonesty, or at least sloppiness. In Martel's case, I think it's mostly sloppiness. Some examples: \\"I must say a word about fear\\" (p. 178: must you, or do you just feel it would fit nicely into the narrative at this point?) \\"[L]ike all younger brothers, I would suffer from following in the footsteps of a popular older sibling\\" (p. 23: not all younger brothers have popular older siblings: sometimes older siblings are unpopular.) \\"The shield was heavier than I would have liked, but do soldiers ever get to choose their ordnance?\\" (p. 228: yes, sometimes they do.) There are also numerous instances where the narrator uses the second person to explain life in the middle of the ocean aboard a lifeboat shared with a Royal Bengal tiger. He is describing fantastically unique experiences: they are not something \\"you\\" find yourself doing.<br />These may seem like quibbling points, but they indicate a general sloppiness of style that pervades the book. I suspect Martel is trying much too hard to make his writing flashy. He tends to rely on short, abrupt sentences, far too many of which begin with conjunctions. There are lots of one-sentence paragraphs. He often introduces new story elements by dropping them in suddenly and then stepping back to introduce them. For example, chapter 42 opens: \\"She came floating on an island of bananas in a halo of light, as lovely as the Virgin Mary,\\" (p. 123), and we only learn half a page later who \\"she\\" is (an orang-utan.) Abrupt sentences, abrupt paragraphs, sentences beginning with conjunctions, dramatic chapter openings, and the like can all indeed be effective devices. The trouble in this book is that Martel uses them so frequently that they cease to have any effect at all, except perhaps to serve as a constant reminder of the writer behind the writing, thus distracting us from the writing itself. Martel is not Brecht: the effort and the artifice are visible by a failure to conceal them, not out of stylistic choice.<br />At points, it seems Martel is almost aware that his writing is slapdash, and that he revels in it. He likes to play on clichés. We are told that a fish in the boat is \\"flopping about like a fish out of water\\" (p. 200), that when eating, the tiger \\"took the lion's share\\" (p. 249), or that, after seeing a bolt of lightning strike only a few feet away, the narrator was \\"thunderstruck\\" (p. 258). I think these lines are supposed to be cute, but given that they're in a novel that's markedly short on truly captivating descriptions, they come off as cop-outs. Similarly with lines like, \\"[m]y feelings can perhaps be imagined, but they can hardly be described\\" (p. 157), or \\"[i]t seems impossible to imagine that there was a time when I looked upon a live sea turtle as a ten-course meal of great delicacy\\" (p. 235). In both of these examples, the narrator then goes on to attempt to describe or help us imagine the confessedly impossible, so that these lines read as a kind of apology for the mediocre descriptions that follow. <br />Perhaps the most egregious moment occurs in the \\"author's note\\" at the beginning, where one of the characters tells us that the story that follows \\"will make you believe in God\\" (p. viii). The narrator replies, \\"that's a tall order,\\" and he's right. You can't drop a line like that in the introduction to your book unless you're pretty sure you can come close to fulfilling it. This book doesn't come close, and it hardly even seems to make the effort. I find that insulting in a book that shows evidence of effort to a fault, but only in the direction of wowing us with jazzy writing.<br />A friend of mine says there are two kinds of Canadian writers: the ones who try really hard to be hated and the ones who try really hard to be loved (Mordecai Richler vs. Dennis Bock.) I haven't read enough Canadian fiction to comment on this claim, but Yann Martel is certainly trying much too hard to be loved, to the point that it hurts his writing. Everything from the snappy style to the whimsy of the magic realism is so crying out to be loved that I couldn't get lost in the novel. It's a shame, because I think it could have been a really good novel, and I give it two stars instead of just one because it's not quite as bad as I've made it out to be. In particular, I found the ending surprising and quite moving, though even that is marred by dialogue between two Japanese interrogators that's clearly aiming for laughs but never succeeds in being more than faintly funny. In the end, this novel is too much about the writing of Martel and not enough about the life of Pi.
B00005B6C9|5.0|The last Bee Gees album may be their best. There are a couple of weak tracks, but the majority is top noch. And as an added bonus, Maurice(my favorite singer and person of the three) sings lead on two songs on here! That's two as in 2! As in TWO! As in...well you get the idea. Here's my song by song analysis:<br />1. This Is Where I Came In. 5/5 Stars. This songs starts the album off well, with an interesting acoustic sound. This what Barry meant by \\"Back to the Basics.\\" It's at a faster pace than their earlier work, but it's a good cut none the less.<br />2. She Keeps On Coming. 5/5 Stars. This started off as my favorite song on the album. But it slipped after I heard more of the album. Still, it's a great tempo. You would think that this was written by The Rolling Stones.<br />3. Sacred Trust. 3/5 Stars. This is the weekest song on the first half of the album. It's a pretty ballad, but it could have been a lot better.<br />4. Wedding Day 5/5 Stars. I didn't like this song at first but it quickly grew on me when I heard Barry and Robin's interplay. One of their finest.<br />5. Man In The Middle 5/5 Stars. This is first song Maurice sings. It's a great autobiographical track especially the chorus. Concert set-up wise, Robin would be the obvious choice to sing this one, but he can't. This is Maurice's song.<br />6. Deja Vu. 3/5 Stars. This Robin-Led Song had potential but it gets repetitive after a while. Also there was a strange rap going on at the end. What's up with that? There is a bonus:At the end of the song you can hear the crew talking if you listen close.<br />7. Technicoulor Dreams:1/5 Stars. My least favorite track on the album. It sounds like a bad show tune based on Barry's singing. The most annoying part is the clarinent. Just like on Deja Vu, you can hear the crew talking at the beginning of the song. The only good thing about it is that it makes a good intro to Walking On Air.<br />8. Walking On Air: 5/5 Stars. My favorite song on the album. The synthesizers, the tempo, the drum programming, the lyrics, the guitars, and of course, Maurice's incredible voice.<br />9. Loose Talk Costs Lives: 3/5 Stars. An average ballad. C'Mon Barry! You can do better!<br />10. Embrace. 5/5 Stars. I just love the up-beat tempo on this one. Reminds me a bit of For Whom the Bell Tolls.<br />11. The Extra Mile. 4/5 Stars. Good Orchastra feel, but the lack of 3-part-harmony ruins it.<br />12. Voice In The Wilderness. 4/5 Stars. A great rocker to end the album, and consequently one of the greatest bands that ever lived.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night. Get ready Tull fans for the most recent release by Ian and the boys. It is a wonderful Christmas present for those of us who love all things Tull. Do not worry about the familiar titles - they have all been redone, spiffed up and given a proper bit of tinsel for this great holiday release. The fabulous &quot;Jazzy&quot; version of &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlmen&quot; is worth the price of admission alone. Ian claims, often not to be a Christian but he partakes in a wonderful tribute to this special Birthday Celebration. So put aside that electric nose hair picker your sister gave you and get ready - You will not be disappointed with this Christmas present from Jethro Tull. The songs are festive and with a classic touch of typical Tull flair. I for one have been playing it at the office on my computer stereo and the non-believers appear to enjoy it as well. Anyway - When you get into Santa's lap ask him for a copy and also to &quot;Pass us that bottle will ya?&quot;<BR>Ho Ho Ho.<br />From a very old Tull Fan.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I don't understand the commercial PRODUCERS, they produce the fake singers and force it in the public minds. Since a lot people don't know the difference between good and bad they finally buy it. Britney is really bad in this CD. I was waiting more maturity in the WORK. DISAPOINTED here. Don't buy it if you like your money!!!!
B000002VQQ|5.0|she sure did it better than any of her grandchildren. I recall seeing her come on stage on Saturday Night Live. I didn't know who she was. She started saying \\"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.\\" And she repeated it. I knew immediately this was somebody special. I should find out more about her. All these other glowing reviews are correct. Yes, she's Punk, but she was more. Yes, she's a poet, but she is more. Yes, she's rock, but she is more. She is so many contradictory things depending on her choices. One of the best \\"rock\\" albums ever. If you think the Sex Pistols were great, or Green Day is great, then you haven't heard Patti Smith. Do it. It will return three-fold whatever you put into it.
B0000959N0|5.0|i don't see why this movie's getting such bad reviews. i ended up renting it a couple dozen times before finally deciding to buy it. this is a masterpiece of a movie. along with x2, this is the best comic movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Let me first preface this review by saying that I have anticipated this soundtrack for a long time.  Upon first hearing that Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth were doing a musical based on the Witches of Oz, I was enthralled.  I've had some bootlegs of the songs for several months now, and have been waiting impatiently for the official Original Cast Album.<br />That said, I love this CD.  It's good to see Stephen Schwartz, a fantastic composer (Pippin, Godspell, Children of Eden) back on the boards with a totally unique and original show.  His songs are immediately catchy and beautiful.  Idina Menzel as Elphaba, the girl who would become wicked, belts her heart out and proves that she is a bona-fide Broadway star and so much more than just 'Maureen from Rent.' She sounds effortless on &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; and &quot;No good deed&quot; - both of which are incredible songs.  Kristin Chenoweth as Galinda (NOT a typo) is adorable and gets to showcase much more of her voice than audiences are used to.  We're all familiar with her fantastic belt voice, but Wicked shows off her phenomenal classical soprano as well, in the opening &quot;No one mourns the wicked.&quot;  Another great performance is given by Norbert Leo Butz as Fiyero, though he is only given two songs.  Joel Gray as the Wizard does the best he can with the music he is given.  In honesty, The Wizards songs are my least favorite on the CD.<br />All in all, there is a lot to love on this CD.  My personal favorites are Norbert and Idina's &quot;As long as you're mine,&quot; Kristin's &quot;Popular&quot; (or Pop-you-oo-lar) and the gorgeous Act One Finale; &quot;Defying Gravity.&quot; Epic score, epic show, epic voices.  Well worth it.
B0000C8AVR|1.0|Ive been told that the hybrid cd's can be played in any cd player. Well, my high wquality DENON player wont play ANY of the 15 cd's in the box.<br />anyon else had that problem?<BR>Mattias
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have always enjoyed Dream Theater's music dating back to the first time I heard &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; on the radio.  Each CD they release seems to stand alone in its own unique way.  They are not a slave to fashion or doing the &quot;in thing&quot; which I really appreciate.  And without a doubt Dream Theater is one of the most talented bands in the world.  You could argue that each member is one of the best at their craft.  They are truly amazing.  <BR>Having said that, I tend to run hot and cold with their music.  Sometimes it is a bit mellow for me, other times too technical.  I love what they do, but I have never considered them to be one of my favorite bands.  Then I picked up this CD and I have not stopped listening to it.  First and foremost, the guitar work is incredible.  John Petrucci simply goes off on this recording.  If you like guitarist like Paul Gilbert of Racer X, Roland Grapow of Masterplan, Ronni Le Tekro of TNT and Yngwie Malmsteen, you are going to love this CD.  The guitar work is unmatched.  It stands alone.  <BR>The music itself is extremely heavy, especially when compared to the last recording &quot;Six Degrees&quot;, but it still carries a light touch at times mixed in with plenty of great keyboard work.  Singer James LaBrie appears to have the same gift that Freddie Mercury had.  He appears to get better as a singer as he gets older.  He sounds great and compliments the music very well.<BR>The music is heavy and all seems to come out of the key of &quot;E&quot; with distortion.  That gives it an overall grunge feel, but the similiarities to Grunge there.  There is some serious song structure and arrangement that leaves you wondering how they could ever repeat these songs live.  I hope this next sentence does not offend anyone, but for some reason musically I found myself thinking back to my old Megadeth CD's, like &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;.  In fact, on the second track &quot;The Dying Soul&quot; (it should be noted that this song is a continuation of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; from &quot;Six Degrees&quot;), James LaBrie's voice was distorted on some of the parts in such a way that it sounded like Dave Mustaine.  And yes, the old metal head in me really enjoyed that.  Maybe that is what I like about it so much.  It is a perfect blend of old school guitar work, new world grunge distortion and attitude, and master musicianship (is that a word?).      <BR>There are a total of seven songs and you get 69 minutes of music.  Thus, we are talking about five songs over 10 minutes in length.  There is an eleven minute instrumental called &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; that is very melodic and kind of a departure musically from the other songs.  &quot;Vacant&quot; is also a three minute ballad that leads into the instrumental that I think was recorded when Mike Portnoy (Drums) and John Petrucci left the room.  It to is a departure from the rest of the music, but it introduces the instumental and is certainly a Dream Theater kind of melody.  <BR>The other five songs are heavy.  Probably the heaviest stuff they have ever done.  &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot;, my personal favorite on this CD, starts out slowly with acoustic guitarist work, then explodes into the chorus and later into some great metal riffs that will leave you banging your head against the wall...or in my case against the head of the poor guy sitting next to me on a flight back to the United States from Malaysia.<BR>Anyway, I love this CD.  I think it is the best work this band has ever done.  If you like the days of great guitar playing and long leads, I think you are going to agree.
0142002038|5.0|Dr. No, the first Bond Novel I read, (an accident, I did not realize that the filmakers made the movies in a different order from the books) the sixth in chronological order. I thought this one was great! Bond must investigate the mysterious disappearance of John Strangways (the representitive of the secret service to Jamaica) and his secretary. Once there he slowly finds the truth behind Strangway's disappearance. Enter: Dr. No, who is sending wrong messages to Missiles causing them to crash from his private island north of Jamaica. Highlights: Centipede ordeal, &quot;Dragon&quot;, No's establishment, Obstacle course, Fight with Squid.
0316666343|5.0|I read the book Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. Its about a girl,Susan Salmon,thats about 14, and gets raped and murdered by her neighbor. After she passes away time goes on, and her family falls apart. The story is being told by her in heaven, watching her family and friends.<BR>    &quot;Like snowflakes,&quot;Franny said,&quot;none of them the same and yet each one, from where we stand, exactly like the one before.&quot;Franny is one of Susan's friends up in heaven and she is comparing snowflakes to humans on earth. This quote, has alot of meaning to Susan. <BR>    This thrilling, sad novel has 328 pages. It is nonfiction.  I would recommend this to 14 and up. This book was very good and I could barely put it down.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I liked Paul Thomas Anderson's &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; when I saw it a few years ago, so I gave &quot;Magnolia&quot; a shot after stumbling over it at the video store. The promise of a three plus hour runtime did not put me off in any significant way: I often enjoy reading very long books or watching lengthy films because I always figure that more time equals more character development and better background. I even violated one of my usual rules--reading a few reviews about a film or book before diving in--and watched &quot;Magnolia&quot; with precious little information about the plot. Even after learning that Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore starred in this film, two actors I usually despise, I STILL decided to give this one a chance. What really suckered me in was the roughly ten minute opening sequence, one of the most original and intriguing opening sequences I have ever seen in a movie, about a murder filled with amazing coincidences hinting at inescapable fate. I logically assumed from this information that &quot;Magnolia&quot; would take as a central theme the power of coincidence and human fate. Well, I wasn't far off because these two ideas inform a significant part of the movie. But there is something else going on here that transcends these ideas and moves Anderson's picture into the realm of the religious.<br />&quot;Magnolia&quot; concerns a day in the life of a host of characters both big and small in modern day Los Angeles. Hollywood bigwig Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) lays dying of cancer in the living room of his house, attended only by a caring male nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and his confused and drug addicted wife (Julianne Moore). Partridge's estranged son, a seedy infomercial misogynist named Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), knows nothing about his father's impending death and probably wouldn't care much if he did. His concern at the present is a taped interview he agreed to do with a nosy reporter, an interview that ominously threatens to lift the carefully crafted veil of secrecy Mackey placed around his personal life and childhood. Having his dirty laundry aired publicly inspires Frank to look deep into his soul and make a painful decision about whether he should reconcile with his past or not.<br />Meanwhile, a show Partridge once produced, called &quot;What Do Kids Know,&quot; is airing in another part of town. The long time host of the show, Jimmy Gator, discovers he has an incurable illness. The show must go on, though, so Jimmy walks out on stage to fire questions at the current wunderkind, Stanley Berry. Stanley suffers privately from the attentions of his overbearing father, a guy who pushes his son to succeed on the show at any cost. Related to the television show are Jimmy's wife Rose (Melinda Dillon), his drug addicted daughter Claudia, and former child star Donnie Smith. Smith once appeared on some of Partridge's shows but has since fallen on hard times. His job at an appliance/electronics store has just dropped out from under him and he can't seem to line up a date with the bartender at his favorite pub. Jimmy's daughter Claudia, who hates her father for initially unspecified behavior, meets up with a clumsy yet macho<br />cop named Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and begins to tentatively connect with him.<br />I know you can get this cast information from nearly anywhere. I just wanted to see if I could untangle the byzantine structure of this film in the space of two short paragraphs. There are many more characters parading through the scenes of &quot;Magnolia,&quot; and Anderson carefully ties them all together without ever bogging down. Obviously, the cast list isn't nearly as important as what these characters do and how the actors portray their deeds. All of the performances in this film are excellent. Tom Cruise steps out on a limb here as the insensate Mackey, a guy who tries to deal with his emotional baggage by dumping on women in his &quot;Seduce and Destroy&quot; infomercials. As good a job as Cruise does here, John C. Reilly steals the show in the role of police officer Jim Kurring. His manic behavior, his eternal patience (see the amusing scene with the lady in the apartment), and his rigid opinions about right and wrong are often hilarious and deeply sad at the same time. Everyone here should pat themselves on the back for a job well done.<br />The first part of the movie defines the various characters and explains their situations. Then comes the emotional roller coaster ride as nearly every person in the movie suffers a humiliating set back of some type. Mackey's lies about his past become known in deeply embarrassing ways. Officer Kurring loses his firearm; a huge humiliation for a cop. Jimmy Gator and Stanley Berry both undergo enormously awkward situations during the filming of the television show (in front of a live audience, no less). Physical and emotional pain comes spilling out from nearly every character about midway through the movie. Then something remarkable happens: the healing begins. The characters &quot;sin&quot; and then atone for their behavior in various ways. I saw someone refer to this movie as a Christian picture, and I think that claim is true to some extent. A frog fall that would make Charles Fort proud might make some viewers doubt the veracity of this claim, but even this odd event towards the end of the film has a scriptural basis. Can Hollywood make a Christian film in these modern times? Apparently. Match the religious themes with a great soundtrack, the performances, and the somber feel of the film and you have the makings for a marvelous three-hour experience. Give &quot;Magnolia&quot; a glance soon.As good a job as Cruise does here, John C. Reilly steals the show in the role of police officer Jim Kurring.

B00005JMGC|5.0|I just saw this movie last night, and before it was over I knew that I wanted to own it on video/DVD to watch it over and over again. It's funny, light enough to make you smile, and deep enough to make you think. The actors, Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, etc are perfect for their parts. It is a girl movie, but not overly mushy and romantic. For the most part, it is a clean movie, only a few implied romantic scenes. (Yea!)It doesn't promote women being career driven, or housewifes, but promotes choosing to do what you want, whether it be a career, a full time mom, or both. I'd definitly pay to go see it again. I loved it!
B000088E6D|1.0|Odd how artists catch on, such an example is Michael Buble. His voice is pleasant, like a lounge singer in an upscale hotel or perhaps Vegas. Yes, Vegas baby! Some of his covers are decent, especially &quot;Fever&quot;, but please Mr. Buble do NOT attempt to cover Van Morrison. As Bob Geldorf said in a tribute to Van, &quot;How many murdered &quot;Moondances&quot; have we heard?&quot; We just heard another one. Too much almost Frank, and not quite enough Harry Connick Jr., Mr. Buble's creamy, dreamy, overblown voice is dangerous to your health especially while driving. A yawn.
B000006ZFD|2.0|The two additional tracks on this import are: &quot;Ultranol&quot; and &quot;No Monster In Me.&quot;  Both of these tracks are available on the CD1 single for &quot;The Universal.
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|What more can I say but get this movie.  It had me laughing so hard!  Great effects and action scenes!  Buy this movie and see it before it comes out chopped up in the theaters!
B00005JM02|5.0|Oh, wow. I've seen Finding Nemo at least seven times, and every single time I watch it, I can't help but roar with laughter. Helen DeGeneres, playing Dory, a blue fish with short term memory loss, clearly steals the show. She's hilarious, and Helen makes Dory sparkle even more.<br />The story like was wonderful, and so were the animations. I have to hand it to Pixar, Finding Nemo was a big hit in our family, whether your 1 or 100, your boung to laugh out loud!
B00003CX9S|5.0|This movie was just plain great. I really in joyed this. This movie really had no flaws. Great movie and you feel real bad for the charictars. The Elephant Man(Anthony Hopkins)looks great in the movie. You should buy this, and you will be happy you did.
B000065V3H|3.0|I ordered this video Nov. 30th and was told that it would be delivered by Dec 22nd (which was long enough to wait).  On Dec22nd I checked the status of my order again, and now it says it will be delivered after Dec 24th.  Four weeks to wait for a video? This is ridiculous.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|We all know that this is not as good as th first but it is still really good.Neo(Kenu Reeves) is stating to understand his role as the one even when the orcle herself said he is not.Anyway,<BR>the Machines are planning to dig down to the last human city, Zion. To undrstand the story completely, you need to play Enter the marix, Wacth the first one, and wacth animatrix. you have to do alot of things before you wacth this, that is if you wan't to know the movie completely. Overall this was a good movie, much,<BR>much,much better then the horrible third film but still, the first is the best!
B000089RVX|5.0|With the mixture of hard rock and the soft piano, this album is a great cd! Amy (the lead singer)'s voice has a unique accent that clashes against the sounds of the instruments and is captured on this GREAT, #1 selling album! There are 2 slow songs that show off Amy's talent. The other songs show off how talented the other members of the group are. The drums, bass, and guitar, are played so well, no wonder this band is hitting the top of the Bilboard charts! For a gift for a family member, friend, or yourself, it is a GREAT gift that you won't regret getting!
B00008LDPU|5.0|This DVD is the best matrix item out there, better than the movis better than the video game. Why? Becouse this goes everywere and<BR>I mean EVERYWERE!!!!!!!! It tells about how the matrix was made,<BR>it talks about how a world runner runs out of the matrix. My personal favorite was Dective story, wich is one of a kind.<BR>If you were confused about what the matrix is from the first film this one helps you understand. Any fan of Japense animation<BR>should see this.
B00005QB9A|5.0|I agree with some other reviews Ive read above on how some people criticize this movie too easily. I dont think its necessary to sit down and watch it with some preconcieved idea as to what to expect, rather than just let the movie and the soundtrack seduce you to its full extent. I believe Guiseppe Tornatore and Ennio Morricone have put together a film that will be referred back to by many generations. Its one of those films that refuses to age in time. The brilliant performance by Tim Roth in an not-so-usual role brings to life 1900, a character so much within us all, representing what he has to say and do in this world through his magnificent piano-playing, (&quot;A light that shines so bright yet for so little time&quot;...taken from blade runner). I havent the slightest intention of drawing any conclusion for the reviewer of this movie but if your not into great expectations, youll probably wind up with more than that at the end of the film. My opinion is that the story didnt necessarily need to take place on an ocean liner, it could have been anywhere where 1900 felt safe and secluded from the bustle of the surrounding world but through his greatness as a pianist, he was always bound for fame and glory as well as his inevitablity. I feel its important to get this point across to those who feel the need to compare this &quot;insignificant&quot; aspect with the movie &quot;Titanic&quot;, yet I would have wished half the musical score in &quot;Titanic&quot; this film has. The main character leaves me with the sensation that hes subconsciously set out the task to leave a mark on this Earth while hes never literally set foot on dry ground and that all of us who have strived in our own lives can relate to easily yet again, he leaves an unfinished task to those who havent. My advice, get the DVD, listen to the beautiful music and put your thoughts aside, the film will do the rest and youll surely be wanting to see it more than once!
B00009TB5G|4.0|This movie was really good, but the first one is better bcouse it's darker and you care about the charictors more. This one takes place right after the first. Frodo and Sam travel into Mordor to destroy the evil demon Sauron by casting the one ring of power into of into Mount Doom. After a few days of traveling,<BR>they fight Gollum, a monster who was crupted by the ring. They<BR>win,but gollum helps lead them to Mordor,becouse he has been there before. This was a good film that is really worth it. the only bad part was the stuip Helm Deep battle. If you saw the first film and liked it, than this will be a great film for you.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Ah yes, Dream Theater has come out with another album that sounds just like the last album, which sounded just like the album before, etc, etc, etc. When is John Petrucci, John Myung, and co. going to realize that IT's NOT THE 1980'S ANYMORE???!!!<br />I had the chance to hear 'Honor Thy Father' on a rock station on my television, and it was by far the worst thing I've ever heard. There was 80's guitar squeals, lame keyboard solos, and of course, the most annoying singer in the world, James Labrie. He sounds like a 7 year old whining about not getting any Power Ranger dolls for Christmas!<br />If you want progressive rock, try Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Try King Crimson's In The Court Of The Crimson King. Hell, even try some Moody Blues. These guys sound like Yes (the most self-indulgent of prog bands) combined with Judas Priest. Don't bother.
B00005JM0B|4.0|This movie had alot of action in it so if you love action this will be the best movie you ever saw. The movie is about a Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger who is now the Govrner) in the<BR>war filled future were men and machines lead by an evil giant computer named &quot;Sky net&quot; fight each other, goes back in time sent by the humans to help their leader John Coner's past version survie the up coming war and another Terminator. My only<BR>complant is the story was the same in Terminator 2. That did not<BR>bother me to much however. You should see the first two before you see this one. This movie was good but the first two were better.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Probably my favorite Tull album, SFTW is dazzling in its musical and lyrical brilliance.  Outstanding in every way.  Joyful.  Mysterious.  Poignant.  Powerful.  Mesmerizing.  This CD is all that and more.  Buy it and let it soak into your soul.
B00006LLNU|1.0|I like low-key, spooky, ethereal music as much as the next guy, so I thought I might like Sigur Ros too. Boy was I disappointed.<br />   A few other reviewers here note that &quot;there's no there there&quot; to this record and I agree. There's some e-bowed guitar and slo-organ and Thom York-esque voice and slowly building drums, but none of them are doing anything worth listening too. There aren't any songs to speak of. That would be OK but the sound textures aren't anything new or interesting either. The various repetetive figures that they work to death are completely unimaginative and dull. And when the songs get loud it just sounds bombastic, pretentious and embarrassing.<BR> <BR>   The singer supposedly makes his own language for the lyrics. Again, no problem with the principle idea, but whatever language it is doesn't have many words. I thought that if I heard that guy sing that &quot;Yusaadelaaw&quot; phrase one more time I would puke. It appears in something like 6 of the 8 songs. And over and over again.<br />   I listened to this two times, and I really wanted to like it. But it's just crap, and I couldn't stand to listen to it ever again.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This CD is splendid and features outstanding musicianship.   You can tell a lot of care went into the creation of this CD.  The new songs are uniformly wonderful, the instrumentals are both witty and poignant, and the reworked classics offer new ways of hearing old gems.  Do not hesitate to pick this up.
0767805712|5.0|I remember watching this when I was younger on a movie channel and not catching the name of it. I was so impressed with the plot, the characters, and just the beautiful way it played out that I just had to find out it's name. I finally saw it on VHS and watched it almost a million times. The whole concept is intruiging, it's an almost realistic and dangerous vision of what society could come to someday. The good twist is that even in a world like that there is still hope for the imperfect. Wondering where the title comes from? Well I don't recall it ever being explained in the movie but from genetics, G, C, T and A are the 4 codes that make up DNA..so stick em together and you can make the word Gattaca. Neat huh? Even the title is interesting..Definitely a movie worth seeing more than once and that will definitely let you appreciate these times we live in a bit more.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|This boxset is most beneficial if you want to see the process of making an Alien film and why each one turned out the way it did. We follow the journey of each film from its conception, to its production, its release, and finally the reaction it received, both critically and commercially. We see this through extensive interviews with many of the people involved in making these movies, and footage of all stages of production. Plus we are given a view of the films in hindsight through present-day interviews with many members of each film's cast and crew. We also get an insight into each film's particular drama, be it high or low, and how this affected the final product. Having the two versions of each film allows us to view the results of these dramas, and can be also be used as comparative pieces, especially when particular decisions were controversial. So we get the films we know and love/hate, plus a version of the film that tells us what should've/would've/could've been. The Special Edition of each film is either just a curiosity piece, a chance for the makers to fix minor problems, a satisfying completion, and/or an illustration/examination of a production plagued with problems.<br />It would mainly be of interest to the many Alien fans who know the movies inside-out, but it would also be of interest to those wanting to see the relationships between those involved in making a film- particularly a well-known franchise- from the writers, directors, to the studios, the producers, and the cast and crew...to each other and to the Alien story. We can see all the conflicts that occur in this process, as well as the creativity. <br />This boxset seems to include all the available material from all the Alien films, and has great nostalgic appearances by the actors playing the well-known characters, though sorely missed are appearances by some cast members (e.g. Yaphett Koto, Ian Holm and Winona Ryder in particular) and crew (director David Fincher). Also, it does not contain present-day audio commentaries by Sigourney Weaver, though she is interviewed. The previously-released \\"The Alien Legacy\\" was sufficient in terms of having the films in their final form and nothing else, but this is the definitive Alien boxset, at least until they possibly make the much talked-about Alien 5 sequel.
0671027344|5.0|This was an amazing book.. I dont really read much but this book was actually very good.. This is a good book for teenagers because it's basically what a lot of us go through and what a lot of us think too. The book really touched me because when you read it you know there is people out there that went through the same things as you. The thing that people might think is bad about this book is it talks about doing drugs but I think it's a good thing not because people will go and do them but because you know how the person feels about it. I would recommend this book to teenagers and parents because they need to know what we think and how we feel about things.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is probably the best record that I've bought so far..it's got to be more than 5..it has to be a perfect 10 on a wow scale! every song here is worth listening to from the first to the last track...I don't need to skip on anyone of them..it's got great beats, and great lyrics couple with a great &amp; fantastic voice such as X-tina's! Truly classic..do I need to say more? X-tina rocks!!!!!!!
1400049628|5.0|Before reading this book i was entirely unprepared for the Zombie Invasion scenario. But now, thanks to Mr. Brooks, i have erected a secret fortress in which myself and my closest friends shall take refuge when the inevitable occurs...<BR>   But i digress, The Zombie Survival Guide, as it's title implies does indeed offer a myriad of helpful suggestions in the event of a Zombie Outbreak. The subtle humor of Brook's writing leaves the reader scared of every dark corner. The dreadfully serious tone of the studies on Solanum(the zombie virus) and zombie sociology is somewhat chilling. Combined with ironic and morbid illustrations( Spearfishing technique for disposal of underwater zombies, etc.) the elements of the book come together to create an ironic, cynical masterpiece of humor.
B0000025DV|5.0|Jeff Lynne has picked this as his best ELO album, and the fans agree. This was released in 1977, ELO's peak year, when their concerts sold out and the radio was playing their music all the time. Lynne is without a doubt the heart and soul of this group. John Lennon commented in the early 70's that ELO was best equipped to carry on the &quot;Beatles&quot; spirit.  How prophetic he was! Jeff Lynne would go on to work with George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and other pop icons. <BR>One of the highlights of the double album (although it fits on one disc) is the Concerto for a Rainy Day: Four songs that take you from a bad storm to a beautiful blue sky (the last released as a single and now part of a movie soundtrack). Lynne's mix of violins, cellos, choirs and electric guitars has never been matched. It's such an unlikely combination that only a truly gifted musician like Lynne could pull it off successfully.<BR>I would recommend this album to lovers of classical music, rock or Top 40 Pop. Lynne gets my vote as one of the most talented musicians that has somehow eluded the accolades he deserves.  Perhaps because he doesn't seem to like the limelight. Whatever the reason, he deserves an extensive coffetable type book written about him.
B00009TB5G|4.0|There are those in the &quot;movie-first&quot; crowd who deride Tolkien fans for being purists. I have something to say to them: were it not for Tolkien's imagination and incredible effort, along with the sustained interest readers have had over the decades, there'd be no Peter Jackson movies to marvel over. Simply put, other fantasy films with no literary basis have not done nearly as well as LOTR.<br />That said, I think that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is a bit of a concession to movie audiences. It's more of an action film than &quot;The Fellowship&quot; was, and it plays more with the plot. You have to be a Tolkien reader to know that the Aragorn/Arwen love story is magnified for the film, and that the Elves didn't actually show up to help out at Helm's Deep (it was a leader named Erkenbrand, but his part no doubt would've added confusion to the already involved plot). <br />The second book runs in two separate sections (the war between Rohan and Saruman, and Frodo's passage into Mordor), and it's clear that Peter Jackson meant to integrate the plot lines more. It's a tad bewildering at times, but I agree with the pacing. What I do not agree with is the whole scene where Faramir escorts Frodo, Sam and Gollum to the ruined outpost Osgiliath (where Frodo confronts the chief Nazgul, Ring plainly in sight). Faramir is the pivotal character who snares the hobbits, learns their secret quest, and decides to let them go on. Instead, the movie gives us a Faramir who's no better than his brother Boromir when it comes to the Ring. Sorry, but this is wrong and Jackson deserves criticism for it. I can overlook the overdone bits about Arwen's romantic dilemma, but there's no need to change the characters' basic architecture.<BR> <BR>One of the stars in this film is the rambling, windswept realm of Rohan. From the horseman's plains to the Golden Hall of Meduseld, everything rings as true as an Elvish blade. Topping off this beautiful scenery is Miranda Otto. She's Tolkien's Eowyn personified (and just as great to watch in &quot;The Return of the King.&quot;) These things are what make the films so incredible - terrific casting, eye-popping sets and action - and yet, why the detours into stuff that isn't in the book?<br />Maybe that's why they made a Platinum series. I would have sat for four hours to see the thing done right. But let's say that the LOTR films will be seen as revolutionary and rewarding in their own way.
B00006RJHG|5.0|This 1974 Canadian flick is one of the creepiest you'll ever see. Bob Clark (Porky's) directed this early slasher with much skill and a bit of humor. The setting is a Canadian sorrority house, a couple of days before Christmas.  Since everyone is going home for vacation, no one is suspicious when the students disappear. The stalker/obscene phone caller's voice is chilling. There is a lot of suspence and very little blood in the attack scenes.     Many films \\"borrowed\\" from Black Christmas, most blatantly \\"When a Stranger Calls\\".  But over the years, thanks to cable TV and video, this cult film is gaining popularity rather quickly.    Fans of this film will want this edition of the DVD, which instantly outclasses all previous editions. It contains a lengthy new documentary, two commentaries (the first by Bob Clark), interviews, trailers, stills and posters.  It also contains a reversable cover sleave that has the original 1974 movie poster on one side (containing the movie's most famous image of the first victim covered in plastic). Horror fans as well as fans of good solid thrillers will be pleased.    Addition to my first review: I thought Amazonians would enjoy a little history: This film was a big hit in Canada, but was mostly ignored by American movie patrons. Warner Brothers bought the film for distribution in America, but didn't like the ambiguous ending.  Not wanting to spend money to change it, they instead decided to change the title to \\"Silent Night, Evil Night\\". Black Christmas seemed like a blaxploitation title akin to \\"Shaft's Christmas\\" according to Warner execs. The change didn't help, and Warner lost faith in the film and cut the advertising budget.  The film quietly faded away.  3 years later, NBC expressed interest in broadcasting the flick on it's Saturday Night at the Movies. At the last minute, NBC pulled the plug, deeming the movie too intense for network tv.  In the early eighties, Warner thought they might try to sell the film to cable (whichwas finally catching on).  HBO agreed to broadcast the film, but they didn't like EITHER of the previous two titles. They chose \\"Stranger in the House\\". Quite a few people saw it on cable, but those who caught Black Christmas in the 70's and wanted to see it again were not aware of the name change. They thought the movie was lost forever. A few years later, the film was edited and sold to basic cable stations like USA, still called \\"Stranger in the House\\".  In 1986 Warner released the film to home video for rental.  Old fans were finally reunited with the chiller, as \\"Black Christmas\\" was reinstated as the title (probably because the uncut print contained this title). The film gained new fans, and a cult was growing. The rental was so popular, Warner rereleased the video as a sell through for $19.99 or less in the 90's. It also hit laserdisc around this time.  In 2001, 2004 and again in 2006, Black Christmas was release to DVD in three different editions.  Each edition contains more extras, the first being the weakest.  And of course, this Christmas Day, the REMAKE of Black Christmas will hit, with the blessing of original director Bob Clark. Will it chill 21st century audiences as the original did back in the 70's? Only time will tell.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Although I've not listened to the rest of the tracks, or the 2nd disc, I feel I've listened to enough (Get Back, Let It Be, Long and Winding Road, and Don't Let Me Down) to say that this is the album that should have been released in 1970.  The other was fine for its time (after all, who knew that this one was going to be release 30+ years later).  Considering the acrimony that was around at the time, and that it was unlikely that the Beatles were going to release much after this [although &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is technically the last album and this was a sort of &quot;posthumous&quot; release by the Beatles, i.e., the group &quot;died&quot; after Abbey Road and the first version was released &quot;after the fact&quot;].  However, if the Beatles had gotten on/along better, and would have had some say, this version should have been released instead of the &quot;Spector&quot; version.  Does this mean people should &quot;trash&quot; the other one?  No, but it is more filled with passion and &quot;directness&quot;, i.e., listening to it makes one feel more as if they were in the studio with them, when The Beatles recorded the thing, and strips away the frippery associated with the other version.  Some may disagree but to each his/her own.<BR>The second disc is a way of hearing what was in their heads at the time, and some may consider it a waste, but even so; disc one is worth the price alone.  When the lads put personalities aside, they could make some damned fine music, despite what others say.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Anyone under the impression that Whitney Houston was washed up and over with needs to hear this album. It is a true testament of why she is one of the most influential R&amp;B singers of our time. This album ranks up there with Boyz II Men's &quot;Christmas Interpretations&quot; and Mariah Carey's &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; albums. Whitney didn't just pick the typical &quot;poppy&quot; Christmas songs to record, she also chose the traditional songs. Such as &quot;The First Noel,&quot; &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot; and &quot;Cantique de Nvel (Oh Holy Night).&quot; One of my favorites has to be the stirring rendition of &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot; that sounds like the group Take 6 was backing her up. The single released from the album &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; may be misleading to some because she's not singing at her full register, but the other songs on the album find her belting out the notes like the Whitney Houston we're used to. She even gets a little bit of help from daughter Bobbi Christina on &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; and surprisingly the little girl doesn't sound half bad. Whitney then takes you to church at the end of the CD with &quot;Joy To The World.&quot; I got goosebumps when I first heard it. This is one of those albums that will go down as a classic, and if you're a collector of holiday music this is one that HAS to become a part of your collection. It sure has for me, and will be one of the only Christmas albums I'll be listening to this season.

6304601425|3.0|There are those who will agrue forever and a day about which Hitchcock was better. The American Hitchcock (\\"Rear Window\\", \\"Psycho\\", & \\"Rebecca\\") or the British Hitchcock (\\"The Lady Vanishes\\", \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\") and this film \\"The 39 Steps\\", often thought of as the best of Hitchcock's British films. In my personal opinion I like the American Hitchcock. His Britsh films, while very entertaining always seem to have smug characters. Maybe it's just because of who is playing the parts, but, I never find myself opening up to them. And his dry wit sometimes gets in the way of the over-all story. The entire set-up with Donat and Carroll handcuffed together would have fit perfectly in a screwball comedy. In fact if I remember correctly wasn't there a scene in \\"I Was A Male War Bride\\" that is quite similiar?<br /> Anyway, Hitchcock's \\"The 39 Steps\\" is one of his best early films, my favorite of the British movies is \\"The Lady Vanishes\\". It has his favorite theme, the innocent man wrongfully accussed, as Robert Donat trys to prove his inncence when a woman is found dead in his apartment. She was a secret agent who brought Donat into her confidence regarding information concerning \\"the 39 steps\\". That same night two villians murder her, and now Donat, who knows what her next move would be must go find her contact and prevent the enemy from taking secret documents out of the country. Or as it is known throughout the film as \\"the thing\\".<br /> \\"The 39 Steps\\" based on a novel by John Buchan and written by Charles Bennett and Ian Hay does contain those moments of wit Hitchcock's films were known to have, and as I said before the handcuff scene could have been taken from a screwball comedy. Hitchcock directs the film with confidence as he keeps the story moving along nicely. It never has a boring moment. And the movie is just shy of ninety minutes. I also like the performances given by the two leads, Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll, who plays a woman who somehow gets mixed up in this whole affair on accident.<br /> Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors, and while I admit I don't think this is his best movie, it is still one that proves to entertain its audience. If your interested in seeing some of Hitchcock's early British films, \\"The 39 Steps\\" will prove to be a treat. And if you enjoy it please check out his other films such as \\"The Lady Vanishes\\" and \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" (which is slightly better then the James Stewart remake).<br /> Bottom-line: One of Hitchcock's early British films has moments of dry wit and excitement. Perhaps not his best film, it is still entertaining. Worth a look if your a Hitchcock fan.xed up in this whole affair on accident.<br /> Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors, and while I admit I don't think this is his best movie, it is still one that proves to entertain its audience.

B00008H2LB|1.0|This Linkin Park...I don't understand them.  Chesters vocals are high and screechy.. in a bad way.. and it doesnt sound like any guitars are even in this whole CD.  To me it sounds like.. a &quot;clean&quot; band trying to go for a mix of rob zombie and ozzy osbourne without the death stuff... Now that's just my opinion but I highly suggest against getting this album.
B00006HAZG|5.0|Though he does a great job, the real star is Maggie Smith who plays his great-aunt!  She doesn't get enough credit for her small role but the scene where she meets with David's stepfather and step-aunt is enough for me to buy this dvd it.  Absolutely an incredible performance!
B000092ZYX|2.0|I've never really understood the hype behind these guys myself, either. The bulk of their work (especially OK Computer and The Bends) isn't bad - but just so-so. Since the beginning of all the &quot;trust-me-these-guys-are-different&quot; hype, I still hear everyone's Pink Floyd/U2 comparison critiques. But that's just the icing on my cake.<br />Everyone says that these guys are the true &quot;experimenters&quot;, have &quot;real talent&quot; and they are the answer to rock/pop's Golden Age - more than anyone else blah-blah-blah, and it seems that the English music press can't make up their minds who should deserve the most hype (Radiohead, Coldplay, or Robbie Whatshisname). I guess RH experiment to a point. But their 'experimenting' just doesn't grab me. <br />My roots remain in the 60s/70s era (English and American, mostly English), when everyone was truly let loose and, more importantly, when the major labels allowed them to be. THAT music was and is timeless, organic, and will remain immortal. So, to me, if any new band can top THAT stuff, then you get five stars. But today's bands have to be timeless, organic, and immortal. Radiohead is not the answer. What they're doing has been done already...their musical talents are just more watered-down. (Note I said &quot;musical talents&quot;. They write good lyrics. But the music has to make the lyrics sound good, too. That 'perfect marriage' hasn't been accomplished in decades.<br />'Hail to the Thief' does get political which is cool. But musically, my needs weren't met as usual (sadly, they haven't been in years). And I kid you not...EVERY SINGLE interview I read or hear from any of the older guys or girls (including DJ's, at least the ones who weren't afraid to lose their jobs) say the same thing I am - that they don't want to be a part of today's music and where it's heading. There's no character, no talent, just blah.<br />And I know I'm going to piss people off when I say this, and that they're sick of hearing it, but I'll say it again and again: THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS MUSIC THINK IT'S GOOD BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HEARD THE BETTER MUSIC AND BETTER RECORDINGS OF THE PAST. The 60s and 70s was when you had to be DIFFERENT to make it big. So, since that was the case, THAT music is what everyone should learn from to get the true meaning of the word &quot;experiment&quot;. Unfortunately, today's rule is the opposite.<br />The fans think RH are the true 'whatevers' but that's because they haven't heard what I and other old timers have. To the RH fans: it's new and exciting and the future. But to me: it's all been done before...
B00006BS6T|1.0|Lame.  Supposed to be loosely based on the actual shootdown of a US aircraft over Bosnia, this is just another Hollywood rah-rah movie.  The flight scene where the good guys get shot down is the movie's high point.  Unfortunately it lasts only two minutes and comes early on.  From there it's admiral Gene Hackman looking tough and uttering inanities (ordering his crew to &quot;triangulate&quot; Owen Wilson's location seconds after Wilson told him where he was located; or ordering &quot;intel&quot; to tell him who was chasing Wilson moments after Wilson told him he was being chased by Serbs).  Typical tripe.

B00005QK3W|5.0|Paul McCartney is right when he says that Driving Rain is a &quot;very interesting album&quot;. On his previous 2 albums the music was great but rather predictable. Driving Rain showcases a variety of styles and features excellent music. However, there are no &quot;outstanding&quot; songs and some fans may find the lyrics simple and occasionally silly. But I feel they're at par with his other work. The compositions are consistently good and one won't feel the need to skip any song. <BR>Featuring great guitar playing and drumming. There is no excess of production and the sound is simple yet interesting. After a long time, here's a McCartney album that truly rocks!<br />NOTE: The inferior &quot;Freedom&quot; is an unfortunate inclusion, not to be found on the original release. It doesn't match the rest of the material here and spoils the album's effect.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|&quot;The Italian Job&quot; is a good, fun and intelligent &quot;heist&quot; type movie predicated on the revenge factor.  I found this movie to be quite entertaining from the opening scene all the way to the closing scene which is a bit unusual for these types of movies.<br />Mark Wahlberg has certainly come into his own as a superstar and he quite well proves it with his performance in this movie.  The ever beautiful and alluring Charlize Theron stars and performs quite admirably in this movie.  The supporting cast of Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G and a brief but poignant performance by Donald Sutherland all of which deserve high praise for their collective performances which combined, all bring this movie to a new height.<br />Director, F. Gary Gray also deserves praise for bringing this great heist/caper movie to fruition and putting together such a wonderful cast.  The score for this film perfectly enhances the overall feel of the movie.<br />The Premise:<br />Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) has planned the perfect heist and carried it out perfectly with his crew as they go to Italy to steal millions of dollars worth of gold bricks.  The one thing he didn't plan for was being double crossed by a member of his crew, Steve (Edward Norton).  As part of his plan in double crossing Charlie and the rest of the crew, Steve kills Charlie's mentor and Stella's (Charlize Theron) father, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), but fails to kill Charlie and the rest of the crew as he thought he did.<br />What follows from there is a very intelligently written and played out heist/caper movie as Charlie finds Steve once again and enlists the aid of Stella in regaining the gold that they'd stolen.<br />I highly recommend this movie as it is one of the better and most enjoyable movies of its type.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Pedal to the Metal:  The Making of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<BR>-Putting the Words on the Page for &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<BR>-&quot;The Italian Job&quot; - Driving School<BR>-The Mighty Minis of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<BR>-High Octane:  Stunts From &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<BR>-6 Deleted Scenes<BR>-Theatrical Trailer

Although Dan Brown researched parts of this book, other sections were inaccurate and led to the downfall at the end of the book.  If you do some research on the internet regarding this book, and read some reviews from newspapers, you will come to find out that the book isn't as exciting as originally thought.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Just kidding! This is one of the greatest \\"rock\\" records of the last 20 yrs (and probably beyond, but i'm admittedly not terribly familiar with too much before that). Some people from an era long ago may point to the beatles, some to the rolling stones, sex pistols, something in the 80's (although all the 80's were awful).... Anyway, people that don't yet need the viagra point to this as THE album. It's better than radiohead, better than the strokes(?), better than, well, everything else. All of the praise the critics heaped on it, and all the praise the amazon customer critics are heaping, is deserved. This album rocks, it's pretty, its weird, its new, unique, creative, intellectual, confusing, disorienting,...on and on. It is definitely an album that will grow on you, even though many of the songs (esp \\"Kamera\\" and \\"heavy metal drummer\\") are immediately catchy. It just gets better and better...indefinitely. If you've been under a rock since \\"A.M.\\" and thats the only wilco album you own, you will be surprised. Gone is the alt-country/country rock whatever-you-call-it that A.M. offered. This album is a layered bit of psychedelic pop rock; songs start at one tempo, it changes, changes back, the song may disintegrate into feedback or strange distorted voices. Some of the songs are upbeat, albeit weird rockers, some contemplative and subtle melodic balladish songs... I don't know where Wilco will go after this, but in 50 years when I'm old and gray (probably dead) I'll look back on this album and say something like \\"this was the album that changed the way i listened to music\\" or \\"Yankee hotel Foxtrot\\" was the last truly perfect record\\", or \\"woman! go fetch me my teeth and put on the foxtrot album\\". Ok, go buy this if you don't have it. All the cool kids gots it.
0451169514|5.0|This book rocks, plain and simple. As a &quot;loser&quot; myself,&quot; I was rooting for the characters all the way. Some people have complained about the length, but as far as I'm concerned, the only problem with the length was that it wasn't long enough! There were several areas of the story I wouldn't of minded seeing fleshed out a bit more. I dunno. I'm thinking that the modern attention-span has shrunk, and that's a shame.<br />Anyway, ignore the movie version and go straight to the book. You won't be sorry.
B000031WD9|4.0|First off to the negative reviews of American Pie; anyone trying to re-create any of the antics depicted in the film is a moron.  Second of all, the film is a surprisingly funny teen comedy that unknowingly began a trilogy of films that became known for gross out gags and nudity, and helped launch the careers of Sean William Scott and Shannon Elizabeth.  The story revolves around four high school seniors who are lifelong friends (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas) who pledge to lose they're virginity by prom night with some prospective interests (Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari).  The film became infamous for it's pie loving gag and Shannon Elizabeth's foreign exchange student character who loves to take her clothes off.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, including Scott as the skirt chasing Stifler, Hannigan is a joy to watch as a flute loving band dork, and Eugene Levy as Biggs' father.  All in all, the original American Pie is a surprisingly funny mainstream comedy that is better than you might think.
6300182282|5.0|I really liked this film a lot.  Two married people meet at an inn during a business function and hit it off and wind up in bed together.  Both realize that though they found what they did to be highly enjoyable, they do not want to disrupt their own lives.  So instead they agree to meet at the same place for the annual business function, next year.  As the movie progresses we see them meeting each other, year by year and sharing what has passed in their own lives during that time.  We seem them looking a little different and a little older each time.<br />A great relationship with no strings attached!<br />I also loved the theme song from the movie.
B0000508U6|5.0|If you couldnt tell from my title, I absolutely love this group.  Their music is the type that you regret not being able to hear again, when you take your last breath.  Sounds way too heavy, I know but that's where their music takes me.  I dont like their second album as much but I am a loyal fan nonetheless.  Speaking of which,I heard that Chris is married to Gwyneth Paltrow and I am not to keen on that either, but again, still dedicated to the sound!  My favorite tracks are<br />Spies + Trouble <br />thats my .02
B000002B5L|5.0|The Fugees (Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, Pras) sophomore album \\"The Score\\" (1996) is a first class album and deserves all the recognition it has recieved. Musically and lyrically the Fugees dropped a gem with this release, delivering an album to remember. What I appreciate most about this album is the variety of musical influences the Fugees use in there music whether it be Hip Hop, Soul, Reggae, Gospel or Blues. The Fugees do justice to the originals on there covers for \\"Killing Me Softly With His Song\\" (Roberta Flack) and \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" (Bob Marley), both of these songs are off the hook. I wont front either, I had never heard the original versions back in 96, but have since listened to and enjoyed them and become a Bob Marley fan, thanks to this album. Love the instrumentals, Fugees rhyming and Lauryn Hill's outstanding vocals on \\"Ready or Not\\" and \\"Fu-Gee-La\\". The Fugees rip \\"Zealots\\" warning other MCs not to mess around, and talk about police discrimination on \\"The Beast\\". The darkly deep \\"Family Business\\" with Omega and Forte is another sick track. Both the \\"Fu-Gee-La\\" mixes are good, I especially like the \\"Refugee Camp Remix\\". Individually and collectively the Fugees shine on the \\"The Score\\" an album for every Hip Hop collection.
B000060P79|5.0|i listen to this cd at lunch and nobody sits with me and they make fun of me. i think theyre just jealous cuz theyre not as punk as me. they think NoFx, and Gob is punk. like thats with that? my mommy says they're evil, and they're going to heck. and because i listen to punk rock like this, that i'm going to b beautiful someday.
B00005AAFS|4.0|Rammstein's &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; accomplished a surprising feat when it went gold in the U.S., and their follow up &quot;Mutter&quot; is just as solid an album.  The German industrial metal machine is at their pounding vitrol fueled near best here, with vocalist Til Lindmenn's voracious howels and bellowing voice echoing throughout the entire album.  Standout tracks include the ripping opener &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot;, the single &quot;Links 2,3,4&quot;, &quot;Sonne&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Adios&quot;, all of which are instantly listenable industrial laced carnage.  The only real problem with &quot;Mutter&quot; is the same problem which has plagued Rammstein for years, they sound exactly like how one would imagine a German Ministry cover band.  If you can overlook that though, you'll find plenty to love about Rammstein.
B000003TA4|5.0|that this is one of the greatest albums of all time then I'm sure that the hole you live in is quite nice. Over here in L.A., half of the songs on the album get constant airplay on the radio and when I mean &quot;constant&quot; I seriously mean at least one song from Nevermind every 2 hours.  And for those who haven't heard the other songs on the album, they're just as good. You have &quot;Breed&quot; and &quot;Stay Away&quot; which both have a heavy punk rock sound, then you have the melodic &quot;Drain You&quot; and the somewhat dark &quot;Something in the Way.&quot; If you haven't discovered this great album yet, please get it and please, enjoy.
0792833201|5.0|wow this one goes back. I first saw this when I was 6. and I'm still afraid of clowns! This movie is good old fashion terror, and proves that you not need buckets of gore (though that can be good also) to make a good horror film. I would recommend this to any horror buff, young or old
B00009V7T2|5.0|I didn't even know the lyrics...just the overall sound, had me hooked. Great albumn. The above reviews are accurate for the most part...Radiohead-esk, but they do have their own original sound.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is one of the 6 best rap albums of all time. The 6 best rap albums ever are, The Chronic, All Eyez On Me, Ready To Die, Doggystyle, Reasonable Doubt, and of course Illmatic. Now lets talk about why this album is so incredible. First of all the rhymes will literally blow you away. Some of the best ever. 2nd of all the beats are great, laid back and relaxing. Perfect for his style. People keep complaining that the beats get boring and that takes away from the album. Well back then rap did not have the great beats they have now and many of the classic rap albums have boring beats, but that does not take away from them. The 3rd reason for this being one of the greatest rap albums is his style. His style is just incredible. I would have to say he has the best delivery to his words since Rakim. That good. So go pick this album up.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Wicked is a beautifully writen show by none other than the great Stephen Schwartz. The leading ladies do a wonderful job with the moving lyrics and difficult parts. Menzel's renditions of \\"The Wizard and I\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" are some of the show's strongest moments. <BR><BR>Chenoweth provides a bright ray of sunshine, even if you are just listening to her voice. Her comic timing and great presence bring Glenda to life. For her \\"Popular\\" is a wonderfully catchy tune that most certainly will be on repeat in your cd player.<BR><BR>The one unfortunate thing with show is that we don't get to see the supporting roles more often. With a talent such as Joel Grey in the cast (His rendition of \\"Wonderful\\" is a vaudvillian masterpiece) it is sad that his part on this cd is so small. The same can be said of Michelle Federer, as Elphaba's crippled sister Nessarose (who later is the Wicked Witch of the East) and Norbert Leo Butz (of The Last Five Years), as the love interest Fiyero. Butz has a commanding voice and his \\"Dancing Through Life\\" is amazing. I wish his character was more developed. <BR><BR>There is something to be said about a show that is driven by two commanding women. There are too few shows like it. But despite their beauty, there are a few too many pop solos here for the women. I wish there was more time to shine for some of the smaller parts and a variation in song style.  <BR><BR>That is the one reason I am giving this amazing cd only 4 out of 5 stars. Just a smidge more variety next time, Mr. Schwartz. But you can bet this cd will be in my player for a while.
B00005JKN9|4.0|A Supurb Film. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 is because Gangs of New York tended to drag a bit during the middle stages of the movie. And also, i think we could've done without the romance. But still, there is more good then bad in this movie. Top acting throughout the movie, with special mention to Daniel Day-Lewis with his supurb effort with his character. He really played the part well. We all know DiCaprio looks like a nancy boy, but he got away with it. He isnt as bad in this movie, as everyone says he is. Im not a fan of his, but i think he deserves a little more praise then he is getting. Cameron Diaz is always good to look at. So she gets a passing grade too :) Its a very violent movie, so its not for everyone, but overall a thoroughly entertaining movie.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I recently resubscribed to HBO in order to watch \\"Angels in America\\" (first-rate, incidentally) and stumbled across SECRETARY.  I had never heard of the film, knew nothing about it - which is so rare and wonderful these days to be able to completely form one's own opinion about a film. <br />First off, I have now watched the film, or most of it, at least three times over the last week or so (for once, I'm happy with all the repetition on a movie channel). I just can't resist each time I see it listed on HBO's schedule.  <br />I know the main reason:  Maggie Gyllenhaal.  I had never heard of her either, and her acting in this film - even her mere presence on the screen - is magnetic, electrifying, multi-dimensional, honest, sexy, smart . . . I may not have heard of her before but I'll be watching whatever else she does from now on!<br />Secondly, James Spader, Gyllenhaal's costar, is well cast as her boss, in a role in my opinion played perfectly: perfectly understated, perfectly reserved, perfectly sexy . . . in fact I have now added James Spader to my list of most sexy men in films today.<br />If you want a debate about S&M, read some of the other reviews.<br />The two important things I believe you need to consider in order to thoroughly enjoy and appreciate this film are: <br />(1)Appreciate the comedy! If you can't see the wit and comedy in this film, and appreciate the genius comedic moments of both Gyllenhaal and Spader, (as well as other supporting players) you are missing the point; and <br />(2) Don't take the S&M so seriously, but understand that the film supports the reason for it, builds the justification for it logically and intelligently from the start, and successfully transitions the characters based on the S&M relationship to a fitting resolution.<br />As stated above, can't stop watching, or thinking about, this unique, superb film. <br />And I bet you 10 bucks it will excite most women like me - who despise hard-core porn and find soft-core porn just silly - but will find the sexuality in this film (both mainstream and otherwise) a steamy, sensual, turn-on.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|WOW!...This show has it all.  Stephen Schwartz has created a wonderful score which is performed with power and emotion.  It is clever and amusing while taking the audience back in time to see the story as it has never been told before and has plenty of plot twists along the way. This is one of the best shows to be produced on Broadway in a very long time!
B000002UAX|5.0|i've been debating for a year now whether this album or revolver is better. and i still can't decide. i don't have this on cd yet, only on record, but that doesn't mean i don't listen to it almost every night. its so eclectic, and the songs are just great. you can really tell the change of mind in each of the band memebers. they all start really experimenting musically on this one. they do almost every style of music possible. surf( back in the ussr) metal( helter skelter) country( rocky raccoon) prog rock ( happiness is a warm gun) blues ( yer blues) and even noise rock(revolution #9) all in all, this is one of the definetive rock albums of all time, along side sgt. pepper, revolver, the velvet underground and nico, and pet sounds. this is defeitnly great, if you can just scrounge up enough cash.
B00005JKN9|4.0|This was a very fun, interesting and violent movie. The acting was good. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio wasnt as bad as everyone is making out... but he did a good enough job to maintain his character in the movie in my mind. Cameron Diaz is always sexy in her movies, she was good to look at, and her character was a very interesting one. The best peice of acting came from Daniel Day-Lewis. He really got his character going the best, which was a joy to watch. The only problem i had with the movie, was that it seemed to lag a bit during the middle stages . It seemed that Scorcese was filling in the time with nothing scenes, but it comes out of the hole with a good ending. All the gangs in the movie are so different, which is cool. I also liked the firefighters :))) A very violent movie, but it doesnt go over the top. Very similar to the violence of Braveheart. Overall a good film.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a film that is incredibly complex? No, it's really not...not if you know what the film is really about.  Donnie Darko is more than a film it's a puzzle; I've finally put together the pieces after re-watching the film several times. If you've never seen this film you may want to stop reading this spoiler because I'm about to reveal the truth about Donnie Darko.  I've read many reviews about this film from critics and various members of the general public and nobody has ever explained what the film is about, WHY? Because they don't know.  I DO! Donnie is the second coming of Jesus Christ...he died at the end of the film because of peoples sins (To give them another chance to live).  There are many clues in the film about this. The cinema is playing the last temptation of Christ, Donnie's Psychiatrist tells him that if the world were to end then there would only be him (God) and you (Donnie) left.  Donnie cries after hearing this.  Frank asks him &quot;Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?&quot; Because he's Jesus.   Donnie's teacher tells him that an act of god would be the only way wormholes could appear out of nowhere.  Donnie explains to his teacher that it would be possible to travel in time along god's path. Frank is a vision from the future guiding Donnie to save the world.  Donnie floods the school so that he can meet Gretchen, he falls in love with her and she dies. Everything comes together so perfectly so that Donnie will save the world and die for people's sins. The plane engine is a rip in the space-time continuum (I.e. there's no need for it to be there) God uses Donnie to repair the rip.  Donnie calls Patrick swayze satin.  God is using Donnie to save humanity and Donnie Darko is the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Ok! Now you know the truth about Donnie Darko... go and watch the movie again...if you don't own it...please buy it from Amazon.com today.   Everyone should experience the best DVD release of 2003 and one of the greatest films ever made at least once.  It's a love story, a science-fiction film, a movie about the dangers of self help, a time travel movie and it's also none of the above as explained in this article. Enjoy the film!
039472903X|4.0|Although it is slightly dated, this remains a book that everyone in advertising should have on their shelf. Ogilvy may well be without peer as a master of advertising and anyone considering a career related to advertising needs to read this again-and-again. <br />Ogilvy is the natural heir to Claude Hopkins (and if you don't know who he is, pick up a copy of &quot;Scientific Advertising&quot;) and has the same understanding of advertising as both art and science that Hopkins did. Ogilvy knows that an ad campaign, no matter how visually wonderful it may be, must do one thing: sell. <br />Ogilvy understands that advertising is fairly synonymous with sales, a fact that far too many advertisers and ad people alike seem to keep forgetting. Witness the mindless glut of ads that ran during the internet boom, read Ogilvy and Hopkins, and you'll understand why so many internet companies died on the vine when they couldn't attract customers. Admittedly, a number of internet companies lacked a true product or service to sell, but most did not do themselves any favors with their advertising.<br />Whether you are new to advertising or a seasoned pro, this book is a must have.
B000002UAR|5.0|from the opening 1,2,3,4,1,2 then into those chords in tax man, to the last note of tommorow neevr knows, this is the best beatles album, and probably the best album ever. every song on this is amazing. you won't skip a single  track the entire time you listen. i would tell you the best tracks, but its just the entire thing thats amazing, so just buy it. theres no reason not to. if you're just getting into the beatles, or just wanna update your origianl vinyl copy, just get it. its amazing
0802130208|5.0|Without a doubt, this might be one of the funniest books I've ever read. The adsurdity of the story challenges our sense of sanity. I will never look at hot dog vendor the same way again. Toole's fine wit needles the fabric of this satrical story so tightly, he leaves us gasping for air.
B000001AKM|5.0|Wonderful songs, didn't know Lionel before but in this first choice also the best and also testing the other cd-songs i'm proud to say i have the best related to. Richard Marx and Lionel Richie are really my top favourites singers. <br />Stuck on you, Say you, say me, Endless love ( duet with Diana Ross ), just great.
B000092Q4U|5.0|&quot;This is 80's Slayer all over again&quot;  A quote said by metal icon Scott Ian, the frontman for the legendary Anthrax.  While Lamb of God may not reach the metal throne that Slayer has held down for years, the quote is quite suiting.<BR>Lamb of God deliver absolutely PUMMELING metal.<BR>Rough, deep, hateful and heavy as heck but not quite death metal.  Complex riffing and tempo changes but you wouldn't consider this &quot;math metal&quot;.  Fast precise riffing but not thrash.  An insane heavy breakdown here and there but no where near metalcore.  With all that said, Lamb of God still manage to throw in enough creativity to create a sound that is totally unique in the world of heavy metal.<BR>I got into Lamb of God just by word of mouth, and even though it took me a long time to get into these guys, both of their albums have not left my CD player in quite some time.<BR>Now to the album.  It kicks off with &quot;Ruin&quot; probably metal's best song in years and the rest of the album doesn't let up.  The title track rips you apart, then comes &quot;Purified&quot; with a solo by ex-Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland.  From then on we go to the murderous first single &quot;11th Hour&quot; to the skull crushing &quot;Vigil&quot; which showcases the band playing quiet for all of 20 seconds.  &quot;Pure American Metal&quot; at the very least.  Randys voice shows hatred in the purest form and the drummer, Chris, doesn't give you room to breathe between bursts of his jackhammer double bass drums.  The production credit goes to Devin Townshend (The madman behind Canadian metal psychos Strapping Young Lad) who gives the album a very raw feel but still ridiculously heavy.  My only complaint being the bass drums not sounding deep enough.<BR>In conclusion these guys are a breath of fresh air, metal, nothing less.  Praise the lord.
B000002UAU|3.0|sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band is without a doubt the singular most overrated album in the history of popular culture, music, or rock n roll. it was recently rated as number one on rolling stones top 500 greatest albums ever. no. no it should not have been. revolver is without a doubt the definetive beatles album. although this album changed many things in the way music was made. the production, the overall concept, the whole thing changed music forever. but still i ask myself how, and why. sure there are some real good cuts on here. the title track, lucy in the sky, little help, and a day in the life are really the only good cuts on this album. of course if you're trying to collect all the essential albums every band has ever made, of course you need to get this. but if you're just getting into the beatles, get revolver, or the white album
B00000J7JO|4.0|The melodies are a lot more...melodic than previous RHCP records, so anyone afraid that they'd only like a couple of radio songs need not be. At the same time, anyone looking for the hard rock edge of the Peppers are also gratified by SOME hard tracks; as well as rougher moments included within most songs.
B000003C5C|5.0|Leprosy, Death's second album, shows some fairly substantial growth from their already solid debut. It's still just straight forward old-school Death metal, but Chuck's got a better voice and more interesting lead work than most, and the songwriting is a step above the competition. All in all, an excellent album.<br />The biggest weakness is Rozz's lead work.  It tends to be a bit on the laughable side, mainly a bunch of trem bar squealing and obnoxious trills. It's not too much of a problem, as they tend to be short, and frankly a bit amusing even if they aren't exactly enojoyable from a music standpoint. Chuck's leads make up for his deficiency, however.  He's nowhere near as proficient as he'd become, but he's still exhibits why he's my favorite lead guitarist. He always has just the right combination of melody and speed, never being too melodic for the musical backdrop, but never zooming off in to tedious squealing, as do many DM lead guitarists.<br />This has some rather excellent DM production. Still fairly raw, but has just enough definition, and it's still very bulky and thick sounding.(unlike many roughly produced albums)  The drum sound is perhaps a bit over the top(I can't imagine a snare drum sounding like that in the real world) but it still works pretty well, giving the album a really great rhythmic punch. You can even hear the bass quite a bit of the time, though it usually isn't doing anything of particular interest.<br />Every track here is good. They don't have much variety, though most of them have a pretty memorable chorus, so they don't just blur together. The riffwork is very nice, with a good combination a chunky, thrashier riffs with blazing, death metal trem riffs.(which can get tedious if they are overused, which they are not here) It's mostly very fast, though it sticks with thrash styled drumming rather than using blast-beats.  Plus Chuck gives what is probably his best vocal performance ever. Very intense with out ever going over the top. The title track gives you a good sense of what's to come, with lightning riffs and a rather ferocious(if simple) drum assault, while still managing to have a memorable chorus and pre-chorus. The next to tracks are both very good, but Left to Die is the next real stand-out, and probably the second best track on the album. The chorus is fantastic, and it has a great middle break, containing what is definitely Chuck's best solo on the album. Next comes the much famed Pull the Plug, and I must say that I think this song deserves it's reputation. I would dare say that it has perhaps the best, most memorable chorus ever heard in a metal song.(certainly the best in thrash or death metal) The song is brilliantly written in it's simplicity. The progression from the slow verses to the sprinting pre-chorus to the absolutely crushing mosh-riff of the chorus works beautifully, all topped off with another cool lead from Schuldiner. Simply a fantastic song.  Open Casket is next, and is another good one.  It's a bit more progressive and unpredictable than most of the other tracks, and Chuck gives an especially eerie vocal performance.(listen to when he sings, Touch the Fleah, it is so cold.) This is partially offset by the following Rozz-penned Primitive Ways, which is easily the most straight-forward and simple track on the album.  It's perhaps the weakest song on the album, and it's still pretty cool.  Choke on It reminds is another more progressive piece. A bit slower and less heavy overall, with another great chorus.<br />All in all, this is another Death classic. Buy it..

B00005BL2A|4.0|Depeche Mode's &quot;Exciter&quot; continues their run as royalty to their signature synthesizer music.  They stay unique in their musical style after almost twenty years.  They prove on this album that they can still entertain audiences as they did in the beginning.  Their fast paced songs are edgy and catchy, which are sung by Dave Gahan.  His voice remains unmisidentifiable.  Their ballads are beautifully sung by guitarist Martin Gore.  Every lyric on this album is written and sung from the heart.  They begin this album with the catchy dance hit single &quot;Dream On&quot;.  This introduces the listeners to what's about to come.  Other stand-out tracks include &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; and the two-time Grammy nominated &quot;I Feel Love&quot;.  &quot;Exciter&quot; is a great album for those looking for great synthesizer music.  This will surely please many listeners.
B000063DI9|3.0|I'm a huge Iron Maiden fan.  My best friend is an even bigger fan.  Growing up, all I ever heard from him and his brothers was that Seventh Son was the best album Iron Maiden ever produced.  At that time, I really wasn't big into Iron Maiden, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Upon listening to the album, I decided that I really didn't like Iron Maiden.  Flash forward 10 years.  I was browsing through the record store and I decided, for no real good reason, to buy &quot;The Number of the Beast.&quot;  One listen was all it took to get me into Maiden.  I went on to buy the rest of their first seven albums, loving them all.  Seven Son, however, was the last one I bought.  By this point, I was really into Iron Maiden, so I figured Seventh Son would sound much better to me this time around as compared to the first time I heard it all those years ago.  But it didn't.<br />The main problem I have with Seventh Son is synth overkill.  On &quot;Somewhere In Time,&quot; they were able to find what I thought was a good balance between the synths and the guitars.  On Seventh Son, the guitars are far too quiet in the mix, and you hear far too much synth.  Every song on the album is ruined by the horribly overused synthesizers.  But the synths aren't the only downside.  To me, none of the songs are really all that good.  They're mostly boring and too &quot;pop.&quot;  This isn't heavy metal.  It's pop metal.  The only song on this album that I really like is the title track, mainly because, to me, it's the only song on the entire album where the band manages to pull it together and make a truly good heavy metal song.  &quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot; would be a decent song if it weren't for the completely stupid lyrics.  The same goes for &quot;The Evil That Men Do.&quot;<br />I can't understand why the hardcore Maiden fans find this album to be the best.  Of their first seven albums, I honestly think this is their worst.  It's not terrible, but when compared to &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; or &quot;Powerslave&quot; this album really doesn't hold up very well.  That being the case, I just can't understand how this album garners so much praise.
B0000942LT|5.0|Alot of people have critisized this album for being too slow, saying that Staind have &quot;sold out&quot;. I'll tell you now thats wrong. Staind has not sold out, but they have changed so that they are not running with the mainstream of most metal these days, and this is no bad thing. The powerful, moving lyrics and great guitars make this album an absolute essential purchase. It offers a break to the mainstream of metal these days.<br />Buy this album, you won't be dissapointed.
0385504209|3.0|WHile this story had some interesting information (or factoids), it was too pat and shallow to be worth all the hype. I recommend the art history mysteries by Iain Pears for better potboilers, and Pears's An Instance of the Fingerpost for a better novel with some depth.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; original score is a masterpiece.  Howard Shore proves that he continues to strive for the best for this monumental movie.  Most tracks are different from the other two episodes.  Every musical note blends perfectly with the emotional value and the theme expressed in the film.  The fight scenes become more intense, and the love scenes become more romantic.  Without this music, the movie wouldn't have the same intense impact.  The big orchestra and the choir perform wonderfully.  Every performer offers their own heart and soul aspect.  Annie Lennox's performance and composition of &quot;In the West&quot;, heard in the closing credits, is beautiful.  James Galway's flute pieces are delightful.  This album offers a great musical journey without the movie.  The major songs heard here will be remembered the same way the &quot;Star Wars&quot; theme is.  Many listeners will be highly entertained with music from &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.  Hardcore &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; fans should also buy the score from the other two editions.  This collection will keep listeners pleased.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|It seems that today there are two kinds of films being made. Those that have huge budgets, big names, release dates that are planned to exploit box office, awards and expected weekend earnings. Then there are those that are made for a &quot;certain audience&quot;. These films wear their pretensions on there sleeves and in doing so attempt to be branded as something &quot;daring&quot; or<BR>&quot;special&quot; because they don't have &quot;studio&quot; support. I don't mean to imply that some of these films (large or small budgets) don't have merit and are not good or even great films, as there are many that most certainly are. <br />30 years ago, Paramount wanted to capitalize on the &quot;dollars&quot; being generated by the Leone/Eastwood/Morricone trilogy. With a blank check and Henry Fonda, Sergio Leone succeeded in making a western that would fail to ignite at america's box office, garner mostly negative reviews and end up being hacked up by its<BR>parent, Paramount. What Leone and Parmount could not have known at the time was that Leone's 3 hour homage to cinema would take its place in the company of films like Welles's &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;, Laughton's &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;, Capra's &quot;It's a wonderful Life&quot;<BR>and Scott's &quot;BladeRunner&quot;, etc. These films and others rejected,<BR>disowned, chopped and forgotten, would join that small group of masterpieces from all mediums of artistic expression with the magic to reach into time and find audiences decade after decade. <br />Today, Leones beautiful and sad meditation on the end of an america that never existed, takes its place in the pantheon of greatest films ever made. See the accolades on the &quot;IMDB&quot; top 250 films, reviews from critics coast to coast on &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, film makers from Tarantino to Scorsese and most of all,<BR>those of us who have seen and been touched by this great film through the years since its creation. Today we have a beautiful<BR>representation of a great directors gift to the myth of an america that never was. It seems that Paramount has at last done right by Leone, wherever Leone's spirit rests, he must be pleased.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I was prepared to give this CD four stars instead of five.  It's just four guys -- no keyboards, no brass, none of the drama and classy instrumentation of later Dire Straits.  The songs all have a certain similarity.  If you like &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; -- and you surely know that song -- you'll like the rest of the tunes on this CD.  <br />      But then I listened to the CD again and the last 30 seconds of the last track, &quot;Lions,&quot; persuaded me that this is a five star CD.  In a brief instrumental finale to an otherwise unremarkable song, Mark Knopfler's guitar walks and talks and bakes cookies.  This guy is an exceptional talent.      <br />     &quot;Dire Straits&quot; comes close to what you might condemn as &quot;light rock&quot; but all the tunes have a hard driving beat and a sophisticated hillbilly texture -- if such a thing is possible.  For years I assumed that the members of Dire Straits were southerners -- from New Orleans, or suchwhere -- but then I learned they're from the north -- and the northern British Isles at that. So when they sing about &quot;way down south in London town&quot; they really are talking about down south from their near arctic climes.
B000000WA4|5.0|Wow, definitely one of my top ten CDs.  If you like to just surround yourself in a rich, rocking, melodic, musical environment for a few hours and escape your everday life for a bit, THIS is the best CD to do that to.  As Larry Mullen jokingly says in &quot;Rattle &amp; Hum&quot; (About Rattle &amp; Hum, but it really applies better to Mellon Collie), &quot;It's a musical journey.&quot;  <br />This has got everything for us Gen X-ers and any enlightened baby boomers.  It's got psychadelia in &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Cupid De Locke&quot;, brutally burning rock in &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Muzzle&quot;, &quot;X.Y.U&quot;, &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;, acoustic beauties in &quot;Stumbline&quot; and &quot;Thirty-three&quot;, epic emotional roller coasters in &quot;Muzzle&quot;, &quot;Porcelina&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot;, and &quot;Galapagos&quot;.  <br />It was bound to happen.  I LOVE the Beatles, but Billy Corgan created the best double album ever.  The White Album is a very close #2 in my book to this sprawling, beautiful work of art.  If you don't agree with that, you'd hopefully agree that it is the White Album of this generation.
B000002HEP|5.0|this cd is perfect.  kyuss had a touch. the songs seem to make me feel as if i am in the desert, and i love the desert.  this was my first kyuss cd, and i hope to buy many more.  this band came and the went, but they arn't forgotten. 'essential stoner rock.'.....peace.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Simply the most artistic, most creative and BEST jazz cd of all time!  Dolphy must have been from another planet, bacause humans don't seem to appreciate this as much as us from other Universes do.
B00008PBZW|5.0|I missed &quot;Windtalkers&quot; in the theatres, but I bought the DVD when it came out. First off, if you like WWII films, you will love this one. Second, I can understand how some people could say it lacks in story.<br />This is meant for action fans, and war film fans. It was NOT meant for the art house people that would rather sit through some French romance film. This is meant to excite, and cash in on the wave of post 9-11 war films. Like a good John Wayne film, it was meant to be a good John Wayne type action film. It wasn't meant to replace &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;.<br />Afther I owned the DVD for a while, I decided to buy the director's cut edition. It adds to the film, and really makes it more complete, because the original cut of the film left out some details in the story(like the romance between Cage and the nurse). Check it out, but don't look for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. You won't find it here.
0385486804|4.0|I'll admit that I (figuratively) devoured this book and was mesmerized by this extraordinary, tragic story.  But I've thought about it for a while now and I've come to the conclusion that I just can't agree with what Chris did, and am not so certain that Krakauer was justified in portraying Chris in such a sympathetic manner.  He does seem to have been a bright and unique individual, and his disdain and attempt to disaccoiate himself with our corrupt, flawed society has to be commended.  But the fact of the matter is, that in attempting to buck convention, Chris went about it in a very Western manner: selfish, individualistic, disrespectful.  I could go on about this for a long, long time; but I'll only touch on the last aspect.  In the book, Krakauer states that he received numerous letters following the publication of his article in OUTSIDE.  One was to the effect that Chris had no respect for Nature; Krakauer contends that he did, and tries to defend Chris on this point.  I have have to disagree with Krakauer completely.  Chris' actions denoted a profound disrespect for Nature, an attitude that unfortunately has been an habitual flaw in weltanschauung of our \\"civilization.\\"  His death therefore is nothing more than a tragic waste.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|average hookum designed to appeal to a more mature audience. it is violent in parts and logan does his fair share of cutting up people with his claws so maybe not for kids under 12. i like the new character night crawler and it was good to see the bad guys helping the good guys for a change.
B00008OWZC|5.0|i wasn't &quot;of age&quot; when zepp was in their prime so this album gives me a small sense of what it was like when they played live...minus some drugs i'd imagine.  unlike some of the reviewers i like the rawness and spontaneity of these recordings...that's what makes live performances interesting.  plant's vocals and pages guitar are fantastic but i still get most of my enjoyment from listening to bonham and jones hold the group together...fantastic music from a fantastic and legendary band.<BR>if anybody thinks that &quot;agitated&quot; is a serious reviewer go look at his other reviews...&quot;duran duran better than led zeppelin&quot;???...hmmmmm
6303212379|4.0|If I remember correctly, this movie did not have a stellar run in the theaters when it was first released, but it appears that it has developed quite a cult following.  I was hooked on it the first time I saw it, and it took several years before my enthusiasm began to wane.  But I still can't help but watch it  for a while when I happen across it while flipping channels.  It does seem to be on quite regularly, and I guess that shouldn't be all that surprising since its a fun and entertaining movie, well directed but not overdone.
B000060P79|1.0|This CD is really bad (not the good way). If anyone thinks they are punk then why are they on Nickelodeon!? Their songs are pointless. The lead singer sounds like he is suckin healium. Lyrics are very stupid. On the cover your seein a image that you would see from pop-punkers Blink 182 (who can actually sing) but no you get this Simple Plan crap. Save your money to buy some gas after work it will last longer im sure.
B000002L7J|5.0|I remember the first time I heard Meat is Murder.  I was back from college back in rural Iowa on a country road watching the thunder. When I popped in a tape someone had left in the car.  In the darkness and solitude I heard from my speakers something the likes I never heard before.  What first grabbed my attention was the amazing rhythm guitar work of (the most underated guitarist in the world)Johnny Marr. Not since the Grateful Dead have I heard such astonishing rhythm guitar.  Then the words started to sink in.  Morrissey is the Keats of our times.  Morrissey's wordsmith is equal to that of Lennon, Dylan, and Neil Young. This album is pure genius. Today as it was when I heard it for the first time hasn't dated itself and still draws out the same emotions. You owe it to yourself to go out and buy this now!
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I would recommend anyone to see this if simply for the visual aspects, but the story really boils down to, &quot;Don't do drugs, or THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!&quot;  Not much more to the movie...And I simply cannot get over the fact that the when the people use heroin, their eyes DILATE!  Did the director truely think he could put one over on the audience, or was he actually unaware of the fact that pupils constrict when someone uses heroin?  Either way, this never should have happened, shame on him.
B000000W5F|4.0|You could put this CD together with &quot;Some Girls&quot; and have a good double. Both remind me of the other.  I really liked &quot;Start Me Up&quot; when I bought this album in 1981 but I think the media has worn it out and I'm tired of it now.  But like so many other Stones albums, many of the songs here are distinguished by the album they appear on. Back in the days of vinyl, when albums had two sides, &quot;Worried About You&quot; was the first song on side two.  Side two is definitely different than one, I didn't pay much attention to it at first but grew to like side two just as much.  &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; is a beautiful song to end the album.  I remember hearing it a lot late in '82 although this record came out in '81. The songs are all good. &quot;Tatoo You&quot; is a stand out album that rivals or exceeds all their later works.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|I won't lie, I have never been an Alicia Keys fan but I got caught up in the &quot;Alicia Hype&quot; after hearing &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;. And that's all it was, &quot;hype&quot;. I admire this young lady's persistence but now she needs to quit. I suprisingly got through the first 4 songs on the cd and could not tolerate it thereafter. I think she should stick with writing or producing because singing is not her field.
B000000W5H|4.0|My favorite Rolling Stones song is on this album: &quot;Fingerprint File&quot;.  What I really love about this song is how the instruments seem to all be playing apart and still go together so well.  The bass in this song is my favorite.  &quot;It's only Rock 'n Roll (But I like it)&quot; really sounded great in the summer of '74.  This album followed &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; and although I like Goats Head better the albums compliment each other well.  The Stones 60's sound is definitely gone here, but nothing lasts forever.  This is probably their last album that has a total rock &amp; roll sound.
B0000TB05A|2.0|The video quality of this product was awful.  The lighter areas are completely blown out and all detail is lost.  The lighting, though appropriate for the event, is horrific in terms of photography.  The only gem here is Out of Control, the rest is rubbish we've all heard over and over again.
B000002JSN|2.0|Kashmir is at once haunting and grating, eerily beautiful. Easily the best track on this album.<br />In My Time of Dying and Trampled Underfoot are also worth listening to, but most of the rest of the album is uninspired and forgettable. And this from a Zep fan.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This album is definately just the beginning of Gavin DeGraw's career. I bought the cd when it first came out and it hasn't come out of my cd since. I've even picked up a couple more of Chariot to give as gifts this Christmas. Gavin's honesty in his lyrics prove that he has an amazing talent as songwriting as well as singing and of course playing the piano. If you haven't heard him yet now's the time. I've also seen Gavin perform live and he's amazing! Check it out! :)
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|Before becoming \\"everyone's band\\" earlier in 2003, they were just like any other British rock band trying to break into the mainstream. Their music was praised and played over by the UK media, but were only known in selective circles here in North America. It is hard to comprehend it when watching \\"Live 2003\\", which makes Coldplay look like on of the world's biggest and best bands, which they are well on the road to being.<br />The concert is composed of songs lifted from their two studio albums, 1999's \\"Parachutes\\" and 2002's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". The highlights from the former include \\"Shiver\\", \\"Everything's Not Lost\\", and the two big singles, \\"Yellow\\" and the achingly beautiful \\"Trouble. The newer album, which made Coldplay international stars, is well represented here, with stellar versions of \\"Clocks\\", \\"In My Place\\", and the blistering show-opener \\"Politik\\". As anyone who has ever seen a Coldplay concert can attest, the main attraction is in the light show that accompanies each song. Perhaps to help ease their transition into larger venues, Coldplay use loads of blinding lights, strobes, and even green lasers (during \\"Clocks\\") to liven up the concert. And you will definitely not be disappointed, since the variety of lights is very reminiscent of a Pink Floyd concert. As for the songs, they sound fantastic when played live.<br />The band themselves are not overly exciting. Chris Martin's dancing around the stage and odd \\"fist to the sky\\" dance during \\"In My Place\\" add some leverage, while the rest of the band looks rigid and uncomfortable, standing like statues behind their instruments. They remind me of Oasis, in that they are going through the motions while keeping in mind who is the real star of the show, and avoiding to spotlight. It's a pity, since they are gifted musicians who function well as a cohesive band.<br />The live DVD captures their show in Australia, ironically, in the smallest venues of the tour. The smaller (relatively speaking) venue means that the show has a more intimate feel, and the stellar camera work and editing make you feel like part of the audience. The sound quality is also really good, giving the songs bass and volume that you need from a concert DVD. The two added attractions are the 40 minute \\"Tour Diary\\", which is a mish-mash of footage and interviews, and two new songs, including \\"One I Love\\", which has a very Echo &amp; The Bunnymen feel to it. It's quite good, actually. Also added for value is an audio CD of the concert's best songs, so you can listen to them on your Discman and enjoy the pumped-up versions of their big hits. Overall, this is a great DVD/CD package.<br />Whether you are an older fan or a new initiate, \\"Live 2003\\" is Coldplay in their element and how they are best experienced. As far as concert DVDs go, it is a great value, considering what you get. Overall, it's an easy recommendation.nue means that the show has a more intimate feel, and the stellar camera work and editing make you feel like part of the audience.

B0000AFX64|1.0|Short and sweet this is not true wide screen, other reviewers were very correct in their observations. Simply a full screen format that has been cropped at the top and bottom. Sad really to think that such a large company needs to resort to insulting the consumers intelligience. I had already purchased the Boxed set but read that this movie version was way better in quality so I decided to buy this movie version, for those quick fixes of Galactica-mania. Guys I am quite dissapointed in Universal. Even though I am a great fan of Battlestar and know that every penny made only increases the chances of seeing it (the original) again. I would have to say to skip this version. Get the entire boxed set instead. I would have to disagree with a previous comment concerning the overalll quality of this version. Actually the Disc Set is much better in quality... So dont pay 20 bucks to find out as I did.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|For the first time in an Iron Maiden album, Bruce Dickinson´s voice is sounding annoying. Going all the time for the high notes, even sometimes seeming out of tune, his voice is really wrecked this time. He seems to be fighting all the time with his vocal chords. It´s totally strange, because in Brave New World and in the subsequent tour he was close to perfection.<br />The songs are, generally speaking, very good. I only have serious restrictions about two songs: Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier. Absolute fillers, both of them. <br />The production is muddy, that´s for sure, like you this term or not. Worse than in Brave New World. Dont´know what happened. Nicko McBrain is also &quot;sleepy&quot; here, his drumming is without inspiration or even attempting to make something great.<br />IRON MAIDEN is one of the last true rock bands of the world. They have purpose and respect their fans.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I really love Sarah Mclachlan and her songs are fun to sing to.  I wasn't sure if this one would be a awesome as the others but...it is even better!  She has so much talent and portrays it in all of these songs!  I love listening to this album!  I highly recommend it!  If you love Sarah, you will love this album!!!
0226264211|2.0|Now I understand how this illustrious liberal writer must have won so many people to his cause. The book is so boring, so repetitive, with such a bad writing, that maybe people agree with him fast, just for the sake of having his mouth shut up!<br />I see some points he tries to make, but mos of them are silly and naive. Maybe he would not have written this kind of thing had he wrote in our century...
B00000IOSU|5.0|This album is like a greatest hits album.  All of the songs are awesome!  A fun one to listen to!  I love Sarah and if you don't already, you will after you listen to this!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Matrix Reloaded was packed full of action, suspense, and incredible fight scenes.  However, the mere brute force of this movie was not enough to save it from being a philosophical letdown from the Watchowski brothers.  The entire &quot;cause and effect&quot; idea expressed by our French friend was nothing remotely surprising or interesting and only leaves the viewer waiting for a more in depth idea that never surfaces.  Not to mention any usage of philosophical dialogue is totally ruined by a blatent explanation directly following, but hey, he &quot;drank zee wine&quot; and now he &quot;must piss.&quot;  Is Reloaded worth having in a movie library?  Yes.  Does that necessarily mean that it was a successful continuation of an incredible plot and idea?  No.  On the plus side, the action scenes are incredible.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido has a style all her own!  Her voice is soothing and relaxing but her songs have a lot of meaning.  This is more of a contemporary-style album.  It is for anyone to listen to.  A lot of the songs are somewhat upbeat.  It's hard to explain but just trust me...it's great!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I bought this album with a lot of skepticism and not really knowing what to expect.  I am possibly one of the few people who opted NOT to listen to this album on MTVs now popular &quot;The Leak&quot; internet program where you get to sample the album before its release.  Initially, at first glance, it seems as if In The Zone will only serve another helping of Britney's now usual brand of &quot;pop&quot;.  This is simply not the case.  With In the Zone, Britney has captured not only my curiosity but also my respect to her as an entertainer and an artistic performer.  Her voice may not have the range of other current pop divas but what she lacks in vocal ability, she more than makes up in stage presence and charisma.  What's more, with In the Zone, you are able to witness her growth as a performer as well as a person.  \\"Me Against The Music\\" is clearly one of the weaker tracks although not the weakest on this album.  For all of its stellar power (Madonna &amp; Britney -two of pop music's biggest Icons- collaborating on one song) it misleads people to think that it is just another clone of Britney's previous albums when in actuality, it is a departure from everything we've come to expect from Britney Spears.  Her strongest track, in my opinion, is &quot;Toxic&quot; a little tune written by Cathy Dennis who has found renewed success by way of writing hit songs for the likes of Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue.  In the Zone offers 12 new tracks and one bonus remix version of \\"Me Against the Music\\".  Out of the 12 tracks there are only 2 that are less than average.  This, I feel, deserves 4 stars.  I was once only a casual spectator in the phenomenon that is Britney Spears, I am now a loyal fan.<br />Mario - <BR>DJ/ VJ - Washington D.C.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I really like Josh Groban but don't expect something too different than his first album.  His style doesn't change much in this one.  If you liked his first album...you'll love this one.  He's still really awesome!  He has a really powerful voice!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Could've used the complete rooftop concert. I have heard some of these tracks in stripped-down form on those late-night Beatles shows hosted by JJ. Great to have them as a whole. But the rooftop concert would have been cool. By the by, I think &quot;Agitated&quot; needs to take a long hard look at his life. Click his name and check out the reviews. The Fabs ripping off Oasis? Buy Justin Timberlake instead of Radiohead? Pearl Harbor instead of Saving Private Ryan?<br />Agitated: The members of Oasis weren't even born when the Beatles recorded Let it Be. Got it? Who is ripping of whom? Oasis, if you remember, unabashedly admit to cloning the Beatles sound as much as possible.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has everything that will keep you in your seat to watch it from beginning to end! But what i really liked about it, is that it was realistic and not all Hollywood Action/Computerized graphics; all of the stunts in this movie were real. The car driving scenes, the boat scenes, even the helicopter scene were all real!! No computers!! Plus, this movie actually had a good plot. Most movies now, are just all shoot 'em up, a car chase here and there, and some romance. But this movie had action following an interesting plot, and it was intelligently made with all the planning and escape routes (etc.) which made you willing for more. I recomend this movie to anyone, i gaurantee that you wont be disapointed.
B0000DZTIW|3.0|This is an entertaining work, but far -- and I mean far -- from great.<br />I don't doubt the score provides a good musical counterpart for Zwick's film, but on album this is a less than stellar work --melodramatic, redundant, and quite frankly pretty slow and uninvolving at times.<br />Yes, I read comparisons to other Zimmer works, like Gladiator, The Thin Red Line, Black Rain, etc, and those comparisons can indeed be made. Let me say this, however -- this score is far from Zimmer's finest work. There's no question Samurai is a \\"dramatic\\" score above all else, and if you want to get hear Zimmer's pinnacle achievement in that area, look no further than The Thin Red Line, the best, most restrained, and ultimately profound score of his career. Likewise, if you want a more obvious dramatic score from the composer, opt for The Prince of Egypt, another that blows Samurai out of the water in sheer scale and dramatic power. Want Asian Zimmer? Beyond Rangoon. Large-scale action scoring? Gladiator, The Peacemaker, Backdraft, Crimson Tide, etc etc.  <br />That's not to say this score is merely a culmination of other efforts and has no redeeming values. It, after all, is a pretty pleasant listen, and I have found myself returning to it several times, despite it being in my mind less than spectacular. The main theme, heard in the first track, is pretty and I suppose authentic enough in creating an Asian ambience. Likewise, the following tracks (and pretty much the entire first half) are subdued and interesting, if still overtly dramatic in a subtle kind of way, and I do admit that I like the Asian influence the score has. <br />The action, however, is pretty disappointing, and, like a lot of Zimmer's works of the past few years, seems to show the composer in a more regressed mode than anything. It's just synthetic percussion with synthetic strings... But, hey, let's add a few synthetic woodwinds to make it seem a \\"little\\" interesting. Yawn. Likewise, the action motifs are oftendownright simplistic and utterly unconvincing (again, it seems like a regressed Zimmer; he's written music that's much more complex and creative). Yet, in the midst of the mediocrity lay some interesting pieces, primarily \\"Ronin\\" and \\"Red Warrior\\". The first simply provides for some hugely aggressive, forceful percussion that is beautifully conceived despite its simplicity, and the latter is a noble, experimental piece that uses a warrior chant in conjunction with the <br />The final few tracks have repeat renditions of the theme played on low, horribly drawn out strings (a la TTRL), and quite frankly I'm snoozing by this point. <br />What can I say, this score doesn't really do it for me, especially when I listen to it without anything else to keep my attention. I mention this because, well, I'm an avid Warcraft III freak (PC strategy game), and surprisingly the score servers perfectly as background music for it. It's probably also worth mentioning that many of the softer moments in the score actually reminded me of older role playing games, if that means anything.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  It has such emotion and feeling in it as the characters (and horse) come together to create a phenomenal story.  I was moved to emotional tears as the story developed and was cheering loudly through the house for Seabiscuit to win the races....I really didn't expect to be this taken in by the movie, what a wonderful surprise....
B000002UB3|3.0|Although this is often touted as being the best Beatle album, for those of us around at the time of its original release it was viewed as more of a reprieve from the more disappointing years of 1965-1968 than as their &quot;best ever&quot; recording.<br />The Beatles produced some great and groundbreaking rock and roll from 1962 - 1965, then slipped into the orchestral backed, over produced pop dominated albums that were Rubber Soul, Revolver Sgt. Pepper etc.  As the band returned to more rock oriented music with the White Album (although there was way too much on that) and Abbey Road, fans were glad to see them getting back to their roots.  <br />As for Abbey Road, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is a 10-star song, and carries the album, but it's offset by the goofy McCartney songs on side 1.  Side 2 is OK.  Overall, 3-stars.
B000092ZYX|1.0|What is Radiohead? Nothing more than a band college kids listen to and try to be rebellious by doing so. There's no emotion in the music. Yes, I've done my research, I've downloaded their tracks. Each one is no different than the last. The song starts off quiet, then has Tom come in singing quietly, goes to the quiet chorus, to the next quiet verse, etc. No intensity. No volume change. No dynamics. I don't get what's so special about this band. Everyone says Tom Yorke is a musical genius. No, Ville Valo is. Tom Yorke just writes boring, mellow music and is one truly pathetically boring and lonely individual and critisizes American culture and America's mainstream and what hell our country has gone into. I agree the mainstream sucks, but you can't critisize it and then go on MTV 2 rock. I've noticed how kids listen to this and think it's so different that they have the right to critisize music like Nu-Metal. While Nu-Metal might not have the best musicians, it has intensity and emotion, and that is something you will never find on a Radiohead album. Not to mention Nu-Metal musicians are often more talented than Radiohead is anyway. Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour is a way better singer than whiny Tom Yorke. Deron Miller of CKY (though not a Nu-Metal band) is way better than this Radiohead's guitarist. Les Claypool of Primus, Hunter of AFI, Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc. are way better than Radiohead's bassist, which you can hardly hear half the time. I'd even go as far as to say Mark Hoppus of Blink 182 is a better bassist than this band's. And Radiohead's drummer is pathetic. Just there to do his purpose; keep a beat. Nothing more. Get the job done and over with. <br />If you want boring, plain music, do check out this band. There is absolutely nothing exciting about them. Want exciting, emotional music? Check out Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, Slipknot, CKY, HIM, Spineshank, Murderdolls, etc. Or that might not be indie enough for your rebellios spirit.<br />Go ahead and mark this as not helpful. My goal is not to get helpful votes but to get my point out.<br />P.S.:Anything indie sucks. &quot;Subtarranean&quot; is the worst MTV2 show ever. Want a good MTV2 show? Check out the Ball.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|Coming from a guy who couldn't stand this band a few years back, I now Love the ambient beauty of Rock that Coldplay brings to the stage. If you haven't heard a lot of their older hits, then this albumn has everything to offer. The way each track runs into the next, and being mixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, It can't be replicated from a simple mp3 download. There's even a few multi-angle options you can choose on a few of the tracks on DVD. I realy hope more labels start producing these DVD/CDs. Maybe then I'll stop downloading and do more purchasing.
B00005Y84D|4.0|Great concert, great music, inept camera work (thus only 4 stars). Sound, produced by Phil Spector, is actually excellent. It is the same as the theatrical version of the concert movie. It can be hard to find.<br />This came at the end of a running, multi-year collaboration between George Harrison, Eric Clapton, the Delaney &amp; Bonnie Band, Dave Mason and a whole host of others including a young Phil Collins. Many of the main musicians except for Bob Dylan had been playing together for years and it shows on the strong renditions of Harrison's songs. Harrison, Clapton, the D&amp;B band and Phil Spector had just finished the All Things Must Pass epic album, and Clapton and others from the crew had recorded the Layla album, also epic. After this some of the same people went on tour with Joe Cocker as 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen.' You simply could not have assembled a better band than this in the early 70s.<br />For this concert, it is the D&amp;B musicians backing Harrison, Ringo Starr, Clapton and every great session player in the vicinity. These performances launched the careers of Billy Preston and Leon Russell and returned Bob Dylan to the radio after a long absence.<br />It starts with Harrison explaining the notion of a benefit concert and how he came to organize it. This was the first benefit rock concert and really has not been equalled since. It also has some songs by Ravi Shankar and a small, all-star band of Indian musicians, as well as a few scenes of the suffering of the starving people of Bangladesh.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Matrix Reloaded is an exceptional film for people who appreciate the art of the moving image.  The director deserves high praise for being able to show this film with incredible angles, special effects, and scenes that have never been created before (i.e., the freeway speed chase).<br />PHILOSOPHY.  The philosophy of The Matrix is that we are connected to a web, a maze of interconnected fibers within the world that pre-determine what actions we will take within the future.  There is no reason to stop an event from happening; once it is meant to happen, it will happen.  As one scene mentioned quite thoughtfully, there is no point in stopping an event from happening, but you can try to develop a sense of meaning as to why it happened.  Meaning is far more important than trying to change human events.<br />The issue of predetermination has been debated for many, many years, but few films try to understand the issue with as much depth as this one does.  At the same time, The Matrix questions existance itself -- as there are parallel &quot;existances&quot; -- and reality is a questionable and temporary part of the universe.<br />Then, a word on the freeway chase: I have never seen a freeway chase presented with such close angles on the scenes themselves.  It was absolutely stunning and quite interesting for the mind to take in.  When watching this film, you get the sense that your mind is embarking on a grand experiment -- one in which you are to notice the artistic renditions, which are pleasing to the mind; to understand the philosophical overtones of the movie, and yet, still, enjoy the plot as it unfolds.  Certainly ought to qualify for a movie of the year in 2003.  Look forward to seeing Matrix Revolutions.<br />Michael Gordon
B00000FCBC|4.0|The cover albums are many times simply the fillers in band's discography between their regular albums.&quot;Garage inc&quot; is definitly not a filler.new versions of old (or not so old) songs that somehow inspired Metallica during their career are very good and interesting.from the blowing &quot;Free speach for the dumb&quot; up to few motorhead covers on second disc Metallica gives us whole bunch of styles.Misfit's punk,rock ballads,heavy metal roar and melodic hard rock.this variety is nothing else that they have did before or later.<BR>i love these new varsions of songs like &quot;Last carees/green hell&quot;,&quot;Sabra caddabra&quot;,&quot;Whisky in the jar&quot; (Thin Lizzy's classic) or &quot;loverman&quot; (Originaly performed by Nick Cave who has nothing to do wiht metal music...).album not deserves more that 4 stars because all in all it is not their brand new music anyway but these 4 stars are for amazing performances that are all here.hard rhythm section,heftield's deep vocals and hammet's fast solos are simply irresistible.of course this is not the classic Metallica from early years or Black album era but what the hell...i like it!
B00005M91K|4.0|The cinematography is breathtaking and the sound track captivating.  Often the film moves from scene to scene by visual analogies that are nearly seamless.  In the midst of the films evident spiritual concerns, we witness some of life's cruelties: the hungry and the homeless mostly.  Even here the film deftly finds beauty in the faces of the poor without, in any way, masking the dire human consequences of their poverty.  In all of these respects the film is quite exceptional.<br />In some obvious ways Fricke doesn't trust the viewer's ability to understand the film's spiritual theme.  It heavily contextualizes its theme by beginning and ending the film with people engaged in spiritual practices, almost as if it is announcing \\"This film will be about spirituality\\" and, later, \\"Don't forget this film was about spirituality.\\"  In that respect, Fricke made the film too easy.  Also, Fricke relies too heavily on time-lapsed photography.  That would be a perfectly acceptable technique if Fricke had done something new with it.  But how many times have we seen nature scenes with clouds rushing overhead or the rapid time changes from day to night and back to day again?<br />New age types will find the film flawless because it mostly privileges non-western spiritual practices. Hedonists (like me) will enjoy it as well: the film is unquestionably a visual feat.
B000002UA7|4.0|Kate Bush is marvelous of course.but why there is no any more upgraded collcetion like this? there is enough free space in disc here to have few later songs more like &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;,&quot;The sensual world&quot; or &quot;love and anger&quot; that shows more moder face of Kate and are simply amazing songs.<BR>anyway - &quot;The whole story&quot; shows kate's biggest hits up to her big hit album &quot;hounds of love&quot;.passionate music,no less no more.you will get in love with here music after hearing songs like &quot;Wuthering heights&quot; or &quot;Running up that hill&quot;.many experiments with sound,very melancholic melodies but it all digs dip in your head.a great way to start knowing her music.but as i said it is missing so many songs...
B00005JLYW|2.0|This film was one of the stinkers of 2003. Not a cereberal film at all but I wasn't expecting it to be. The leading ladies were of course the main attraction. Cameron Diaz is great for eye candy in this film. The Sweetest Thing wasn't exactly Cocteau but I enjoyed it even though it wasn't that good. It would've been hilarious if Sean Young was the villianess instead of Demi Moore. The plot didn't exist and Bernie Mac was annoying.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I was very excited when I heard that Sarah was coming out with a new album.  I have been an avid listener since \\"Touch\\".  I like that with each album she grows even more into herself.  What I don't understand is how many negative reviews there are.  It seems that most of the negative reviews come from those who are looking for the next \\"Surfacing\\" or \\"Fumbling\\".  If I wanted Sarah to sound exactly the same on every album and every song, I wouldn't be listening to her.  I would be listening to tween pop albums by Britney and Christina.<br />Sarah's artistic value is much more than belly-baring midrifs and over-promoted same sex kisses with Madge.  If you are truly a Mclachlan fan, you will appreciate this album as being independent from her other works and not compare it with previous hits.  The most important thing is the quality in which her past albums were made is still there.  And that voice.  Wow.  For those of you who can't appreciate this cd, I assume you are looking for something with no substance...
B00009UW0N|5.0|When I'm asked what my favorite scary movie is, I take no hesitation in the simple reply of \\"Halloween.\\" And while by today's standards, this may fall into predictable and cheesy, when it came out, it was a ground-breaking cinematic experience into a new genre that inspired a seemingly endless string of imitators.<br />\\"Halloween\\" was made in March of 1978 with a simple budget of only $320,000. It was made by a group of struggling young filmmakers out to make a movie. And, at first, the movie wasn't doing that great. But after a few weeks, Halloween kept rising and rising, that it made a new box office record.<br />The plot? Simple, simple, simple. The storyline centers around an escaped maniac who fifteen years ago killed his sister on Halloween night. Now, he's at it again, as he relentlessly stalks babysitters in his hometown, pursued by his ever-determined psychiatrist.<br />And that's it. Composer-writer-director, John Carpenter, along with producer and co-writer Debra Hill kept it at a very direct and simple premise, allowing the film to build and build as it goes on. And boy, does it ever. Instead of focusing on blood, guts, and gore to get the audience to squirm, \\"Halloween\\" relies on suspense and atmosphere to get the fear across, and does possibly the best job a movie could do. Carpenter also added in one of the most memorable and truthfully frightening music scores in movie history that lived with me for awhile to make me scared to see this movie again.<br />Starring veteran actor, Donald Pleasance, who portrays Dr. Loomis, he puts on a memorable performance that made this probably his most famous film since the 007 hit, \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" Co-starring, and introducing Jamie Lee Curtis in her first movie role, her character hit a fear chord with the vulnerable and hapless victim, Laurie Strode, adding a sympathy towards her in the most intense scenes.<br />\\"Halloween\\" had all the elements needed for the perfect horror film: the quiet little Midwestern town of Haddonfield to soon add in the new dimension of evil, put in with a great script.<br />Those memorable, tense scenes are ones that will always live with me and are known by horror films world-wide. The classic point-of-view from the killer as we enter the house and take a knife from the drawer all the way to the spine-tingling climax with a deadly battle in a bedroom closest.<br />We get a foreboding discussion on fate, as a teacher talks on and Laurie stares out the window seeing the killer, Michael Myers across the street:<br />\\"...fate caught up with several lives here. No matter what course of action Collins took, he was destined to his own fate, his own day of reckoning with himself...\\"<br />We also get one of the classic well-known movie lines, said by the Haddonfield Sheriff, Leigh Brackett, played by Charles Cyphers when he accidentally scares Curtis's character:<br />\\"...you know it's Halloween. I guess we're all entitled to one good scare, huh?\\"<br />Philosophical implications also include great speeches on evil wonderfully acted by Pleasance, as his character tries to convince the sheriff of that night's oncoming danger:<br />\\"...with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes...what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply evil...death has come to your little town, Sheriff...\\"<br />For now and in my opinion, \\"Halloween\\" will forever remain the definitive horror movie of all time and the best in its series, always good to look back to when I need \\"one good scare.\\"of Haddonfield to soon add in the new dimension of evil, put in with a great script. <BR>Those memorable, tense scenes are ones that will always live with me and are known by horror films world-wide.

B0000636UN|5.0|Ever since I first heard &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;, I've been a huge fan of Crow's.  I have every single of her albums and they were worth every penny.<br />&quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;, her fifth album, is no exception.  From the hard-hitting &quot;You're An Original&quot;, to the wistful angst of &quot;It's Only Love&quot; to the catchy pop tune of &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot;, Crow has yet another winner.  Another treat is &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, with a surprise appearance by Eagles' Don Henley.<br />Trust me-I don't listen to many current artists, but Crow is one of the few I make an exception for.
B00005UKKF|1.0|If you want a DVD of a wannabe stripper lip synching...then this is the DVD for you!!! <br />I mean, I can get the same thing on HBO or even in person at the Spearment Rhino. C'mon people. How can you call this talent? Christina Aguilera might be a hoe, but at least she can SING!
B00006WKSZ|4.0|Funny, but my CD copy of Tokya Tapes does include \\"Polar Nights\\". Echoing the sentiment of the other reviewers, the departure of Uli Jon Roth did indeed, in my mind at least, make the Scorpions a more commercial pop band.<BR>\\"Kojo No Tsuki\\", while somewhat out of genre, provides me an opportunity to wow Japanese folks I meet - how many Americans can sing a traditional Japanese folk song in a Karaoke bar?<BR>The guitar work by Uli Jon Roth on this album is unparalleled -- I could play \\"We'll Burn The Sky\\" over and over just to enjoy the virtuosity Roth displays. For what it's worth, this was the very first Scorpions recording I ever heard, and to this day, it remains my absolute favorite. Skip the \\"Breakout\\" and later recordings, touch base with \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" and earlier Scorps recordings. You'll not be sorry.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I stood in a nightmarish holiday shopping line approximately 50 feet long, and thought \\"never thought I'd buy a Britney Spears album but ok\\"! I heard a couple songs from this cd and knew I'd like it. It's different from her old cd's. She obviously isn't afraid to try something new. The album is a mix of dance, hip hop, and pop. She's my age now, and her old cd's seemed to mostly please young teens (10-15 year olds; you know, the squeaky girly songs about boys and such. I have some respect for Britney. She obviously has talent, and can dance, and definitely entertain. On this cd titled IN THE ZONE, I really like BREATHE ON ME, TOUCH OF MY HAND, and Shadow. In an interview Britney explained the meaning of Touch of my hand and she's right. There isn't anything wrong with it! . . . There's nothing wrong with it. Her vocals are also very good. She's getting better and more experienced. I just hope the rumors about her aren't true. I hope she's a good person because her music would be much more respectable. I think she likes to be sexy, but probably doesn't do it to sell music. It's hard to say! She has talent. This cd gets five stars because I'm not a Britney fan and I love it. Things change I guess. I listen to mostly everything. But I like orginality. The songs definitely have originality, don't you agree??
B00009KMEO|5.0|This is an over all great CD. There are some songs that didn't have to be on here, but they are still okay.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|Casper has been around for a long time and its good to see it turned into a movie and this movie holds up the grandness of the television show. The acting, suprisingly, was very good, forshadowing for the great things christina ricci would bring to the silver screen later in her acting career.<br />A greedy woman and her friend, i woudl say, inherate a mansion from her dead father, to soon find out it is haunted by 4 ghosts, so they hire a ghost doctor to rid the house of the spirits and the docotor and his daughter live there and work with the ghosts, having rough first encounters, and the daughter befriends casper, the youngest ghost. Turns out he likes her. Later at school it is decided that katt's house will be the place for a school halloween party. Katt and Casper discover a machine that turns the dead into living and peril happens where the woman kills herself to get her treasure and tries to use the machine but Katt tricks her and she moves on, then the dad accidentaly dies and Casper gives his one chance to live again to him and as a reward he is allowed to be alive again for that night and he and Katt become....well i dont know they really didnt show you too much into that.<br />This is a great movie with a very good cast. My favorite part of the movie, oddly, it the score. The sound of the piano solo is so haunting and beautiful that it just fits this movie perfectly. this movie is for anyone who enjoys a good time.
B000065U1N|5.0|I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this movie that I would unequivocally place in the same pantheon of great war films such as Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now. The focus of these closed-minded reviewers seems to be on the politics that are the backdrop of the film, when they claim that &quot;1000 somalis died in the clash and only 19 Americans died ... the Somalis [were portrayed] as the villains when all they were doing was defending their city.&quot; If they wish to vent their rage on American foreign policy, they should do it elsewhere rather than scapegoating &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. I am certain that others would be delighted to hear their opinions and anger over Americans &quot;terrorising&quot; a dictatorial militia. <br />Having said that, Black Hawk Down is an excellent movie. The cinematography is superb and eclectic in camera techniques. It does not focus unilaterally on battle sequences (which are stunningly impressive and memorable), but also ominous imagery of a dull and poverty-stricken Somalia. Tension is constantly mounting and discharging during engagements. <br />As many have mentioned, there are many characters in this film, but anyone with a three-digit IQ will be able to keep track of them. The depth of these characters suffers slightly because of the focus of the movie, their eighteen hour fight behind enemy lines. However, they are so endearing that the viewer elates over their successes and feels their hopelessness and frustration. <br />The conclusion of the movie was fairly anticlimatic; by then the whole engagement at Mogadishu will seems pointless and fruitless, but the lasting impact is delivered in a similar fashion to that of Saving Private Ryan, in the journey through hell the viewer has with the characters. Although this sounds like melodramatic platitude, Black Hawk Down manages this with sincerity, neither glorifying war nor deliberately shocking the viewer with gratuitious violence. <br />This film shines in demonstrating a believable account of the 1993 engagement at Mogadishu. I will leave aside the banality in stating that it is &quot;an excellent look in modern warfare&quot; as others have; ultimately, as Eric Bana says &quot;it's about the guy next to you&quot;. There is no jingoist political message to it, as others have implied, and I can say that with conviction as I am Canadian and did not feel as if American glorification was being forced down my throat. In this respect many other movies have been greater offenders.<br />It is an entertaining movie, one that is not merely a rehash of other war films but stands out on its own. Although not the classic that Saving Private Ryan was, it is an excellent movie.
B00000K19E|4.0|This movie is a monumental achievement in visual effects.  Despite the wierd plot and development, this movie still makes for an exciting visual roller coater ride.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Yes, you can hear a little bit of Metallica (almost in every song), Tool (check &quot;Honor My Father&quot; song!), and some other bands in the new Dream Theater album but the tunes are fantastic. It's relatively heavy but very clear and virtuose.<br />To cut the long story short (just buy the album!): it's a NEW GENERATION of progressive rock. Forget 80's and the pathetic junk.<br />Can't wait for the DT's next album!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Given the fact that the movie had the dialogue of a bad Shakespeare play, the film still works as a visual treat.  I just don't like the screenplay.  The movie takes itself too seriously.  Despite it's short comings, the special effects are just incredible and is still worth the price!!
B0000UHFC6|4.0|I consider myself a fan of Shore's film scores, especially the Cronenberg pictures and others such as Silence of the Lambs, which highlighted his capacity for oppressive dread. I've also liked the previous two LOTR scores despite some reservations, mostly having to do with his action writing. I had not heard the score for ROTK before seeing the film, and as I watched and listened, I truly felt that his level of inspiration was much higher this time around. From the first notes there is a suppleness and harmonic inventiveness that were frequently missing from the other scores. The first hour and a half of the film contained half a dozen or so quite memorable moments in the score, the most extroverted being the lighting of the beacons that appears here in the cue 'The White Tree.' (About half these moments appear on the cd.) Even the battle music here, normally the great weakness of these scores, had a surprise or two, such as the enormous trolls beating out the rhythms we'd first heard in the first films during the Moria sequence. It's true, though, that Shore's resourcefulness here isn't what it could be and eventually what we get is long stretches of droning and pounding. <br />That said, I have to say that I found Shore's theme for Valinor quite affecting, especially as it's used in the film, first during Pippin and Gandalf's 'eve of battle' talk regarding death as a passage to a 'far shore' (also missing from the cd). The theme appears at intervals when mortality looms, then in the cue here titled 'The Grey Havens' and is finally incorporated as the chorus melody in the Annie Lennox song 'Into the West'. Despite a bit of cheese factor here, I just love the sound of this theme and even the Lennox song. The perfect easeful close to all that has gone before. <br />I doubt I would like this score nearly as much if I'd heard the cd first. Many of the better passages from the complete score are here, but many are (unavoidably) missing, and this is music that works muchbetter when married to the visuals that inspired it. I do listen with pleasure to the cd (most of it) but I would recommend seeing the film and then deciding whether to buy the soundtrack. <br />Apart from John Williams, Shore is about the only composer currently scoring films that could have gotten through three films on this scale without disgracing himself. Goldsmith at one time had both the talent and the temperament, but seems to bring one or the other of those qualities, but not both, to most projects these days. Goldenthal has the technical chops, the lyrical voice, and can write brilliant scherzando action material, but one suspects he would have missed some of the opportunities that Shore takes for emphasizing the more sorrowful, melancholy overtones (and LOTR is a work filled with sorrow and loss). I must admit that I have complete faith that George Fenton could have written a full-scale masterpiece here and filled in all the missing spots that Shore missed, but I have always been partial to the amazingly gifted and accomplished Fenton. Williams? I think he would have given us a towering, self-assured piece that you could almost hear in your head before seeing a single frame of the film ... but ultimately I'm glad we got to hear Shore's take on all this. His talent deserves to be recognized and if the LOTR scores aren't his very best, I do think there is some very fine work here. Overall: B+
B00005JLXE|3.0|Based on Stan Lee's Marvel comic book, this movie adaptation is a plausible, if unspired superhero flick. Ben Affleck potrays Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer by day/red suited avenger by night. After being blinded by a toxic substance as a child, he gains super inhanced senses such as jumping high(just like Spider-Man) and hearing better then an average man. His father, a washed out boxer, is shortly murdered after the accident. Using his abilities to fight crime in Hell's Kitchen, he is calls himself Daredevil and avenges all that do wrong. He is pitted against a powerful gangster Kingpin(Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Farrell) an unusual expert marksman. He pairs with the beautiful Elektra(Jennifer Garner) who also has a vendetta as a fighting machine. I can't help like the plot, but to a point, when the story muddles through the final half of the movie. Affleck is a weird cast choice as Daredevil, i just can't get through the whole bennifer thing. This film is not as good as \\"Spider-Man\\" which has a better villian and a better superhero. Daredevil looks like a red-suited dominatrix.
0156012197|1.0|I have read the original French version and both English translations, and I must agree with those who say that Howard's translation is terrible.  His version loses all the charm of the original work.  As I was reading it, I already thought this new translation proved to be quite pointless, but then I came upon the passage concerning the picture of the baobabs.  The original adjective used by Saint-Exupery was \\"grandiose,\\" which holds basically the same meaning as it does in English.  Woods translated this as \\"magnificent and impressive,\\" but Howard!  Oh, Howard replaced this with \\"big.\\"  I'm assuming he mistakenly read this word as \\"grand,\\" which does mean big, but his proofreading should have caught that.  The rest of his translation does not sink quite to this level, but it does not nearly match that of Woods.  At least she managed to retain some of Saint-Exupery's magic.<br />I'm also offended that the publishers would try to replace Woods's classic translation with one that has language they consider to be more modern.  Le Petit Prince was written in the 1940s with what would assumedly be French of the 1940s.  Thus, wouldn't it make sense to keep it in English of the 1940s?<br />PLEASE do your best to find Woods's translation.  Do not let Howard taint your image of The Little Prince!  Beware of this new translation!
B000002H33|5.0|&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; may be the defining moment in Metallica's history. This album was released during the mid-80's and Metallica was barely getting as the world's greatest metal band. This spectacular album is nearly perfect in every  way. James Hetfield's vocals, Lars Ulrich's drumming, Kirk Hammet's guitar solos and Cliff Burton, who tragically died in a bus crash, gives us a fine final farewell as bassist. I'm questioning whether I like the &quot;Black Album&quot; better then &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, but the answer is a quick no. Because this album is more thrash than any album they done and features unforgettable songs like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, there best song, a classic ballad like &quot;Welcome Home(Sanitarium) which the lyrics describe a mental patient, and &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;, which describe a soldier. I love every song except I have doubts about the last two songs: &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; Istrumental songs are OK for me but I prefer Metallica songs with lyrics. &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; is the least likable song on the album but is still passable. Everything from the musical standpoint are great, the lyrics, riffs are all excellent.&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is a intelligent album and is Metallica's most complex album to date. This album should not be a miss for every Metallica fan's collection.
B00009NOF4|2.0|Radiohead were an amazing band in the ninties but are hard to like today.  Hail to the Thief was just too hard to get into.  Most of the songs seemed predictable and I just wished Thom Yorke would spit out what he was singing and quit dragging it out, it made it real boring to listen to.  The music isn't anything special at all, it comes off as if Radiohead have been stripped down to a conservative joyless band making the present songs sound repetative and dull.  There still are a few songs worth hearing that remind you of what Radiohead used to be, but that band is gone leaving the listener with a bitter old man nobody wants to get stuck talking to.  This disc is just for the hardcore fans who don't mind being force-fed a sub par only to crap out, in their minds, genius.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbusters is a bona fide classic movie.  It has aged spectacularly well and definitely deserves re-watching.  I'm sure everyone knows the story by now.  Three University professors in parapsychology in New York City get kicked out for being too weird, set up a private ghost-catching company and happily save the world while becoming rich and famous and getting the girl.  What a perfect piece of capitalist propaganda from the heart of the Yuppie world, NYC in the eighties!  Still, the basic &quot;American Dream&quot; story is easily recognizable and appreciable through any number of leftfield distortions, and the vitality of the script and the brilliance of the lead performances prevent the movie from being too cloying or schmaltz-y.  The humor retains a wicked, cutting edge, and certain set pieces are brilliant- Witness, for example, the opening scene of the movie, as Murray turns a psychology experiment into a pick-up scenario.  These scenes are still as funny now as they were then, unlike certain other Eighties movies that seem to have lost their cutting edge over time, for example, Teen Wolf or Ferris Beuller's Day Off.<br />The supernatural side to the movie (and this was the movie that paved the way for the X-Files, Harry Potter and Crossing Over) is incredibly well set out, as the prophesies begin to come true (just like &quot;The Omen&quot;...) and the group struggle to make sense of what's going on.  The science, while pure hokum, is also right-enough to be convincing, and the worlds of religion and politics also get gently mocked too.<br />The special effects don't really stand up against the stuff we're used to these days - the hell hound seems particularly lame - but Slimer and Stay Puft exude a certain charm missing from modern CGI.<br />My only quibble with this movie is the very end, where the evil god trying to destroy the world seems content to rely on...Mr Stay-Puft.  (&quot;No I'm not personally going to kill him - I'm going to put him in an overly elaborate easily escapable death situation and then just assume everything went to plan, what's wrong with that?&quot;) One would assume that an evil being intent on destroying the world after so many centuries of waiting would have a Plan B.<br />Anyway, go watch Ghostbusters today, and thank god this is one movie they never defiled by making a sequel! Oh no - wait a minute....borate easily escapable death situation and then just assume everything went to plan, what's wrong with that?&quot;) One would assume that an evil being intent on destroying the world after so many centuries of waiting would have a Plan B.<BR>Anyway, go watch Ghostbusters today, and thank god this is one movie they never defiled by making a sequel! Oh no - wait a minute....
B00004TH7Z|5.0|While this isn't quite as much of a metal milestone as the band's previous albums, such as &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;<BR>or, &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot; were, it is inarguably a great piece of work. After two somewhat lackluster albums, <BR>&quot;No Prayer For The Dying&quot; and &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;, Bruce Dickinson<BR>left Maiden, and the talented, yet inferior vocalist Blaze Bayley<BR>was recruited, and the albums &quot;X Factor&quot; and &quot;Virtual XI&quot; were made, two more weak albums themselves. But Bruce returned, and so did Adrian Smith, who had been out since &quot;No Prayer...&quot;, and Maiden recorded this triumphant return. With Janick Gers, who replaced Adrian during his absence, remaining, the band became equipped with a tripple guitar line-up, which fires on all six cylinders here. &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, the album's first single, and smash radio hit, is great, altough it's repeated airplay somewhat damaged it. &quot;Ghost Of The Navigator&quot; is well worth a listen, begnning with a mellow, soft intro, which slowly but steadily builds into a roaring barrage of guitars and drums.<BR>&quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; are great as well, the latter clocking in at 7:00 plus. &quot;The Mercenary&quot; is powerful, and is another &quot;role-playing&quot; song, ala previous Maiden songs, &quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, &quot;The Assassin&quot;, etc...<BR>The longset song here, &quot;Dream Of Mirrors&quot; is a wonderfully arranged track, with great guitar riffs. &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot; is the weakest song here, and it sort of breaks the flow between <BR>&quot;Dream Of Mirrors&quot;, and the epic 8 minute &quot;Nomad&quot;, yet another song describing a &quot;role&quot;. &quot;Out Of The Silent&quot; planet it the only other single here, and it is simply amazing. The first chorus is somewhat weak, whereas the guitars aren't as tight or rhythmic as on the following chourses. And finally, closing this rocking album is &quot;The Thin Line Between Love And Hate&quot;, somewhat weak, yet it contains some insightful lyrics. Now that you've heard the good of this album, it's time I give you the only one &quot;bad&quot; thing: It's production is pretty weak, and the songs don't sound as replete as they do on previous masterpieces. However, once you get past that, this album is sure to please. Not only will it please Maiden fans, but any true metalhead. While I'd reccomend &quot;Powerslave&quot; or &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot; over this, I'd still highly reccomend you buy it once the affeormentioned albums have become part of your collection. See ya for now, and remember: UP THE IRONS!!!
0783229526|5.0|Well, Terry Gilliam did it.  They said that no-one could ever make a movie out of Hunter S. Thompson's sprawling, oozing, rambling, incoherent, gonzo 1972 novel of the same name, but by Jove he did!  Not only that, he has made it wildly entertaining, watchable, hilarious and fun as well - a masterful achievement, given that the end of the novel itself breaks down into transcripts of tape as the good doctor himself gets the Fear.  Much of the credit for this should go to the screenwriter who adapted the book so well, picking the best pieces from the book and managing to thread a vaguely coherent timeline through them, as well as to Hunter S. himself, for writing a book where the monologues can be adapted verbatim and work so well as voice-over in a movie.  The type of \\"new journalism\\" practiced by Thompson and his alter ego Raoul Duke forswears objective description of vents for a manic subjective stream-of-consciousness retelling of the essence of the story.  Wonderful to read - almost impossible to film.<br />The true star of the film of course is Johnny Depp, on whose masterful portrayal of Duke the movie hinges.  He flails around frenetically, spitting out his words like a mad man in a fantastically broken style where the words trip over each other excitedly, racing to all get out at the same time lest some vital thought be lost in the overall melee, followed by pauses where he seems unsure of what he was saying in the first place.  What's the deal here?  What happens next?<br />Depp is ably aided and abetted by a chunky Benicio Del Toro who, despite his racial handicap, manages to portray the vicious and psychotic Samoan attorney that Duke is almost never without.  The two of them then busily careen around Vegas, having fun, breaking the rules and searching for the American Dream.  Don't bother looking for a plot here - there really isn't one. Instead a serious of fast paced, beautifully scripted mini-stories keep one enthralled from start to finish, from \\"My Favorite Things\\" to \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\".  (Yes, the soundtrack is wonderful too!)<br />If the film has a downside it is the manic nature of events.  The first time I saw the movie it passed me by in a blur.  I didn't really follow what was going on, beyond a surficial grasp of \\"they're wasted and in Vegas\\" reality.  Too many jump cuts, monologues and flashbacks to really get a grip of what was happening. However I then went away and read the book, and the second time I saw the film it made much, much more sense and I was able to get to the heart of the thing - to work out what it all meant.  The movies slavish adherence to the original text is heartwarming and while the book is incredibly entertaining and perhaps on the whole superior, watching the movie can be a cheap fix, a highlight reel assembled to remind you enough of the original without having to re-read the whole thing.  Besides, once you see Johnny Depp as Hunter S., you'll never be able to picture him another way, such is the genius of the film!  Perhaps that's why Thompson went to such great lengths to prevent the film from ever being seen.  A little ego can be a terrible thing.<br />My main gripe with the film concerns the last words of Gary Busey's appearance - \\"Could I please have a little kiss? I'm very lonely out here in the desert...\\" It's not in the original text, it doesn't make sense and it doesn't add anything to the film.  It shouldn't be there.<br />So read the book first and then watch the film and keep an eye out for all the celebrity cameos, Penn, Flea, Busey and yes, even the good doctor, Hunter S. Thompson himself...te Things\\" to \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\".  (Yes, the soundtrack is wonderful too!)<BR>If the film has a downside it is the manic nature of events.

B0000399WI|5.0|It's a rarity in the movie world that a movie can take you on the emotional rollercoaster that &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; takes you on.  It's unquestionably the greatest movie of all time, for a variety of reasons.<br />Great storyline.  A man who has been stripped of his dignity by his cheating wife is pushed even further down when he is convicted of murdering his cheating wife.  In prison, he's raped and beaten daily for several years, put in &quot;the hole&quot; for a month, and tortured in inhuman ways.  Despite the hardships, Andy keeps his head on straight enough to devise a master plan to escape from the prison that no one could ever escape from.<br />Great acting.  Morgan Freeman as Red stole the show, and Tim Robbins as Andy was equally impressive.  Bob Gunton as the Warden gave a steller performance, as he truly made you hate his guts in convincing fashion.<br />Great setting and screenplay.  At the Shawshank, it always looked dark, dreary, and cold.  It was almost as if the Shawshank had control of the weather patterns and the climate.  It wouldn't have had the same effect if they showed the inmates basking in the sunshine, and getting tans while out in the yard.<br />It boggles my mind that anyone could give this movie a negative review, but it just goes to show that even when you're close to perfection, you still can't please everyone.  This movie is as close to perfection as Hollywood has ever come.
B00005N5S5|4.0|This is a really cool movie, which easily deserves 5 stars, but unfortunately the DVD is a bit lacking.  It has deleted scenes, and &quot;making of&quot; extras, but only the deleted scenes have a commentary.  I'm really a stickler for audio commentary in Special Editions, it just makes it......well.....special.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When the show was on, I was fan.  However, I was a frustrated fan.  I could tell the show was in trouble.  The episodes were not aired consistently, and I would miss several due strange network scheduling.  Plus, I had trouble making sense of the story arc; I thought that this was because we'd never seen the original pilot until after the show was canceled.<br />When I watch my copy of the DVD, I realized how much this wonderful show had been wronged.  Not only was the spectacular pilot not aired, but the shows that were aired were shown in the wrong order!  No wonder people were having trouble following the development of these characters!  I've never been particularly impressed by network executives ideas about their audiences intelligence, but this a huge insult to all of us.  Let them know how wrong they are, buy Firefly and let them know the viewers were there.  <br />I'm a huge fan.  This set is well worth the asking price.  All the fans are waiting with anticipation for our next installment, the Firefly movie.
B00005JM02|5.0|DH &amp; I LAUGHED SO HARD!!!  It was SO much fun to watch.  One of the rare movies that entertain and make you laugh without resorting to obnoxious behavior or bathroom/bedroom humor.  unbelievably, I found Ellen Degeneres to be HILARIOUS as &quot;Dory&quot;  (I don't usually like her much).  This one, we bought immediately, which is rare since we are VERY picky about movies.
B00005JM02|1.0|Watch &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; if you are looking for a movie with no scary things in it. Totoro is Joy wrapped in a film. Watch &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; if your looking for the saddest Animation ever.(PG-13 for themes and R for sadness) Watch &quot;Kiki's delivery service and &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&quot; if you want to laugh. Hell even watch Pinocchino if you want a Disney Film. All these films will always be better than Finding Neom.<br /> Watch &quot;Millenium Actress&quot; if you want to see the best Animated film of 2003 (its rated PG-13 for some themes). But the Oscars will overlook this film and choose &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. What a shame. Go Totoro!!!<br />Finding Nemo is just a rehash of elements from other Disney/Pixar films. Its like Toy Story but with animals. Its the Rescuers without the wonderful mouse companions. The Rescuers was an excelent film. But nemo falls short. It fails to make you cry when it wants you to and it fails to make you laugh at its bad brand of funny humor. Its like everyone who's not a fish was stoned and everyone who was a fish was drunk. Go see Millenium acrtess if your older than 16 and go see Totoro if your ages 2-199. Go Go KIKI... Go Go KIKI
B00004YRQA|5.0|Guess the first question is whether this card is required or not ? And the answer is YES. For example if you are playing OffRoad Fury, you need to create/earn and save your profile point. Which in turn can be used to open locked race courses and/or \\"buy\\" better ATVs or uniforms. Sony should have included Memory card with PS/2 bundle. No reason not too. Quality is great - no issues so far. No excepting any since it a Sony product. Though at $25, it might seem expensive -- but it is required if you want to have fun with your PS/2.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Great actors, good music, and one hell of a good story.<BR>A film that should be included on your must-own movie list.
B0000DD7NL|4.0|I liked the way the album flowed, but none of songs left a bullseye with me. I think that she needs to come more into her own and stay more orginal.(I want her just to go off on that piano and sing her ass off.) I want to remember a song not just remember a version. I read her diary and I'm still waiting to get to her secrets. We are still just scratching the surface. But its worth taking a look at.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Part of the job of any movie is to manipulate the audience's emotions. This manipulation can be compared to a bell curve. Not enough of it causes the viewers not to relate to the characters and/or the story. Too much of it, and we feel used and abused. To me, \\"Seabiscuit\\" gets it about right. It's a gloriously old-fashioned movie about rooting for the underdogs. It's an ancient form of storytelling, but \\"Seabiscuit\\" tells its tale exceptionally well. <br />Based on a true story, this is about three men and a horse. All of them were in need of a second chance in the midst of The Great Depression of the 1930s. The horse, Seabiscuit, was from a noble bloodline, but was small and seemingly lazy. His original owners sold him off for next to nothing. He was eventually bought by Charles Howard [Jeff Bridges], a man who made a fortune selling cars but who was devastated by the death of his son in an auto accident. Howard chose as Seabiscuit's trainer Tom Smith [Chris Cooper], a man who saw his beloved West fenced in by civilization. The jockey was Red Pollard [Tobey Macguire], who was abandoned by his parents when he was a teenager. These men and their horse went on to become folk heroes by winning race after race. Eventually, they challenged the biggest and best race horse of the day.  <br />The acting ensemble does a remarkable job despite the script's being one of the movie's weaker elements. It has too many platitudes and predictable responses. The cinematography by John Schwartman and his crew is brilliant and amazing, and since the subject is horse racing, it is appropriate that the visuals take precedent over the dialog. Also helping to make \\"Seabiscuit\\" a winner are the simple but moving score by Randy Newman, as well as the wonderful re-creation of the look of America in the 1930s.
B00000JLWW|3.0|The special effects were quite good as the ship went down, but the unlikely love story was contrived and unconvincing. Leo is miscast big time as Jack. With the sappy love story between him and Kate Winslet, I anxiously awaited the sinking of the boat.<br />Best picture of 1997? Yeah, right!
0312983867|2.0|I have to agree with the Fort Worth reader. The story has some funny moments, but this is just another  romance novel, complete with insipid heroine in need of being rescued, then boinked (or boinked then rescued ... whatever).  She is supposed to be college educated. Why is Steph suddenly so stupid? C'mon, leaving her keys in the car while attempting to pick up a FTA,  and later going out for pizza when she knows she is being stalked by a maniac is reaching.  I really don't care how hot Ranger is.  Why should she worry about death cooties on her sofa,  then sleep unprotected with a guy who has been with the bar maid at the sleazy pizza joint?  Eeeew[...] <br />Stephanie needs to get a brain transplant.  If I want to read this kind of garbage, l'll pick up a Harlequin.
B000002H2Z|5.0|this Cure album, to me, is one of the most complete recordings in the entire Cure catalogue.  i remember back in '85 when i first heard this album, and it quickly became a classic in my music collection as track #10, Sinking, came to a close.<BR>everything from In Between Days with its undeniable groove to the flamenco sip of The Blood....wow, good stuff.  <BR>The Kyoto Song is a slow groove....The Baby Screams is some of the quirky, fun Cure that us Cure fans love so much.  A Night Like This, Sinking, Six Different Ways, and Push are simply some of the finest Cure songs ever written....they feel &quot;grand&quot; &quot;deep&quot;...i dunno, there is just something about those tracks that i dig....the words, guitar, keys, and of course, Smith's voice...trust me, this release is about alot more than the hit &quot;Close to Me&quot; (which i skip 8 times out of 10 anyway) Head on the Door is a different side of the Cure, but it is still the Cure, and it is fantastic.<br />Heaven<BR>Give me a sign<BR>Waiting for the sun to shine<BR>Pleasure fills up my dreams<BR>And I love it<BR>Like a baby screams<br />    -  The Cure/The Baby Screams/Head on the Door/1985/R.

0060916540|5.0|This might not apply to American readers (or it may, I don't know) but there's a huge misconception in the UK as to what this book is about. I work in a bookshop and we're selling this by the dozen, which infuriates me not because I do not believe it should sell well and be widely read, but because people are buying it for the wrong reason.<br />Touching the Void is, simply put, the story of the human spirit's ability for survival against all the odds. There are many occasions where both Joe and Simon could have given up; many moments when it could all have been for naught; but they kept going, and both lived to tell the tale. Simpson's writing is, as ever, vivid and visceral, putting you up on Siula Grande with him. We vicariously experience his time in the crevasse, his efforts on the glacier, and then his crawl back towards the camp, wondering if there will be anybody there even if he does make it. You know all along that he survives, but when he reaches safety you want to cry out because he describes it so painfully well. This is what the book is about.<br />With the impending release of the movie, and widespread radio coverage in the UK featuring interviews and editorials, a terrible misconception has crept in. Almost everyone who has come into the shop and asked me about the book has said, \\"I heard about this book on the radio. It's about a climber who cuts the rope on his friend. Do you have it?\\" By focussing on Simon Yates' cutting of the rope, it seems that everyone is missing the point. Far from a cold-hearted act, everybody fails to acknowledge that had Yates not lowered Simpson down several thousand feet of the mountain, a non-stop feat of incredible courage and fortitude, Simpson would not have survived, period. Simpson himself does not blame Yates for his actions, and this is the lead we should be taking. All these people who have never been on a mountain in their lives saying, \\"Ooh, he broke the code, he shouldn't have done that,\\" just have no idea.<br />I'm glad the book is selling well, and deservedly so, but I wish it could sell for the right reasons and not because people want the inside story on The-Man-Who-Cut-The-Rope.r />I'm glad the book is selling well, and deservedly so, but I wish it could sell for the right reasons and not because people want the inside story on The-Man-Who-Cut-The-Rope.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I think Radiohead is one of those few bands that can actualize a brilliant conception aurally.  They present very rich, emotionl, moody stuff.  It works.<BR>Their music reminds me a lot of Velvet Underground (vocally) and Pink Floyd (experimentation, concept).  But OK has its own greatness and is very original.  Radiohead will be one of history's next great rock bands.<BR>Yeah, I give it five stars.  I wouldn't say it was the best album of all-time.  One of the best, but I'm still partial to Dark Side of the Moon.  Of course this is a personal thing.<BR>Why is it that so much good music comes out of Britain, anyway?
B00005T7I1|4.0|the audio and the video were great! while amazon website and the back cover of the disc say the movie format was wide screen anamorphic 1:1.85 it was actually normal screen format of 1:1.33! there should be truth in advertising

0446677450|3.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a wonderful book to inspire people to learn more about changing their outlook on finances. What is missing is the insights into how it can be done. Sure, this book has vivid examples of how R. Kiyosaki has gotten rich, but I venture to believe he has earned more money from his surfer wallets and sales of the richdad products. In fact, there is a quote from Robert in the book, page 129 in my edition, that he does not recommend anything mentioned in this book to anyone. Come again? You are selling us on a book that asks everyone to follow his way of managing finances, yet, he tells you not to follow anything he does. Doesn't make sense.<br />Don't get me wrong, I am a Kiyosaki fan because I believe his writings open the mind to chaning the way we each look at finances, but if you are going to help others, then just spill out your formula instead of dropping tidbits here and there.<br />Everyone told me that Cashflow Quadrent is a better book with greater detail, and that is true. So, it might be worth skipping this book, and going straight to cashflow, so you have the extra $20 to help in building your personal wealth.
B000066NW0|5.0|Sure, you can call her a poseur. She is, after all, the biggest phony in the music industry. She \\"tries too hard to be punk, but she's really not.\\" She pronounced David Bowie's name wrong. She's a big idiot - she has temporary tattoos - she jumps on stage \\"un-punkly\\" - and her hair is unnaturally STRAIGHT - and dooood, wtf is up with that necktie??<br />BUT DON'T CALL HER TALENTLESS!!!! She wrote all the songs in the album and they are quite impressive! The album is just awesome! My personal favourites are \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"Falling Down\\"(from the Sweet Home Alabama soundtrack). She would've been more respected if \\"they\\" agreed to turn her into a country-rock singer or a Michelle Branch-type singer. So, like her for her music! Don't be a bunch of pussies and just sing along!

B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan received recognition from the music industry at the age of 17 due to the awe that she received when she performed with her band at the time, October Game, doing gigs.  At the age of 19 she received officially a contract with the recording industry with Arista Records.  With the same live performance awe that the representatives received watching Sarah perform live, Mirrorball leaves the same impact of such a performer.  In Mirrorball, there are many memorable heart wrenching live performances of Sarah McLachlan that makes this CD a great gift for all.<br />1. Building A Mystery: the guitars do a great job as they capture this song.  This live performance of this song is good: good instrumentation, vocals, and back up vocals. <BR>4/5<br />2. Hold On: haunting performance.  I really enjoyed this great performance, great vocals, and instrumentation.<BR>5/5<BR><BR>3. Good Enough  <BR>4. I Will Remember You: this song received quite a bit of recognition.  There is a nice soft feel from the warm voice of Sarah, the instrumentation, and the song itself.  This song is a Grammy winner for 1999 best female pop performance.<BR>5/5<br />5. Adia: Another great live performance.  Sarah does a great job vocally with this piece, as well as playing the piano at the same time.  <BR>5/5<BR> <BR>6. I Love You: Compared to the Album version, this song is much better.  There is so much emotion within this song.  The way it is sung is very soothing and full of dramatic pose. It is because of this song that I found myself drawn to the album version.  Much faster than the Album version.<BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>7. Do What You Have To Do: this song is sung with much dramatic pose.  The piano and Sarah alone can hone the song's intent.  Sarah proves that she is a great performer, song writer, and singer.  <BR>4/5<BR>          <BR>8. Path Of Thorns:  This song is great, but not great compared to the studio version from my perspective. The instrumentation is good, but does not match that of the studio version.<BR>3/5<BR>          <BR>9. Fear: This song is great.  The live performance gives this song much more dramatic pose by honing Sarah's voice and creating dramatic climaxes.  The instrumentation help create such effect as well.  Very haunting and well performed.<BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>10. Possession: This by far received recognition among the radio waves for great the great live performance.  This is my favorite as it shows the edgier side of Sarah, and also showcases Sarah's live talent.  She truly gives her fan a treat with this song.<BR>5/5      <BR>    <BR>11. Sweet Surrender: my favorite song of Sarah.  It is nice to hear this song performed live.  I like the instrumentation, it keep close to the studio version but much edgier.  <BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>12. Ice Cream: this song can be heard with back up vocals with Ashwin as it is a love song, perfectly sung with Sarah and her husband.  This is a great fun song to listen to, although it's not as nice as the others.<BR>4/5<BR>          <BR>13. Fumbling Towards Ecstasy: I love this song.  It sounds pretty much like the studio album but with just much more word coloring and dramatic pose.  Also, the live instrumentation is much more powerful in this song.<BR>5/5<BR>          <BR>14. Angel: Sarah and the piano create such dramatic impact with this song.  One of the more recognized song's of Sarah, she does a great job with this performance.  She puts a lot of emotions into this song.  There is also good piano improvisation with this piece.<BR>5/5<br />Sarah McLachlan shines as a live performance.  She is most comfortable on stage, and that essence is captured in Mirrorball.  For more performances, I truly recommend Mirrorball live on DVD for it has more songs included, with great performances as well.  Great live album.  Sarah and her talent has gotten her vary far, and this cd truly does prove her abilities as an artist.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney Spears emerged onto the teen pop scene in early 1999 with her debut album, 'Baby One More Time', quickly becoming one of the most successful pop acts of her generation. But, of course, we all know that \\"teen pop\\" isn't exactly the most credible type of music do make. With her first two albums, Spears followed a winning formula, guaranteed to have pre-teens and teens alike purchasing her albums, calendars, music videos and any other merchandise her record label decided to market. The sad part about this is that Spears was more of a tool, rather than an artist.<br />When trying to become an \\"artist\\" in the fall of 2001, with the release of her junior album, 'Britney', critics and music buyers didn't buy it. The album would've been a commercial success for others, such as Jessica Simpson or Mandy Moore, but no.. not for Britney. It became obvious that Spears had bit off more than she could chew. Once a tool, always a tool, unless, of course, you work hard enough to break that mold and prove to the record-buying audience that you're ready to get real. Christina Aguilera did it with her sophmore studio album, 'Stripped', so that was added pressure for Spears, who was to release her fourth album a year after.<br />'In The Zone', Spears' fourth album, released in the fall of 2003, was released with lukewarm reviews, but impressive first week sales. The album, which sold over 600,000 copies in its initial week, showed Britney in a new light (but wait, that doesn't necessarily mean the light shined bright). While her voice was and never will be anything to write home to, it was apparent that the pop princess was indeed trying to shed her good-girl image. Apparently, Spears thought Madonna could help her out, so she enlisted the Queen of Pop for the first single off 'Zone', \\"Me Against The Music.\\" <br />Big mistake, Britney.<br />It turned out to be a muddled, psuedo-dance song that went nowhere, musically. Was it different from her previous opening singles? Sure. Butdid it show that Spears was ready to become an \\"artist\\" rather than the \\"tool\\" she's always been? No.<br />The album, filled with cheesy dance-pop, wannabe-shock fillers and faux-R&B tracks were overall a disappointment. Spears was in a zone, alright, but it certainly wasn't a comfort zone. I give her points for trying to ditch the image and mature, but she's got to try harder if she wants to stick around with the best of them.<br />You only have so many chances, Britney. Stop blowing it.
6302891272|4.0|My name is Simo and I'm a high-school student in Nagoya International School, Japan. I watched different movies based on Shakespeare's Macbeth play, Roman Polanski's version which settings are close to the book version. BBC has made a play which is placed in the 90's and it tells about the Scottish civil war. Finally I watched Akira Kurosawa's film Thorne of blood, which is settled in Samurai era in Japan. Polanski's and BBC's Macbeths follow the book quite accurately while Thorne of blood is much looser. Thorne of blood has the basic story line of the book but there is lots of differences and some details are adjusted to Japanese society and culture, for example; witches in Macbeth are changed to evil spirits because there are no witches in Japanese culture. In Macbeth there are three prophecies about Macbeth's death but in the Thorne of blood there are only two; the prophecy about killer who is not a women born is missing from Thorne of blood. Kurosawa is a master in cinematography and he uses camera perfectly. The movie has quite slow rhythm because it has lots of long shots, the BBC`s Macbeth is more modern and it has faster rhythm because shots are shorter and there are more fast cuts than in Thorne of blood. Personally I liked the movie and I think that it is the best of the three movies that I have been talking about in this review.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This is britney's best dance cd ever. It's great for a party. And that's it. She wrote most of the songs...and honestly as a songwritter myself, there not good, ther's just okay. I think britney has the power in the music buisness to do some other type of production, and I also believe that she can sing, but she is not focusing on that, instead she's faking her voice so she can sing better while she dances. It's okay to dance, but it shouldn't be a singers main focus. I've seen old tapes of britney, and she CAN sing, problem is when it comes to recording a cd and choosing songs, even JLO sounds better( and she doesn't have a good voice). If you want a good dancd cd buy it....if not  keep your money.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't get to catch Firefly while it was being aired by Fox but I did buy the series when it came out to DvD on a wierd impluse buy and am so glad I did... I think the whole space/western with the Chinease influence is so weird but awesome. I love (most) of the actors, they have a great chemistry together, from what I understand Fox didn't give this show a chance what with airing it out of order and evertthing. Had they given in proper promotion and aired it in the original order it, and not given it the Friday night slot of death there's no way it would have been cancelled. They took an old storyline (a group of space &quot;outcasts&quot; and gave it a new twist. I really hope they go through with the movie but for now buy the Dvd, along with the special features which are awesome!
B00006EXCC|5.0|\\"Aftermath\\" proved the Stones could hold their own as album artists. It is a nearly flawless display of five musicians at the peak of their powers. This LP could be considered the first one after the band had achieved supergroup status on the strength of immortal singles such as \\"Last Time\\", \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Cloud\\". I believe the British LP is so much stronger than the US one and I'm glad that I was able to have both. For the uninformed, the US release which followed the UK one by two months, has \\"Paint It, Black\\" as its lead track while the Brit version opens with \\"Mother's Little Helper\\". Either one would suffice for me as both tunes are alltime classics and feature Brian Jones on the sitar. However the UK \\"Aftermath\\" features the full-length \\"Out of Time\\" one of my absolute favorites, plus \\"Take It or Leave It\\" and \\"What to Do\\", all left off of the US release. \\"Aftermath\\" was such a turning point for the band not only for the use of all Jagger-Richards penned tunes but for the exotic instrumentation. Dulcimer, marimba, harpsichord and the aforementoned sitar add flourish to such standout cuts as \\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"Lady Jane\\", \\"Mothers\\", \\"Time\\" etc. I absolutely love this record and cherish this era of the Stones almost as much as the 68-72 period. The UK version of \\"Aftermath\\" should be considered one the greatest albums in history and a major stepping stone for the five young Londoners future claim as \\"The Greatest Rock N' Roll Band in the World\\".
B000002J03|4.0|When LED ZEPPLIN II was released in fall '69, there were hard rock bands around other than Led Zepplin.  Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf, Iron Butterfly, Blue Cheer, Jeff Beck Group, and Ten Years After were some of the heavier rock bands playing. And yet something about LED ZEPPLIN II raised the ante. Over the next 12 months it would be followed by BLACK SABBATH, the debut album; IN ROCK, the classic Deep Purple album; and URIAH HEEP, the debut album. Four different British bands that began to mutate the heavy blues/rock riffing begun by the Yardbirds and Cream into something newer and heavier.  It really wouldn't be called &quot;heavy metal&quot; until later in the '70s, all these bands were just considered hard rock bands. But LED ZEPPLIN II, and maybe more specifically the track &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; which brought this sound to both FM and AM top 40 radio, were landmarks.  The band really cemented their reputation with this second album, and most of the tracks still hold up today as classic.
0156027321|5.0|The writing is so sharp, so closely observed and descriptive, that I found it hard to believe that this was fiction and not a memory of real events.  Who could describe the taste of turtle meat or the feeling of cutting one up, without having experienced it? Every nuance of life as a castaway rings true, and I start to wonder whether the Author's Preface is fact or fiction. And yet at the same time, the story is absolutely fantastic, impossible.<br />The bending of truth and fiction in the end of the book rather stunned me.  And then I had to consider which story was the better one.  And the parallel to believing or not believing in God was obvious.
B000002UAR|5.0|Very difficult to find fault with REVOLVER, perhaps a creative peak for the band.  This was released in August 1966, the same month they gave their last concert in San Fransisco.  Perhaps the direction their music was moving toward (&quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;) was one they felt they could no longer duplicate on stage, or maybe they just didn't want to try to play this for still screaming teenagers. The Beatles were recording so many great songs and were so popular that they didn't even need to include their best-selling singles on their albums to help sell them, like 99.99% of recording artists did.  Yes, it was a practice almost unheard of. Too bad, because I feel the addition of &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; (the single released that summer) and its excellent B side, the Lennon track &quot;Rain&quot; would have made this even stronger. Some reviewers have noted they sometimes skip over &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; or &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; when playing REVOLVER. They may be two of the weaker tracks on a very strong album, and I'm sure no one would ever have skipped over &quot;Rain.&quot; It contains the famous backward loop a stoned Lennon made by accident, and Ringo's drumming is probably the best he's ever done.  Wish they could somehow include these 2 songs on future pressings of REVOLVER.
B00006IU73|3.0|This album has three very well-made tracks: Blackest Eyes, The Sound of Muzak, and Strip the Soul. However, the rest ranges from boring prog to boring semi-poprock to boring Radioheadisms. And Prodigal? Yeah, you're the very first band in history to hate Jesus. Still, great potential is here.
B000002UAU|3.0|First, the concept of albums will soon become obsolete, what with MP-3 and CD burning.  The original vinyl SGT PEPPER released in June '67 coincided with stereo releases and headphones replacing mono and transistors for the younger set. And George Martin's production (Bob Dylan always said it was over-production) brought forth sounds that popular music hadn't experienced before. But if today's CD buyer were to analyze this album by the songs, he might think about half are good or even great, and half aren't, so why all the fuss?  Frankly, I always felt that the Beatles should have combined SGT PEPPER with MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (released only 6 months later), because SGT PEPPER was overrated and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was underrated.  The best tracks on PEPPER are &quot;Day in the Life&quot; (still a classic Lennon-McCartney song), &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Good Morning,&quot; &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends.&quot;  But they should have left in the dust bin &quot;She's Leaving Home,&quot; &quot;When I'm 64&quot;, &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,&quot; and replaced them with the stronger 1967 tracks of &quot;I Am The Walrus,&quot; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; and &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; from MYSTERY TOUR.   In fact, this is how I would have made their 1967 release of SGT PEPPER'S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR:   Side A -- Getting Better, With a Little Help from my Friends, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Fixing a Hole, Hello Goodbye, Flying, I Am the Walrus.......    Side B -- Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Within You Without You, All You Need is Love, Good Morning Good Morning, Fool on the Hill, A Day in the Life........       Now tell me Beatle fans, is that one STRONG 5 STAR album or what ?  They could have released their throwaway tracks of &quot;She's Leaving Home,&quot; &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,&quot; &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; &quot;When I'm 64,&quot; &quot;Lovely Rita,&quot; &quot;Magical Myster Tour,&quot; &quot;Blue Jay Way,&quot; &quot;Your Mother Should Know,&quot; and &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man,&quot; on some ANTHOLOGY UNRELEASED TRACKS OF '67 CD thirty years later.  As for me, I listen to SGT PEPPER'S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in my car all the time, and I don't skip any tracks.
0679311718|5.0|Besides being a well written and in depth account of the tragic events in Rwanda, this book is a devastating analysis of todays geopolitical realities.<BR>Yet, this book is also a sign of hope. As long as the UN peacekeeping forces are staffed with men like Dallaire I see real prospect in the long run.<BR>This is the story of a hero - precisely because the author does not see himself as one.<BR>A rare treat nowadays.
1556154844|5.0|Every serious programmer, or at least the one who wants to become one should read this book. <br />Book is supported with structured programming examples (Ada,C,Pascal), but the underlying principles that it is trying to present are as contemoporary as always. <br />I started my career as a programmer. As a novice I got to work on some (other people's) pretty crappy code that kept me up very long at night, and costed me a great deal of stress. Learning from that frustrating experience I asked myself - what is a good programming, and what would it take to learn how to be a great programmer/developer.<BR>I discovered Steve McConnel's book, and it helped me a lot in getting there. It remained one of the milestones of my career.<br />This book will teach you a lot. It will show you a bad way to code, and the good way to do it. It will give you a great coding tips, and it will show you some, as the author calls them, &quot;coding horrors&quot;. Moreover, it will tell you some great 80/20 rules that should help you with debugging, testing and refactoring focus.<BR> It will definitely change you as a programmer - a lot. Do I need to say again that every serious programmer should read this book.<br />The only thing that I could wish for would be a reflection on <BR>Object-Oriented programming and its good vs. bad practices.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this album is great!!!!!!!!! This is for the TRUE britney fans!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT listen to the bad reviews!!!!!!!!!! The only bad song is '' Shadow''  the rest are great!!!!!
B000002UDG|4.0|WHERE IS MAYBE I'M AMAZED? This song is one of McCartney's top 5 and one of any post-Beatles songs by any Beatles members. Other than that, everything is here. Say Say Say, Mull of Kintyre, Band on the Run, Live and Let Die, etc.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones are probably the best punk band ever for many (for me it's the Descendents!) and this is their best record! Why do I like this record? First of all it is a funny album! Catchy and snoozy so I highly suggest this record!
0393317552|4.0|If you want to know what he's talking about before you read the book, the other reviews capture it well.  Basically, it's a history of humankind, more specifically, a history of those times and accomplishments of humankind that have created the world we know today; its inequities, differences, and similarities.<br />It is extremely interesting, I've heard most of his arguments put forth piecemeal by people in the past, but this book looks to the evolution not only of people, but the larger societies of the world today, and of those that are unknown to the world at large, and his ideas of how these groups ended up dominant or peripheral.<br />The four stars would be five had the end not been so repetitive; it was actually difficult to get through parts of the last chapters, but overall, for all the effort and linkages among anthropoligical specialties, it is an amazing book.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a total essential record, not only for the punk fan but also for the music fan who likes real music not only one tipical style! All the songs on this CD are various and different and for sure!, they're all f**kin great!
0385504209|5.0|This book grips you from the first page. It keeps you in suspense, with many twists and turns, right until the end. The author's vast knowledge of religion and art history certainly lend to the suspense and makes The Da Vinci Code stand out from other books in this genre. Have an art history book on hand when you read it - and maybe a bible and the Internet, too. Have fun!<br />Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.&quot;
B00005R62K|5.0|Let's face it.  It was bands like early Priest, early Scorpions with Uli Roth, Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Kiss, Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, Alice Cooper, Mountain, AC/DC, etc. that really focused in on and started popularizing this hard rock and metal subgenre bigtime.  These bands (and i'm sure i've missed a few others) are the grandfathers of hard rock/metal.  Of course, Priest played a major role, since they were unquestionably one of the best to break into the scene, and 'Stained Class' is simply one of the most classic and best metal releases ever.  It is energetic, structured, raw, focused, and powerful, with incredible hooks and soaring vocals only as Halford can deliver!  I am 42 years young, and I still 'bang my head' to this classic (much to the chagrin of my lovely wife), having grown up listening to it in the late 70's.  The digital remaster is superb, giving extra punch, air, and grit to the already tight instrumentals and vocals.  The increased dynamics inherent in the remaster will give your system a workout!!!  Listen to this CD on let's say, a 200 watt per channel McIntosh amp, good highly revealing Magneplanar speakers, with twin Velodyne subs, and you will achieve EARGASM!!!
B000002GYI|5.0|...that Kraftwerk's Computer World is a wondrous masterpiece forged of newly developed modern machinery and German ingenuity. This is an album that remains timeless because of its truthfulness to themes important to humanity and for some kick-arsch production. A quick listen could lead one to believe that this is merely a minimalist effort, one that is defined by simplicity. But this would be a mistake, this album is a winding road into the future, with each track leading us onward into infinity. The parts are integral to the whole and there is a continuing musical theme that binds the songs, which makes it an enjoyable listen. &quot;Computer World&quot; is hypnotically intoxicating. Two fun tracks follow with &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot; then it is right back to the entrancement of &quot;Computer World 2.&quot;<BR>     Overall this album is very enjoyable. I would suggest it to anyone even scarcely curious about Kraftwerk, and certainly to anyone who enjoys modern electronica. Computer World has held up famously for 22 years, and it will for 22 years more. Lang lebt die Legende von Kraftwerk!
B000001ELL|5.0|Anyone who gives this release a negative review simply has no ear for good, quality songwriting, period!  The songs on 'Dynasty' are, quite simply, memorable state of the art 'power pop' meets hard rock masterpieces.  They are structurally and melodically tight as tight can be, and even playful and sexy at times!  And as a previous reviewer mentioned, some of Ace's most tasteful guitar work was layed down on 'Dynasty'.  This classic release is a MASTERPIECE, and the digital remaster gives the vocals and instruments extra 'air' and punch.  Listen to this CD on a really good high end system at a healthy volume.  If that doesn't 'do anything for you', you may want to call the local paramedics to perform defibrillation on you!
B0000DD7NL|4.0|A much better album than her last cd, &quot;Songs of A Minor&quot;. But Alicia still needs to push herself to be more original and not repeat styles from yesteryear. Don't me wrong, I love this cd but I get the feeling that I've heard this before from my 70s soul collection. Also when you consider the fact that artists like Andre 3000, R.Kelly, Erykah Badu, Kelis and Joi are taking the lessons of old soul and expanding it in another direction, Alicia comes off as dated. She can't survive rehashing old ideas. Soon, she will be compare to Lenny K. (who does the same thing with rock music). <BR>Alicia is at her best when she's writing from a personal situation. Songs like &quot;Diary&quot; and &quot;Nobody not Really&quot; are real gems. Her attempt at being 'different' falls flat. Songs like &quot;So Simple&quot; and &quot;Karma&quot; just don't impress me too much. But I give her respect for trying. In other words, Miss Keys needs to continue to grow because until then, I will never consider her a great artist. Until then, I will continue to listen to my Minnie Riperton cds.

B00006BXI0|5.0|This is the first ever Symphony X album to purchase. I simply heard this album at a friend's place, and he told me that this band actually ripped alot of riffs from Dream Theater...That what actually made me listen to it...And guess what...Dream Theater is no where near this bands level either musically or lyrically. This album is actually METAL...Progressive, heavy and groovey...This album bought alotta people into metal! This album has the perfect combination of neo-classic, old school metal and progressive power metal...I think...Russel (vocals) is just outstanding...Nothing to compare with James of Dream Theater...Romeo, a very great guitarist that I can really say that is the master out-there...<br />This album is a must for real musicians who appreciate progressive metal at its best...This album has feelings, it has meanings and has music which will touch you deep inside...<br />This is the album which changed my musical life and as a musician, progressive music is not only about odd timings and &quot;who-plays-200-notes-per-second&quot;...It's also about melodies and musical feelings...That is this album...<br />Long live Symphony X!
0967851408|1.0|Charles F. Haanel may have been both a genius and a successful businessman, but he certainly was no author.  The book does contain useful information, most of which is common sense, but the presentation and organization makes this book difficult if not impossible to derive any value from. Within each chapter is a numbered list of thoughts, or concepts.  In total in any one chapter there may be 30 or so numbered points comprised of two or three sentences.  These are identified as paragraphs.  The proper way to read this book would be in a meditative or contemplative state of mind.  Read a single point (paragraph) and consider it's deeper meaning and possible implications in your life.  However, to sit down and read this as you would any other typical book is very difficult.  I read the first chapter, or the first numbered list, and found it more like cramming for an exam.  Perhaps I'm too impatient, but I found this exercise a waste of time.  I simply threw the book in the trash and chalked it up to a bad call on my part.  What I was hoping for, and what this book for me was not, was the recollection of one successful man in how he transformed his life - what universally applicable truths did he discover, what mindset or values did he use, and how he put it all together to transform his life.  If this book contains that information in a useful form, good luck putting it all together.  I bought this book looking for a well-defined system.  In the end, there is no &quot;system&quot;.
B000008L90|5.0|<br />This is one of Donna Summer's less &quot;commercial&quot; albums. It is not one of her best sellers but definitely worth looking for. <br />Released on the Geffen label in the mid-80's, Donna makes a dramatic departure from her trademark &quot;disco&quot; days at Casablanca and goes for a fresh new sound. It includes songs that showcase her vocal ability like &quot;It's Not the Way&quot;, &quot;Oh Billy Please&quot; and &quot;Forgive Me&quot;, for which she won a Grammy (Inspirational). My favorites are &quot;I'm Free&quot; and &quot;Maybe It's Over&quot;. The album has a sound that is distinctively 80's but at the same time is very original.<br />It is rumored among Donna fans that this album is one of her favorites. There are many rarities associated with this album such as extended versions, special mixes and unreleased songs.<br />If you are looking for standard Donna songs, I recommend the &quot;Anthology&quot; or &quot;Journey&quot; compilations, however, if you are looking to explore a different side of Donna, this album has a few songs that are well worth looking for.
B000068PQ0|5.0|One of the quirkiest, most addictive albums I've heard.  This artsy concept album combines beautiful chord progessions with electronics and guitar.  It sort of reminds me of Pink Floyd with a upbeat pop sense.  Album highlights; &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&quot; and &quot;All We Have is Now.&quot;
B00005O5CM|4.0|She's a California sorority girl who'll do anything to keep her man. Even if it means going all the way...to law school! Reese Witherspoon stars with Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Matthew Davis, and Victor Garber in a knock-out comedy with a heart of gold-and hair to match!<BR>This movie is sooo adorable. I love the little dog, Bruiser. I love all of the one liners in the movie and the court scene for Reese's first victory! <BR>The only thing I didn't like was all the pink in the movie! I not really fond of pink. It's not my thing. But other than that, the movie was great! :)<BR>***Check it out***
B0000009S3|5.0|This album blew me away when i first heard it.  The combination of xylophone, sax, and woodwinds with incredible guitar riffs makes this jazz-rock-avante garde album something that can never be matched.  Zappa's guitar work in &quot;willie the pimp&quot; affirms his role as one of the most influencial guitarist of his time, and this album show him to be one of the most innovative composers.  A must for any true music lover and guitar player.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Dont listen to the other user reviews on this page, because theyre probably all just stoners. Citizen Kane is a great film about a man who goes from humble beginings, to having everything, to losing it all. Yes, the movie seems to drag in a couple parts, but once you see the ending, everything fits together perfectly. IS this arguably one of the best movies ever made? absolutely. if you appreciate good movies, and arent just an action meathead who cant handle a plot that doesnt involve explosions, this movie is for you. on a quick note, attention dumbass who asks why this movie wasnt made in color: THEY DIDNT HAVE COLOR MOVIES IN 1941 DUMBASS!! how dumb can you be??
B00007AJF8|5.0|I saw this movie with others and they all said, \\"What the f*ck?\\". I was amazed that a director that could put together a piece of artwork crazier than a Picasso paintaing but it all fits together through some sort of weave. Each minute the movie gets crazier and crazier with its doubtful plots about going into the mind of John Malcovich and bieng dumped out on the side of a highway. Cameron Diaz did an excellent job potraying the confused wife who goes into the portal to fulfill her sexual desires for Catherine Keener who becomes John Malcoviche's love interest. It was refreshing for her to play such a powerful role instead of the dumb blonde she usually portrays. John Cusak also did excellent as the troubled pupeteer who completely takes over Malcovich's body and mind controlling his life and fulfilling his life on becoming a professional pupeteer with Keener as his new companion. The movie endlessly goes nowhere but it was delicously entertaining and I strongly recommend it if your sick of the action/blood/guy-gets-girl themes in most movies today.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Iwas a fan of Buffy and Angel from the beginning.  When I heard Joss' next project was a &quot;space western&quot; I was skeptical.  Like all Buffy fans, though, I know that all you have to do is close your eyes and chant &quot;Trust Joss&quot; over and over--it will always work out.  While the series was on, I thought it had potential.  When it was cancelled, I was disappointed but not surprised.  After viewing the episodes as they were meant to be seen (IN ORDER), I was furious.  Firefly was betrayed, the viewers were betrayed, and Joss was betrayed.  This was not just a show with potential, this was a fantastic show.  I made my dad watch the pilot (the REAL pilot), and halfway through it he turned to me and said &quot;How on Earth did this get cancelled?&quot;.  I still don't have a good answer.  I hope the movie gets made, both because Firefly deserves better and so my dad will forgive me for getting him hooked on something he can't keep watching.  Buy the DVD--so very, very worth the price.
B000067FP7|5.0|Some films are not what they seem. Take \\"Gremlins\\" (1984) for example. It is the story of a small-town kid who acquires a strange creature that spawns a pack of menacing green beings that terrorize the inhabitants of the cheery little area.<br />A silly idea, yes, but surely a fun one, and surely one to be cherished. It isn't technically a great movie, or even a very good one, but it doesn't mean to be. The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see \\"Critters\\"), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.<br />Thank Joe Dante for this movie. And thank him for providing us with magnificent and imaginative films over the years. He is one of cinema's great underrated directors, the man responsible for bringing other creatures to life very often, whether it is werewolves or small toys or Looney Toons.<br />The movie is centered around Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), the small-town kid mentioned above who is handed a Mogwai by his father (Hoyt Axton), who picked the puffy furball up in Chinatown during one of his routine salesman trips. Billy's father is a sort of failed inventor, reminding us of the frizzle-haired Doc Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in \\"Back to the Future,\\" only not quite as eccentric. \\"Back to the Future\\" came out a year after \\"Gremlins,\\" and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius. Time travel was a myth before \\"Back to the Future,\\" which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents. (H.G. Wells himself hadn't even approached these topics, and I can guarantee he would have never sparked a relationship between the sibling and his mother.)<br />\\"Gremlins\\" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like \\"Back to the Future,\\" stretched out into a bigger picture. I won'tkid you -- it's not as complex as \\"Future\\" is, but it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it.<br />Billy works at the town bank, hounded by the city grouch (Frances Lee McCain) and threatened by the vice president (Judge Reinhold). His long-time sweetheart (Phoebe Cates) works there, too, and at the local bar, occupied by drunks at night (and on occasion some nasty gremlins). The town loon (Dick Miller) is convinced there are gremlins about, and soon he is right.<br />\\"Don't ever get them wet,\\" Billy is more or less told by his father. \\"And don't feed them after midnight.\\" (See if you can spot the huge flaw in that rule.) Well, the small little Mogwai, Gizmo (voiced in burps and small cutesy sentences by Howie Mandel), does get wet, and spawns a set of fellow furballs -- all apparently mean-spirited and vile. And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.<br />Will Billy defeat the gremlins, get the girl, and save the town? Take a wild guess.<br />Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film \\"Toy Soldiers\\" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of \\"Gremlins,\\" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.<br />I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original. It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun. The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character. In fact, it had two -- a Donald Trump-like manager and a gremlin that more or less belonged in The Three Stooges, and definitely not in a movie about menacing creatures. In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny. (People complained that the launching of Frances Lee McCain out a window was too much, but come on.) <br />As a whole, I didn't think that the sequel worked especially well. But it has as big a fan following as the original in some respects, for those who favor goofy, pointless cash-ins over original, hysterical movies.<br />I wouldn't expect many people to love \\"Gremlins\\" as much as I do, but its charm is certainly worth commenting on -- and so is its wicked humor. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy. And unlike something like \\"Critters\\" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad. No sequel for that little creep.
B0000C1HLF|4.0|This sequel, although entertaining, fell short of my expectations. The action scenes are exciting, but sometimes seem and look too ridiculous even for TV. The plot is very weak and it does seem as if the writers threw together a bunch of fight scenes, revealing outfits, and special effects. Drew, Cameron and Lucy are still a great team and their chemistry together shines on screen. Bernie Mac as Bosley was the worst choice ever. I like Bernie but he was not suited for this role. Bosley is always a bit bumbling but smart and he always finds a way to come through for the girls. In this film Bosley is a moron. They tried to make him funny but it's just bad. It even seems as though Cameron, Drew and Lucy have a hard time pretending to laugh at his jokes. Demi plays an ex- Angel bent on revenge. Her character isn't developed but we learn she always had a problem with teamwork. The best part of the movie is when Cameron and Demi are fighting and Cameron tells her she has one important thing Demi will never have. Friends! Then Drew and Lucy fly in and help her. Overall this was a good movie. It was fast paced action with fun women who men want and women want to be. If it weren't for how terrible the new Bosley was I would've loved this.
B000089RVX|2.0|I can't believe how much of a fuss has been made over a mediocre band. Sure... they have some decent songs (Bring me to life, Going Under) but they still aren't amazing. I find the lead singer's voice annoying and as far as musical content goes... there is nothing special about this CD. The guitar is just loud, distorted power chords, the drums are average and I don't understand why everyone likes them so much.<br />I don't suggest you buy this CD, mainly because there a way better bands out there. They are definitely NOT the future of rock... unless the future is dull, talentless noise.<br />Better suggestions:<BR>A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth Step<BR>Tool - Lateralus<BR>Dream Theater - Scenes from a Memory
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is one of the best shows to hit Broadway in a long time.  I know this review is supposed to rate only the cd, but it's one of those shows that you just can't miss.  The music ranges from lyrical ballads, to fun and jumpy campy numbers to belting rock songs...and they're all just wonderful.  The cast is incredible and I believe &quot;Wicked&quot; would be enjoyable for kids on one level, but also appeal to adults with it's social parallels and perfect execution on another level.  So, buy this cd and don't miss this show live on Broadway or you'll be green with envy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It wasn't a case of too little too late, this show was wonderful right from the start! Unfortunatly the execs at Fox were incredibly shortsighted, instead of giving it a full season they cut it short. But enough of the soapbox... Firefly is an awesome combination of sci-fi/western/drama/comedy. It's cast is first rate, writing is sharp and characterization right on the mark! One can only hope that Joss fights hard to get this back on the air or on the big screen.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I agree with some of the reviews, you grow to love this music after serveral plays. At first only a couple of songs strike you. The CD has wonderful sounds but the recording was not done well. The instruments become buried and not clean and separated. I wish the cd would be re-mastered. But the music itself is flowing and not forced. Sarah's voice is never better and lyrically interesting. Her vocals project such emotion it makes you dive right into yours. I find at first not liking this CD but now magically drawn to it as my favorite. spirit339a@netscape.net
B000002KE2|5.0|This album is my favorite album of any I've ever heard from Sabbath, well actually of any band. This is the definative Sabbath album.<BR>1.Wheels of Confusion-great song with cool riffs and bass lines.5/5<BR>2.Tommorrow's Dream-awesome song with a great meaning behind it.5/5<BR>3.Changes-this song is very saddening, especially with Ozzy's moaning vocals portraying a very hurt individual. 5/5<BR>4.FX-very useless and the only song (if it can be called a song) on the album i dislike 2/5<BR>5.Supernaut- one of the best blues/metal songs ever written. This song can never be duplicated in it's complete majesty. This is sabbath at it's best 6/5 :)<BR>6.Snowblind-this anthem about cocaine is my favorite Sabbath song of all time (other than Supernaut, and Junior's Eyes)10/5<BR>7.Cornucopia- cool song about people dying in wars such as the Vietnam War 5/5<BR>8.Laguna Sunrise-this song is a really good song but it's not near as good as Orchids 4/5<BR>9.St. Vitus Dance- I love this song. It's friecken awesome. The lyrics are complimented by great music and cool bass lines. Great song-period 5/5<BR>10.Under the Sun- This song is awesome. It's heavey as hell and explodes into the room whenever I play it. 5/5<BR>Hope this review helps ya<br />5.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|I took my wife to this movie since it was her turn to pick one out (I was all up for seeing Lord of the Rings AGAIN!!).  I brought my Palm Pilot to keep me awake through this as I'm not big fan of romances, not even romantic comedies.<br />Well, the Palm Pilot never came out.  This was truly a wonderful movie to see.  It was funny.  The three stars are Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, and (surprisingly) Keanu Reeves.<br />Jack Nicholson plays an old man hot on the trail of younger women.  He meets Diane Keaton, his young girlfriend's mother, and develops a (somewhat strained) relationship after having a heart attack and being forced to recuperate at her house.  Keanu Reeves plays the Doctor (when he walked in I said, \\"Oh, no!!  Not Keanu Reeves playing a DOCTOR!!!!\\") that helps Jack recover, but also develops a love interest in Diane Keaton as well.  Okay, I'm not what you would call \\"a Keanu Reeves fan\\"... but he actually did a great job in this movie... except the parts he was playing a doctor.<br />Highly recommended.  Prepare to be entertained and have you laughing from start to finish.
B000002KHH|5.0|Ok, time for my advice on this little gem. Paranoid is not necessarily my favorite sab release but it is for alot of other people. my favorite is vol. 4(check my review of it)<BR>1. War Pigs-great,great song. intro part( also known as Luke's Wall) is awesome.5/5<BR>2.Paranoid-biggest hit for sabbath and a very overated song,not that I'm complaining, it's very good for a filler :)5/5<BR>3.Planet Caravan-pretty good song to be slow. Like Solitude from Master of Reality it doesn't sound like the Ozzman but it is, i promise 4/5<BR>4.Iron Man-one of my favorite Sabbath songs. Great riff, amazing solo, and the drums at the end of the song is unbelievable. 5/5<BR>5.Electric Funeral- good song to listen to for a good thrill. it has a good riff and cool lyrics but falls a bit short of the Sab's standards. If you like this song try out Reunion, the best version of it is on that album.4/5<BR>6.Hand of Doom- I used to hate this song but I like it now, actually I like it alot now. It's a great song about heroin abuse. 5/5<BR>7.Rat Salad-it's a ok instumental but nowhere near as cool as Orchids and Embryo on MoR. 3/5<BR>8.Fairies Wear Boots-1. This song is about Skinheads not drug abuse as stated in another review.2. Great intro and cool guitar playing through out the song.5/5<BR>Hope this review helped out.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was worried that Peter Jackson might botch the trilogy up simply b/c his previous two films didn't work for me.  So, as the opening of the first LOTR film got closer and closer, I was really starting to wonder.  See, I knew that, comparing this to STAR WARS, that the fantasy genre would go nowhere in movies if LOTR bombed.<BR>Fortunately, I was wrong about Jackson and the quality of the movie, so, I am gladly eating my hat.<BR>FELLOWSHIP begins the tale of the struggle between good and evil in which the Evil Lord's ring, which is imbued with a great deal of his essence, is lost after good wins.  Through a series of incidents Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit, inherits the ring, but finds out that it must be destroyed or the world will end in fire.<BR>The extended version includes extra footages like: (1) more fight scenes with the Uruk Hai; (2) a scene of Merry and Pippin dancing; (3) additional Shire material in the beginning; (4) more with the fight at Moria; (5) a bit more travel time and sequences at Rivendell; and (6) more backstory about Gollum.<BR>But, the true treasure of this four CD set lies in the commentary of the creative team:<BR>(1) Did you know that Galadriel is a great aunt to Arwen?  So, when she talks to Aragorn about his relationship with her, it's more of a big deal than we think;<BR>(2) There's lots about the makeup of the hobbits and especially the hours spent on the feet and makeup;<BR>(3) Details of how the orcs and other fantastic creatures were made; especially about the rock troll;<BR>(4) Did you know that some of the people passing by the hobbits at the PRANCING PONY were acrobatic women on stilts?;<BR>(5) How many times they rewrote the prelude which introduced Sauron;<BR>(6) The makeup and design of Rivendell; why it was set with nature and many open causeways to the elements;<BR>(7) How the director got some of the most famous artists, who did renditions of Tolkien, to work on the set;<BR>(8) How the cast was chosen;<BR>(9) It goes through the whole movie with commentary by the director and writers; and then another run through with commentary by the actors;<BR>(10) Why the prologue with the battle against Sauron kept being taken out and then being put back in;<BR>(11) How the director told Ian McKellan (i.e. Gandalf) to compare Frodo volunteering to taking the ring to having a son who just volunteered to fight in the WWI trenches.;<BR>(12) How Sean Astin hurt his foot;<BR>(13) The CGI and how it helped plot the story;<BR>(14) Dwarf tossing remarks;<BR>(15) The design of the Balrog;<BR>(16) Why Tom Bombadil didn't make it in the movie;<BR>(17) How the director and writers had to deal with the producers and studios to accomplish certain feats (i.e. like letting Gandalf smoke!)<BR>Overall, a smashing success.<BR>Purists of the books will hate it or find something to gripe about.  Everyone else will love.
B000002KDO|5.0|This album is a crap load better than Paranoid to me. All the songs are awesome, I don't dislike one of them. Well, on to the review.<BR>1.Sweet Leaf- This song is one of their most underated songs.I love it. 5/5<BR>2.After Forever- Really cool song about God penned solely by Iommi. I like it alot. 5/5<BR>3.Embryo-cool instrumental but just takes up space. Should be saved for live shows only and shouldnt've been on an album, but still good 4/5<BR>4.Children of the Grave-the song that turned me on to sabbath still remains as an untimely classic. CotG-I love thee 5/5<BR>5.Orchid-Really, really good instrumental. This song takes alot of skill to play correctly. I should know as I am a guitar player. 5/5<BR>6.Lord of this World-awesome song. I love it. It has great music and cool lyrics. 5/5<BR>7.Solitude- this songs fooled alot of people by the way Ozzy sang on this song. I like it ok but it's alittle too weak for me.4/5<BR>8.Into the Void- It's a great song. I consider it the birth of Doom Metal. It is a classic without a doubt. 5/5<BR>Hope this review helped you out.
B00000J7JO|4.0|After years of battling drug addiction the now-classic RHCP's line-up regrouped to create Califronication. Although I must admit I enjoy One Hot Minute and I think Navarro is an awesome guitarrist, John simply works better with the Peppers, being the quintessential guitarrist. Californication isn't a completely jarring departure from BSSM, even though it is a change. The direction hinted at by tracks like Under the Bridge take prominence on this record, which contains quite a large number of very slow tracks and powerballads as well as more traditionally-styled rockers as oposed to Funk/Punk numbers which isn't a bad thing at all, since the Peppers have great ability with all these types of compositions. This record never becomes boring because of the variety, and it is indeed a solid offering by on of the best Alterna-Rock bands.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys did not captivate me with \\"songs in a<BR>Minor\\" although Songs in a Minor sits in my album<BR>Collector gathering dusts, I still took a chance on<BR>Alicia keys based on intuition hoping that this Cd<BR>Will be much different from the first; an Alicia Keys<BR>Did just that!

That is not bad<BR>At all considering the fact that all three Divas are<BR>Grammy award winners and can produce a league of<BR>Legendary song tress in their own right, Alicia Keys<BR>\\"Diary \\"has infused Blues, R&amp;B, Soul, and jazz in a<BR>Masterpiece of melodies, which might just garner her<BR>Another four Grammies, which this time I will solely<BR>Support, \\"If I aint Got you\\" Is and old' school blues<BR>Song, that gets right down to the basis of what love<BR>Should be all about, its lyrics speaks to young and<BR>Old, \\"If I was your women\\" I think this song<BR>Defiantly confirms that Alicia Keys is a mini version of Aretha Franklin. Regardless, of how many Diva's came out this season, Alicia keys has by far the best Cd of 2003 and 2004, \\"Diary\\" , has both outsold Brittany Spears, Beyonce and Even Ashanti first weeks sales, and more than likely sell more than 2 million within a month. If that is not enough to get this album than I don't know what it is? Now if you are not into blues, R&amp;b and soul than this lp is not for you. Just don't listen to the melody of the song, listen to the lyrics, let them touch your heart and maybe it will give you a wake up call, that Alicia Keys is the real and True Queen of R&amp;B!!!
B000092T6M|1.0|Let's start with the positive- Alan Rickman does a terrific job as the sheriff. The low points of the movie are too numerous to mention, but I'll start with Kevin Costner, hopelessly miscast as Robin Hood. Even local dinner theatre actors can summon up a decent English accent- Costner doesn't even attempt one. Instead, he deadpans his way throughout the movie, a sad omen of the rapid decline of his once promising career. Morgan Freeman does a credible job of breathing life into a multicultural stereotype- the urbane, civilized, enlightened Moor, lightyears ahead of ignorant, hypocritical Christians. This stab at political correctness fails- the myth of enlightened Islam, in Spain or elsewhere, is only a myth. In reality, the Moor would have tried to kill the infidels.<BR>   Avoid this movie at all costs- poor acting, political correctness, and other flaws too numerous to mention ruin the movie.
B000002KJQ|5.0|\\"ZZ Top's\\" first major selling album has all the guts and hard nosed grunge of basic rock and roll. Released in 1973 when glam-rock was peaking, this trio knocked the glammers on their butts with hard stompin' rock and blues. Less refined in vocals and stronger in bass thumping and chord driven choruses, \\"ZZ Top\\" was just starting to show their stuff. The first three songs really pull the listener into what the group is all about. The toe tapping \\"Waitin' For The Bus\\" is pure rock, segueing into the very bluesy \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\". The single released from this album was also one of their best. \\"Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers\\" is a ZZ Top classic that still gets airplay. For just a taste of early ZZ Top with no frills and just basic Texas R & B, this album deserves a good hard listen.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|The first listen through, you are discovering fabulous new songs.  By the second listen through you are singing along to the chorus and you hum the songs for days.  <br />I had the good fortune of catching Gavin's performance as an openning act this fall - I immediately ran to the back of the room after his set and bought the CD.  I have DEVOURED this CD since the day I got it, proclaiming a different song 'my favorite' every week or so.<br />It's true and honest.  It's unpretentious.  It's got just enough blues and soul to be heartfelt, and just enough funkiness to be catchy.<br />As I watched him perform on stage, my friends and I kept looking at each other with utter amazement - with his voice and his talent, how is he not yet a household name?!?!?!  <br />Just wait.  He will be.
B0000TB050|5.0|As soon as I had this DVD in my home I sat right down to watch it. I love the fact that songs such as Out Of Control, New Years Day, Angel of Harlem, and especially One are shown on this DVD. Having seen U2 live on this tour, I was hoping for a more live feeling concert DVD with this one. Boston was a great concert, but it feels more like a music video taping rather than a concert. I own all of the U2 concert videos and DVD's and so far I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite. If you're looking for a live, exciting, feel like you're in the crowd DVD, than this is the one you want to own. The lighting comes through just as though you were sitting in the crowd. On the Boston DVD the lighting seemed alot darker and sometimes wrong, like how an orange would come through as red, blue as green, etc. The Slane Castle DVD has the lights as they were at the concert, and this really keeps the mood going from song to song. The band were on, the crowd was on, and it was overall a great show to watch as it seems everyone had their own share of fun. Overall on a scale of 1-10 I would rate this DVD a 9 mainly because of the fact that they left Mysterious Ways as an extra where it should have fit in with the rest of the concert. I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of U2 or listens to their music.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This album has some excellent tracks on it, like &quot;It's no game part one&quot;, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, &quot;Scary Monsters (and super creeps)&quot;, and &quot;Scream like a baby&quot;. Some of the subject matter may be a bit off putting especially if you're in a bad mood. &quot;It's no game&quot; has a reference to suicide (about putting a bullet in his brain). But Bowie and pals do an excellent job here. Bowie's singing is good, and the guitar playing is good too. For some reason though I really enjoy Dennis Davis's drumming on &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;. <BR>I'm pretty sure he mostly worked with Bowie (I think this might have been his last album drumming for Bowie though). Dennis came from a fusion background and started playing with Bowie on Station to Station.

0790732203|5.0|BEST MOVIE EVER! TOM CRUISE IS EXTREMLY HOTT IN THIS MOVIE!  OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL PART WAS THE BEST!!!!
0393307050|5.0|Like the first ranging shot from a long nine-pounder, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; sets the tone for the vast, sprawling epic that is the Aubrey-Maturin novels- hinting at, but not fully betraying, the fullness of theme, emotion and understanding involved in such a long series. <br /> The characters are a large part of this- O'Brian makes it easy for the readers to understand how a bluff, forthright man such as Jack Aubrey could find a friend, and a foil, in the secretive, learned Stephen Maturin, and how together they could embark on great naval adventures. From the very first pages, in which Aubrey and Maturin nearly fatally misunderstand one another, through the early cruises of the Sophie, to the climax where Jack's impetuosity and daring overcome great odds to win a famous victory over a Spanish frigate, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; is full of nuances and coarseness, derring-do and subtlety, history and fiction in a mixture as compulsively readable as it is entangled.<br />New readers of O'Brian, fans of the film version of &quot;Master and Commander&quot; may- but more likely will not- be disappointed in the book. The film, a pastiche of several of the novels, crams incident after incident into two and a half hours. By contrast, over the course of the twenty-novel series, Jack and Stephen's fortunes have a rhythmic rise and fall reminiscent of the long swells they often encounter at sea. <br />Part of what keeps the fans of the novels coming back- even re-reading the series time after time- is the knowledge that just over the next wave, past the horizon, is something else worth seeing, knowing, having- and that thanks to Patrick O'Brian, they will find it every time.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have all 180 episodes recorded, I love this show. He is my number one favorite comedian. I saw him Live in Deluth Min; and it was great. The full series must come out on dvd. I will pre order the minute it is final. Please put out on DVD ASAP.
6305364613|5.0|Well, despite some bad reviews you've probably read before my review, and will read after, I think this movie is wonderful. I like it because The language is traditional Elizabethan: Totally Shakespearean, and because the setting is modern, it gives such a huge contrast. It's also thought provoking; imagine if we lived in a world like their's! The city looks nothing like a city I have ever seen, and that medieval atmosphere gives it a fresh take on modern society. The combination of all the odd elements really makes this movie work. The actors were amazing....Shakespearean acting is not something to be taken lightly, many people often train specifically to take on the roles Shakespeare created. However, I have a 'thing' for tales such as this one, I read the original play in one day. Shakespeare isn't for everybody, and if you're not willing to become involved in this movie, then don't even bother with it, because I doubt you'll appreciate its quality.
B000002KAT|5.0|I bought this album as a college freshman when it came out in 1968.  I had liked Brown-Eyed Girl, but this wasn't anything like that song.  I sorta liked it after the first listening, even though it wasn't what I expected.  After two or three listenings, I began to appreciate the intracacies of the individual songs and the genius of Van Morrison. Astral Weeks soon became my favorite album, and I've probably played it 50-100 times a year ever since.  Whatever mood I'm in, this album is appropriate.  Even though I never knew a good many of the words until the last few years (God bless the internet), the music is simply the most emotionally evocative that has ever been created.  The jazz guitar interplays, the ever-present bass backbone, and Morrison's voice are an incredible force of musical nature that cannot be taken lightly.  The songs are individual vignettes and very well constructed, but this is not an album with catchy hooks.  This is an experience to be savored as an entire creation.<br />You can't possibly find better music than this, and Van was in his early 20's when he made this album.  This is what it must have been like to hear Mozart or Beethoven.  This is not like a lot of what he has done since, probably Veedon Fleece comes closest.  In any case, buy this album, and play it all the time.  Then play it some more.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Hearing this tribute to George was very moving to say the least. What is so neat about this concert is that you can feel a genuine love and respect by the artists that performed some of my favorite George's tunes. Some of my favorite songs on the CD was 'If I needed someone', 'I need you', 'For you blue', and of course 'Something'. Something was especially neat with the first half being Paul on the Ukulele (light and whimsical) and then Claption finishing out the song (serious and emotional). This is just another Beatle-related album worth buying.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|At first listen you don't recognise the band's typical sound.<BR>They've tuned down the guitars, the drums sound more metal than ever before and James voice has improved several levels.<BR>And the synth-stuff for that matter is almost gone.<BR>It's great that the songs don't drown in synthical tunes.<br />At the second listen it starts to sound familiar.<BR>The dynamics are there and the insane guitar solos by Petrucci.<BR>And for me who prefer heavy to soft makes this album great.<BR>Their heaviest in all time.<BR>Portnoy's drumwork reach higher level, it breeds metal god damnit!<br />The only complains I have on this record is the disapointing guitar solos, yeah they're fast and insane but they don't have any personality at all...<BR>It doesn't match the material very vell...but still they are great even though they have a lack of variousity.<br />Final output:<BR>By the name of god is their best song ever.<BR>A truly masterpiece that will last forever!<br />P.S I rate this record as the only pure progressive metal material that these guys have come up with.
1573301183|5.0|I have been listening to these boys for years but honestly I had never seen them.  To see them doing many of their hits live was more of a thrill than I had imagined.  They are so talented and quite a charasmatic presense on stage.   Jerry and Layne harmonize together flawlessly.   The drums on &quot;No Excuses&quot; are perfect as well as the opening bass line for &quot;Would?&quot;<br />It is sad in a sense to watch Layne because of his untimely death but his creative talents will live forever in this concert.<br />Many times in the concert the band members talk to the audience and as I said before many of their best songs are played.<br />This is a must for ANY Alice in Chains fan.

B00006CXXU|2.0|The good news is the Christina has a good voice, much better than her mumbling counterpart, Britney Spears.  I don't own any other Christina album, so I can't compare it with her others The albums does have some good ballads, such as Beautiful but most of the songs are average or less. No need to discuss her radio hits, we all know them. These songs are disposible and will not stand the test of time. <br />She spends way too much time on this album trying too prove she's a woman. She comes across more like a little girl crying for attention. <br />And then we have the length of the album. It's too long. This explains why it's a weak album. Another reviewer said that 12 songs would have been enough. With less songs we can concentrate on the better ones. I felt exhausted after listening to it.<br />This album isn't good enough to keep. Sorry X-Tina fans.
0446530891|5.0|I have read four of David Baldacci's books with mixed reviews.  Split Second is by far my favorite book.  The plot has everything I look for in an exciting book:  Good characterization, a plot that ties into the past, short chapters, and a fast moving story line with lots of twists!  I highly recommend this book as one that you cannot put down!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Blind Melon &quot;Soup&quot;<BR>Talking Heads &quot;Stop Making Sense [Live]&quot;<BR>Pink Floyd &quot;Meddle&quot;<BR>Allman Brothers Band &quot;Live at Fillmore East&quot;<BR>Grateful Dead &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen...the Grateful Dead&quot;<BR>Neil Young &quot;Harvest&quot;<BR>White Stripes &quot;De Stijl&quot;<BR>Beatles &quot;The White Album&quot;<BR>Beatles &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;<br />Above is a list of some of my favorite albums of all-time. These are not all of my favorites, they are not in order, and I may have even left out an album that I would normally include in my top five. The point is, it makes me laugh how so many people assume that Radiohead fans are musically uneducated and that the only reason people listen to Radiohead is because they're so often referred to as &quot;different&quot;, &quot;rebellious&quot;, &quot;musical geniuses&quot;, or whatever. I listen to Radiohead because it's unbelievable music. This is my personal favorite Radiohead album, although I think that all of their efforts are beautifully crafted in their own right. If you ever get the chance to see Radiohead live, I strongly encourage it. I've seen tons of shows, and Radiohead is by far one of the best live performances I could ever hope to see. And I've seen shows the likes of CSNY, String Cheese Incident, Moe., Allman Brothers Band, Tool (Radiohead blows them out of the water live), Ekoostik Hookah, Smashing Pumpkins, David Byrne, Pink Floyd, Stone Temple Pilots, Rolling Stones, Flaming Lips, White Stripes, B.B. King, Government Mule, David Bowie, Lou Reed, Simon &amp; Garfunkle, and many others shows. The only show that I can really compare to the Radiohead concert is seeing Pink Floyd live, which, believe me, is a treat as well. If you don't see the beauty and pure genius behind the music of Radiohead, then I feel sorry for you. You obviously don't have the ear for music required for the listen.

0385504209|4.0|This is an interesting story, but not nearly so interesting as Kleier's LAST DAY.  While both books are spiritual suspense thrillers, LAST DAY is more powerful, far more frightening, and better written. It involves a topic much weightier and more shocking than CODE.  If you liked what you saw in this novel, I believe you will enjoy LAST DAY more.
0788815490|5.0|Merchant Ivory produced ten movies from 1986 to the mid 90's, making up a distinct british subspecies of uptight-victorian melodrama, the kind that have brought Helena Bonham Carter and Emma Thompson to world fame.  <br />This isn't one of their most famous works, but I like it very much. One reason is Alison Elliot, whom I fell for immediately.  Julian Sands is also a talented actor when he's not playing a warlock or wizard.  <br />Basically, this movie had punch.  I could feel Sands' greed, and his shame at his base motivations.  And I also felt Ms. Elliot's despair and resignation as her ilness progressed.  She knew she was being doublecrossed, but still went forward and gave the money in an act of forgiveness and grace.  The effect was sublime, and deeper than I expect from cinema these days.  The production and cinematography were also quite beautiful.<br />Merchant Ivory haven't done very much lately.  I do miss them.
B000002HPT|5.0|I'm not sure I understand the bad reputation this album receives from Dream Theater's supposed fans.  I've seen several people refer to this as Dream Theater's &quot;sellout&quot; album because, you know, all radio-friendly pop tunes are eight-to-thirteen minutes long and feature extended passages of odd meter.  I'm also mystified by those who praise Scenes From a Memory over this.  Just because it's overwrought and prententious doesn't make it better.  (One reviewer even criticized Falling Into Infinity's lyrics and then praised Scenes, which as far as I'm concerned, was mostly ruined by its contrived-sounding lyrics.)  The middle trinity of songs (&quot;Burning My Soul,&quot; &quot;Lines in the Sand,&quot; and &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot;) is truly where the album's strong point is.  It is amazing to hear how Dream Theater has learned to seamlessly blend the disparate parts of their compositions.  As far as I'm concerned, it is in many ways on par with Images and Words and Awake, and in some ways, it surpasses them.  If there was any change in their sound from Awake to Falling, it was a maturing.  It's such a shame Scenes From a Memory didn't live up to this.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Yet another addition to the Beatles catalogue. But a worthy addition since we can finally listen to the de-Spectorised Let It Be (Phew!) <br />I was delighted to see that Don't Let Me Down was included (since it was recorded during the Get Back Sessions and is one of Lennon's best). <br />The Long and Winding Road sounds MUCH better without the female choirs and the 'Wall of Sound'. <br />This is much more a BEATLES album than before, since neither McCartney or George Martin knew about the original Spector version. Yes, John and George aren't with us now, but John wasn't with us when the Anthology series and the 1 Album was released. Yoko and George had approved all these releases anyway. I'm sure John and George would be pleased to see Beatles material delighting the world 30 years and more after they broke up.<br />My only gripe is the deletion of certain memorable quips like Lennon's on Two of Us '....I dig a pygmy by Charles Hawtrey on the deaf aids! Phase 1 in which Doris gets her oats!'<br />But the inclusion of the bonus disc goes some way to rectifying this.<br />But a strong 4/5 nevertheless!!! Enjoy!!  <br />p.s. Must mention Agitated who isn't fit to review Beatles material if he thinks The Beatles rip off Oasis and that Rubber Soul was recorded after Sgt Pepper?!???
B00008J4P5|3.0|...then add some Hendrix and early Bowie and you get the 'White Stripes'. Throw in a bit of The Who and The Kinks for good measure as well. Now this is not a bad thing, sounding like some of the great bands of days of yore, but when it gets in the way of innovation and freshness, it makes listening a bit ho hum.<br />I was excited when I first got my hands on this, courtesy of 'Seven Nation Army', which I still think is a sensational piece of rock music, but the rest of the album doesn't live up to this track. Jack White's vocals are sometimes unique but often don't have the power to carry off some their work. Listen to the end of &quot;I just don't know what to do with myself&quot; and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about. He starts to strain and go off key which doesn't suit the rest of the track. My Bowie reference earlier was referring to vocals, which to me are very similiar Bowie pre-1975 on a number of tracks. I can't be critical of muscianship on this album as others are, in fact I think some of the guitar playing is pretty good.<br />But if you've immersed yourself in the music of the 60s at any stage I think you might just find you've heard all this before<br />Try this test, listen  to &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot; and if you think it sounds like the Beatles &quot;Sun King&quot;, then you'll probably find most of this album too familiar to be interesting. Thats not to say the White Stripes are not very good at what they do - they are. They cover a variety of sounds and styles which at least means listening time passes pretty quickly.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|from utter disappointment no doubt! I have to truly be the biggest Badu fan on earth but this album really just didn't do it for me! I really, really tried to like this Cd but it just didn't work for me. I don't understand how she can come with her previous 3 and then something like this! I just knew after &quot;Love Of My Life&quot; her fans were in for something really special. With the exception of &quot;Danger&quot; the rest of the album sounds like a demo!
B00005Q4CS|3.0|With this movie, the message is clear, don't ever do drugs, of any kind... they are dangerous and will destroy your self-respect and your life. Some of the images are shocking and this helps you a lot more to understand the danger... <BR>The bad thing is that you don't get to empathise with the characters (except Harry's mother, a great character), don't get to know more about them, their expectations, I don't know how to explain it, but they seemed like puppets for me, something failed... like they were not feeling really what was happening... Oh and that doctor, come on!, you cannot leave a patient who urgently needs your attention to call the police, that doesn't happen... About the pupils' dilate or contraction I can't say anything because I don't know...   <BR>This movie is worth watching, has an excellent cinematography and a message about all kinds of addiction... but it's not the type of movie you watch more than twice. <br />Trainspotting is still on the top, it has the fun, has the message, the reality, cinematography, the music, and the most important really great characters. You can watch it a lot of times, so it's worth buying...
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Damn Alicia...........YOU DA MAN, GIRL! I really can't stop listening to this CD. I really love the first single, &quot;I Ain't Got You&quot;, &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot;,and &quot;Dragon Days&quot;. I like the fact that you branched out with other producers that seem to compliment your style well. You were more R&amp;B oriented with &quot;SONGS IN A MINOR&quot; and more soulful on this one! You have both mastered! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Not nearly as good as Surfacing but I enjoyed the album nevertheless. The album features a pleasant collection of tracks that follow her style and tone. It's no masterpiece, but if you like her voice, you'll be pleased with this album.
B00005JMEW|5.0|For almost ten years my top 5 movies have been 1.The Empire Strikes Back 2.The Silence of The Lambs 3.A Nightmare On Elm Street 4.The Terminator 5.The Naked Gun, I never thought anything could crack that list, but Kill Bill volume 1 has. This masterpiece of our time has not only cracked the list but made it to #2. If this is just the calm before the storm so-to-speak I can't wait for Volume 2! But I'm also kind of distraught that the empire strikes back may be bumped out. Can a lightsaber really be beaten by a Hatori Hanso blade? Only time will tell...
B000006Y6X|5.0|i dont know what trichard was up about, but this is one of my favorite albums, right along with too rye aye, don't stand me down, and let's make this precious.  i found a dexy cd by chance and bought it for come on eileen, and thats where it started.  to me, there is no other music.  this is what life is about.  the only other stuff that comes anywhere close might be paul simon or colin hayes.  i hope that the dexy fan base stays small so we can hold onto the last good thing in the world without the population polluting it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a perfect movie for anime fans and fantasy fans who understand japanese culture.If you have a tree hugger in your family thos os the perfect gift.Another plus is its not one of those anime's that haave tons of nudity, gore , violence, and language.It only curses like 4 times (...)There isnt much viloence only a few times when the main character shoots arrows and it has gory affects(thats pretty much it for violence), and there is no violence or sexuality.Any way if you get the chance to see this fabulous you should take it without hesitation!
B00006HBUB|2.0|Although I wasn't a fan of the original Scooby-Doo cartoon, I decided to watch this movie because I remember reading that the movie was actually better than the cartoon.  Wrong!  Although the casting director made some perfect choices (wait until you see and hear Matthew Lillard as Scaggy - he's perfect), nothing can help the script.  Yes, it pokes fun at the original characters and premise, with lots of references to the pot-smoking, free love, horribly dressed seventies.  Yes, the plot is classic Scooby, with its hauntings arranged by villains - and hints of real ghosts. And yes, it tries to appeal to this generation of kids, particularly boys, with the elementary school playground humor of bodily functions.  But even with some genuinely funny moments, nothing gels.  It just comes across as an asinine attempt at nostalgia.<br />This movie was a complete waste of my time.  I still can't believe I watched the whole thing. If you loved Scooby-Doo, you're much better off parking in front of the television with the original.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is incredibly intelligent, modern prog rock/metal--kind of like Pink Floyd meets Nine Inch Nails. It doesn't hurt that Maynard James Keenan also has one of the most distinctive voices in music today. I would easily rank this as a modern classic. Listen to it with open mind and ears let Tool open your third eye too.
0679437223|3.0|I cannot think why it has taken me nearly forty years to read Heller's masterpiece. It lived up to all I had ever heard. The hero (?) Yossarian is desperate to get away from the insanity of war. The Catch is that he cannot convince the authorities of his madness because anyone wanting to get away from the war must be sane. This is the thread, which runs through the book. In the process we meet a host of bizarre, comic and tragic characters. There is the brilliant Major Major Major who will only allow men to come in and see him when he is out. In fact the higher they go the madder they get - Cargill, Cathcart, Dreedle and the wonderful Scheisskopf whose dream is to put his men in a parade. But for me the genius of the book is in the creation of Milo Minderbinder who manages to turn the war into an unrivalled business opportunity. Throughout the book there is the haunting spectre of Snowden - what really happened to him.<br />I cannot imagine that there is a more entertaining, more gripping and more powerful account of the insanity of war. Nobody should go through life without reading this.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I like Jennifer Lopez and the way she sings. But I only liked some of the songs on the album. My favorites are Waiting For Tonight and If You Had My Love. My favorite of all of her cd's would have to bo the one called JLO and J to tha L-O! The Remixes.
B00006L90T|4.0|I've bought 6 movies in the past few weeks: Carnival of Souls, Night of the Living Dead, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring, Island of the Dead, Evil Dead II, &amp; Dreamcatcher &amp; this is my favorite, second only to LOTR.<BR>Candace Hilligoss is excellent &amp; why she never became better known is beyond me. She is a far, far better actress than 90% of the rest of the actors &amp; actresses from her era. She's not bad looking either. She only made one other movie - Curse of the Living Corpse. Someone please find me Curse of the Living Corpse I've got to see this woman again.<BR>Carnival of Souls is a link between the horror movies of the 1930s &amp; the 1970-80s. George Romero (Night of the living Dead) &amp; Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead series) owe this movie a hugh debt in my opinion. There's also a scene very similar (to me anyway) to one in LOTR when Frodo &amp; Sam are making their way thru the swamp with Gollem &amp; Frodo looks into the water. This isn't Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street (in my opinion it's much better than either of these) but it is a very good suspenseful, semi-scary movie. 4 stars.
B000056NX5|3.0|I don't really care for the older version of this musical or the new one.  Both seem to have too much of whatever the time they were filmed look to them.  In the newer version though I thought the person who played Mary was brilliant.  She has a stunning voice and is so good.  The diciples are all awesome and some of the numbers in this moving are amazing.  Simon's Zelatos, Everything's Alright, I don't Know How to Love Him, and Hosanna are all so unbelievable.  My personal favorite is Could We Start Again Please.  That song is so pretty and I would recommend this version of it because it's better than the older one, though it could have been a little better.
0312305060|4.0|First, I saw the movie that was based on this book a year ago, and walked out not knowing if I liked or disliked it. In speaking to a friend of mine, she suggested I read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and then read &quot;The Hours.&quot; Her suggestion was I would get the best understanding from both this book and the movie. She was absolutely correct!<br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt as though Michael Cunningham had a deep admiration for Virginia Woolf and her work. Yes, almost all of the characters in &quot;The Hours&quot; are lifted from the pages of &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; However, Mr. Cunningham makes these characters interesting and alive and people I would like to know. He writes in an organized fashion, as compared to Mrs. Woolf's stream of consciousness gibberish. The characters seem to have more depth, curiously, than the ones they are based on. They are easier to understand and sympathize with.<br />I would highly recommend this book, but I would equally recommend reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; first. My own perception of &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; was that it was duller than dull, but it does provide the basis for the characters the Mr. Cunningham brings to life and makes their stories easier to understand. I suppose one could read this book without reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; but I would find that difficult, personally.<br />The one facet that Mr. Cunningham brings up that I either missed or was too bored with &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; to pick up is the passage of the hours and their impact on the people in this book. It was obvious to me that Mr. Cunningham not only appreciated &quot;Mrs. Dallowy&quot; but he seemed to have an understanding of what VW was attempting to tell her readers and failed at. Here, he has succeeded.<br />If you are a Virginia Woolf fan or purist, you will probably not appreciate Mr. Cunningham's attempt at incorporating her characters into this story. However, if you like stories that have characters thatare alive and are people you can relate to, this story will like hold your interest.
0783240287|4.0|THe music is wonderful and most of the actors and actresses do very fine jobs of portraying these characters from the bible.  THe kids are also really cute.  Some of the costumes are a little strange and it might have been better not to use such bright and showy of costumes (the less is more approach), but everything other than that is excellent.
B000065PUE|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time. It's monolithic in its goodness. Its ridiculous. I am shocked by it.
0385504209|2.0|I enjoyed the provocative information about the Magdalene but it was spoiled by a mediocre &quot;who dunnit.&quot;  The killer (big psycho guy, lacking melanin) was something I'd have attributed to Monty Python. I recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since they stormed onto the music scene with their debut album, Parachutes.  It was an instant decision, therefore, to buy &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; the band's sophomore release, earlier this year.  I've owned this album for several months now, and I actually find myself listening more and more and more to it as time goes on.  For me, that kind of ever increasing appeal the sign of a truly great album.<br />The first thing I'll note specifically about this album is that its biggest single, &quot;Clocks,&quot; gets my vote for the song of the year 2003.  This tune is creatively written, masterfully performed, and kinetically infectious.  There simply wasn't a comparable hit single in 2003 that bears the same level of craftsmanship as &quot;Clocks&quot; - it's a breathtaking song comprised of multiple layers of musical territory, a tune that will clearly continue to be a landmark for Coldplay throughout their career. <br />The marvelous thing about this album, however, is that &quot;Clocks&quot; is only the beginning.  Every single track on A Rush of Blood to the Head is outstanding.  While I wouldn't say the album is immediately accessible, it is immediately intriguing, and repeated listening breeds increasingly abundant dividends for the listener.  I believe that's how Coldplay envisioned it.  A Rush of Blood to the Head explores a wide range of musical territory, even within tracks, enveloping the attentive listener in the spectacle of it all.  Each song is independently rewarding.  Cumulatively, these tunes demonstrate Coldplay's fundamental musical intelligence in songwriting, which only gets better with the band's strong musicianship and the album's attentive production.  <br />I began to write about particular tracks, but somehow my editorial words don't seem to do justice to these songs.  Instead I'm going to leave it to you to listen and discover for yourself the plentiful (and I mean plentiful) treasures on this album.<br />I will say that in my opinion, A Rush of Blood to the Head is THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR 2003.  Music simply doesn't get any better.  This is a FANTASTIC ALBUM.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Ah - the White Stripes -for now the name conjures up images of the current `hep cat' with the necessary tattoos, piercing and attitude deluxe signifying what ever you want it to.<br />I first heard of the WS a few years back but paid them no mind - just another `buzz band' in a mediascape that needs ever increasing sounds and images for consumption. <br />However, because we have run out of the new we need to recycle the past for those that had never experienced it - hence this years new and improved blooz rock.<br />So now we had the WS, really a just so guitar and a drummer but added on to the music is the spectacle - the difference or a hollowing out with questions for a Life Style section.<br /> Are they brother and sister or husband and wife?<BR> Just add or subtract what you will for any one may say `here is something mysterious which I must get to the bottom of.' <br />Sure, we have heard this music before - maybe 40 years ago or last night just around the corner at the local bar - but you may have never seen the music this way. <br />Of course Dylan did the seeing years ago creating confusion and controversy but Dylan had some thing else - talent - and that is what is lacing in the WS. <br />If you want to hear the music do what I did - borrow a copy from your library and save your cash.
B00005JMFO|1.0|I couldn't stand this movie. It's got a brilliant British cast but it has the feel of a soap opera, with so many storylines and smut. I don't like to see too much objectional content in a movie so if you're like me then you might want to skip this movie. Its not the great Christmas movie that it promotes itself to be.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Look, these guys are good (well, Jack is, anyway), but this album's hype is WAY out of proportion to its musical merits.  I'd say that, at best, half of the record is good to borderline-brilliant, but that other half... whew!  <br />It makes me sad that the rock cognicenti are so desparate for the next leader of the new school that they are willing to lavish such unrelenting praise on a fairly mediocre album - and I say this as someone that quite liked &quot;de Stijl&quot; and &quot;White Blood Cells.&quot;  Here, more than occasionally, White's ambition gets the best of him, and when such occurs, it's embarassing, frankly.  <br />A good album, in the end, but five stars from RS?  Record of the year in Spin?  Give me a break - I'd much rather something deserving, like the new Outkast, or the Sun Kil Moon record, see the accolades (not that Outkast needs help in that regard; they were No. 2 on Spin's list).
B00005JMGC|2.0|I usually am a fan of Julia Roberts but this is a disappointing film. The movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It wants to encourage women but at the same time it puts down women that choose a more traditional role <--the film also makes it clear that its bad to want to pursue that. <br />I think the movie should have had the message that women are free to choose anything, to have different options. It tries to do that with Julia Stiles character but that message doesn't come across very well. There are some positive messages but those are far & few in between. It was also a very dull movie. <br />I'm sorry to say that it was a waste of time, I wanted to like it but it didn't turn out to be the great movie that I thought it would be.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I totally envy Britney Spears.  She has it all: beauty, talent, and amazing performance abilities.  She's also a great actress, and if you don't believe me, then see the incredible &quot;Crossroads.&quot;  But back to this album: it's really deep stuff.  Music doesn't get any more underground than this.  The lyrics articulate the tribulations of this young and accomplished woman.  Britney is a genius.  It would be a sad day if she ever retired.  I don't know what I would do!  I guess I probably wouldn't eat for days.  If you think this girl is just another manufactured face in the crowd, then get this album.  You'll immediately want to sell your Pat Benetar, Ann Wilson, Joni Mitchell, and Chrissie Hynde CDs in a heartbeat!
B000002UB3|5.0|Capping a string of the most incredible album releases known to the human race,Rubber soul,Revolver,Pepper,Tour,and the White album,then came this,one of the greatest albums ever.Rolling Stone magazine recently named this,along with the incredible Revolver,Pepper,Rubber Soul,and the White album as must have albums.Abbey road is a great one!
B000002UAX|1.0|It's pretty bold for the Beatles to release a double album, considering how shoddy their work really is.  Instead of releasing just one disc of mediocre songs, they're torturing us by releasing TWO.  90% of this album is basic filler and it could have been trimmed down to just an EP with 4 tracks.  I like the song &quot;Birthday&quot; but hated &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; and &quot;I'm So Tired.&quot;  Well, this whole album is &quot;tired&quot; and is another reason why the Beatles are so overrated.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The material on this collection has been in the hands of bootleggers (the same could be said about a lot of the anthology material of a few years back) for about 33 years now... by releasing this,the people get legit releases of what they want, the crooks in the boot market suffer loses... it's easy.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|Simply seeing -- and definitely hearing -- Yes perform Gates of Delirium and Close to the Edge with a symphony orchestra is alone worth the price of this concert DVD. Production values far outmatch other recent efforts such as Keys to Ascension. While Close to the Edge is inlcuded in the accompanying CD, Gates is not. That's a real shame because it is the highlight of this fantastic film.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|I'm probably not alone is saying that the music of Chicago was my first exposure to jazz of any kind.  At the time, I didn't know there were jazz elements in the band's music.  I just knew that what I was hearing sounded different from all the other stuff I was listening to.  And that it was very, very cool.<br />After buying this CD today and listening to it for the first time in probably 20 years, I was delighted to find it still fresh, alive, and exciting.  And it's still cool. <br />The album opens with \\"Prelude to Aire,\\" an outstanding combination of Walter Parazaider's wonderful flute playing mixed with some mesmerizing percussion from Danny Seraphine and (then) new member Laudir DeOliveira.  The jazz-influenced instrumentals that follow, \\"Aire\\" and \\"Devil's Suite,\\" are so compelling that you don't care that the boys aren't singing.  In fact it's not until the sixth song that you hear vocals at all, but when you do, Robert Lamm's voice delivers with a satisfying impact.   <br />The amazing thing about this release is that Chicago was already a well-established group that didn't need to do any experimentation with their music.  This is less rock n roll than any of their previous releases and carries very progressive musical ideas.  Three singles are included, which today still sound fresh and vibrant: \\"Wishing You Were Here,\\" \\"Call On Me,\\" and \\"I've Been Searchin' So Long.\\"  Pop, funk, Latin, and jazz are all represented on the disc and they're all done well.  How many groups can do that today?  How many would even ATTEMPT to diversify their sound?  What a creative project!  Give it a listen.  You won't be sorry.
B00005JMEW|5.0|it amazes me how many people nag at tarantino for \\"stealing\\" from other films, and yet each person who does this still seems to think they are the only person who seems to notice.  this film is founded on satire--tarantino is often criticized by many for being far too over-the-top as a director, yet in spite of this over-the-top-ness it seems that most viewers still miss the point entirely.  if this film were meant to be taken seriously i would agree, but instead it's almost as if tarantino is giving the finger to the films that he is \\"stealing\\" from.  he \\"steals\\" only to prove that he can do it better--and anyone with less talent than tarantino probably couldn't get away with it, but he does and the result is at least worth a second viewing.<BR>that said, wow.  this film is as close to cinematic perfection as i think i've ever seen.  everthing, every last second of this film is perfect in its timing, its cinematography, its acting, its story--and of course how can you review a tarantino film without putting in a plug for the music.  tarantino is known for having the best scores out there and i think he outdid himself with this one--the soundtrack is every bit as mind-blowing as the hour and fifty minute film itself.<BR>i must also add that i cannot wait for volume 2, mostly because the more times i've seen this film the more places i see that tarantino could just be teasing us for the time being before he lays the final smack-down.  volume 1 seemed to be concealing many important points to the story, only hinting at the crucial \\"blood-spattered bride\\" event that is the catalyst for everything that happens in this film.  enough is said to make the viewer think he knows what happened on that day four years earlier, but the more that i've seen the film the more i think it may not be as simple as we've been led to believe.<BR>to those who have yet to see the film, i assure you this is one that you will not want to miss.
B00005JKG7|5.0|If you were to ask me what favorite scary movie of mine is most overlooked and in dire need of more attention and recognition, I would most definitley say &quot;The Fog&quot;. The year was 1979, and director/writer/composer John Carpenter was just coming off the massive success of &quot;Halloween&quot;. What does he do as a follow up to that groundbreaking classic?. Well, he makes another one!. He and his longtime collaborator Debra Hill wrote the script for an old fashioned scary ghost tale. Mission accomplished guys. The story takes place in the idyllic seaside town of Antonio Bay, California. The town is on the verge of celebrating it's 100th anniversary, being runned by local resident Kathy Williams, played by screen great Janet Leigh. At the same time as the big festivities are getting underway, the town is beset by a strange, eerie fog that is more than meets the eye. As we find out through Father Malone(Hal Halbrook), the town of Antonio Bay is built on greed, deceit, and murder. A group of long dead mariners are exacting their revenge on the town and the descendants of the men who originally did them wrong and built what was to become the town on their horrible actions. Now, they want what's rightfully theirs back. And they come in and do it engulfed in a dense, terrifying fog. Caught up in the terror is a small group of people. Local DJ Stevie Wayne(Adrienne Barbeau, who was Carpenter's real life squeeze), her son Andy, hitchhiker Elizabeth(Jamie Lee Curtis), Nick(Tom Atkins), and a few others as well. John Houseman appears in a small cameo at the beginning of the film. There are a few gags in the film that you need to look out for. The Tom Atkins character is named Nick Castle. Nick Castle is the actor who played Michael Myers in the original &quot;Halloween&quot;. There are a few others, but I will let you find them on your own. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is horribly overlooked and underrated. It may not be &quot;Halloween&quot;, but it is a strong try that is almost as equally creepy and suspense filled as that film. It is vintage John Carpenter, down to the cool score, and this was the last film he did that I think was truly scary. He also has a cameo early on in the film at the church playing the 'Bennet' character. The movie is tightly written by Carpenter and Hill, and it moves along at a nice pace and it gets you all settled into the nice town and the residents we soon meet. As always in Carpenter films, it really sets the mood and takes you into the movie itself. Carpenter has a special knack for ringing terror and suspense by actually making it creepy and scary without having to resort to &quot;jump scares&quot; or gore. This one is a perfectly executed film with a perfect balance of scares and a strong tale to go with it. Some people might find it surprising that Jamie Lee Curtis has a smaller, co-starring role here. Barbeau is the real star and heroine. But it's kinda funny because the original poster for the film showcased Jamie Lee and no one else. Misleading, yes, but with her rising fame at the time and the success of &quot;Halloween&quot; a year before, it was a nice marketing move. &quot;The Fog&quot; did okay at the box office, but it kinda got lost afterwards and created a following over the years. Carpenter should be noted for doing this film just as much as he is for doing &quot;Halloween&quot;. It's gotten a resurgence over the years, and you can tell the influence it had on Kevin Williamson for the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; movie. All in all, &quot;The Fog&quot; is a real exercise in smart and upstanding terror. A classic thriller that is just waiting to be re-discovered again so it can scare the pants off you.

B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is extremely talanted and is no Dave Matthews wannabe.  He has his own unique sound and can play the hell out of the guitar.  He is one of the few musicians whose every song I like and can listen to at anytime.  This album as well as his two other albums (Inside Wants Out and Heavier Things) are a must have for anyone who knows and loves good music.

1563898586|5.0|In the 1960s I loved &quot;The Classics Illustrated&quot; series of comics.  The stories were based, as the title implies, on classic novels.  Perhaps my favorite was &quot;Master of the World,&quot; based on the novel of the same name by Jules Verne.  The science fiction theme and the characters created this wonderful world that appeared as though it could be real, rather than the complete fantasy of Superman or Marvel's venerable lineup of mutants and superheroes.<br />&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" is reminiscent of those great Classics Illustrated comics, but with a much more adult edge.  Early in the book we find Alan Quatermain addicted to opium and apparently well down the road to an oblivious death.  We soon find Hawley Griffin, \\"The Invisible Man,\\" creating multiple pregnancies attributed to either demons or saints.  Clearly this story is far different from the comics I read as a youth.  But what a story it is.  While told with a distinctly adult edge, the story is an epic tale of some of the best literary characters of the Victorian era fighting against a villain intent on (what else?) conquering the world.<br />In the course of the travails of the dubiously phrased good guys a number of deaths occur, and the significantly less than pure predilections of our heroes form a dark base to a story that is nominally of good versus evil, but turns out to be more of evil versus not-as-evil.<br />The real marvel of the story is the style in which it was written.  I have read many of the classics that form a basis for this graphic novel, and the style herein emulates that style in a disconcertingly exceptional way.  There were points where I wondered how Alan Moore was able to capture the style of 100 years ago in a newly created novel.  If there were gross inconsistencies with that style, I was unable to find them.  Those unfamiliar with classic literature may find the style a bit difficult to read, but once you get into it you find that it challenges your mental abilities and makes you think about events and writing in a different way.<br />There have been few graphic novels for which I would provide more than a mild recommendation to another reader.  In the case of this novel, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys graphic novels and classic literature, particularly adventure classics.  If you enjoyed \\"Classics Illustrated\\" series of books that date quite far into the past, you will find some similarities.  However, be warned that this is clearly an adult story.

0385504209|1.0|The idea wasn't bad. But the writing is horrendous. And the dialogue - dear God.<br />If you're looking for a real intellectual thriller, don't despair: Umberto Eco, Arturo Perez-Reverte and Sebastien Japrisot provide some of the very best, and they actually do research. Nikos Kazantzakis' \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" is brilliant for those interested in alternative theories of Jesus. And Strunk and White's \\"Elements of Style\\" is an old classic that Dan Brown should have glanced over once or twice.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Going into &quot;Irreversible&quot; I had read several reviews, so I was preparing myself for &quot;the scene&quot; that caused so much outrage at Cannes and just about everywhere else the film was shown.  The opening/final scene was very dizzying and distracting at first, but conveyed the chaos of the situation (which is the point, right?), and if you pay close attention, you'll come away with even more of a sinking feeling when the film is over.  The tension remains very high leading right back to the rape, which has to be the most brutal and harrowing piece of film I've ever witnessed.  How the actors involved got through it, I can't imagine.  One key point to remember, folks:  watch (if you are able) and you will see that she fights her attacker the whole way, with every ounce of strength she can muster.  The only saving grace in all this is that, after this horrifying sequence, there is still another 40-45 minutes left in the film, all preceding the incident, and it thankfully gives you time to recover (somewhat).  Still, once the movie ends, it will haunt you for days.  I thought it was very well made and hugely affecting, but I could NEVER watch it again.  Much like Lars Von Trier's &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot;, it is simply too upsetting.

Recorded at The Record Plant (NYC), Westlake Audio (Los Angeles) and Cherokee Studios (Los Angeles). Label - Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: If you have to have one Twisted Sister album... this is it. It contains the 3 necessary elements of any 80's hard rock album: 1. Numerous hard rocking tunes (\\"Stay Hungry\\", \\"Burn In Hell\\", Horror-Teria, and \\"The Beast\\"); 2. A couple of hits (\\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\"); and at least one power ballad (\\"The Price\\"). All the songs range from 3 to 5 minutes (the longest being \\"Burn In Hell\\" at 4:53). In between 1982's raw \\"You Can't Stop Rock & Roll\\" and the putridly slick and melodic 1987 release \\"Love Is For Suckers\\"; Dee Snider & Company put out a down right fun and hard rocking album. 1984's \\"Stay Hungry\\" found Twisted Sister in the middle of the glam metal scene - right up there with Quiet Riot, Ratt, Motley Crue, Poison, etc. Dee Snider was more vocal than any of the other band leaders (Kevin Dubrow, Stephen Pearcy, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, etc) and deservedly so. The man can talk. The new millenium finds him on the radio doing his \\"House Of Hair\\" natiowide broadcast... a true testiment to the 80's and 90's glam and hair bands. Dee has the gift of gab - and the radio suits him perfectly. My least favorite tune here is \\"SMF\\" (decent melody, but hate the lyrics). Snider writes all the tunes here and it's evident he's a dry-witted educated man - he writes great (and often funny) lyrics... and his music is simple. To this day, I can't help but remember the video's from \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\" featuring the 'Maestro' himself Mark Metcalf (aka: Doug Neidermeyer from \\"Animal House\\").

B0000D14JV|1.0|I liked the original much better. I never liked Jamie Lee Curtis. Lindsey whatever her name is doesn't hold a candle to Jodie Foster, and no, I am not just saying that the old one is better b/c it came out when I was a girl and I like to live in the past, I'm 18.

0613325419|4.0|This is a just a charming little book, absolutely in the marvelous JK Rowling style that we have all learned to love.  This book served the marvelous purpose of sucking my children into reading the whole series.  My older son was quite intimidated by the size of the main books, until this one came out, when he was about 10.  He loved all the trivia in here and lept on to the larger books with alacrity so he could find all of the animal characters in them.  It made Harry Potter seem like Pokemon to him.  The younger one followed his older brother's example and became an even more enthusiastic fan.<br />I just have one little gripe.  The book is out of date.  It lacks descriptions of some of the main magical creatures in the series, e.g. blast ended skrewts, thestrals, and the serpent who is Voldemort's companion.  A new edition is in order.  Now such an edition might seem a bit tricky, because the other was supposed to be the edition with Harry Potter's handwritten notations in the margin, but the necessity for the new edition could easily be attributed to a magical printer's error.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Although I havent seen the show yet the cd is so good I will get my tickets as soon as possible. I bet it will sweep the Tonys in June 2004. Anyone who loves the 1939 film and Broadway musicals will love this album.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I was excited to hear that this album was coming out, and now that I have it and listened to it a few times, I'll say the excitement was well warranted.  The recordings seem to come to life while retaining the intentional simplicity in the song writing.  I'm glad that the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; garbage has been removed as I have never been a fan of &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; because of it.  I think this makes the album match up better with the film as well with the addition of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;.  The one disappointment, however minor, was that they didn't add the &quot;All I want is...&quot; part to the beginning of &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; like in the film.  Otherwise, this CD is well worth the spend, and then some.  One can only hope a re-release of the film on DVD can't be far behind (think of the potential for bonus footage)

0792164903|5.0|The night before I watched this movie I watched the classic Disney animated feature, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and I read the original story by Washington Irving. <br />Needless to say Tim Burton's marvelous Sleepy Hollow bears almost no resemblance whatsoever to Washington Irving's original story of a nerdy pedagogue and his propensity to out-of-control superstition and fear.<br />But then who's counting. Why not take classic characters and catapult them into a story that is much, much more intriguing, compelling and, oh yes, frightening than the original? I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Burton's remastering of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) as an obsessive police inspector whose childhood was marred by some pretty spooky goings on at home. Crane is assigned to travel to Sleepy Hollow and investigate why the locals are having troubles hanging on to their heads. <br />Christina Ricci is wonderful as a retooled Katrina Van Tassel, a devoted daughter who wants nothing more than peace in Sleepy Hollow and is ready to take some enchanting steps to try to make it happen.<br />And if you thought that Cinderella's stepmother was wicked wait until you get a load of Miranda Richardson in her analogous Sleepy Hollow role. <br />The gray-toned cinematography is absolutely striking, the Elfman soundtrack brilliant and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular.<br />Forget about this one just at Halloween. This bewitching offering will have you coming back all year round.<br />Douglas McAllister
0393307050|4.0|I have recently read all 20 books of the Aubrey/Maturin series...<BR>and I think all 20 books are worth reading.  From my limited understanding, it appears that O'Brian is a historian and naturalist, in addition to being a writer.  Therefore, the action that happens in the books - especially the battles - are based on battles & events that really happened.  Additionally, O'Brian dispenses great knowledge about medicine, naturalism, culture, politics, sociology, sailor's lives, whaling, etc. without seeming to do so.  I think I learned more about the early 1800's from this book than from any other source.<br />As for the writing itself, I think O'Brian played with various styles throughout the series.  The first book, \\"Master & Commander\\" is a bit heavy on the technical, nautical detail.  His 2nd & 3rd books often reminded me of a Jane Austin novel as he swung the other way - towards romance & affairs on-shore.  However, by the 4th book, O'Brian seemed to find a readable, enjoyable balance between historical detail and character development.  But even throughout the rest of the series, he seems to play with different elements of story-telling.<br />The one trait I found almost unique to O'Brian is that he would develop is characters in the most unexpected manner.  He would pull characters out of the nameless faces on a ship & suddenly develop them for no particular reason.  On the flip side, you learn things in books 18 & 19 about characters you've been following since book 1.  And, additionally, towards the end of the series he completely abandons characters you have been following for books on end.  I don't necessarily like or dislike this trait of his, but I found it a rather unusual & amusing obstacle to deal with.<br />Overall, however, I am definitely a fan of O'Brian and of the recent movie.  If you are able to invest time in his work, I think you will be overjoyed by the returns.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|There is no disagreement with any of the reviewers here - this performance blew me away and had me completely enthralled. I bought this recording for simon keenlyside and colin davis, but all the main characters are fantastic.<br />To start with the queen of the night, diana damrau has to be heard and SEEN to be believed..she sings and acts her heart out - this is the most exciting portrayal of the queen I have ever witnessed. Will Hartmann and Dorothea Roschmann are excellent as tamino and pamina, and simon keenlyside is as brilliant and touching as his review in opera news claims.<br />The sets and costumes are marvelously tasteful, the conducting is magnificent, and the performances have you laughing one moment, excited the next, and in delicate ecstacy after that. I cannot count the number of times this DVD had me jumping off my couch and yelling bravo! bravAA! to my TV screen. How often does something this perfect come by? GET IT NOW!!!!
B0000CABBW|4.0|I am sure there are many levels &amp; cultural themes to this rich movie that I am missing.  However, what struck me powerfully was Pai's (the main character) courage &amp; fraility as she faced a life of blame for something she had no control over.  Her grandfather, leader of the Maori tribe in New Zealand, was waiting for a first-born male to lead his people out of poverty &amp; discouragement and into the glory the culture once had.  His first-born son refused this role, and so he awaited his first-born grandson.  However, this grandson died at birth, as did the mother.  Pai - the twin sister - survived.  And while she had enough spirit to win over her grandfather's affection &amp; love, she could never erase his blame &amp; disappointment that she was the one that lived.  The ultimat triumph in the movie leaves a lasting sense of hope &amp; healing.  This movie does an amazing job at showing how complex &amp; dangerous &amp; necessary love, pain, hope and expectations are.

0061015725|3.0|A scary premise and okay story telling, but some parts didn't make sense, logically. Also, some of the science was just not plausible and there was no effort by Crichton to make it so. Another thing that bugged me was that the main character was shown to be sort of an idiot at one moment, and then brilliant in the next. I felt this story could have been outstanding and 5 stars with not much more effort from the writer.
B00005JLRT|4.0|There are 36 dramatic situations in the known universe. Every plot is a variation on these 36 dramatic situations. The Greek playwrites came up with all of them and honed them to perfection. What does this have to do with Star Trek Nemesis? Well a lot, actually. It isn't a remake of Wrath of Khan. Certainly there are some basic plot similarities but these are mostly superficial. Thematically the film has less to do with Trek 2 than with Trek 8. So if there are 36 dramatic situations (and everything, remember, is a variation on these)and there are 10 Trek films, what is the likelihood that there could be some plot similarities? A whole lot actually and Trek 10 in my humble opinion does it better in some areas and, yes, a bit worse than Trek 2 in others. It's not the worst of the Trek franchise that a lot of Trekkers claim but it's not the best either. For the worst of the Trek films featuring the Next Gen, I'd recommend avoiding Generations which was like an episode of the series (not a particularly brilliant one I might add but average)inflated into an epic film for the big screen.<br /><br />What does work in Nemesis works extremely well. Picard celebrates the end of an era with his crewmates as Troi and Riker get married. As if that wasn't enough change, Riker assumes command of another ship (the Titan)with Troi at his side. Commander Data finally moves up in rank (and does so without anyone dying)to second in command of the Enterprise.<br />After celebrating their wedding on Earth, Riker and Troi embark back to Troi's home world for a ceremony there aboard the Enterprise. En route to the planet Betazoid, the crew picks up a signal that could only be from a positronic brain like Data's. Intrigued, the crew go to this planet unsure of what they will find. It's pretty darn close to the Neutral Zone so Riker, still Picard's right hand man, suggests caution. They discover another of Data's long lost relatives in the process.<br />Meanwhile, Star Fleet has received a communication from the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire. They've requested a Star Fleet representative come to Romulus immediately. Since the Enterprise is the closest ship available, Picard and crew are sent there where there are a number of surprises awaiting them.<br />Contrary to a previous review, the acting is solid throughout and hangs in there with some of the best in the Next Gen film series. I'm rather surprised that the director Stuart Baird elected not to reintegrate any of the cut sequences for the film. They would have actually strengthened the narrative and explained a lot (for example, why Worf was on the Enterprise after being appointed to a position on Klingon. Turns out the diplomatic life wasn't for him. That line of dialog was lost during the cutting phase of the film). The cut sequences consisted of interesting character moments and revealed quite a bit about Picard, his feelings about meeting Shinzon the new Praetor of Romulus.<br />My suggestion--give Nemesis a chance. It's an entertaining film that has a number of marvelous battle sequences and some nicely nuanced acting from the Trek veterans. While the pacing is a bit sluggish at times, the overall pace of the film actually helps the film achieve some of its thematic gravity and momentum. I'd also suggest lightening up a bit here--it's a film in a franchise series that attempts to entertain while examining a number of interesting themes (whether our decisions create who we are or if we are just a victim of circumstance and formed by these very circumstances).<br />The visuals are top notch. I had my reservations about the digital visuals used in the film (actually it began as far back as First Contact where the Enterprise was a virtual Enterprise and not a model) but I've been proven wrong. They look impressive and there are visuals that couldn't have been accomplished with models and animation that are accomplished here.<br />After 72 episodes of the original series, over 100 episodes ofthe Next Generation, ten feature films (not to mention the spin-off series DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all the novels spun off from the various series), sooner or later there was bound to be a dramatic situation that was repeated. It happened before (during Next Gen and the other series). I'm not quite sure what some fans were expecting but Nemesis is a fine (but far from perfect) addition to the Trek films.<br /> Remember, next time you think you've seen that plot before, you probably have so be kind in your judgment. Nobody has had any success coming up with a 37th dramatic situation yet and until they do, we're stuck with those same 36 over and over and over again. Remember, it's not the situation but the telling that really matters. With Nemesis, Baird, writer Logan and the veteran Trek cast turn an eye to the difficulty of being closer to the end than beginning. Nemesis touches on a number of emotional issues that will eventually face all of us and does so with candor, wit and grace.he Next Generation, ten feature films (not to mention the spin-off series DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all the novels spun off from the various series), sooner or later there was bound to be a dramatic situation that was repeated.

B0000CDLA7|2.0|Well, after listening to this CD more than a dozen times (yeah, I know I must be a masochist at heart), there is some sense that emerges out of the mush, believe it or not. (The first few times I listened to it, my mind just sort of went blank--or \\"uncomfortably numb\\"--and I had to look at the CD player to see which track was running.) I can now recognize the songs about three times out of four, and some of them aren't actually that bad.<br />Shame they aren't good, though.<br />I'm not going to say anything about the noise-not-music, as this has been covered many times before. Overly-long songs with about zero ideas per minute, except for some nice parts which come straight out of SFAM (\\"Dance of Eternity\\", mainly, although not only). Don't expect \\"Metropolis part 3\\", though.  This is more like 70 minutes of \\"The Glass Prison\\", which is, in my opinion, their worst song ever (or was until ToT, but maybe this dubious distinction should now go to the horrendous \\"As I Am\\" or the abysmal \\"In the Name of God\\", I haven't made up my mind, yet).<br />Take away \\"Vacant\\" (the filler that gets listed as track n°5) and all you've is a collection of 10-minute songs (more of less) played on the same rhythm and showing the same musical inventiveness (ie none). Technically, it's very good, but there's absolutely no feeling, no sense of melody, no nothing.<br />\\"In the Name of God\\" gets a special mention as the WORST DT song ever (yes, I've finally made my mind). Is that even a song? I have to wonder. I mean, 14 minutes of absolutely nothing and lyrics that make me want to puke. Even if you wanted to release a really bad CD, you could have done without this song, guys. There's more than enough material here anyway.<br />Oh, and they're trying some \\"prog rap\\" in there, too, incredible as it sounds. DT now have their own Kid Rock. Yeepee.<br />Don't get me wrong, evolving is great in a band, only there's no evolution here, just a (bad) rehash of things already done before, by them orothers. Call that \\"devolving\\", then. Or \\"regressive\\" rock. Definitely \\"Nightmare Theater\\", anyway.<br />That said, the production is superb, the cover art is okay, and the playing is top-notch (from the guys who play, at least, don't know where Jordan Rudess was at the time). Maybe they should ask someone else to write their songs, from now on. And I'm not talking about the lyrics only.<br />All in all, this sounds like below-par Evergrey with a bad singer (listen to \\"Recreation Day\\" or, better yet, \\"In Search of Truth\\", and you'll see what I mean). I'm still giving it two stars because I feel this is a giant step up after Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, which was (and still is) a disgrace. Still can't bear to listen to it after letting it \\"grow on me\\". Next-to-last, then, just after Falling into Infinity and When Dreams and Day Unite.<br />Besides, three weeks to write a whole album shows that (A) they just didn't care, or (B) they actually thought they could pull it off. The conceit of it! But anyway I look at it, this leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth...<br />And when you get right down to it, this must be the first metal CD that I own that makes me want to fall asleep. It's not the worst by a long shot, but it's just so dull and boring!<br />Two very bad CD's in a row-maybe now would be the time to split up and do something else, guys...<br />Anybody for a CD-throwing contest?
B00005JMCN|4.0|Gary Ross' film version of Lauren Hillenbrand's marvelous book performed like Seabiscuit when it was released. The film didn't open as strongly as The Hulk or many of the other new releases, but around the second stretch it took the lead and kept performing. While Ross' film relies a bit too much on a series of short documentary-like narrative links to describe the time and circumstances of Seabiscuit's rise, the film performs strongly due to its solid, well written script and a seasoned cast. The film would have been stronger if Ross had used his characters to drive home the dire situation facing the people of the United States during the great depression. At times it felt a bit like Ross was forcefeeding the facts to the audience for those without any concept of history. This approach was a bit distracting and does have the effect of pulling viewers out of the film from time to time.<br />Although I had seen Tobey Maguire in a number of films prior to Seabiscuit, nothing prepared me for the soul weary performance he gives as Red Pollard. He captures perfectly the feelings of abandonment and anger that drove him to succeed despite considerable odds. Likewise, Chris Cooper as Tom Smith manages to channel the very essence of this unique, talented horse whisperer who saw great potential in both Red and Seabiscuit. Jeff Bridges vividly inhabits the role of automobile mogul Charles Howard. In many respects, Bridges plays Howard as a variation on Tucker from the film of the same name. Both men seemed to see the future, embrace it with their boundless optimism  only to trip over a tragic obstacle on the path they chose. Howard lost his son and, in many respects, his sense of place in the world the way Bridges portrays him in the film. Seabiscuit really is a film about second chances and for all three men and the horse that brought them together, that second chance gave them life again.<br />The other performances include a stand out supporting turn by William H. Macy and Elizabeth Banks. Even the minor supporting roles are well cast and played giving a authentic feel to the film.<br />The beautiful production design and vivid photography are both well served by this immaculate DVD transfer. It's not without some minor imperfections in the transfer but, on the whole, many of the beautifully shot scenes here could be used as a comparison standard for different DVD players and televisions. THe sound is stunning. Randy Newman's rich score captures the very elements of the time and spins them into a rich, dramatic musical tapestry that perfectly compliments the film.<br />Minor narrative flaws aside, Seabiscuit delivers proving that there are third acts to American lives in the real world. All it took was faith, belief and a unique group of individuals to see the potential in Seabiscuit. Ross' film manages to unfold these lives and weave them together believably in a frequently riveting drama.d Elizabeth Banks.

0679428895|1.0|Being an Italian who loves the Roman empire, I was quite excited on Pompeii and I bought it on the very first day. Unfortunately the book is boring boring and boring. Honestly, I gave up reading after 200 pages.... Though I am not used at, why waste your time on an unlikely love affair set in a corrupted Roman town? Just read Italian newspapers to find more actual love affairs in an even more corrupted Italian economy....
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Indecent Proposal is one of those films with a stellar cast and is a film where one hopes that the cast will make the film shine. And they do just that. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson play a loved-up couple who end up taking Robert Redford's offer to sleep with Demi Moore for $1m while they are in Las Vegas, hoping that money will solve their problems. As one watches the film, one hopes that their problems will be solved and that they will live happily ever after. Wrong answer. Accepting his offer causes negative consequences for the couple and just shows that no relationship is unbreakable; cracks appear when you do not expect them to. <br />Pros: Robert Redford! This role is different from his other film roles but he plays the suave, mesmerising Svengali-type character perfectly. Everything about him from his attire and and the way he carries himself prove him to be the man who may just be able to tempt Demi Moore or...maybe not? <br />Woody Harrelson plays the poor, genuine and yet tormented male in great style here and after watching this, you will be able to forgive him for Kingpin. <br />How can anyone forget Demi Moore? Simply a top actress.<br />Cons: I think I am in the minority here but the ending - NO!<BR>The only reason I don't give this film 5 stars is because Robert Redford should have been given a larger role, while he has top billing, I expected more from his character. <br />Watch out for Billy Bob-Thornton
B00006SFBD|5.0|this cd is nothing short of perfection, also check out; my arms, your hearse, still life, and blackwater park. all amazing
B0000C1HLF|1.0|This movie was, in nicest terms, HORRIBLE.  Don't even think about seeing this movie.  The people never seem to die, and the special effects are bad.  Bosley seems to have gotten a rare disease that makes his skin change color.  If you do not like Bernie Mac's comedy you do not like Bosley.  I will not say another word about this movie, since you should not even talk about it.
B00003CX9E|5.0|After over 60 years, this is still one of the best movies out there. This movie was released in 1941 by a young (25 year old) Orson Welles. It is long, but its well worth the effort of watching it, and the actual story behind this film is fascinating. Highly recommended to those willing to invest some intellectual thought in this movie.
B000009QO6|4.0|Glenn Danzig left the best band in the world, The Misfits, in 1983 - and formed a new band, the fantastic, utterly fabulous Samhain (2nd best band in the world, heh). Then he left them and went to Danzig. Why Glenn? You should have stayed with the Fits' or atleast Samhain. Not saying that Danzig is a bad band, but Glenn was so much better with the Mifits and Samhain. They were faster, harder and catchier. Danzif is more of a blues metal, hard rock band than the punk of the Misfits and gothmetal of Samhain. But still, this is a good album. Glenn's voice is very good, nice and smooth, and the production is very good compared too his earlier records. Mother became a big hit a few years after the album came out, and his only hit too date. Some of the song shere are also real catchy. The best songs are Twist of Cain (addictive, be warned), Possession, Am I Demon and Mother. An all around good album, but with a few bummers that kind of drag along (She Rides) - Other than that, this album is great.
B000089RVX|4.0|Ok. To get started, I have only listened to the CD a few times, so I am not about to judge it and criticize it as the rest of the reviewers. But, I can honestly say right now that there are at least 2 songs that I would definatly buy this CD for. One being &quot;Bring me to life&quot;, because its just an over all awesome-kind-of song that got my attention to begin with, and then &quot;My Immortal&quot; because it's a touching song with a unique melody and it draws you in...unlike anything else. And for those other reviewers that have called it &quot;crap&quot;, they should stop and think about this. Most CD we buy anyway only have a few number of songs that we abolutely have to have, you can't expect every single song on this CD to be a top 10. Be reasonable! There must have been one song that talked you into buying the CD in the first place! So enjoy the songs that you like, thats why you bought it in the first place, and skip the songs you don't. There is no point in ruling the entire CD crap when you know there was at least one song you liked that made you buy it. And in my case, I plan to buy this CD right now, for the songs that I do like. To me, it's definatly worth it. But thats just my opinion.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This album sets the standard for 2003 carrying into 2004. She  defiantly deserves some grammies for this album. I love it from top to bottom. This album has the same amount of soul as it had on Songs in A minor. To me no other R&amp;B artist out right now can touch her.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This record is a great follow up to Mer De Noms, in which A Perfect Circle have managed to explore different dirctions in  an experimental sense. Unlike their first cut, Thirteenth Step is much more mellow, but is still very brilliant. Maynard James Keenan has always concentrated on pure energy, and even though this record has had some direct changes,(not to mention member changes)it is still an extreme emotional release. However, these songs do not showcase the band's talents as well as the music on Mer De Noms. Some of the songs are shorter, but needless to say the music speaks for itself in a way that words can't describe. A Perfect Circle also does not belive in exploiting their image as other \\"wanna-b\\" musicians tend to. I highly respect this band. They have been a great inspiration for myslef and the music I write. If your out to follow a generation of greedy endorsers, then this albumb is definantly not for you. If you want to hear great music from artists who have went through intense pain to create something beautiful, then I recomend Thirteenth Step, or any other A Perfect Circle records.
B000002H6C|5.0|What can I really say about ...And Justice for All, other then the painfully obvious?<BR>Metallica - One is considered by myself as not only the best metal song, but also one of the best overall songs of all time (I'm a sucker for ballads).  To Live Is To Die is an amazing instrumental, Blackened is one of the best lead-in songs to an album ever, with that deceptively slow start that immediately gets you in the mood for some great music, and Dyer's Eve and Eye of the Beholder sure hold their own too.<BR>Wait, did I mention Shortest Straw, Harvester of Sorrow, Frayed Ends of Sanity, and, of course, the epic metal song ...And Justice For All?  Unfourtunately, if I went through all the great things that was hidden within these songs, I'd exceed the limit of 1,000 words, so for the last five, I'll simply say...<BR>They're awesome.<BR>If you like music, you'll like this album.  If you like metal, you'll learn to love the musical talents of Metallica.<BR>In short, buy it, whoever you are.
1577311523|3.0|Mr Tolle presents his take on one of the oldest and arguably the best philosophies of this world; it is a pity he does not recommend any readings that obviously gave him so much and should be contained in the final section of any contemporary book on this subject. I've read some 20 books on living in the now starting from records of Buddha teachings and other ancient masters like Dogen, to the contemporary instructors. Of the XX century &quot;living in the now&quot; teachers I wholeheartedly recommend you Sokei-an, a Japanese who as the first taught this art in North America, in very modest circumstances, more than 50 years ago, no tv or internet shopping, and left us teachings that are most complete and inspirational.  A side note - it is a pity no western &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; presents the philosophy of living in the now, thus condemning newer and newer generations (top small fractions of these generations in fact) to &quot;discover&quot; the art of living in the now as an art unknown and alternative, as if the mind-centered western philosophy started by Plato and Aristoteles was the only way.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets was Metallica's second great album, and a musical mastery of metal.  Much like Ride the Lightning, every song on this album had a main theme that could be connected if the listener paid attention to the lyrics.  Easily the best of Master of Puppets were, of course, Master of Puppets, Sanitarium, and Battery.  Not to be outdone, though, two other great songs lie on this album - Orion and Disposable Heroes.  <BR>Although Damage, Inc., The Thing That Sould Not Be, and Leper Messiah were not as good as the other five, they were great metal songs in their own right, almost certainly a lead track on one of almost any other metal band's albums.<BR>This is the first band, and only so far, to have actually achieved what I like to call 'Genre Mastery'; that is, just about as good as it possibly could get from a certain musical genre.  Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All are simply the best metal albums of all time, and the way things are going now, it seems they'll never be outdone.<BR>Buy this.  Now.  Please.
630280082X|4.0|I really love this video and the best part of course is the end. For the record, Steve Vai played all the guitar parts in the duel at the end. Ralph Macchio did not play any guitar (for the recorded sound in the movie) although he did learn quickly and presented a great performance that fooled many a guitar player. I think that I still have the old Guitar Player magazine where Ry Cooder talked about the making of the movie and who played what parts. A great movie for any real guitar player.
B000002HRE|5.0|Yet another subpar Metallica album, but still the best among the rest.  I actually enjoyed this album more than 'LoaD', because some of the songs really displayed the musical ability of the band (And, of course, I was a sucker for The Unforgiven II, the sequel to one of my most beloved songs).  <BR>Although there are more fillers on this album then 'LoaD', there seems to be more excellent songs on this album, starting with Low Man's Lyric.  This is a great ballad with a simply amazing beat for such a soft song.  It's quiet, but comes across powerfully.  Fixxxer is certainly a song that is worthy of being placed on a 'Greatest Hits' album, if it ever does come.  The guitars acting like sirens in the background...simply awesome.  The Memory Remains is another one of those songs that I would add to the Best Of collection.  These words, when looked into, have a complex meaning equalling some of Metallica's earlier work.  As previously mentioned, I was a sucker for The Unforgiven II, but even as such, it was still an incredible song.  More meaning-ridden lyrics that just scream 'Metallica of old'.  Carpe Diem Baby is another good song, but I would consider it filler-calibur for the old Metallica CDs.<BR>Unfourtuantely, the rest of these songs I don't feel like mentioning, because it brings pain to me to see these on an album with the label being Metallica, the worst of all being Where the Wild Things Are...what a travesty of a song.<BR>Most of the CD is filler, granted, but the aforementioned five make this a worthwhile buy for any new metal / Metallica fan, as long as you don't expect it to be up to standards with the Big Three.

B000002HMH|5.0|To all you people disgraced with the selling out of Metallica, I feel your pain.  That Metallica was by far my favorite band of all time.  Not this one.  This has nothing on the old Metallica.<BR>So why give the CD 5 stars?  I'll tell you...<BR>To be perfectly blunt, nobody had anything on the old Metallica, and eventually, people change.  You just have to accept it, not sulk in the anguish.<BR>The old music still exists.  If you don't like this BECAUSE OF IT'S MUSIC, then go listen to Master of Puppets.  But if you don't like this because you expected more from Metallica, then you're wrong.  Which brings me back to my original review...<BR>If this CD was released by almost any other band, it would not only be acceptable, it would be musical artwork.  But, since it's Metallica...<BR>We expected more.<BR>If you like new metal (I refuse to use the retarded 'nu'), then you'd probably love this album, because all of that other crap pales in comparison to this or 'Re-LoaD'.  Otherwise, think of it as a debut album by a band called something other than Metallica, and you probably won't be dissapointed.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I give Howard Shore Five Hundred stars for the work he has done with this trilogy.  A very well earned Oscar indeed!  <br />However, I was a little disappointed with the soundtrack for the first film.  There were several musical cues that were altogether missing - mainly the three note cue which you hear as the Fellowship is approaching the entrance to the Mines of Moria.  Also, the opening melody from the film is not in the beginning of this disc - in fact, much of the music from the prologue is not at the beginning of this disc.  I'm not even sure where they got the music for the first track.  <br />I like to put on Albums Two and Three and hear that opening theme - the Ring theme - because it makes me feel like I am watching the movie!  I was highly disappointed that it was missing from this disc.<br />However, what IS there is still top-notch, and you can hear on every track why Shore got the Oscar.  Beautiful, haunting, suspenseful, melcholic - I don't think anyone can hear the Hobbit Pastoral Theme without getting a little teary-eyed.  The music for Rivendale and the Elves is gorgeous!  But my favorite moment on the soundtrack is probably also one of my favorite moments in the film - it occurs on Track 7 (Knife in the Dark) and corresponds to the one-minute camera move which tracks through Isengard, up the tower to Gandalf, and back down again into the pits of the orcs.  It is the industrial Uruk theme - I love it! <br />Despite my misgivings, this is still a great disc, and you must buy it!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I don't think Britney Spears has any intentions of being a popstar anymore...I think she just wants to be famous!  And honey...that's fine by me!  \\"In The Zone\\" (come on Brit...couldn't we think of a better title?) was hyped up to be Britney's new adult sound, the kind of record that would make people finally see just who Britney is.  Well...if Britney is schizophrenic it works.  Like her previous efforts the songs are all over the place, there's a definate lack of direction and thought going on here!  She seems to be happy making a record that will please everyone, as opposed to something that really means something to her.  Honey, I'm all about the artistry.  Being Britney Spears one would think she could get better songs than \\"The Hook Up\\", \\"(I Got That)Boom Boom\\", and the horid \\"Brave New Girl\\"; which makes me throw myself from my car while driving at high speeds.  So what works?  Not much really.  I consider myself a Britney fan, but if I wanna buy a CD full of half-back hip hop soul pop moaning...I'll buy a Janet Jackson record.
B00007BH5C|5.0|If you only want to buy one, this is in my opinion the best of the three.  Not only does it include all of the themes from the first album, but it also includes the theme for Rohan, which is my favorite musical cue from the entire trilogy.  Add to this the best treatment of the opening melody, and the best closing song (albeit dark and mournful, but hey, that's what made Two Towers the best film of the three as well)!<br />My favorite section is Track 16 (Forth Eorlingas) which corresponds to the moment of the film when Gandalf and the Riders of Rohan are flooding down the mountainside to confront the Uruks - the moment when the music swells as the sun crests the hilltop ALWAYS gives me goosebumps!<br />For me, the first album is too repetitive, and the third is too vacuous - The Two Towers is definitely Shore's best entry in the Trilogy!  Hope they bring him back for The Hobbit!!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney voice is not really her voice but a sound supported by eletronic sounds and help voices in the back ground. Britney you have all the opportunity to show something good and you are blowing it alway. I think you should learn to sing and grow up as an artist. I am sorry but THE ZONE must got to SPACE and disapear forever!!! The music in this CD is terrible and if guys good music you should try something like Natalie Merchant, Cyndi Lauper or Tori Amos....
B00005JLXE|5.0|You've probably seen many super-hero movies, and now you're thinking: &quot;Should I see one more?&quot; In my personly opinion: sure. Daredevil is a super-hero like Batman, Superman and so on, but just one thing separates him from them and makes him so human. And that is the fact that he's blind. The same bio-hazard which blinded him make his other sences super-human. By day he's a lawyer Matt Murdock who seeks justice in courtrooms of New York. When night falls on the city he becomes vigilante who do the same job, but this time on the streets. And for guilty people he has no mercy. Atleast until he mets Elektra, beautiful and misterious woman who shakes his world from top to bottom. <BR>I won't tell you anything else except his last words:<BR>   &quot;Hell's Kitchen is my neighbourhood. I'm proud the rooftops   and hallyways at night, watching from the darkness. Forever in darkness. Acardian devil.&quot;
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I'm thanking my lucky stars that my friend, one of a group of quickly shrinking \\"Britney-ites\\", let me listen to this disc before I bought it.  Oh My Gah!!  This is, in my opinion, the most tragic, unlistenable, inconsistent plethora of garbage I have heard in years - and I'm sugarcoating it!!  <br />Luckily for me, I only have $12.00 invested in the Britney Empire...I purchased her first CD, and that's all.  After listening to this complete trainwreck of an auditory nightmare, my investment will stay at $12.00.  <br />I normally summarize and elaborate on some of the good tracks on recordings, but I am not able to with this one because THERE ARE NONE.  All things aside, Britney should go into therapy for letting her record company even release this.  The Doomsday Clock has started ticking Britney.  You better change your ways or you'll be singing to a slot machine crowd of eight in some Vegas casino...a fitting end??  I think so.
B00008S2VG|5.0|The first time listening to the song, &quot;American Life&quot; didn't catch my interest but it wasn't long after that I became addicted to the beat of that song among others on this album.  It's an album I seem to hear a new beat/rhythm each time I listen to each song...it's great...has songs like no other - a true album of individuality.  If you're a Madonna fan, and/or if you're ready for something new, you'll love this!!
B0000DD7NL|4.0|Keys continues to shine with her sophomore effort, &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot;.  I was starting to worry since it had been quite a while since we've heard from her in solo format, but she's come through again...a bit softer and a bit more reflective.<br />The disc starts out with Harlem's Nocturne, which I swear was left off &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, it mirrors that material to a T.  Then comes (a tie) my favorite track, Karma.  Such wicked strings, vocal harmonies and underlying beat...not to mention great lyrics and performance by Keys.  The other track (favorite tie) is If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By.  You can describe this track in one word: soulful, just check out the bass line - smoothness!  Another standout was If I Ain't Got You, a nice jam.<br />I was a bit shocked/surprised after a full listen that You Don't Know My Name was selected as the debut single.  It's ok, but far from the best song or material on this disc.  One track that really got on my nerves was Heartburn, track 3.  This song was not in synch with the rest of recording, but oh well.<br />This is a solid release and should score her a few Top 10 singles.  The magic is still there...there's just not as much of it.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This movie rocked!!!!It takes place in Neo-Tokyo(Tokyo was destroyed in world war three) were two motocycle gangs fight each other wile one of the member is wouned and taken to the hospital. This movie goes every were and is really the best movie ever made. Perfect story and perfect animation this movie became real popular real soon, which is a good thing becouse the movie is so perfect. Good for anyone who likes Japanese movie and has a surprise ending!!!!!!!!
0061015725|4.0|Michael Crichton's a better author than Robin Cook, although that isn't saying much.  But he wouldn't stack up against sci-fi genius Charles Sheffield and certainly not against Ursula le Guin, and that's because he's invariably lousy at characterization, almost as if he's lived a too-sheltered or too-solitary life.  Other reviewers have complained of the lack of emotional &quot;affect&quot; in the marital relationship between Jack and Julia, so I won't, but it comes across as a really awful marriage -- which I doubt Crichton intended.<br />In many aspects, including the desert lab and the thoughtless military-oriented technology, the book seemed like an update of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN.  Because of that, there are some genuinely positive values here.  It's always good to be reminded of the essential brutality of the military-industrial complex and rampant capitalism.  And a nanotechnology plague seems scarier than anything Crichton's done to date -- more likely to happen in the near future.<br />The best part of the tale, which seemed deliberate on Crichton's part, was how the author stood ANDROMEDA STRAIN on its head!  In the older novel, written in far better times than these, the government supplied its citizens with the most up-to-date protection possible against technological terror, and the scientists (though cardboard characters) were said to be the best in their fields.<br />In PREY, private industry, serving DOD, works out of a sordid and botchy lab in a low-bid competitive race, the ultimate guarantee of trashy and dangerous results.  In case the failures of the space shuttles haven't been enough, this is a good lesson for us all.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Not as good as the fist but still a great movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good guy in this so if you are expecting him<BR>to b evil get the first movie. My favirite part in this is the cool machine battle in th inro. This movie is very popular which<BR>makes me wonder what took the third film so long. If you like action, then this is calling for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004SVID|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have never owned the original album myself, but have heard it quite a few times. I do own ECHOES and there are a number of tracks from \\"The Wall\\" on it, so I can safly say that I think this version is far superior. Pink Floyd has always been a great live band. All the songs are stronger and longer, featuring longer guitar solos from Dave Gilmour and also more keyboard and organ parts. There are two new songs. The upbeat rocker \\"What Shall we do now\\" which follows an incredibly eerie version of \\"Empty Spaces\\". The other is an instrumental song called \\"The Last few Bricks\\" which is basically an extension of \\"Another Brick in the wall pt 3\\". It sounds similar to the music in \\"The Happiest Days of our Lives\\". Gilmour plays his guitar very distinctly and different then your average guitar player. \\"Mother\\" has always been a favorite of mine. The live version is great! Roger Waters plays a good acoustic guitar and if I'm not mistaken David Gilmour sings part of it. That's another reason why I prefer this CD to the original, I believe Gilmour sings more, and he is much better singer then Waters. \\"Run Like Hell\\" is fantastic. The little speech at the beginning of the song is cool, and the slide guitar near the end is a real highlight. For those who are just casual fans, who already have the album, I can't really say whether it's worth it. But for serious fans and those who don't already have the album it is well worth it. Unless you want the original artwork. All in all, a fantastic live version of an already fabulous studio album.
1558908382|5.0|Grosse Pointe Blank is maybe John Cusack's finest film - certainly, his finest film playing a full-fledged adult.  Cusack and Evanston, IL home team D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink put together a smart screenplay that is equal parts comedy and drama.  Of course, Cusack is the engine that drives everything.  He pulls off the role of depressed hitman with aplomb.<br />Cusack's co-stars excel here as well:<br />- Brit Minnie Driver flexs her acting chops as Cusack's midwest high school girlfriend.<br />- Dan Ackroyd has an over-the-top role as head of a Hitmans' Union.  It's an absurd, demented role that fits Ackroyd like a glove.<br />- Jeremy Piven turns in his usual solid stuff as Cusack's high school buddy (okay, not much of a stretch there, but no one does these roles like Piven).<br />- And, of course, Joan Cusack is her usual hilarious self as Cusack's Admin.<br />The delight of the movie is the delicious satire of wrapping the most non-professional of all \\"professions\\" (hitman) in the trappings of the modern world.  Cusack's Martin Blank has an admin take his messages and set up 'appointments,' gets pressure from the union, takes therapy sessions (from Alan Arkin - brilliant as usual), battles competition for market share.  It's wonderful stuff.
B000127LW2|1.0|Voyager is the worst of the 5 series. Tom Paris and Tuvok are dull characters, Neelix is the most irritating character in all 5 shows, possibly the most irritating character in any show. The Doctor is never utilised to his fullest.<br />This is a show I approached with an open mind. Many had decried TNG and DS9 before they even started - as with those shows I waited until I had actually watched it. Voyager fell very quickly with some dire storytelling.<br />There is a guy I know who rubbishes TNG saying that it stole all its storylines from the original serise. First of all, only a few storylines are obvious rip-offs. Second, Voyager does its share of ripping-off. I still can't believe that it ripped-off the original series turkey \\"Spock's Brain\\" (ie \\"The Phage\\" aka \\"Neelix's Lungs\\")!<br />Even the one episode I liked first time around, \\"Eye of the Needle\\" isn't as good second time around. Voyager is the series that really eroded what Star Trek was about. Predictable story-arcs, laughable temporal-anomaly stories (Year of Hell being an utter clunker), and poor story-telling (the suicide of a Q in season 2 being a missed opportunity) make this the nadir of the Star Trek franchise. If there is an 11th film and it focuses on the Voyager crew then it will be the first ST film I don't go and see.<br />For a sense of wonder watch the original series, for good stories watch TNG, for interesting characters and story arcs watch DS9. Voyager should be banished to the Delta Quadrant!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|A wonderful recording of a show that my family and I enjoyed greatly.  It's been a long time since we were this anxious to own the CD of a Broadway musical.  The five of us saw Wicked in mid-November, after being told by various friends that we could not miss it, and we all had a ball.  The show is full of surprises, things that we talked about extensively over dinner afterwards.  As a parent, I was grateful for an experience that prompted so much conversation.  As entertaining as Wicked was, it made us think.  The CD goes from our living room to our car.  We love the songs and enjoy reliving something we shared as a family.  Thanks to all who created this terrific show.  More, please!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|this album is wonderful! the quality is so stunningly amazing its a joy to hear a lot of the older songs. i can hear parts that were covered up before due to a muddy mix.also some of the previously unreleased material is absolutely wonderful. anyone can argue tracks all day long because of personal preference. bruce is accused of being money hungry. i disagree. he more than gives you your monies worth. as for the policeman that hates the song code of silence and probably 41 shots....if the shoe fits wear it. i respect the police and they have a hard job to do. but i have some friends that are police and there is a code of silence. but my point is the reviews are supposed to be about the album and not a personal attack because he expresses views you do not like. trust me folks, the quality of sound alone on this cd is worth the price. and three cd's for less than twenty bucks?<BR>wake up america...................
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Owing, no doubt, to my woeful ignorance of popular music release, I did not know that my lovely Sarah had come out with a new album until I saw the video for Fallen on VH1.  Usually, I refuse to buy a CD until at least two good songs have come off it.  I made an exception here because I have been waiting so long for some new music from this, one of my favorite artists.  True--Fallen sold me on the album...I went out that very day and bought it.  I didn't like many of the songs immediately, but since she's one of my favorites, I thought I'd give it another listen.  If you like Sarah, most of the songs on here will eventually grow on you (particularly if you are willing to learn the lyrics so that you can sing along).  Her voice is, as always, undeniably lovely.  Most of the lyrics are poetic and compelling, as usual; though some are a bit trite and tiresome.  The orchestration is beautiful though, at times, overbearing.  Give it a chance.  It really is worth a second listen.
B00006J3WH|5.0|First off, I have to start by saying that I haven't always been a fan of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". I loved the movie when it was originally released. Then again, I was quite young. Had I known Joss Whedon's original intention, I'm not sure how I would have felt. <br />However, my love for the film played a huge role in my perception of the television series. I thought it was too dark. I didn't like how deep the storyline tried to get... until after the extremely dismal season seven aired on the FX station. It was upon viewing the final few episodes that I was hooked. <br />But I digress. Despite my foreboding for the later seasons, I have to admit that my favorite story in the entire Buffy arc would be \\"Once More, With Feeling\\". I'm not going to get into huge detail on the episode, as this is only a review for the soundtrack, however I would like to mention that this episode features some of my favorite cinematography in the series. Joss Whedon obviously dedicated a lot of time to this particular story, and for that I am quite thankful. <br />\\"Once More, With Feeling\\" has got to be my most listened to album, by far. Surprising, considering the broad range of music I enjoy. But maybe that's why I'm so drawn to it. In the span of fifty eight minutes, we get quite a variety of musical flair.  Everything from rock anthem to 1930's swing influence, I find that the composition of tracks rivals even the cinematography of the episode.<br />I will admit that there are a few sour apples in the bunch. Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon both seem to struggle, which is understandable. They aren't exactly professional singers, though Brendon does seem to loosen up over the course of the story. They aren't horrible, by any means... just not what one would expect. Brendon is magical along side Emma Caulfield, however, in \\"I'll Never Tell\\". It's easily the cutest song on the album. Funny to watch, too. <br />There are some exceptionally good voices on this album, too. Anthony Stewart Head has a breathtaking voice, and Amber Benson has a voice to fall in love with. It's too bad that she doesn't sing professionally. I would really like to hear more from her. I can't say enough good things about her performance. <br />One of my favorite songs would be \\"Rest In Peace\\", performed by the incomparable James Marsters. While he does seems to have a limited range, the song is tailor fitted to meld with his scope and character. I guess maybe I'm just too much of the brooding type for my own good, but I've always found \\"Rest In Peace\\" the easiest song to associate with. <br />All said and done, the soundtrack album for this episode is well worth the purchase. The extra tracks (all composed by Christopher Beck, I believe, though don't quote me on that) are beautiful and are quite nice if you like score music. I still have yet to see the episodes they accompany, but I can't wait. <br />Buy it. You won't regret it.
0385504209|5.0|Between Dan Brown's ultra-complex religious puzzler DA VINCI CODE and my copy of Freeman's MURDER IN KEY WEST, I feel I've gotten more than a year's worth of primo reading material in the past two months--and we're not even through Christmas yet! DA VINCI CODE is a great 'what's next' mystery, with enough twists, turns, and iconoclasm to satisfy any whodunnit reader and irritate any priest without a sense of humor. Immensely entertaining and thought-provoking.<br />Also recommended: Freeman's MURDER IN KEY WEST.<br />Alan Duffy, NYC Attorney.
6304981635|5.0|Every single martial-art movie that came after this one owes a debt to Bruce Lee.  Every.  Single.  One.  That I write it so confidently, definitively, speaks of arrogance: how could I purport to say such a thing, in light of the thousands that followed?<br />My arrogance is merely supreme confidence in my assessment.  Bruce Lee would approve.<br />From the opening fight scene (filmed last) to the final refocus on the bear claw, Bruce Lee's fully-realized vision is pure entertainment.  That it happens to be the best martial-arts movie ever filmed is almost frosting.<br />Enough of the preamble.  Let's get down to why I can call up my cousin Jason and we can watch this movie over the phone every time it's on.  How we know all the dialogue, get shivers when we see the action... because the fights are incredible.<br />Even today, these are some of the most realistic fight scenes in cinema.  Not the realism in the sense of wrestling with a drunk guy in a parking lot real, or a short road rage exemplar.  No, this is karate and kung-fu and kempo going head-on, no wires, no stunt doubles, just Bruce Lee kicking Sammo Hung's ass in the opening scene (that's right, *THAT* Sammo Hung), Bruce Lee wiping out sixty guards, Bruce Lee absolutely dismantling Bob Wall in a tournament.<br />Oh yeah, Jim Kelly was pretty good, too. &lt;laughing&gt;<br />Seriously, Jim Kelly *was* pretty good.  He moved better than John Saxon, that's for sure.  And for all the artifical devices, the silly premises (and there are many), it's a wholly enjoyable movie, and smart, if you can believe that.  Bruce Lee's acting ability will impress you, and there are hidden gems all over this flick.<br />Don't take my word for it.  Rent it.  Buy it.  Order a pizza and have your buddies over.  And just remember: boards don't hit back.
0385504209|3.0|Da Vinci Code was much like movie popcorn.  The many rave reviews tempted me, but ultimately the final product left me disappointed.  It's a quick enough read and does touch on interesting topics.  However, the `love story' is pedestrian at best.  My biggest complaint is Brown compulsion to add in random factoid asides.  Obviously Mr. Brown completed a significant amount of research, but at times it appears he just adds in non sequitur bits just to let us know he did his homework.<br />You could do worse, but I'd say wait `til paperback and a long flight to pick this up.
1586210661|2.0|I'm not without humour however, I do know humour.  This book simply leaves something to be desired.  Its not terrible but more importantly, its not that great.  It has been touted as laugh out loud funny, but it lacks the ability to, in most places, crack a smile.  Don't waste your time or prepare yourself for a dissapointment.  If you lower your expectations then you can be better prepared for &quot;laugh inside, without smiling&quot; funny.
B000006ZDQ|4.0|This is a phenomenal album. It´s a totally new sound for Black Sabbath, featuring now Ronnie Dio on vocals and the highly competent production of Martin Birch. But Dio´s lyrics.... Can someone tell me who the h..ll are the &quot;Children Of The Sea&quot; after all?! Still today I don´t figure it out!<br /> My point is: Dio´s input and vocals changed the tired Sabbath into a new powerful outfit that recorded this masterpiece. But Dio´s lyrics are a joke,much worse thatn the previous Sabbath albums, when the lyrics had meaning, not just some kind of fantasy thing without sense.
0385504209|4.0|I rarely read fiction.  But a friend of mine dropped off this book and asked me for my opinion of it. Probably because as a scientist I have a strong interest in numbers and codes as well as in religion.<br />I enjoyed the book very much.  Not for its possible relation to fact, but because I detected the hand of an author who had his finger solidly on the pulse of the not-too-critical reading public.  They just want a good read...all how-many millions of them.<br />The book kept me leaping from chapter to chapter (they are short, typically four pages long), wondering how the heros were going to escape from their latest predicament.  I thought the escapes were clever and imaginative, but then I am not a hardened detective story reader.<br />My deepest quandry was not in how seriously to take the basic theme of the story: that Jesus had recovered from the cruxification and had descendents with Mary Magdelane in France.  I would say that the probability is in the low sub-sub-digits, much less than 1%.  What Dan Brown has done is to confuse what few historical facts I have in my posession with his well-thought-out revisionist thoughts.  In a few years, maybe even tomorrow, I will have trouble separating my spare knowledge of the facts from his pregnant presentation of imaginative events.  That aspect I don't like.<br />It is for this very reason that I do not watch so-called TV and movie docum-dramas of events in recent history.  I have lived through all the wars since 1940.  I have watched controversial political figures come and go.  These &quot;facts&quot; are still in my head, although fading.  When an imaginative &quot;artist&quot;, Oliver Stone, for example, replays history but imposes his personal twist on the &quot;facts&quot;, I am at a loss whether to be entertained or ill-informed. So I have made it my deliberate policy not to watch docu-dramas.<br />The same with this book.  Read as entertainment, it moves as fast and is more exciting than a James Bond movie, because you can skip through the parts that do not interest you.  But beware of cluttering your mind with unproven, even if plausible, theories.  Before long they may sit in your mind as established facts.  For that reason, you may deliberately choose not to read it.<br />But being forewarned is thus forearmed.  If you read this book and you will be able to participate in the innumerable stimulating discussions it has engendered. I am enjoying that activity now.<br />Jesus is by far the most influential person who has trod the planet Earth, judging by the establishment that even today thrives based on his memory.  Well-intentioned men, and some not so well-intentioned, have written revisionist themes about his life since its beginning.  It is very easy to perceive what Jesus taught, but very difficult to follow his teachings.  This book does not help this aspect at all, but at least it turns a spotlight back on the absorbing and intriguing mystery that is Jesus.e, because you can skip through the parts that do not interest you.

B00005JMCN|2.0|Seabiscuit looked as though it could have been a really good movie. There haven't been a whole lot of stories about horse racing. So, it seemed to be a novel idea.<br />On the good side, The movie has marvelous production value and is obvious the makers were attempting to achieve an oscar for their studio. But, that is the only thing I can say in its favor.<br />The story has characters and themes that you SHOULD care about and root for. Red Pollard (played by TOBEY MAGUIRE), is a consiment underdog. An ill-tempered, former bare hand boxer who has been dismissed and forgotten his entire life. Yet, the movie never truly executes this feeling, or resolves it.<br />Seabiscuit wins race after race, showing signs of super intelligence when it comes to racing and competing. Knowing when it's losing and not liking it, and we're supposed to feel as if it were some kind of underdog. The horse is fast, a top notch racer and it never shows any sign of anything different.<br />What the movie needed more than anything was more moments between Pollard and Seabiscuit. Bonding. The movie needed to show them becoming one, becoming a team and more importantly, becoming inseparable friends. In this, it failed. It tried. But, it failed.<br />The biggest dramatic moment in the entire yawner of a movie is when Red Pollard is the victim of a freak accident that you see coming a mile away, (and so should have he if he'd been around horses all his life) injuring his leg and being told he'll never be able to race again.<br />All in all, the true problem with SEABISCUIT is the story itself or the script itself. And it's biggest failure is its attempt to make the viewers believe that horse racing is something OTHER than a game for the sole purpose of making the super rich, RICHER.

0156027321|5.0|In E.B. White's &quot;Elements of Style&quot;, the great American author praises those few writers who can relay great emotion through the simplest of prose.  If Mr. White had been alive to read Yann Martel's &quot;Life of Pi&quot;, this book would have warmed his heart.<br />The winner of the Booker Prize, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is a story about the innate necessity of survival, the ability to find one's inner-self, and the importance of cooperation and coexistence.<br />Incorporated in succint prose, Mr. Martel relays his story through both straight-foward dialogue as well as many cunning metaphors.  He passes his own brand of social agenda as well, and one must read this book with a careful eye in that regard.  However, I do not say that to deter any readers from picking up this book.<br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; earned its many praisings through excellent writing and an almost philosophical premise.  Of any book published in 2002, this is certainly one of the more insightful novels.
0790729369|5.0|Wow, this movie showed me the story of true love.  Francesca, even though married with kids, really didn't have a fulfilling life.  She had no excitement or love or anything.  She was just a disappointed housewife it seemed to me.  Someone lacking the love.  Well, she found it in Robert Kincaid, she found something special that made her life better and even changed the way she felt about her home.  Because, the love between her and Robert made everything special.  This story may seem a little far off to some, and it is understandable.  But, not to me, this is just one of those rare stories that can show what life can produce in the name of love.  When Francesca and Robert were on the bridge and she played that joke on him with the flowers, I could only laugh.  I mean, they had chemistry and I just knew that they were meant for eachother because Robert brought out the best in Francesca.  When two people can bring out the best in one another that shows something.  And it proved to me that Robert and Francesca were meant to be together.  look what happened to them in four days!  Can you imgaine what their life would have been like forever?!  Sure, they would have had problems, but, who doesn't?  Anyway, somebody wrote a review that this movie was glorifying an affair over marriage.  This isn't the point of the movie, If francesca was in love with her husband, she would have not had an affair with Robert, she loved Robert, not her husabnd.  That was just the way it was.  I'm not promoting affairs on spouses of course, but, this wasn't just an &quot;affair.&quot;  This was the look of love.
B00004KD1L|4.0|I'm not exactly a big fan of Groove Armada. I do enjoy their second album but in general, they are one of those artists/bands that I just can't get into despite all the accolades they receive from critics and fans alike. I thought I would put in &quot;Vertigo&quot; tonight because I haven't listened to it in many, many moons. I still don't like &quot;I See You Baby&quot; which is one of the most annoying dance songs I have ever heard (right up there with any song by Fatboy Slim). I guess if I was to sum up a description of Groove Armada's music it's that they are a hybrid of house and ambient music. The cd kicks off with the killer deep throbbing dance beats of &quot;Chicago&quot;. That song I definitely enjoyed. &quot;Whatever, Whenever&quot; crosses over into hip hop with vocals provided by M.A.D. It is the ideal track for any chill out compilation. I love the moodiness of &quot;At the River&quot; which can be found on a lot of chill out compilations nowadays. I loved the horn section used on &quot;Dusk You &amp; Me&quot;. The song definitely has a jazz influence to it and just like &quot;At the River&quot;, a perfect song to chill out to. I definitely prefer the more mellow songs on the cd although I do think &quot;Chicago&quot; is a killer song. I can live without hearing &quot;I See You Baby&quot; ever again. &quot;Vertigo&quot; is by no means a terrible album. A lot of the songs are excellent however I am more inclined to side with the reviewers who thinks that Groove Armada (and/or this album in particular) is overrated.
0375410341|4.0|I was a little confused by the sequence of events as I started this novel, but that was quickly over and I grew to really love the book.  The characters are well developed and the story is fascinating.  Danielewski did delve a little too much into details about the technicality of some aspects involved in the plot of the novel, though, but I'd have to agree that even these elongated and boring bits added positively to the novel.  I was even a little spooked by this novel and, at times, saddened by its content.  Not to mention this book as obscured text on the page which definitely draws attention to it in a line-up.  The ending was a bit abrupt and I felt Danielewski was just trying to end everything without having a reason to.  Great book, though.
B0000399WI|5.0|this is by far my favorite movie of all time (yes, i said of all time). never have i seen a movie that developed characters so well and MADE you care about them. this is also probably the only movie i can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. if you have never seen it, you're missing cinematic genius.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Train of Thought takes Dream Theater back to their roots of progressive metal at it's finest, while going forward into new territory Dream Theater has only hinted at their past. <br />Dream Theater takes it's love of Metallica, Pantera, Ozzy and other heavy bands, churning out heavy riffs, and mixes them with the intricate keyboard work found on their epic \\"Scenes from A Memory\\" and \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\" <br />James Labrie's voice as never sounded better. The lyrics have gotten away from the 3rd person stories and become the most personal and honest album to date. The songs \\"In the Name of God\\" and \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" are worth the price of the CD alone. <br />People who are only familiar with the past two Dream Theater albums may think this album is a bit \\"off\\" from what they expected, but long time fans know that Dream Theater has always been a heavy band, and here they return to their heavy roots with full force on this amazing album. <br />This is the BEST Dream Theater album since Images &amp; Words, and Awake
B00005ASHM|1.0|Maybe the problem is me.  This album has legendary status and is highly praised by people who show signs of knowing good music.  Heck, just take a look at the list of other albums that people who bought Pet Sounds bought, and you will see taste aplenty.  But I don't get it.<BR>  I have tried and tried to appreciate this album, but it just bores me.  It seems shallow, artificial/insincere, cutesy and repetitive.  The boys sure can harmonize and I appreciate that they were doing things that were groundbreaking in their day, but it all comes across (to me and many others) as lacking in feeling and energy - the songs remind me of commercial jingles.  I suspect that the album is just massively dated.  America produced a lot of incredible albums in the 1960s, but I cannot hear why this is one of them.<BR>  Get yourself some Beatles, some Bob Dylan, some Janis Joplin, some Hendrix, some Velvet Underground, some Joe Cocker...and *borrow* a copy of Pet Sounds.  Spin Pet Sounds a few times and see if you think it deserves its reputation.  If you like it, buy your own copy and adopt it.  If you don't, smack it with a rolled up newspaper and shoo it away.
B000065BPB|4.0|- Will NOT pull your hair.  Even if you pull them off carelessly (I have long hair).  That's VERY nice.  I had a lot of experience with the popular (overrated) Sonys found in radio stations and recording studios (forget the model, but it's a direct competitor to this model) and with those Sonys had hairs being constantly pulled out from the root, even when careful.  I've had almost 100% bad experience with Sony, and I never thought the sound was so great.     I bought these to monitor audio recordings I was making of my own music and ambient (i.e. nature, foley) sounds, when my other open-air phones were creating feedback into my mics (ouch).  I needed \\"isolating\\" or \\"isolation\\" headphones, and I can't stand earbuds/plugs.  So the choice for over-the-ear was these or I believe Studio Kans (which are basically hearing protection mufflers modified to include audio drivers -- I didn't need that much isolation for the expected tradeoffs, such as comfort and price).  I preferred the Sennheiser name, but they have also shifted their strategy to a degree in recent years to cheaper, lower-fi stuff, watering down their name.  I didn't have a way to audition either of them.  But I did know the Sennheisers have low bass response before buying, and I wasn't purchasing it for listening to industrial music ;) .    - Low bass response.  Not ridiculously low, but if you are purchasing these for listening (enjoyment, not technical/analysis) and enjoy deep bass, this is not for you.  What is there is tight.  If you like classical, you'll probably enjoy them, especially if you listen while traveling.  I'll have to try that 'burn-in' thing some have suggested.    - Good for listening for details.  Isolation helps, as do the otherwise quality drivers.  Cheap headphones will create or exaggerate hiss or noise, making your recording and gear seem noisier than it is.  The HD 280 Pro lets you know what's really going on, but do audition the final mix in some regular speakers for a bass reality check so you don't overwhelm your listeners.      - Blatently false advertising of \\"up to\\" 30-some dB of noise reduction (as others have mentioned).  No way.  That would make them more effective than most dedicated hearing protection, and that certainly isn't the case.  I lost a lot of respect for Sennheiser when I realized that the company did not stop the person in the company misguided enough to claim this.  Even if they technically made it happen in one register in the lab from a certain angle, in reality it's false.  Now, Studio Kans' rating of 29 dB, I believe, making it double as hearing protection.  But the Senn's DO provide decent isolation, but not as hearing protection, but for preventing feedback while recording, and muffling ambient noise enough that you're actually monitoring your recording, not hearing bleed-in sound.    - Almost everything attached to these phones is replaceable, including a straight vs. stock coiled wire (wish it came w/straight).    - In my experience, the Senn's are more comfortable than the Sony competitors, but the Sonys may stay on better if you're running, dancing, or prone (lying down).  Senn's have a big, soft leatherette pad and rotate easily (and 'collapse', too).    - Comes with 1/4\\" screw-on adapter (gold-plated connectors, O2 free copper wire).    - Phones seem to be impedance-sensitive.  Most quality gear will make these phones seem very efficient.  More poorly-designed gear may get the opposite result.    - Other phones I own: Koss Sportapros (descendant of the venerable PortaPros) and the venerable Koss/ Realistic/ Radio  Shack Pro-60's.      Pro 60's gave almost instant and strong fatigue (from the drivers, not the headset).  Despite their size, they were very much open air and didn't isolate at all, so they were surprisingly bad for DJ, recording, and travel purposes!      Koss Sportapros are an incredible value for a person who loves bass and wants to be entertained and enjoy modern music, not hear every detail in a technical manner.  (Small, thin, light) Sportapros give wonderfully unnatural very-low-end and low-end bass (amazing, actually, and tight too), are cheap and great for just general purpose listening -- a great complement to the HD 280's (about the opposite of them in every respect).  Sportapro headband is ugly as sin; I popped off the drivers & stuck them on a thin headband of throwaway Koss's (look at radio shack).  I don't mean to review other phones, but it seems on-topic to me and may help someone.    I also had some Sennheiser Active Noise Reduction (ANR) (the small/typical size-ones which sit on your ear).  I took them back, was utterly disappointed.  The ANR actually somehow ended up drastically reducing bass and just deterioating sound in general -- bass response & general sound was better with ANR off, plus sound wasn't so impressive even then.  Plus ANR led to huge fatigue & didn't work so well for anything above low registers (but did cancel out bass well enough to cancel out its own bass playback).  Passive noise reduction (muffling sound) is much more effective.  Combo passive & active noise cancelling is probably a great idea but is expensive & I've not tried it.      Best 'enjoyment' phones I've ever used (don't own) by far were some high-end circum-aural open-air Sennheisers (fabric pads, forget the model).  However, those wouldn't be suitable for my purposes as they let in/out too much sound.    Bottom line: recommended for people who need isolation or noise reduction, such as foleys, DIY solo artists who need to prevent feedback & monitor their track from the recording and block out the ambient room sound, studios who don't want backing music to bleed onto vocal tracks, DJs who need to cue up music while other tracks are playing loudly, but also need to get them on & off quick (Studio Kans look tougher to don), and frequent travelers, all of whom don't like in-the-ear isolation designs (which could isolate better) and need accurate sound.  Not recommended for the casual listener who enjoys bass.  For musicians/technicians, the lack of bass response can help pick out other details, but if I had my choice, increased bass response would be the only thing I'd change about these 'phones, in addition to a straight stock cable and even more isolation.    UPDATE: A year after this review, I am updating to say that I think there are better options on the market, especially now. I am disappointed in the lack of bass and listenability. I don't quickly reach for these headphones because of the sound. I don't think the sound matches the price they charge for these 'phones. I wish I could lower this review from 4 to 3 stars. The one thing that is still great about them is they don't pull my hair. I wanted some 'phones which would do multiple duty for home recording, ambient recording, and home listening, but they are best only for ambient recording. For home recording, you need accurate sound, and these don't provide them due to the lack of bass. For home listening, you'd just expect tons more accuracy in the bass for the huge size of those diaphragms.
0671027344|5.0|I like the sappy books that make every movement of the characters really mean something.  Although the end was a bit shocking, this work brings me back to when I was younger and more vulnerable to such sad writing.  It is a strong work, though, and will leave you thinking really hard about who you are.
B000002B1M|4.0|A recreation of the classic &quot;Illmatic&quot; was nearly immpossible so Nas took a different path for &quot;It Was Written&quot;, he made an album more main stream and with better production. On Illmatic he kept is simple as producers go, using a very small amount of different producers, but for It Was Written, he busted out some big names including gangsta rap pioneer, Dr. Dre, and Havoc from Mobb Deep, both resulting in good tracks. The album kicks off with one of it's best tracks &quot;The Message&quot;, a laid back track with Nas introducing the set up for It Was Written, the chorus features clips from Illmatic. Not many of the tracks follow the same criteria as &quot;The Message&quot; but there are still others gems on the album. The first pop crossover Nas makes is &quot;Street Dreams&quot; which features a sample from Annie Lennox's &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. Nas manages not to have the pop beat interfere with his intelligent lyrical power, as he displays on every track. A few more guest appearences are notciable on this album including an excellent one from the firm and cormega on &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;. AZ makes his 2nd excellent cameo on Nas albums where he is able to lyrically stay with Nas, Cormega and even Foxy Brown are very impressive on the track allowing it to be one of the best on the album. A song which may be viewed as soft, or simply not good is &quot;Black Girl Lost&quot; which I actually find to be pretty good, besides Nas singing in the chorus. The message is clear through the title of the track and the lyrics are thought provoking. Another semi-pop crossover is the very popular &quot;If I Ruled The World&quot; featuring Lauren Hill. An excellent fantasy track which is very popular for good reasons. &quot;It Was Written&quot; is a very good sophmore release, but compared to Illmatic, it does not quite repeat its magic. It is a sucessful cut into the main stream that is not quite as good as let's say a &quot;In My Lifetime Volume 1&quot; by Jay-Z. Still overlooked, but not Nas' best.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|If you are over 40, you will laugh, cry and sit in utter disbelief when you watch this concert.  If you are under 40 (and you appreciate the music of the 70s and 80s) you will simply sit in utter disbelief. It does not get any better than this.  I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is a concert of epic proportions. Virtually every song is stunningly performed by brilliant musicians who clearly loved George Harrison. Toward the end of the concert, you will witness a 3-song series that has to be one of the best live performances ever recorded - All Things Must Pass (sung by Sir Paul), While My Guitar Gently Weeps (sung by Mr. Clapton of course) and My Sweet Lord (sung by the ever-soulful Billy Preston).  Among the many &quot;legends&quot; on stage are Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Billy Preston, Jim Capaldi and George's son, Dhani.  George was almost right, all things must pass EXCEPT music that makes us feel this good for this long.
B00008PW2D|5.0|(...) Not every movie or television show maintains its great writing through the entire series or movie.  Sex in the City is about the big picture--Seasons 1 - 6.  In case you all forgot, this show had a major ratings slump after the first couple episodes until things were changed in the writing.  Take a look at Season 1 and the rest of the seasons and there are big changes.  It picked up after Season 1 and has NEVER stopped gaining momentum.  So there was a little slump in Season 5, (...) I for one am interested in the chemistry that these characters have, the situations they get themselves into, and New York City.  Thats what it comes down too.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Every one that reads this review needs to read this because this is the best album of 2003. The White Stripes are one of the greatest rock band of all time except for AC/DC and don't get me started on AC/DC. In conclusion, buy this album.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The worst part of this animation is the length and even that is hardly noticeable.  The story and characters are unique and riveting.  From the very first minute, I was hooked and watched it many, many times thereafter.
0393317552|5.0|Subtitled &quot;the fates of human societies,&quot; this book attempts to answer the question:  why are some societies more &quot;advanced&quot; than others.  Diamond looks beyond immediate and proximate causes to ultimate causes, i.e.. different areas on the globe had different &quot;starting materials&quot; in the way of domesticable plants and animals as well as a geography which aided or impeded the spread of ideas, crops, and animals.  In great detail, with strong logic, he traces the beginnings of civilization on all continents and supports it with ample evidence.  Great book.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Extended version of The Two Towers fills in all the holes and adds some more laughter that the Theatrical release did not have. With 14 more new scenes and 19 extended scenes with a compleatly hilarious talk between Legolas and Gimli after the battle of Helm's Deep. A need see Movie for Lord of the Rings Freaks and those who have not read the books, this fills in a lot of gaps.
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is probably one of the best albums around. Its original and the lyrics will relate to many people. <br />A stupid reviewer (probably the reviewer below me) said it was total crap but i think she/he is completely wrong! <br />The lyrics are different in every song and if you give it a GOOD listen to, the lyrics are unique and original. That reviewer was too harsh and they need to buy more CDs before they diss Evanescence.<br />To fellow buyers on Amazon and everywhere else give it a try and see for your self cos you will be addicted after one listen (if you like it of course!)
0140277447|1.0|A reader from Woodside, NY USA wrote:<BR>> Notice, most of the reviews that gave one star were Japanese.<BR>All the reviewers who gave one star to Robert Stinnett's \\"Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor\\" were American. What is the reason? Probably it is no related to whether \\"Day of Deceit\\" is a great book or not.<BR>It looks like most of the reviewers who have rated \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" at 4 or 5 stars have accepted the articles in this book just as Chang has described with no doubt. It would have been emotional and moving for them to read such a tragic story, then they can not be receptive to the idea that the sources which the author quoted might be incorrect, biased or distorted. The freedom of journalism is a double-sided sword. We must be a critical reader always for the journalism.
0156027321|5.0|This Nobel Prize winner was a slow start, but once we got to part II and then the end, it blew me away. I want to read it several times, slowly. An Indian boy is emigrating from India to Canada with his family (zookeepers) and animals from the zoo when the ship sinks, stranding him in a lifeboat for 200+ days with a Bengal Tiger. Religion, animal training, faith, reality, being at sea. Brilliant!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|It is the best soundtrack ever! I love it! I'm like a total lord of the rings freak and I thought the other two sound tracks were wonderful but this one IS THE BEST! You just want to listen to it over and over again. And adding to the greatness of this sundtrack are the wonderful voices of Billy Boyd (Pippin), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) and Annie Lennox.
B00009TB5G|5.0|LOTR- The two towers, we all know it, we all know how good it is. The continuing saga of Frodo, sam, Aragon, and Gandolf, and their adventures. We learn from the second installation that the ring is growing deeper in Frodo, and that global war is imminent. This DVD gives you much more insight into the lives of the characters, and background information crucial to the understanding of the storyline. There is also tons of behind the scenes footage that is fascinating to watch. This is a great DVD, and I recommend this to all Lord of the Rings fans.
B0000CEB4V|2.0|A truly great  album (DVD) and worthwhile tribute to George
1573229725|5.0|The flyleaf accolades were right - Sarah Waters is an awesome writer!  Encompassing two first-person narratives, this is the story of Sue Trinder, raised a Fagin's Gang kind of theif, who sets out to swindle Maud Lilly out of her fortune.  Multiple double-crosses and revelations ensue before the story finishes, 500 pages later.  Waters takes us through the worlds of London theives, dreary Victorian recluses, the erotica book trade, and madhouses before we're done, each terrifying and alluring in its own way.  Like Dickens at his best, she manages to give each charater complexity and avoid explicit judgement - even the villian Richard Rives is enticing at times.  She evokes, rather than discusses, the various ways women can be controlled and imprisoned, and lets us feel it through her two strong-willed heroines.  The language and texture of the book are at once rich and seemingly historically accurate and also accessible to a modern audience.  So much could be said about this book - brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I m getting more and more intrigued with christina - she is ballsy - I admit i cringe with some of the things she wears and says  - she is a beautiful young woman abd very talented - no need to hide under that unflattering makeup and clothes - although once in a while she looks superb.  This album makes me anxious for the next one - I definitely feel she is feeling her artistry and will keep producing amazing records - great job - I expect her next record to be even better!
B0000683DH|5.0|Being a huge Trekker, I'm an enourmous fan of the original series and the Next Generation.<br />When the first Trek film came out, it was a milion miles from the fast fun action of the original show. It was slow and maybe even boring, and not like the series at all.<br />The second Trek film put right where the first film went wrong and put the original series on the big screen brilliantly. Maybe it was becuase it was made by people who weren't really fans of the show, but it was much darker, faster and more like the show than any of the other films. Not only was the film very well taken by Trekkers and ordinary filmgoers, it still remains the most popular and one of the most successful of all the Trek films. It was virtually remade 20 years later as the enjoyable but nowhere near as good Nemesis.<br />The film is a sequel to an episode of the original series (Space Seed). In that episode, Khan-a brilliant leader and ruthless criminal played with campy melodrama by Ricardo Montalban (The plane!) was sent to an inhospitable planet with his followers. In the film, Khan is 15 years older an a crazed maniac, obsessed with getting revenge aginst Kirk and Spock.<br />Star Trek II has a great story, brilliant acting, is thought provoking and the ending is moving and still gives a lump in the throat. There are a couple of things that don't quite click i.e. how does Khan know Chekov, and why doesn't Chekov beam back to the Reliant from inside Khan's home. There's also no face-to-face punch up between Kirk and Khan and why isn't Space Seed in the extras? It would have been perfect if it had been.  <br />The DVD is very good. The film has about 5 minutes restored to it, and has a few brilliant docs, storyboards, trailers, interviews etc.<br />Definately my fave ST film and should be on anyone's top 100 list. It's on mine......at number 1!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this movie is officially not only the best movie I have ever seen, but on eof the most confusing movies ever to be made. If you dont want to watch a movie over and over, than ONT WATCH THIS ONE! there is no way that you could understand it in one sitting, and if you do, give Harvard a call, they'll want ya.<BR>    this movie is the touching, sometimes comical story of Donnie Darko, a troubled teen with obvious mental issues growing up in the 1980's. He soon starts having visions of a rabbit, who tells him that world will ned 28 days later, on Halloween. Whyll he is being told this, an airplane engine crashes into his room. it surely would have killed him, had it not been for this mysterious rabbit. is it all in his head, or is the world really ending? You decide.
0312263120|3.0|A better than average plot, well paced and plotted, but let down by many niggling details.  The author likes to include technical and engineering detail but lacks the knowledge to make them credible.  We hear about welded ceramic casings, a bus driver &quot;downshifting&quot; from 1st gear, to 2nd gear, a computer with 3 million hand soldered processor chips, designed, built and tested in half a million man hours (that is some fast soldering!)  Password protected screensavers are introduced as if they are a new invention only used in government circles.<br />Also, there are way too many plot status reminders.  Every other page you are reminded why an event is significant (as if you have the attention span of a goldfish).<br />My one plot complaint was that the Spanish goose chase for a key just seems to go an and on and on (and on and on) until I really didn't care what happened next as long as it finished soon.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I listend to this album 3 times - straight through - it doesnt stink but it doesnt grab oyu either and it gets pretty annopying pretty quickly - it sounds all &quot;synced&quot; but muted the entire time - even toxic which is prpably the best track - becomes dull and repetitive and kind of painful after a few more listens...its not worth the money - burn the cd from someone you know if there isa track you likve - but her voice is enough to keep me away and switching stations and channels -
