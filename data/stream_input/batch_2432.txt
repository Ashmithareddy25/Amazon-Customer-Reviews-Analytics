B003U4ZQRK|4.0|I missed seeing the last 2 seasons and had to catch up. I'm still hooked on the series and will watch the last season as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book pretty much sums up the whole series. The movie comes out this month, and I'm so happy. Can't wait!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters are all unique  and each one brings a whole new drama of their own to the story. It's a story of propriety and change. Always leaves you hungry for the next episode. I am anxious for Season 4 and I'm not done with 2.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|A fun and interesting movie--all I ask!  Today's crop of movie fodder can be trying but I know that if Johnny Depp is it I will be entertained at minim.  This one has lots of tongue and cheek dialog and fast banter between characters.  The camera work is cool!
B00APUQMD4|5.0|WPe this movie is great. 3d even better.wow!<br />I rate this movie with a five. I hope the next one, drop from this sequel.
B004SIP7QC|5.0|Fun and exciting movie with grand camera work and interesting characters.  Al ages will love this one.  Smooth directing makes this a joy!
B0070DOHQS|1.0|Trouble connecting and Tech Support is slow and, so far, useless.<br /><br />Spashtop is MUCH better.<br />Connects with no problems and lets me do whatever I need to do.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|Being able to mix and match different sounds is great however there alot of those sounds especially ocean and rain sound that are just to simular
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a good, fun mystery that takes place in the world of books and printing. Contemporary story with a mix of history, and wonderfully sentimental. Highly recommended.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It takes real courage to talk to and write about people dealing with life interrupting illness honestly; for most of us, it's easier to be politically correct and stick with insincere platitudes. Green has that courage, as well as a clarity of voice that made this book a straight read through for me. It is a compelling look at two young adults dealing with cancer who have the wisdom to deal with life rather than become statistics. I probably would not have picked up this book except for the fact that a college colleague has spoken so highly and so often of it; many thanks, Chris, for a read that is now on my lifetime favorite list.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|The game is amazing and super addictive. It's like the only thing I ever play. But there are a few glitches like that you swim on water or your motorbike won't start up. I also recommend that they add varieties of colour to the game,like a green yamakasi or a purple homm or a rich guy with a white suit and purple tie etc. I would LOVE  if this happened. But overall a good game.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|This film provides insights into the reality that physical handicaps do not preclude normal emotions, wants and desires. The insights into the determination of the protagonist to lead as normal a life as possible in spite of his physical limitations is a compelling story.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is hands down the best movie of the year. Saw it in the theaters twice, and  5 times since it showed up at my doorstep. Christoph Waltz, Jaimee fox, and Leo D do a spectacular job with Tarantino's material. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, knocks his dialogue out of the park with his portrayal of Steven. I loved every frame of this film.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. The whole book was action packed from the first chapter, I really loved reading this whole series and this ending was as epic as I could have hoped for.
B006S053K8|3.0|it kept me interested, but overall it was kind of generic and predictable. Just another boy meets girl adventure, worth a watch though.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Not challenging but I do enjoy the graphics. Sometimes I purposely miss just to watch my little hangman cause he is hilarious!!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This is like the Rolling Stones continuing to play. Mr Grisham, please stop writing books. Your older ones, great but come on, please stop.
B000002I27|5.0|This album is amazing!!!!! I dont know how i didnt start listening to The Doors sooner this album has slow rock melody's and soft vocals by Jim Morrison which makes this an instant classic, a must have
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Country Strong is one of my new favorite movies, The way the music-GOOD MUSIC-fits in with the story line is perfect. I love the movie and both soundtracks. If I could give 100 stars I would. Gwyneth can really sing very well. as well as everyone else in the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. I sit and play it majority of the time. I have it on my phone and my kindle. I have got my friends, coworkers and classmates hooked on this game. LOVE IT.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Finally an intelligent movie without high tech special effects, excessive violence, sex, and offensive language that engages the audience. Spielberg has brought a moment of history to life by showing us that the politics of that time is no different in many respects to that of today.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. However, while being a gifted teller of somone elses story, the author is insufferably arrogant.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The implications drawn out by this story are deep. Even in a so called homogenous society, humans will find a way to be prejudiced, objectifying the people they don't know and don't understand. It takes just a few brave souls to help turn the course of a culture. An entertaining read. The writing style was good enough to tell the story. I imagine the author has improved over time with the support of an editor. The characters were well drawn. I look forward to reading his other work.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|The way the actors interact with each other, and the beautiful way each scene develop is amazing!, a must watch!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love all the characters, scenery, costumes. You get so drawn to the story you can't wait till the next one.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Oh, you HAVE to see this movie. It touches your heart and soul. Not only was it intriguing, but also the romance and the believe makes this movie spectacular!
B002P73UQW|5.0|This is 1 of the great comedies since sienfield. Not a lot of really smart comedies out there this is the best comedy sitcom shows on the air .
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|As a Disney collector planning to buy a 3D TV within the next year, I upgraded my Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack to the 3D combo pack before it went back to the Vault. I haven't watched the 3D version yet (no 3D TV), but I fell in love with the packaging. The front cover is 3D, the colors are rich and the deign is beautiful. I had a hard time bringing myself to open it :)<br /><br />I bought the combo pack new, and it definitely arrived new in plastic. I ordered on Tuesday, 4/30 and it arrived on Fridy 5/3, even with the free Standard 5-8 day shipping. I am very pleased and I can't wait to watch the 3D blu-ray on my new TV this fall. Thank you, Amazon!
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Twisted movie. The title takes a literal meaning when filthy rich investment banker (Van Orton) lets materialism take over his life. Receiving an obscure gift from his brother (gift certificate to CRS to examine and ameliorate his lifestyle). It is unbeknownst to him that The Game has begun once his application has been denied. While all around him collapses, he must find his way back to a humble-like lifestyle.
0062267787|5.0|loved Hana, enjoyed Annabella, am truly going to miss Raven! This book was a great short read for anyone that's looking for a little more delirium in their life.
0307476073|4.0|Based on reviews I have read, Wild is a book you love or strongly dislike.  I for one loved this book and felt as though I was witness to an extraordinary metamorphosis in Cheryl Strayed as she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) in search of healing and self.<br /><br />Strayed's life had never been easy, but the loss of her mother to cancer was the crushing blow that pushed her to the edge.  Her life spiraled down into easy sex with men other than her husband, dangerous drug use, and an inability to rise above these issues and stay above them.<br /><br />In the first 100 pages, Strayed explains her last name.  In my opinion, she sums up who she is when she makes the decision to hike the PCT.  Strayed and her soon-to-be ex-husband, Paul, are reviewing their divorce papers, when they come across a question asking for the last name they would each use after the divorce.  Beneath the question was a blank line on which they could write anything, become anyone they wanted to be.  Later in her apartment, Strayed ponders her last name sounding out names that go well with Cheryl.  Ironically, the word \\"strayed\\" came to mind.  The dictionary confirmed her new last name:<br /><br />\\"Its layered definitions spoke directly to my life and also struck a poetic chord: to wander from the proper path, to deviate from the direct course, to be lost, to become wild, to be without a mother or father, to be without a home, to move about aimlessly in search of something, to diverge or digress.\\"<br /><br />As she writes her story, Strayed weaves back and forth between the present and episodes from her earlier life as if she is knitting together her past and her present. The reader experiences with her the excruciating want to turn her life around, heal herself, and become the woman she knows she can and wants to become.  All this intricate storytelling makes for a riveting read.<br /><br />Strayed doesn't plan well for her hike requiring her to draw on inner strengths she had no idea she possessed, and often leaving herself in predicaments that reduce her to tears alone on the trail.  Yet, in the next few pages, Strayed's circumstances have the reader laughing, along with her, at her quirky mistakes and slip ups.  What stands out for me in this memoir is Strayed's ability to connect with people along the way but also understanding her crying need to be alone to give life to the woman she becomes.<br /><br />Strayed's eloquent writing of the history of the PCT, including the people who helped it come into being, enlightened me to facts I was not aware of even though I live in its shadow. She reflects on proponents like Catherine Montgomery in 1926, Clinton Clark, who took up the cause in 1938, and then Warren Rogers who saw the trail dedicated in 1968. In the following passage, she speaks to the understanding these people had about what nature means to the human soul:<br /><br />\\"It didn't matter that everything from my cheap knock-off sandals to my high-tech-by-1995-standard boots and backpack would have been foreign to them (the trail's founders), because what mattered was utterly timeless. It was the thing that compelled them to fight for the trail against all odds, and it was the thing that drove me and every other long distance hiker onward on the most miserable days. It had nothing to do with gear or footwear or backpacking fads or philosophies of any particular era or even getting from point A to point B.<br /><br />\\"It had only to do with how it felt to be in the wild. With what it was like to walk for miles for no reason other than to witness the accumulation of trees and meadows, mountains and deserts, streams and rocks, rivers and grasses, sunrises and sunsets. The experience was powerful and fundamental. It seemed to me that it had always felt like this to be a human in the wild, and as long as the wild existed it would always feel that way. That's what Montgomery knew, I supposed. And what Clarke knew and Rogers and what thousands of people who preceded and followed them knew. It was what I knew before I even really did, before I could have known how truly hard and glorious the PCT would be, how profoundly the trail would both shatter and shelter me.\\"<br /><br />In this passage, Strayed speaks to the universal nature of humanity.  In the darkest of times, often we must reach the absolute depths of despair to find our way through the darkness to the sheltering and healing qualities of the light.  Alone, afraid at times, and shattered by her circumstances, Strayed found in nature the woman she was born to be despite the crises of her early life.<br /><br />Written with a fluid style and a combination of truth and authenticity, grief and sorrow, and yes, humor, Wild is not a guidebook for planning a hike along the PCT, but one woman's story of renewal and hope. I highly recommend it.ple who preceded and followed them knew.

078322947X|4.0|This film is remarkable. There are certain scenes (quite a few) that have breadth, extending beyond the screen. How the dimension is captured by the director and conveyed by the actors is amazing. It is as if you are there. Other times you are away overseeing the scene displayed and it seems that masterful direction is at work. They don't make films like this anymore.
B0093COK4S|4.0|Well done Mrs. Lauer. Not sure what she was thinking with Back to Life (2009) but this album was a big jump back to the Sandra we all loved in the 80's. The trance production duo of Blank and Jones did a fine job here, although I suspect Michael Cretu is blushing somewhere listening to this. Some of the production tries a little too hard to replicate the Cretu formula/sound. I guess working together after their divorce was just not possible, shame they were such a great team. Anyways euro-disco fans will be pleased with this album.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Everything you'd need in a calc while on a tablet. not rocket science, but it'll do just fine. lost one star for not being able rotate to landscape mode. its a keeper!!!
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Carl Sagan, an incredibly gifted Astronomer who this movie is dedicated tells the story of the eternal struggle of Science vs Faith. What this story tells us is that the beauty of Science is that it can be proven. The beauty of Faith is that it cannot. The beauty of both is that you can be a scientist and still retain the sense of awe, and wonder of things unproven and unseen. No matter where you stand on the issues, this story touches you. Jodie is magnificent as Ellie the Scientist who does not believe in God, but in the end wants all of us to have some amount of faith. We must make a choice as we watch, did Ellie have an alien contact or did she have a spiritual one? This movie is a must see film. If you are a Prime member, watch it. If not, watch anyway, because it is entertaining, funny and profound.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This girl is amazing. She is incredibly talented, the music is unique and beautiful, and it is simply a feel-good CD. This is a must have for any fan of violin music, and she gives it a raw twist that will make anyone fall in love with instrumental music.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is one of the better Witch books I have read.  I enjoyed the history aspect of it, and really enjoyed the length of it.  This was a fantastic cross of vampires, witches and daemons, with out all the hyped up sex scenes.  Highly recommend this series and can hardly wait for the last of the trilogy to come out.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|This is the super hero movie to live up to, maybe even surpass. Fine casting, masterful direction with a supreme dialogue throughout. Even today many of the special effects still stand up. My most favorite special effect scene can be found in this gem: the helicopter rescue scene. I am sure this is named one of the &#34;Top 100 movies to see before you die.&#34;<br />See it! Then live on...You will believe a man can fly...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an awesome game but its way to much like temple run. But its very fun and keeps me entertained for a long time
B0064MGU98|5.0|THE BEST SHOW ON T.V.  serious and funny combine as an entertaining show.  I can't wait for the next season to begin.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Shakespearean-angst in a gritty MC with all the pathos to boot. All characters are so multi-dimensional...you love and hate them in the same breath. This show is a must-see!
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Loved this book, and the previous one- Fall of Giants, and can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|To begin, I must say that setup took mere seconds to complete, as promised. The problem is that the app is not optimized for 7 inch tablets. The picture is drastically askewed, also making the mouse unsinked. Will change review if fixed.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show blows my mind. It's amazing and different and keeps me wanting more! Great acting and great storytelling. Loving it so far!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|one of the best,lots of action and lots of humor,and i really liked the new cast. the love scenes where fantastic
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is AWESOME and great for kids! My little brother loves this game and so do I! Leps world and Leps world 2 are really cool. Personally I like Leps world 2 better; it has great graphics, and addicting levels you want to do over and over. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B005IQZB14|5.0|These was recommended by two different ladies when I was in the book store.  My daughter bought it and then I also bought it for my Kindle since my daughter loved it so much.<br /><br />We were hikers and campers in our younger days spending time in the Pacific Northwest. thoroughly enjoyed the descriptions of the trail and also enjoyed reading about  the personal journey of the author.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Very good backpack and laptop part is hard material which provides excellent protection.<br />One of the best , to me it is the best and the biggest you can find for a backpack
B007GE2H3G|4.0|One of the the best animations to come out in the past few years. My kids love watching it and we watched it again just the other day. Can't wait for the sequel.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Can't put this down...love it more than the Hunger Games.  It also gives a deeper perspective on the HBO series as well.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|i love love love the speed and ease of playing this game.<br />everytime its a challenge.. very kool you'll love it too.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked the style of the author, and it wasn't predictable.  The characters seemed real, and I felt I understood the decisions made by the father.
B0095P33IW|1.0|We suffered through half of the movie, then we just turned it off.<br />Maybe 12 year old boy would enjoy it, but not an adult.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I love this movie, which I saw in a theater.  I purchased it for my daughter because I wanted to share my enjoyment with her.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Well of course the Artist is handsome! (that doesn't hurt any)  &#34;Smells like Teen Spirit&#34;, &#34;November Rain&#34; are 2 of my favorites, but love the whole CD

B004XWMXW4|5.0|Very Cool!!!  &#34;Smooth Criminal&#34;, &#34;Use Somebody&#34;, and even &#34;Welcome to the Jungle&#34;.  Love this whole CD.  love it love it
B009I6QEQQ|5.0|I always wanted to read this since becoming a huge fan of the movie, \\"The Ninth Gate\\" I knew that Polanski took liberties with the story, narrowing down the plot, and morphing the characters but after reading the book I actually love the movie more and thoroughly enjoyed the richness of the original story. It is very well written and the author obviously did his research and was able to pass his discoveries onto the reader. It has been a long time since a piece of fiction has kept my interest until the end.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a good app I enjoy playing it but it can be a little hard to control.<br /><br />Aglets from Neptune
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|well ive said it all up top all that's left to say is amazing job and worth more than you think needs a bit of memory space though*/

B00004CZQS|1.0|Was extremely disappointed. Once I placed the DVD in my player, it did not play. It stated that the movie could only be played in certain regions in the U.S. Not where I live. I wish they would of stated beforehand the issue of the region for viewing this DVD. Otherwise I would of not ordered it and had gone through the hassle of returning it.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie is very entertaining....and I would definitely would recommend this movie!! This is a movie that u would watch on a borning have nothing to do day!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|The movie series computer graphics don't seem as crisp or lifelike in the later releases as the first three releases. Still enjoy watching Alice.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|it needs to be free cause lots of people can afford stuff like that.I have not played it but the reviews says its a good game and also they need to have like a demo that is a good idea.
B008SOS63S|5.0|This is my first encounter with Joe Bonamassa and I love it! I had hoped to see him live, but the tickets are outrageous, so I'll just listen to a few CD's and pretend I'm at the concert.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really use this and this is perfect for checking answers and has things that an real handheld calculater doesnt have so its perfect everybdoy should have amd that its free it is the BEST&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
B002L5GQGY|4.0|I was excited about this DVD because of it being at the Royal Albert Hall, but I was disappointed with the sound mix. The video is beautiful, but the sound seems muted, not crisp and I don't think that's an issue with the venue because I've got Adele's DVD from the same place and it has excellent sound.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Though a little blusey in spots than I would prefer. Martin's songs, and David's effortless voice are still good enough to allow me to listen to every track. This one grows on you for sure. I still feel like a kid with a new DM release, they are Still amazing!
B005USZYDU|3.0|I wasn't crazy about the ending, but enjoyed the book.<br />Light reading, and somewhat humorous. Grisham other works are more intense
B008B0QH5S|4.0|A bit of a somber album. There are some stand out tracks. I'm always happy with a PSB release. For those complaining i's not a dance album, They have always had down tempo mid tempo tracks, since day one. And I have every release.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved seeing this movie in the theater and was glad I could purchase it this spring.  Buy it now!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very good game. It's full of cool things to do like; fight different battles, build your military base and concord the world.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great device!  It protects the ear piece while charging it!  It gives the ear piece a 7 hour charge and the case can give two days wworth of charges before it needs to be charged again
B003U53GK8|5.0|This final season kept me guessing right up until the end. The writing and imagination involved in all of the seasons had me hooked. I put off watching this series for too long, but once I started I couldn't stop. I can usually take a good guess at how something is going to end, but I never saw this coming. Without getting into spoilers, the final episode had me smiling, crying and sad that this ride was over.
0385344228|5.0|This is written on a par with Jodi Picoult. The court room drama, mystery, and family dynamics are wonderfully done. I will look for all of this author's books.
0345803485|2.0|I was disappointed with the plot line and the quality of writing.  So many repetitions, that I thought I mistakenly kept reading the same page.
B006QF5CU6|5.0|love to watch a lot of movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it he is a good actor a lot of action to.
068987474X|5.0|I LOVED this book and suggested it to several girlfriends!  Finally, a man's point of view that helps women understand themselves better. My guy got upset when he saw the book on my coffee table.  He didn't stay my guy for long!<br /><br />Connie Stewart, [...]
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good graphics, great puzzles, and the hint button doesn't ruin the game. Short but sweet game that is actually challenging and fun.
B00CBBXOQ8|5.0|I like Olly's music a lot.  The album is light pop music with a dance beat - very nice.  If this is your type of music, give Olly a try.  After listening to the music all week, I decided to buy his other albums today.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Every once in a while you read a book that reminds you of who you are.  This was one of those books.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This ap accomplishes what I believed to be impossible.  To compare a snippit of a song with seemingly all the other songs in the world and - within seconds - give a surprising amount of information and options regarding it.. ..<br /><br />Magic!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I highly recomend this game to all ages who love great games and who also like iron man. It is also challenging for the the littlenones
B003CR9BYE|3.0|I did not find any passion in Sinatra's vocals.  He is the best with Count Basie.  Jobim is great with Gilberto and Getz. But sadly this one just didn't work well for either.
B00000IBVC|2.0|I got one that couldn't play in my DVD player. Error message indicates it's a &#34;Region&#34; issue. Wouldn't Seller be able to tell from Buyer's address what region-version to send?<br />Had to return it. Now I have to be careful in re-ordering.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|My favorite Clutch album?  No, at least not yet.  However, it has all the stuff I love about Clutch.  If you're a Clutch fan, buy it.  If you're not a clutch fan, listen to the samples, listen to some of their other stuff.  Can't wait to see them live in a couple of weeks!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|It is a very good set of both regular and Blu-Ray DVDs.  It was a great gift for a big Toy Story fan.
B00A04O6PQ|5.0|I read this story out loud to my family on a road trip in place of radio and fighting among the kids. We all greatly enjoyed the story. The movie was a disappointment, but please don't let that over shadow this exciting tale of adventure and mystery with a ancient greek twist.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|I enjoyed this one.  It was a tad less tense than the last one in the Sigma series which made for better evening reading.  The realities of GM seed production are brought home in this novel from start to finish without ever being overbearing.  This was a well woven, engrossing thriller.  Highly recommended!
B002SR2PKG|4.0|Truley a master or thrills and chills, Steven King really captures the imagination and reminds us that not all childhood ghosts and mosters stay in our pasts.....
B008D37J6O|2.0|Bought a movie off iTunes an transferred the file to my KF via USB cable. This fails to play the mp4 file as it promises.<br /><br />Timeline progresses but void video or sound...
0606238433|5.0|A smooth read, yet ever the page turner, with scoking events around every corner! This is a must read. Lovers, Death, Power Struggles, Spies, Heros & Cowards
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Bought a movie off iTunes an transference the file to my OF via USB cable. This fails to play the mp4 file as it promises.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The DVDs had parts that were edited out for tv making it even funnier (and made more sense of Sheldon's comments in the pilot).
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is gorgeous and easy to use. It gives me a ton more information. I really love using it especially because it's so visually appealing.
B0031RS8UI|5.0|I read this book because of a recommendation from a friend and found it to be one of the funniest books I have ever read.  I actually laughed out loud while reading it and haven't done this in a very long time.  Sophie Kinsella is a wonderful author and I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A quick read that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end! Definitely recommended for teens or adults.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Started watching this show this season live. Had to go back and watch from the beginning. I have Netflix and this show is not available. Thank Amazon!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Terrific but unsettling - certainly topical with what has been happening lately.  Loved the author's writing style.  But why was the victim a Jewish child?  Any hidden meaning there?
B005LAII44|4.0|As someone who grew up with the cartoon & comics there is plenty to say about the film versions, 2009's \\"Rise of Cobra\\" did get some things right, casting Rachel Nichols as \\"Scarlett\\" & Sienna Miller as \\"Baroness\\" was right on target, as was Ray Park as \\"Snake Eyes\\", (see review from 2009) this new film is about the same but suffers some inconsistencies as well, things they got right....\\"Duke\\"(Channing Tatum) & \\"Roadblock's\\" (The Rock) freindship is on par with the comics, & The Rock definately looks the part no doubt, as with the first film, \\"Snake Eyes\\" & \\"Storm Shadow's\\" connection is explored once more, \\"Zartan\\" impersonating the President, & yes, this time they get Cobra Commander right!... \\"Firefly\\" is portrayed accurately,.... things they got wrong....killing off Duke (was pushed back 9 months so Tatum could get more screen time, what screen time???)...never happened in the comics, \\"Cobra Commander\\" & \\"Storm Shadow\\" leaving \\"Destro\\" to die,(what??)....no explanation as to what happened to \\"Baroness, Scarlett, Breaker, Ripcord, & Hawk\\" from the first film, Paramount was too cheap to bring back Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Marlon Wayans, & Dennis Quaid, but not explaining their fates was even cheaper!!, a line of dialogue would have been nice, but noooooo!!!...we are left to wonder, Sienna Miller in 2009 said she was paid to appear in three \\"G.I.Joe\\" films as Baroness, I guess she got a free paycheck for not appearing here, this is what happens when you put idiots in charge of a franchise like this, there are however some high points to this one that I will point out, Adrianne Palecki as \\"Lady J\\", simply beautiful, so much so that I am willing to forgive Paramount for depriving me of Rachel Nichols as Scarlett, the mountain top fight sequence involving Snake Eyes & Jinx  vs  Storm Shadow's guards has to be seen to be believed, a simply breath taking action sequence, the action set pieces are more this time around, the world leader's summitt meeting is to close to a terrifying reality when the president (Zartan) launches all of the U.S. nukes, forcing the other world leaders to do the same, all in an attempt to disarm the world & take control, all orchestrated by Cobra Commander, this kind of thing was always hinted at in the comics & cartoon, Bruce Willis appearing as the original Joe from the 60's toy line was fun, talk about a guy packing heat, the hiding places in his home is a home invader's worst nightmare, & Willis hams it up no doubt, all in all this one is more of the same, like the first film it is hit & miss, as I stated in my review of that one, you shouldn't go in with high expectations, or expecting Paramount to have learned anything from the first film's mixed reaction, but if you want some cool action/fight scenes, then this is your film, & Adrianne Palecki will definately keep you watching no matter what.

B005LHOKFS|5.0|I use TA on any journey I take, be it a trip out of state or down the mountain to the big city.  Anytime I need to find something to eat and don't want to settle for box fast food, TA is there, providing great reviews and easy directions.  Big TA fan!!!
B004WSX60M|5.0|This was the perfect present for my soon to be hubby he is a huge Johnny Cash fan. He loved it everything was wonderful disks look great and it came fast in the mail!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I thought the cast did an excellent job of not over acting in this movie. I have seen many stage productions brought to the big screen and am often disappointed in the way the actors treat the camera like it is a stage audience and over play the roles. The subtlety of the performances, especially of Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were beautiful.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to install, works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Great basic solitude game. Nice layout and easy to operate.

B0027MJU00|3.0|A good read but slow in spots.  I loved Gone Girl and this one just doesn't read as well. Still, pretty good.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|A great show for network TV.  I usually watch series from HBO or Showtime but this was an intriguing series to watch.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This is a great app WHEN IT WORKS, but alas, too often it freezes (often at the last piece of the puzzle) or crashes the whole Kindle Fire.  When this crash happens, have to reboot Kindle Fire sometimes more than once to get acess to any other portion of Kindle Fire - apps, books, etc.<br />I have deleted it from my Kindle.  Too bad, it was a fun app and I had bought many additional puzzles - which turned out to be a waste of $.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|A great stage musical turned into a wonderful film.  The songs were not prerecorded.  Instead, the actors had an earpiece with piano accompaniment and they sang live on the set.  The vocal tracks later had the orchestra added.  This gives the musical numbers an immediacy older musicals lack.  The actors were able to experiment on set as they pleased rather than being confined to singing along to a playback of something they recorded months before.  And it's worth the price just to hear Hugh Jackman sing \\"Bring Him Home.\\"  Another highlight is \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.\\" Some of the original 1986 Broadway cast members were given bit parts, which I thought was very classy on the part of the producers.  Definitely a must have.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This adventure/sci-fi flick is great to escape reality. Sometimes I wish it were true that we could just escape on a ship out into the galaxy and save an alien race from their intimidators. I can watch it over and over again!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Excellent in every respect.  Daniel Day-Lewis becomes Abe Lincoln, down to the high pitched voice the history books describe.  Sally Field is a wonder as Mary Lincoln.  Other excellent performances from Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Julie White (\\"Grace Under Fire\\") and Lee Pace (\\"Pushing Daisies.\\")  A marvel of a film - and no big explosions, gun fights, Hobbits, wizards, vampires, or dragons.  Just an engrossing story with good, solid acting all the way around.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The acting and the plot is worth the gratuitous violence. I don't normally like to watch movies with excessive violence.
B00AV68GOA|4.0|The scripts are fun to read, and the explanatory notes by Julian Fellowes are very interesting.  Even includes material that was cut.  And we get all of Violet's caustic sarcasm.  It does lose something in that it is a script and is better performed than read, but any Downton Abbey freak will enjoy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have 3 words get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it is awesome no probe u should luv it.seriously its addictive if u don't have it yet y r u still reading this go get it
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Good brand of Doobies Brothers Music - saw them live in 2010 and they are still excellent particularly Tom Johnston, Pat Simmons and John McFee.  This album is their latest release and is just as good as any others with Tom Johnston doing most of the singing (with a lot of Help from Pat Simmons).  I always felt the Doobie Brothers where better without Michael McDonald.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It can be fun but I get frustrated when you collect items and it doesn't correctly update your tallies of items. If total numbers of items don't change, I close out and go back into the game. Seems to work but it's annoying to have to do.
B00005R24K|3.0|People used to tell me that this movie was very scary but after finally watching it, I disagree. It's got some good special effects for a 1980's film but I have seen scarier movies. In addition, I believe that the dead zombies are very annoying. They just can't stop talking nonsense. Bruce Campbell delivers a great performance and his fellow actors as well. The setting makes this movie scary. The forest reminds me of the Blair Witch Project. Also, the recordings are kind of creepy. Watch it at the middle of the night to fully enjoy.
B005U9QVPE|5.0|This sweet movie has it all; the battle between good and evil, love, humor, and Jim Henson at his finest. It may not be as well known as his other \\" Muppet\\" movies, but this has an enduring message that appeals to adults as well as children. It is a staple in our household and is watched regularly.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Everything Is Illuminated really is an awesome movie.  It's about a teenage Jewish boy played by Elijah Wood (who actually looks much younger than he really was when he made this movie- he looks 16 but he was probably more around 25) who visits Russia in an attempt to find the woman that freed his grandfather from the Nazi's back in World War II.  However as the story moves along (and especially near the end) what we actually see is a relationship develop between Elijah's English-speaking interpreter and his grandfather, whom Elijah Wood lives with during his visit (and eventually explores together).<br /><br />I must say, the storyline is pretty impressive and moves at exactly the appropriate pace so we don't miss any details.  You'll be reading a fair amount of subtitles on the bottom of the screen, but there's plenty of English speaking too.  It's a combination of both the entire way through.<br /><br />The hilarious moments are usually subtle and come when, to name one segment, Elijah expresses he doesn't eat meat in front of a Russian family who responds by saying \\"What kind of person doesn't eat meat?\\" and when Elijah asks for a potato instead, the cook brings in a freshly cut raw potato on a plate.  Hilarious!  Also the deranged dog with a sensitive attitude- Elijah Wood and this dog share a few funny scenes.  Actually later on when the woman Elijah is looking for is finally found, we see the dog riding on the hood of a slow-moving vehicle because the older lady refuses to get into the car believing they're too dangerous.  This is another funny moment for a couple reasons.  Basically the movie provides plenty of funny moments to take away from the tragic and serious circumstances that are revealed concerning a horrible World War II story later on.<br /><br />Basically, Elijah Wood, his English-speaking interpreter and the grandfather (of the interpreter) all head out into the middle of Russia's beautiful country outdoors (and I'm hoping this movie really wasfilmed in Russia because the scenery is absolutely beautiful- especially the river scene showing the fish swimming together in succession).  I don't want to give too much away here, though for me the movie's interesting because it provides a colorful and different aspect of the Russian/American/Jewish relationship currently and how it was back in the WWII days.<br /><br />The ending though... let's just say, we see a certain death in a bathtub and much to my surprise, the reason for this goes MUCH deeper than I ever could have guessed.  In fact, I completely overlooked the reason.  This segment was going for a much deeper meaning here than I was able to grasp.  I had to read other online reviews to find the answer to this particular scene.<br /><br />The soundtrack is beautiful.  Mandolins, violins, accordions and melodic orchestration that feels distinctly Russian.  Then again I'm not really sure if all Russian music resembles this- perhaps it's more diverse, but the soundtrack is lovely all the same.  I'm looking at the soundtrack right now but I don't see a mandolin on the credits of any of the tracks.  Hmmm...  Anyway, one orchestrated piece near the end is really sweeping and joyful- a personal favorite of mine.  This occurs during Elijah's return home after an airplane ride.  This same airport scene contains a moment that's pretty unique- you'll see what I mean when you watch it.  Let's just say, much to Elijah Woods surprise, he sees familiar faces!<br /><br />Overall, great writing and acting, exciting, adventurous, unpredictable writing (certainly unpredictable in many ways), a fresh perspective on the WWII days, unique... I highly recommend Everything Is Illuminated.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I needed to upgrade the memory in my notebook PC, so I purchased the RAM 2GB and it's been great so far...
B002EDH0FE|2.0|This story was all over the place.  It lost my interest during the second or so flashback.  I kept with it to the end but I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />I felt it tried to be something more than an action flick, it was way too long, and frankly not nearly interesting enough. I wouldn't recommend it.
B005PK56TA|4.0|The series was very good.  Please put Season 2 on Amazon Prime.  Didn't give it 5 stars because the Amazon server seems slow compared to VUDU and Netflix.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|The book was inspirational, but the experiments did not work. It left me feeling very disappointed.  If you are new law of attraction, do not read this book. It will make you have doubts and give up.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Suits my needs. Allows me to use my Nexus 4 as a portable gaming console when paired with Bluetooth game controllers and media player for streaming Hulu, Netflix and YouTube. The SlimPort allows for charging while using the device so you don't have to worry about running out of juice. Its a great buy.
B0094M2S5A|2.0|Sorry but there must be something deep that I missed.  Too many story lines left untied at the end. Some one might have another way of looking at it.
B00766CLPI|5.0|This is one of Barbra's better recordings but did not see much sound difference from the original released in 1974.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I paid for this? I fell asleep. DDL is a better actor than this. I should have known better - I was always bored in history class.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Great game, lots of fun. Maybe my most favorite ever. I couldn't stop playing. Beautiful graphics and interesting plot. If you freak out over clowns, don't play!
0743529030|5.0|I love books that motivate and inspire me. This is the most practical & interesting motivational book I've ever read/listened to on CD. I would reccomend it to anyone that wants to improve their quality of life! It has definitely made a difference in my attitude & the way I think. Great book!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|There are no words to describe this book but if you ever had doubts about what comes next in your life after death, take the journey with this Neurosurgeon!
B000SW4DV2|5.0|This was a sleeper to our family. We hadn't heard about it before. Just picked it up in scrolling through films for kids.<br />Techie-minded children should love this. And it's perfect for grownups.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Always enjoy Jack Reacher.  Very readable with Boys Own action. Plots are well constructed and Jack is a very intelligent action man.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Trying to run back and forth is quite challenging.  Had to refer to hints more frequent than I wanted to.  Loved the story line and would like to see more like this.  Great game iCOOLgeeks.  Send me more reasonably prices games that have a satisfying outcome.
0385523904|5.0|I'm sure pretty much anybody who has looked for this book has some sort of interest in understanding what is happening in North Korea.  For me it was a search about cannibalism in North Korea, mainly just because I'm curious about the lives of ordinary people in North Korea.<br /><br />Now one could use statistics and try to explain what is happening out there, and explain how difficult information is in North Korea, but Barbara Demick chose to do it through a narrative of five people and their families.  A twenty-six year old Kindergarten teacher, a 40 year old doctor, a 50 year old woman who was a model North Korean citizen for most of her life, a rebellious son of a party leader, and the intellectual son of from a Japanese Korean heritage, which provided his family with money, but not the prestige of being in the Core Class.  The hopes of family rested on him becoming a member of the party- which creates a Romeo and Juliet quality to this story.<br /><br />And that is what Barbara Demick did so well in this book.  She goes so much deeper than just the simple defection stories, and conditions, and takes the reader all the way back to a time when things didn't seem so bad in the minds of North Koreans.  We learn how family ties and cultural values keep them entrenched in a system that has done such a miserable job of serving its people.  She allows the reader to feel what they feel, and understand how the regime controls its citizens.  As the story moves towards the famine, and post- Kim Il-sung era, you understand the sheer misery that was happen, and the strength just to survive.<br /><br />And then the she tells the story of how each groups decides to defect.  I couldn't wait for her to get to that part of the story.  I knew the end of the story, and just wanted to know how they got their, but that is the genius of this book.  In Hollywood, the movie will end with each of them (I won't ruin  the ending of one) arriving at Incheon Airport and being completely mesmerized by all of the luxury-  they finally arrived.  But that isn't the way everything ends.  She allows the reader to hear the conflict with the arrivals in the new country.  What they gave up, and how hard it is for them to assimilate in a South Korea that is completely foreign to them.  There is daughter in the story who will seem like the most selfish of all, but in reality does one of the most self-less acts I have read about it.<br /><br />The best compliment I can give about this book is that I feel that I know these five people.  Their stories are obviously fascinating, but their stories are still continuing.  This goes beyond just the Happily Ever After.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I was especially impressed with the natural voice and inflections for a computer generated voice. Missing was that tinny none human feel. Although it is still far from perfect it is very close to great!<br />When I first used his software it became clear I needed to better grasp how to apply this software to my personal needs... I am trying to figure out if I can have it read me a book on my Kindle... I do not yet know.... I'll let you know as soon as I learn to read.... lol
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Provides such a compelling perspective on the Pacific war. Not written by a general or a historian with an eye on sanitizing or glorifying war. Private Sledge shows the reality of war and the too often necessity of War. It is not an attempt to glorify, but it shows the courage and even grace with which those who fought the war in the Pacific employed.
0606257616|4.0|An early Stephen King with all of the elements he conjures to make his stories whole.  If you have seen the movie , do yourself a favor and read the story. And, if you did see the movie you are able to see the people who support the tale of horror and travel with them through the ghostly Manor.  I have read several King books that I would never consider reading again. &#34;The Shining&#34; is one I would read again a few years from now. &#34;It&#34; was my favorite and &#34;The Talisman&#34; is second.  These two I will continue to re-read over the coming years. So give The Shining a shot.  Bobby Brandt

B009IF8CH6|5.0|A well-loved show for the last six years, the sixth season of &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; provides the latest installment in the lives of everyone's favorite grouping of hyper-nerds and their interaction with the larger, less-gifted world around them.<br /><br />Having the whole series on Amazon is a good thing. You can run long, nerdy marathons of it that space episodes of it so closely together that you can actually trace the personality changes of the characters as they and their larger story evolve.<br /><br />I can't get enough of it.
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I bought this book because I loved the movie. (Especially Gerard Butler)  The only thing in common between the book and the movie are the character's names and the fact that her husband leaves her notes.  Everything else is different.  I usually like the movie to follow the storyline of the book especially if I've really enjoyed reading it. However, in this case, I didn't mind because I thought they were both really good.  I liked Cecelia's style of writing.  This book made me laugh out loud, clap my hands and shed a few tears.  I plan on reading her other books and I hope they are as good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addiictive game! So many levels to advance to and some are quite challenging! It is fun too when you are bored.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|One of the greatest trilogies of all time, collected here and restored to DVD quality picture. Great collection and price.
B000ZM1FXO|3.0|Now here is a really sick King! Committed so many sicko things that are a taboo today. But this stuff is still happening<br />today all over the world. It gave me an insight as to what cruel things he did to his people and his Senators. That was unreal! If you want to know about Roman rule then this would be educational. Of course there was a lot of T&A in this movie. You would find that much in American Pie! NOT recommended for children! I can't imagine what the &#34;X&#34; rated version was like!
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Aside from two kind of meh tracks...the rest is brilliant. Simple Song, Blood From a Stone and Out of Hand are classic songs that are amongst the best the band has ever recorded.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OH MY GOD, MY HEART HURTS. 5++++++++++++ stars!<br /><br />I really don't know where to start after finishing this whirlwind... this is one of the few books I've read lately that I simply was unable to take a break from. I read it almost straight through, and it's one that I wish I could wipe from my memory and read over. and. over. and. over. again. for the very first time.<br /><br />Sky thinks she's got it all figured out. She feels comfortable with who she is and her only complaint is that she has a hard time with feelings and lust. She has no shortage of options to hook-up with, thanks to her semi-slutty (but awesome) best friend, Six, who lives next door. But, even when she can acknowledge the attractiveness of a guy she is with, SHE is not attracted. She doesn't experience the heart-racing, gotta-have-it lust. She zones out when things get too real, and she'd rather stare at her bedroom ceiling than get lost in the moment... until she meets Holder. A stranger, even though they've lived near each other for years, who seems to think he knows her... Holder brings out new parts of Sky that she never knew existed. She feels when she's around him. They are inexplicably drawn to each other.<br /><br />Sky, my god... she is such an incredible character. She has a great heart, but she's stubborn and sarcastic and hilarious. She is so strong and brave. She is the type of character that I think girls can look up to and strive to be more like. I know I wish I could have a little bit more of her strength and character. Then... there's Dean Holder. :) A little bit of a bad boy with a seemingly terrible temper... but also, lickable dimples, a crooked smile and an enormous sense of loyalty, protectiveness and heart. The two of them together was just... wow.<br /><br />HE HATES THESE CANS!<br /><br />I wish the book had more Six and Breckin in it!! It sort of made me sad that Six left the country and sort of broke off that friendship from the get-go. I loved the dynamic between Sky and Six... it made me miss my teenage/young adult best friends and those friendships. & Breckin... I loved him to death. He was hilarious right off the bat, and he was just what Sky needed in leu of Six. <3<br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't read this book... READ IT!! Many parts of the book are incredibly serious and emotionally-charged, and I definitely can admit to crying more than once, but other times, you'll break out into a smile, a full-blown unattractive laugh. I had many suspicions about what was going on, and some were right and some were wrong... but it came together BEAUTIFULLY at the end.<br /><br />I love love LOVED it, and it's definitely going down as one of my favorites. :) thank you, Colleen Hoover, for a new favorite book. I will follow miss Hoover wherever she goes from here! Her writing was fabulous, and this book is beyond amazing.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|In a time of generic love stories this movie offers up some originally to the genre that is normally plagued by cliches. This movie is a great drama with great acting, music, and cinematography ( if you care about that kind of thing) but I really enjoyed it and am now considering reading the book.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover, I will follow anything you write from here on out. FIVE STARS all around!<br />I adored Hopeless more than I can even explain... I didn't think there was any way another book could compare, but Slammed absolutely did not disappoint.<br /><br />I have to be up for work in about 3 hours, so I'll keep this short and sweet. I read this cover to cover within about 4 hours. I absolutely DEVOURED this book.<br /><br />18 year old Lake (Layken) is forced to move across the country with her quirky little brother and mother after her father unexpectedly dies... and she immediately meets her very interesting and *very* attractive neighbor, Will -- pretty straightforward so far. But then, everything goes up in flames as Lake's entire world changes in every way imaginable over the course of just a few months.<br /><br />The story, and the relationship between Will and Lake, is not only refreshing, but incredibly real. These characters are smart, brave, and compassionate. I was constantly was laughing, tearing up, or feeling butterflies freak out in my stomach. I was captivated beyond belief, and I was completely pulled into this world. Also, AVETT BROTHERS?! Colleen, you're my hero. That band is wonderful, and the inclusion of their lyrics and messages into the story line was flawless.<br /><br />\\"There are three questions every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man. If you answer no to any of the three questions, run like hell.<br />Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question.<br />The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him?<br />And finally, does he inspire to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man.\\"<br /><br />Slam poetry is something I've had very little experience with in real life, but now I'm dying to get my butt on over to a slam reading PRONTO. The writingin this story was incredibly beautiful and touching all around, but the slam poetry was especially moving. I felt like I was in the room with them, looking up at the stage. I felt it all with them.<br /><br />I am very happy that I already purchased the sequal. I know what tomorrow night looks like for me. ;)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The actors were good at their roles but the premise of children killing children so their districts could win just didn't sit well with us
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars! For Green to be writing a 16 year old girl as well as he did -- I applaud him for that. Obviously Hazel isn't a 'typical' teenager, but still.<br /><br />This book was beautifully written and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster along with the characters. I adore the main characters, Hazel and Augustus, and their back-and-forth dialogue and sincere interactions. To tackle things like cancer and loss with as much tactful humor as John Green did... I loved. It was a heartbreaking read about the devastating and terrible effects of cancer, but to 'lighten' the content a bit with incredibly likable characters who did not just BECOME their cancer... it was well done. The cancer consumed their lives in every way, but it did not DEFINE them.<br /><br />Bottom line: I laughed, I cried... I loved it. I'd highly recommend this book. Just read it.

B0038ZITIE|5.0|The costumes are 1980s silly, yet stunning in execution. Most of the women's costumes are hand-beaded, something you do not see these days. The music is all from Queen, a perfect fit to the movie. The casting was well done. I did not care if there were any bonus features. I enjoyed the movie when it first came out and still enjoy watching it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is so thrilling , romantic and shows how much family means to them .  I love this book so much <3  this series i have read for the second time  . I hope she never stops writing her ideas are amazing
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|A great movie that deserved an Oscar - we have watched it multiple times over and the casting was spot on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and I love it.I think is cuter then temple run. Temple run is fully but I like this because of the more things you can do. You can jump, dunk, and run on trains. Really addictive and fun!
B009AJD5E0|1.0|I simply cannot believe anyone who has seen science fiction movies<br />could watch this film beginning to end....<br />Beyond ridiculous. The scientists travel 2+ years to explore a<br />planet. Most are in a state of animation/sleep the entire time.<br />Upon landing on this planet, go into a \\"man made\\" cave. Begin<br />to discover past life, and two of the scientists get scared and<br />want to return to the ship hahahahahaha. Ridiculous.<br />They of course get lost trying to get back. Oh and later are killed by a snake<br />like creature, that they had been cooing to hahahahahahah....Ridiculous writing.<br />The other 4 scientists in a panic pall mall rush because a storm is coming, manage<br />to find their way out of this cave and back to the ship, no problem hahahahhaah.<br />When the 2 lost scientist got killed by the snake like creatures, I took the<br />dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the trash. No idea what the<br />2nd half or 3/4 of the rest of the film is about.... Just GARBAGE!!!<br />Don't waste your money, or go to my local dump and find the dvd for free.<br />III
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I feel that my horse is a really great game for any horseback rider to be interested in riding or just handling. one problem I had with this games is that when I press competition then it says loading competition and then never loads.. any suggestions to make this problem go away??
B005KGPC4S|3.0|I like Kevin Smith movies, but this one is trying to be a real movie.  It was brurtal and serious with very little humor.  I don't regret buying it, or watching it, but it's not what I really wanted.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|An unbelievably well told, concise, interesting, unusual in subject but full flavored story.  What a thrill to read a short that is so well crafted.  Sanderson does so well in the 'epic' genre that I was delighted, and a bit ( ok, way surprised) by his ability to write such a great short story.  He can hold his head up because he's made the climb to Heinlein status in my opinion.  Well done, sir.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Shame on the large food companies. Once again the greed of a few are hurtful for many.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Cute graphics, simple to learn, not trivial.  Yet it hasn't entirely hooked me, either. I'll keep it around, but I don't love it yet.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It made me constantly use my brain.  This is not a mindless game.  I am excited and anxious to see and play the next addition.  The graphics are phenomenal.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I like having multiple named timers.  The default settings were not what I&#34;d choose, but not hare to change. I haven't used it as extensively as I could yet.
B0094MFITS|5.0|The best modern American writer of fiction was Robert Parker his tone, dialog and detail is flawless. In Stone Cold Tom Selleck does an amazing job and the cast is first class.
B00821OX98|5.0|Such great acting,,just really enjoyed it could not stop watching til I finished all the episodes. A gripper for sure.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|The writing is pretty good, and the author raises some thought-provoking ideas.  But bottom line, I put this book down and never came back to it.  That's my hallmark of a &#34;meh&#34; book.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Good Information but slow. Uses a lot of memory<br />Not well suited for cell phones.  Very good for tablets. It needs an update
B007A4SDCG|4.0|This book is a total classic, and with good reason.  While I enjoyed a lot of what the author had to say, I also wasn't riveted and didn't finish the book.  So I can't give it 5 stars, but that's just me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|the only drawback to this excellent series that I see is that it can be too \\"soap opera\\" with the drama at times...the performances are great.  Some of the story lines are not believable at all, for example putting Thomas in charge, when he returns from the War...prior to heading off to War, he was caught stealing wine and tried to pin it on Mr. Bates.  So, it's a very long reach to believe that he would be put in charge of anything, let alone be hired again.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|This app is a total rip off. If you want the original game, get little alchemy. This app has copied everything I know and love from little alchemy, put on a new background, new graphics, slightly different combinations, and overall, THIS APP IS A TOTAL RIP OFF OF LITTLE ALCHEMY!!!!

0374275637|5.0|A Classic on Accurate Thinking and  A Must Read for anyone interested in human psychology, finance & investments, economics or even business.<br /><br />Daniel Kahneman and his colleague Amos did years of research and have articulated some of their work in this book. It is about how we think and why we think that way.<br /><br />We have 2 systems of thinking which explains the choices we make. One is System 1 which is our fast, intuitive and emotional thinking and the second is system 2 where we think slow, more deliberate and logical.<br /><br />There are several illusions and biases in our thinking which can affect us if we don't think thoroughly. Sunken cost fallacy( putting good money over bad ) for example is very common in investments. Individual Investors like to lock their gain by selling their winning stocks which have appreciated more instead of selling the losers who don't give anything for years.<br /><br />We can get overly optimistic or pessimistic on something when we are on system 1 thinking while system 2 will help regulate this and help us be more realistic.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed on the section on overconfidence where he trains us how to tame our intuitions, make them more accurate and when can we really trust our intuitions.  Kahneman also applauds the benefits to being optimistic. It is the optimists who play a major role in shaping our lives. Their decisions make a difference whether they be in business, military or even politics. They are talented, lucky and got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. With an Optimistic Attitude in life, we can be blessed if we are only mildly biased and don't lose track of reality.<br /><br />This is a transformational book and will make you Think. Go slow and you will get the best out of this book.<br /><br />I Love This Book...a Very Enjoyable Read.
B00BW6SOIQ|4.0|The acting is great, and if you have the right sense of humor, you will like the Secretary.  I was a little reluctant to watch it because of the subject matter, but I am glad I did.  Maggie Gyllythall (no idea how to spell) just became my favorite actress.  This movie is not for children.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Works just like remote desktop on the regular computer. But way cooler cause it's a from a cell anywhere.  Good job
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There was not one page of this book I did not enjoy. I flew through the first 750 pages and then purposely found excuses not to finish the book because I did not want it to end and I was scared it would end in a way that would disappoint me. It did not disappoint and I am at a loss in what I can read next to even come close to this book. I have loved Stephen King's writing for many years and honestly I have not read him for a while for not particular reason. Now I need to go back and read everything he has written for the past couple of years since.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This was a powerful and enlightening book.  Should be required reading!  To realize this is going on NOW!!!  Not 40 years ago.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|So, every one before him was delusional but, since he's a great doctor from a line of great doctors, it must be true.  Reasonably well written but still intellectual rationalization.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show.  Just when you think you can breath, something else happens!  And yet I'm so drawn in by the characters that it's not over the top!  I't's like I've known them all forever!
B005H23J7M|5.0|5 Stars for Amy Winehouse's album, absolutely no complaints, love the album and sounds great on vinyl.  But I just wanted to write a review to warn buyers of purchasing this item here on Amazon from the seller Turntable Lab.  If you scroll to the top of the Amazon listing you will notice there is a &#34;format&#34; box which lists the various formats you can buy this album, (CD, Vinyl 2007 and Vinyl).  Vinyl 2007 is the re-pressing of the album the option right below it which just says &#34;vinyl&#34; has a product picture of the original pressing (where the parental guidance label is in the right hand corner of the cover, on the re-press it's in the left hand corner).  I wanted the original pressing (I don't know if there's a difference in quality, I just always like to get the original pressings) and the only seller is a 3rd party seller Turntable Lab, who ships through Amazon.  Well what Amazon has in their possession from this seller is not the Black to Back LP, it's an Amy Winehouse 45 single with one song on each side and it's not even related to Back to Black.  Amazon, or whoever sent these to Amazon mislabeled them, the label on the item does say Back to Black LP, but it's a yellow 45.... Luckily Amazon's return policy made this a no hassle fix.  When I brought this up to the customer service rep they said they'd look into it, but I wouldn't put too much stock that they did, so just a warning to anyone else buying from that seller hoping to get the original pressing or just the LP in general, you might get something else.  I ended up buying the original pressing at my local record store.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love the author of the book and loved the movie.  Great action,suspense (even though I knew what was going to happen) and now I can't wait for the 2nd part.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Good puzzles that engage your ingenuity.  I have to admit that I &#34;pay to peek&#34; at the answer more times than I would like.  There's a nice demo to learn how to play the game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've been watching the current season, but I wanted to see how it all began.  Amazon had made it easy to watch.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|WOW, every book I read by Lee Child gets better. His character descriptions are clean and the stories weave around . You do not know early on how they are going to end. You find your self cheering  for Jack Reacher as he resloves wrongs that come along.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|A downer after reading the book.  Too quick getting to the hunt, need more personal backgroung on the players to get the real tone.
B003A92YF2|4.0|This is an oldie but a goodie. If you like Malo in the 70's this album will bring back fond memories. It's some of the best latin rock outside of Carlos Santana.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is rely fun. I play this game all this time and my favorite part is when you jump over the trains and when I get coins lol I hope that you will enjoy this fun and cool game as will I know that you will!!
B000HL0EEE|5.0|My wife and I are long time Star Trek fans starting with the original series.  We have enjoyed watching the Enterprise Season 1 episodes.  It has been very entertaining and a joy to watch again.  The stories and characters hold together to immerse us in the world of the Enterprise crew as they begin to explore space seeking out new life and new civilizations going where no man has gone before.  We occasionally think that the impetuous nature of the captain (some crew) and the friction with the Vulcans are over played.  However, it is only a minor distraction.  The series has been great entertainment for us.  We highly recommend it for other SciFi and Star Trek fans.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I bought this item several months ago and despite being careful with it and treating it gently, the joint holding the left earphone broke.  I took a look at the right joint and it was stress fracturing.  I'm a bit upset that after paying out a fair chunk of change for these headphones that it's not more durable.  Other than the durability, these headphones are great; good sound, no voice problems, etc.  But there are probably better sets out there.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Where all this talk of constant explosions and non-stop action are coming from is a mystery to me since there are only three major action sequences in the film and the rest is all about showing the effect Avengers had on Tony Stark and how bad decisions can cause irreparable damage.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film is how the main villain is developed. There's not enough time spent on him/them to really give us an accurate picture of who they are and what their motivations are. By the end of the film, if you've paid attention, it becomes very clear and is actually a really great idea.<br /><br />But the overall point of this movie was about developing Tony Stark outside of the Iron Man suit. Is it the man or the tech that's the hero? This movie answers that question and, albeit too quickly, wraps up a major part of Tony's story. Still, the dialog was great, the jokes don't feel forced and the villain is actually way more menacing and threatening than what we got in Iron Man 2.<br /><br />I won't say this one was as good as the first film. I think when the first one came out it was this amazing fresh idea that took everybody by surprise and maybe a lot of people are going into this one expecting the same. It's hard to be surprised by something twice, though this movie does factor in a couple of really smart ideas.<br /><br />If you're one to hate it when these comic book movies deviate from the comic story, you're going to have a bad time. Do yourself a favor and stay home. Or go see something else. At least then you won't have wasted your time/money. You'll feel better in the long run.<br /><br />For everybody else who understands why these stories aren't brought to the screen verbatim from the comic book page and/or you loved The Avengers and its predecessors, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. Be forewarned, it is still very different from all the ones that came before it. The story is heavily character focused on Tony Stark and that means other characters really don't get a lot of screen time, at least not as much as they should (Pepper Potts). I didn't see it in 3D so I can't comment on if that's worth it or not, but I usually get a headache from the glasses anyway and I'm more interested in the story than something that often comes off as a gimmick to get more money out of me. Movie tickets cost enough as it is.cters really don't get a lot of screen time, at least not as much as they should (Pepper Potts).

B009AMALLM|2.0|I loved the original Paranormal Activity, and the sequel was good as well.  The third one was kinda scary and it also helped to give a little more back story to what was going on with the whole demon and witch coven thing.<br /><br />This movie however was just lame.  It kinda had things that the other films had it them, with the whole \\"Night X,\\" and then the date and it had a few creepy things happening.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />But the jump scares, oh lord the jump scares.  A cat jumping into frame to scare me is not scary.  A girl flopping on her bed to scare me is not scary.  A mom opening the garage door and carrying in groceries is not scary.  A basketball bouncing down the stairs?  Just stupid.  And the thing with the kid riding around on his big wheel just reminded me I could be watching The Shining instead of this thing.<br /><br />Plus an internet reviewer pointed something out to me that I didn't even think of.  Why was Katie taken to the hospital in the first place?  We never find out.  Also, when she came back she looked fine.  She didn't have a place on her arm where they could have put an IV in, she didn't look lethargic from anesthetics, she didn't have a hospital ID bracelet on, etc.  So what the heck was she doing at the hospital?  Some clarity would be nice.<br /><br />Also, the movie is pretty much one big commercial for Apple products and the Xbox Kinect.  Because EVERYONE in this movie has an Apple laptop, or an iPhone, and we are shown people playing Kinect and those weird tracking dots from the Kinect are shown EVERY friggin' night!<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the fact that these parents have to be the dumbest parents on the planet!  When clearly supernatural activity is shown to them, they completely ignore it.  It's almost like they stick their fingers in their ears, close their eyes and go, \\"LA LA LA LA LA, I can't hear you!\\"  I mean you have to actively TRY in order to be this oblivious to things!<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />I will admit that the extended version of the film is good and I really enjoyed the extra little tidbits that it had to show us.<br /><br />Honestly it feels like they just made this film as an afterthought or an attempt to cash in on the franchise.  It doesn't really add anything to the Paranormal Activity storyline or give us anymore background on what's happening.  This film should never have been made and they should have just have left the series with three films.oblivious to things!<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />I will admit that the extended version of the film is good and I really enjoyed the extra little tidbits that it had to show us.<br /><br />Honestly it feels like they just made this film as an afterthought or an attempt to cash in on the franchise.

B004N0I3U2|4.0|This is a fun evening movie, especially for an easy download. Although I've seen it a few times before, it's fun and well done.
B00BF11STU|2.0|The story line was confusing and you never really got to know the characters.  The movie was very long and got boring at times.  Very disappointing.
1932907009|5.0|A very entertaining read.<br />Funny and &#34;to the point&#34; delivery of ideas.<br />While some techniques may be outdated, by current Hollywood/Indie/Internet film standards, still a valuable tool for your library.<br />Great &#34;insider&#34; views.

0345528581|4.0|I'm only in Week 3 of the program, but so far I really like it.  In terms of strength training I tend to prefer functional bodyweight exercises, and this fits the bill perfectly.  The workouts are decently short and manageable, but definitely effective.  I've already seen improvements in my pushups and I can always feel the squats and lunges the next day.  The one issue I have is that a few of the arm exercises (e.g. pull-ups) call for the use of a door, and I'm not 100% convinced that the doors in my apartment can actually support my weight.  I mean, the author shows himself using a door for these exercises in the example pictures in the book, and presumably I weigh less than him, but still, this is not the purpose most doors are designed for.  It's been okay so far, but I'm always a little worried about it.  Even though these exercises are supposed to be equipment-free, I might think about getting a pullup bar so I can stop worrying about pulling the door off it's hinges (and therefore not getting my security deposit back).
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Simply awesome! Simple concepts that can be applied to personal and business scenarios. Well written and engaging. A must read.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This is one of those movies that you rent because you are trying to shut down from a hard day at wor<br />k and just kick back and have a few laughs. Unfortunetly, if you watched the trailer, you've already seen all the good parts of the show. It got 3 stars cuz the story was creative...but I just expected a whole lot more! Sorry Barbara...
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved the book it was not hated to read I hope you tack the time to read it to
B00005214X|5.0|i'm revisitng my youth and buying up the stuff i either missed or had on vinyl back then. i originally liked George as a kid because he played most of the lead parts, but ive grown to love him as a songwriter, spiritual person , and man. this album shows he had a lot saved up while he was still  one of the &#34;lads.&#34;
0470913029|4.0|I read the first part but like with many diet books I lost interest.  However, I got enough of the concepts from that first part that I implemented that way of eating and lost almost 30 pounds.  I could lose more if I hadn't started indulging a little in refined carbs again.  Gotta stop that!
B000NY12LO|5.0|I really loved this book! Very thought provoking! Really makes you think about bullying and regretful if you bullied in your life!!
0345541588|5.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow\\"<br /><br />This book proved to be one of the best Jack Reachers yet. There were no holds barred and a cozy it ain't, not by a long shot.<br />Fasten your seat belts and prepare to be held fast by THE Jack Reacher.<br /><br />I can't say that the ending alone held me spellbound. It was so much more than just the ending. (If I can say JUST the ending) If any of you have read some of Lee child's Jack Reacher books than you already know that Jack doesn't get cornered...he gets even and then some. This book goes beyond that and we can never get enough. Jack's enemies become our enemies. We know that it's Jack's side we are on and we (the reader) hold fast to it.<br /><br />I won't bother going into the details of this story since over 450 other reviewers have done that ...just to say get Jack in \\"Gone Tomorrow\\". It's a must read!<br />Please take note of Dick Hill reading on CD and doing a splendid job. Jack's total assurance of a win-win situation in the face of death comes through in Dick Hill's reading.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I spent quite a bit of time feeling a disconnect between the story I thought was happening- and the story I was reading.<br />Clever 'twist' - not sure if I woudl read it again.
0060574216|5.0|The dynamics between men and women aren't as simple as I once thought. I am so grateful for the chance to understand how my husband works on a subconscious level and why I react the way I do. All the intention in the world cannot change the inner workings of the sexes. It is a good idea to have a guide to the subtleties.
B005CMSDLE|3.0|It gets vague as to her being special but she doesn't do any thing special. It does move along with a few stall outs. I can't give you a spoiler alert because there isn't one worth mentioning.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Repeating myself, I love westerns, so I was definitely game for this one.... but it's so much more than just a western.  Really, really good movie.  Highly recommend it.  It is very brutal at times, so you have to have the stomach for it... probably nothing worse than you've seen before, though.  I still have a problem when animals are involved in the brutality... However, great cast, great acting, great story.  Good mix of humor and seriousness.  Gotta own it! GREAT JOB QUENTIN TARANTINO!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is one of best sci fi movies I have seen for its time it is the best I have seen.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Casting is great, so is writing. Great production values. Having read a few books on Viking life, like Eaters of the Dead, they seem to portray very accurate daily life in the Viking world. The morning &#34;wash&#34; routine, gross, but like mentioned in the book. Good story line, the introduction of the priest is a brilliant way to introduce an introduction to some Viking leaders' value on learning. Really enjoy the show.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is one fine album it is a shame it has taken him so long to really get known, over here (Australia) he has been popular for a long time. He is like Bob Dylan but he can sing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a fantastic puzzle game! Detailed puzzles that require focus and creativity. Much more engaging than your typical puzzle game.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|works well..and makes texting, etc. faster<br /><br />The 14 or more words required here is ridiculous.  This will cause people to stop doing the reviews
B005K17RU0|1.0|I was forced to uninstall this app from my tablet. It simply does not work!<br />This is a lousy review, I am aware, but there was nothing for me to expand on except it failed to perform.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|not a eazy story to do,i thought dustin hoffmans was the sleeper his acting was the best he has ever done.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|My title sums it up.  I don't want to waste everyones time writing a massive novel on here, but it is exactly what I just said, PERFECT.<br /><br />I just finished watching the movie with my wife and I just can't get over the fact of how good this movie was.  The journey that Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) go on is simply breathtaking and amazing.<br /><br />Everyone needs to see this movie.<br /><br />I will add I think Bradley Cooper was robbed by Mr. Oscar, aka, Daniel Day Lewis who gets Oscars for no reason whatsoever.  Bradley Cooper deserved an Oscar for his role just as Lawrence received one for hers.  Loved every minute!!!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Watched random episode. Great stuff. Whooping Goldberg was actually excellent in this series. Nectgen was my fave show in the 90s.
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Awesome! It took me a few listens but it has grown on me. Standout tracks for me are Transition, Right The Wrong and Rest Of The World.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|.I thought this movie was really good. I haven't read the book yet but i think i wiil because the movie is amazing.
B0002CVQCW|5.0|Outstanding.  If you are watching/listening for the costumes and music,  thus is the pinnacle!  The original London cast is the best!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love science fiction based on a possible premise, rather than fantasy.  With the rush of underground shelters for Armageddon, it's not only possible but beginning
B008GAXUGW|5.0|These symphonies are cheerful and give insight into the contribution of Boccherini to the history of music. Boccherini dies in 1805 and his works come before Mozart. A detailed booklet describing the life of the composer is included and very informative.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Dark Comedy, it was a little unsettling and even a bit unnerving but still very good.<br /><br />Just not quite my type of movie so its only 4 stars.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Written by mom-It's really good, I like it and you get bad guys. Me and my mom really like that game.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I don't watch TV as I cannot stand ads and spouse has control over remote.  So I was delighted to discover I could watch on my IPad with earphones! And delighted with the high quality of The Good Wife.  Watched seasons 1-3 on Prime.  Thanks Amazon.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Easy set up and operation. Video performance is subpar which I wasn't expecting anyhow. An exit connection button is missing. The back button sends an esc message that minimizes full flash screen video on the remote system.
B00BT0ZDF2|3.0|I thought that this movie did not live up to the hype that the previews painted.  While I thought that it was visually impressive and with Tom Hanks and Hallie Barry how could you go wrong..right?  Well for me it was really confusing to watch..very disjointed...and by the time you thought you have a handle on it, it jumps to the future or the past...totally confusing to me.  I did find the characters entertaining and after all it is a very long movie...I think for the best part seeing the stars in all the different characters they played in the movie...was great....unfortunately you don't get to see that till the end of the movie.  If you have a lot of time on your hands you might want to check this movie out it is very long...

B00AKCJB44|3.0|I was very excited to buy the album, should have check the sound track out first. You only get a few.songs and the rest are voice clips from the movie. I suggest you only buy the songs you like from the album otherwise It's a huge waste of $13.00.

I can't be sure of the stats, but a good 10 degrees from the stock sounds about right.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Quiet<br />-Lowers temp by a significant margin compared to stock heatsink<br />-Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The sheer size and weight is just amazing. I could probably use this thing to bench press (not mark) FULL SIZE TOWER REQUIRED<br />-You have to take out your motherboard from the case (a deal breaker for some)<br />-The instructions are Egyptian at best.<br /><br />With all of it's faults I still give it 5 stars due to the fact that it is the best bang for it's buck.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I've been a fan of Paramore since the start and I absolutely love this album. For those who say they miss Paramore's old sound I must say I disagree. I'll admit that I was a bit unsure at first because their sound has definitely changed- but for the better! This album is a great mix of different genres along with interludes that mold every track together. I can feel that they've grown as friends, band mates, musicians and people the more I listen to this album. Paramore is no longer the angst filled teens we fell in love with,but now a mature and less angsty adults who are making great music for everyone to enjoy. After all, \\"some of us have to grow up sometime.\\"
B0007MUR2W|5.0|As a huge fan of David Bowie, this album remains one of my many favorites in DB's catalog. It has surely stood the test of time, mostly because everything Bowie does is way ahead of it's time. His music seems to get better with age, and this album is a testimonial to that. Bowie created one of his most memorable characters with Ziggy, and when he appeared in the early 1970s, there was nothing else like it. There was a sort of lost generation after the 60's had ended, young people were disenchanted, and wanted something new, and here it was! he truly seemed from another world. Every inch of this record is truly amazing, Bowie's songwriting is top notch here, from the opening epic Five Years, (which sets the stage) through &#34;Moonage Daydream&#34;, &#34;Starman&#34;, &#34;Lady Stardust&#34; ( a wonderful piece about Marc Bolan) on through to the grand finale Rock 'N' Roll Suicide, which was the standard closing number at most of  Bowie's shows from the Ziggy era to the Diamond Dogs shows in 1974. Highly recommended!
B009R659L8|3.0|I have always been a fan of novels by Mary Higgins Clark and eagerly await each of her books.  This one was a bit of a disappointment to me.  The story was alright. It held together, moved along nicely, and kept my interest.  There was a bit of a twist to the ending.  However, I did not feel a connection to the characters.  They seemed very one dimensional to me.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I love the original NCIS, and I love NCIS La.  The characters and story lines, but most of all, I support DENSI!

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This was a well made film and Denzel Washington was as phenomenal as ever, but this movie is very slow and depressing. The end makes it a little more worthwhile to watch, but if you don't like long slow sad movies I do not recommend this one.
B009R659L8|2.0|It's been a while since I read a MHC mystery and I must say I was surprised at the quality of this one. Parts of this novel were like reading a &#34;first draft.&#34;  Background setting dialogue was repeated so often I skipped over some out of boredom. The same holds true for character development descriptions. (Okay already, I get it that this is a bad guy, or she's a bimbo!) That said, some of the hallmarks of her past mysteries are still evident and there is a nice twist ending. Overall, this book disappointed me and I found myself wishing I'd downloaded something else, and that i had not paid &#34;new release&#34; $.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|I have been keeping up with the Mentalist for the latest 2 seasons so I decided to go to the basics. Well I'm really glad I did because the beginning is just as good as the progression has been!

I was so into these books, that I read them during Physical Therapy.  The author has an awesome imagination and has put it into words that draw the reader in. I really felt like I could touch Christian and Ana.  Very Well Done.  HOWEVER, I really don't know how it can made into a movie without losing something.  Not sure if I will go to see it. The books were more then satisfying .Thank You E.L. James

B00CL0J99K|2.0|Going into this film, you think \\"What could go wrong? Marvel has just come off Avengers, and has an established hero in his third film.\\" Then this movie happens. What went wrong? First, Stark has 42 suits of armor to choose from, and he consistently wears the only one that can't fly and has technical difficulties. Second, they choose the Mandarin for his villain (a great choice) and then choose to completely destroy the whole character with this treatment of him. Third, the end of the film drags on forever as Stark just keeps getting beat down and goes up against the villain that just...won't...die! Every time he goes down, there he is again. It gets so horribly monotonous.<br /><br />And here's a thought: why not let Stark actually WEAR ARMOR? This is the third film, shouldn't he be in the suit for at least half of it? And the final wrap up with Stark was absolutely abysmal, as they deviate DRASTICALLY from the comics. I see no way they could do another film for Stark with it left this way.<br /><br />This is a dangerous misstep for Marvel, as this is the beginning of \\"Phase 2\\" and if their other upcoming films don't do better (and to be fair, Iron Man 3 didn't set the bar very high at all) then this could begin the decline and eventual death of Marvel's movie franchise.<br /><br />So ultimately, how bad is this film? Let me put it in perspective: it makes \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" look good. And forget the after-credit sequence this time out...it's just a waste of time.

0062059963|5.0|The Selection started out with 35 girls and now in The Elite it is down to 6. America is still confused about her feelings for Maxon. Sometimes she feels that her heart will break when she sees him with another one of the girls, but then she will see a side of him that reminds her once again why she feels so inadequate to be the future Queen. And what of her feelings for Aspen? Her boyfriend from home, now a guard in the palace. He is still the only one that she feels truly knows her. If she is chosen by Maxon what will happen to her friendship with Aspen? When America distances herself from Maxon and he turns his affections elsewhere will America realize her mistake or has she lost his trust for good?<br /><br />I actually found myself liking The Elite better than The Selection. There seemed to be much more going on in The Elite. Also it seemed that we were able to see more of the characters personality, the author dug a little deeper and gave the characters more complex feelings. In The Selection I was all for America and Maxon getting together. In The Elite I now have my doubts. I still like Maxon, he has a depth to him that I didn't see before. But he also made me angry because he seemed wishy-washy,  one minute he was telling America she was the girl for him and then in the next he would be all over another of the girls. I also got frustrated with America for not showing Maxon more of her true self. Plus the fact that she continues to lead Aspen on. But all of those feelings and relationships are what keep The Elite entertaining. And don't you just love the cover?
1579128955|5.0|Great book for my kids and me too. Very complete, very organized. Information is easy for the kids to assimilate even though it is definitely not a beginner nor a child's book. We are very happy now that we understand the difference between molybdenum and cobalt .

B007HACDLK|5.0|Like the way he uses current events and almost predicts the future.  Can't wait for the new book to come out.

B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This is just like someone to start in the middle and then have to take us back to the beginning...but that is the only complaint that I have about this movie...visually appealing...suspense, drama, comedy, high emotions.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I really like this app. It is not a waste of time. One of its great things is that you can play with more than one person. You can play with someone else. Like I played with my sister. I lost. ALTHOUGH, on the second round I won.<br /> Another great thing is you can turn it into other animations; like, original hangman on a chalkboard, snowman and flower power. The one that comes on in the picture is the best. The animations are SOO cute. He actually moves and you see him fall through the floor if you loose. Although, if you win it just goes to the next puzzle. BUT, if you are SOO close to losing but you win, something will happen and hangman will get away! I REALLY think Ultimate Hangman deserves 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I thought I had to have one of those really fancy covers, but when I did not find one, I chose this one.  It is bright so I can find it in the bottom of my bag, but most of all, it covers ALL of my Kindle and it is totally protected.  Wonderful design and I know I will buy another...
B00CH87HF4|5.0|If you ever want to get anything productive done I highly recommend passing this game bye. If not....by all means have fun!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Found lots of craft ideas, gardening ideas, how to make homemade remedies. Overall fun to see all the 'stuff'. it is overwhelming how many ideas you can find. Been using about 1 month. It is amazing to see how many things I already do that other people posts. Need to learn more about posting my own ideas, not that far into it yet. Amazing how other people repin your pins and then you go to their page and find more interesting things to pin from their page. Could spend all day on it.Overall if you love doing things and learning cost saving ideas, this is for you. But it is a whole lot more....LOVE it!!!!!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure to get this app, but it was on sale for free on the Amazon Apps store for Andriod, so i figured what the heck why not. If this app wasn't free i would still buy it. This app connect to your computer (You have to download this on the computer to get it to work but its free) and allows you to access the programs on your computer; no games though. The only downside is that this app is 10$,which isn't a lot of money, but in a world of killer 99&cent; apps it is. So overall a must have for phones because you can connect to your computer to do something you forgot, but is just a cool add on for you tablet. For me i think its overall worth it. So Jump in!!!
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Did not find this one necessary to install. If anyone can tell me what the benefits are let me know. Kindle Fire's camera does the same (sorta)  Wish there was a back camera, front camera is a little difficult. Any response or recommendations  is highly welcome. It is difficult to take a picture of scenery, people, animals and other things with front camera. Suggestion please.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This move was both Funny and touching. Loved it. I would recommend it to a friend for a good laugh and heartfelt movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great adventure with an interesting story line, plot twists, and lots of action. The graphics are detailed and it includes short clips of animation at key points. Everything you want in an adventure game.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I enjoy 100% anything written by Jo Nesbo.  I find his stories well written and deep in description.  So much that you really feel what it would be like to be his character.  I recommend reading his stories in succession to really understand Harry.  You will appreciate the character more.  Most of us can relate to Harry in some way or another.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Game was fun but the image was small and the background was dark which made finding the objects hard to see.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I think the gratuitous blood shed was a little over the top.  Story line and everything else was better than average.  I respect the way they chose to really curtail nudity and over the top sexual innuendos but the blood spurting effects were a little too much.  Not good if you are trying to avoid violence.<br /><br />Overall this movie just had me realize that Tarantino movies are not quite my cup of tea compared to those who swear by his work.  I love his artistry, but that is it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I usually only read horror, Sci Fi or fantasy, but a friend told me about this book. An amazing book by a real American hero. I had heard about his unfortunate death, but didn't realize what a great American he was. A must read for anyone who loves our country.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I still like using paper for grocery lists and notes to myself for instant access.  I wouldn't carry my Kindle to the grocery store or out shopping.  However I think I will find the Kindle Notebook very useful for jotting down notes and thoughts when I'm not at home or for writing down short or long term goals (ie &#34;things to do&#34;).  Since I've only had it a brief period of time, I will be exploring more options for its use.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|To me, it seems a bit easier than regular one. The only thing is once you've run out of special powers, you have to buy more and since I can't connect to Internet on a regular BASIS - that leaves me stuck.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Very fast paced and fun movie ok for a family to watch with teen/pre-teen kids.  Nice adventure with overall decent language - just the typical violence found in comic book hero turned movies.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I'm beginning to think that these superhero movies are toying with their fans and viewers, doing just enough to keep people wanting more with each movie they release. You come expecting to see Batman or Iron Man and mostly you get a lot of scenes of Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark either unable to be their alter egos because their stuck in a hole, hurt, emotionally scarred, trying to fix their suit, or maybe they haven't become their alter-egos yet and we need half the movie to get there. Or maybe the script, in the case of Iron Man 2, is just bad and you get the entire core of the movie without Iron Man; with the exception of a brief scene where Tony Stark is drunk and shooting fruit at a party. Could these billion-dollar franchises be saving money on special effects, or was my initial assessment correct?<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is no exception. Without giving too much away, the middle of the movie is spent with Tony Stark suit less because it needs to be fixed. So, ultimately we get the same thing we got in Iron Man 2; a setup, a big scene in the beginning, a talky middle and a slam-bam finish. The good news is, the middle and mostly Iron Man free part is not without action, it is just Tony Stark doing the action, with some Iron-Manish gadgets. This is why I believe this trend of superhero movies with sparse superhero moments is not unintentional. To me though, \\"Iron Man 3\\" is without question the best of the trilogy; although that isn't saying much.<br /><br />Fortunately for \\"Iron Man 3\\", you can't cut out the core of the movie and still get the gist of it. While it does do the same thing as \\"Iron Man 2\\", the story is intricate, complex and thought provoking. While Stark is out of sorts and without a suit, he becomes a bit of a Sherlock Holmes, figuring out the mystery of who the terrorist `The Mandrin' is and where he will strike next. We miss Iron Man through those scenes, but we are still invested in the film and sure enough when the suit finally reaches its full potential, we get what we paid for in a smash up finale that was right up there with \\"The Avengers\\".<br /><br />Although, while he spent the entire movie fixing one suit, he manages to call up dozens of suits to help out with this big finale. Which didn't make sense, and once again proves my point about MONEY being the dictator for these scripts instead of LOGIC.<br /><br />It's not like these studios don't have money or know that the current movie they're working on is gonna make its money. This is a billion dollar franchise people. BILLION. With a B. So why do we keep getting the same screenplays where our hero is disabled or unable or emotionally scarred for some unknown reason for most of the movie? I just don't want these studios and all the billions their making off of us, to think they can nickel-and-dime us like everybody else in the world is these days. I'm onto their game. I'm calling them on it. Nonetheless, it is Iron Man, and for now, it's the only Iron Man we got, so I'll probably still buy their nickle-and-diming blu-ray with the money-saving screenplay. Talk amongst yourselves.ential, we get what we paid for in a smash up finale that was right up there with \\"The Avengers\\".<br /><br />Although, while he spent the entire movie fixing one suit, he manages to call up dozens of suits to help out with this big finale.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I didn't know if I should rate this because I haven't finished it yet...and that's because it seems to ramble. I've just gotten bored with it, and I'm having trouble even wanting to finish it. I keep hoping it gets better. I'm sure it's very hard for the author to describe his experiences in a way all of us can understand, but frankly, my understanding is stuck in the &#34;black jello&#34;. Wish I would have gotten it from the library-but since it's on my Kindle I'll finish it, probably, eventually.

B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This movie fits in with the others perfectly yet it is still its own movie. It is not about Jason bourne so not using Matt Damon is OK.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. It is so well done. I love the details- clothing, furniture, silverware. Everything is perfect. I think I liked Season 1 and 2 better but I still rated Season 3 with five stars because its rare to see a TV series this well done nowadays.

B0052REQLK|4.0|The rating reflects the the value that I feel I got from the material. I found myself in A lot of the examples. I have recommended this book to some of my relatives and children. And I think this book would be most valuable to those over the age of 35.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This movie starts during the civil war I had hoped it would have started earlier then that. With that said the acting is great and the movie helps you understand Lincoln's state of mind during the war and the conflicts the he felt with trying to end slavery.

B0017KIBAI|4.0|I love the controller, and this is not a review about the Gamecube controller itself, which I believe one of the most daring yet surprisingly intuitive and convenient controllers of all time, but rather on the particular unit I received.<br /><br />My controller, which I am currently using in a Wii U using a third party Gamecube controller-to-Wiimote adapter, has one minor issue which is that in order to use the start button I need to tap it fast twice. It's not a major problem, mostly a mild annoyance, but I paid 46$ for the controller, I would have liked to receive one that works exactly like a mint GCN controller.<br /><br />Yet, I have to test this on a Wii or Gamecube to see if the issue might be from the adapter. The rest of the buttons and joysticks work perfectly fine, so it might be either a hardware issue of the controller or that I activated the Turbo function of the adapter in my start button.<br /><br />Nonetheless, fantastic controller. Even with that little detail, you shouldn't be afraid to buy this GCN controller, because even though it is supposedly no longer accepted by the Wii U, the adapters make short work of that problem and you get to play those GCN controller enabled games with one of the best console controllers out there.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Well written so that it keeps your interest.  No clue ahead of time to the ending.
B000SEI230|5.0|It was a book I will remember and the miracles of God.  It was told with no swearing.  This was good.

B0086KDYLI|5.0|Mohsin Hamid writes so well that were it not for the propulsive force of his quietly building suspense story, the reader would be tempted to linger over passages of elegantly beautiful prose. THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST is a timely book, yes, but it is far more: the novel underscores the talent of a superlative writer unafraid to place before the public a story that is bound to create a disturbing response at the end of the roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Cleverly written as a monologue from a Pakistani young man named Changez (a name when pronounced delivers major clues to the story!) as he joins an American in a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan. The story reveals a young lad from a family once well to do in Pakistan, but fractured by the political changes suffered by that country, a lad who goes to America to attend Princeton University where he transforms himself into an 'American stance', performs exceedingly well academically, and joins the wealthy American classmates on jaunts where he encounters the beautiful but mysteriously aloof Erica. Changez and Erica become friends and were it not for Erica's recovering from a loss of her previous lover Chris who died of cancer, the two seem to be destined to become lovers. Erica is from a wealthy family who accepts Changez even more readily when upon graduation he is awarded a position with the prestigious firm Underwood Samson. Changez learns the feeling of the American preoccupation with success and wealth while still being committed to his family ties in Pakistan. While Changez is on a business trip to Manila he watches the 9/11 event and he is surprised that he feels a bit happy that haughty America is being brought to her feet.<br /><br />Changez returns home finding his physical appearance now a cause for suspicion in the bruised country that afforded him success. He attempts to stay connected with Erica but Erica has retreated into her fragile state of melancholia and is eventually hospitalized. Changez continues his successful climb up the American dream ladder of success until he meets a gentleman Juan-Bautista in Chile who admonishes him that his devotion to his work for American companies might force him to forget the importance of home and family. Changez is changed and his decision regarding his employment, his lack of knowledge of Erica's whereabouts, and his growing anger at America preemptive attacks on countries near his home - all result in his returning to Pakistan, and the encounter with the American at the cafe. And Hamid leaves us there, afloat on a sea of questions and new information about the people we have been attacking and the result is a pungent experience in re-thinking the global atmosphere.<br /><br />The book is relatively short (184 pages) and since it is written as one extended conversation, it is next to impossible not to read the entire book at one sitting: leaving the story even for a moment would be like leaving a personal encounter - rude. The story is superb, written with facile elegance, and contains views from outside our cloistered world that refreshingly informs us to re-examine our point of view. Highly Recommended on every level.

B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|The trailers for this movie do nothing to tell you what it's about. I thought the story was silly and didn't make much sense. Animation, production values and acting were all top notch as you would expect from Pixar, but I thought this was not their best effort.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Something there is about a movie that while in the theaters everybody loves and then the Oscars come `round and awards pour in, you you're left with the thought `how can two actors known for such films as potty mouth Hangover I - III and credibility challenging violence such as Hunger Games make a film worth all the hullabaloo?'  Well, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the enormously successful answer. Based on the novel by the same name by Matthew Quick and freely adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell, this stage brings an unusually fine opportunity to reveal the rather phenomenal talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence while also demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble productions.<br /><br />The story briefly outlined is as follows: Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr. (Robert DeNIro), caring Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver) discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), from a Maryland mental hospital after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the \\"silver linings\\" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell 9Jennifer Lawrence), a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.<br /><br />The entire cast is superb - including Chris Tucker as a mentally challenged friend Jake - and the joy of the film is that even while dealing with the controversial subject of bipolar disorder, the story and the actors portraying the characters (each bruised in a particular way) always seems real and gains our empathy. But it is the glow of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence walking the very thin line of social adjustment with the grace of the finest of actors that makes this film so special.  Highly Recommended.

B001NZEHMS|5.0|This is one of the biggest albums in Rap of all time.  If it was not for this album, JayZ may never had been this big today.  I own the tape, but no longer have a tape player so I bought the MP3s.  This is the Album that brought Rap to a generation of white kids in the sub-burbs.  Paul Revere is the one song that any Beastie Fan will know, and if they don't they aren't much of a fan.  Fight for your Right, is just a gateway drug to ill hits that are part of this piece of history.

B003L16FAE|5.0|DON'T buy this product. Supposedly this is one of the most hated blu-rays out there (Ultimate Hunter Edition). Reason being is that all the 'grain' was scrubbed from the film, leaving only a smooth clear picture but supposedly sacrificing picture quality. I saw absolutely NO compromise of the picture and I watched on a 60\\" LED screen. Hate it up haters.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|I can only give it a 3 &#34;neutral&#34; because I wasn't able to watch the end of the movie because of an issue with Amazon.com.  Although it was supposed to be in my libaray until end of the month I think you have to watch the entire movie within 24 hours of starting it and I only watched 1 hour.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It's a Farmville clone and pretty much tries to force you to connect to Facebook and &quot;get your friends to help you.&quot; I enjoyed it but got bored very quickly since it's impossible to progress without connecting to social media to bother people for &quot;help.&quot;
B001AQO3XS|5.0|this film has it all from Scots in the highlands fighting it out in kilts to men with swords killing each other in the streets of new york city to nazis being killed during the occupation all the way to the fabulous freebirds in action at madison square garden it doesnt get much better than this

B00AJAFNIA|1.0|This game is supported by flurry analytics which is a for of spyware for millions of smartphones out there. DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR INFORMATION STOLEN BY THESE CROOKS.<br /><br />Aside the game itself is not that good. There's no instructions and the game infrastructure is  sloppy and slow.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|An absolutely must see. I laughed so hard when they started talking. Hubby had to watch it the 2nd time with me.
1454901276|5.0|This is an amazing book - not your typical police procedural! You will feel like you've taken a trip to the remote islands of Scotland and become immersed in Gaelic culture and language. Fin, the main character (and a police detective) is complex, troubled, anxious. When he returns to the remote and claustrophobic town of his youth, after 20 years in Edinburgh and Glasgow, his dark and troubled past reemerges in alternating chapters of flashback. There is a very interesting cultural story-within-a-story about a 400 year old \\"coming of age\\" tradition. I would highly recommend renting online (via Vimeo) the documentary, \\"Guga Hunters of Ness\\" (a tradition that takes place nowhere else in the world except the Isle of Lewis.) You will definitely be interested in the topic by the time you're well into the book, and the documentary provides wonderful imagery that will serve you well as you read the book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Fabulous book! I never  knew about Orphan Trains, so found this to be such an interesting topic.  The author has such a great way of telling the story, you feel as though you are really there.  Highly recommend this, especially if you don't know anything about this era in our history.

B005LAIIJY|2.0|Quentin Tarantino mentioned there are not enough movies about the history of our country and he's right about that. I love Quentin's movies, this is a Quentin Tarantino movie so do not expect a movie or series such as Roots or The acting is great, the music I did not like. There are so many movies that should be made about America just look at all the British movies that were great.  Why doesn't Hollywood make a great movie about the Italian's who first came here, the Irish, Prussian's etc., all I see are shoot em up movies or comedies anymore & the comedies are not that funny anyway, please give us some good drama and stop trying making remakes of movies we have already seen. Downton Abbey should make Hollywood realize people were watchingIf you're expecting a Roots type movie this is not it, it has it's funny moments but nah not worth the money, wait till it shows on TV for free.[[ASIN:B001HCWGUW Captains and the Kings]][[ASIN:B0098G7AWS Titanic]][[ASIN:B0009NZ76U Bramwell - The Complete First Season]][[ASIN:B005CGI4O6 Roots (Seven-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)]].

B007DIQC90|5.0|I love this CD.  The first time I heard their music on my daughter's music source, I said, &#34;I have to have this!&#34;  My daughter stated it would be a good &#34;Mom's Day&#34; present.  I stated, &#34;I can't wait that long.&#34;  Their songs are pleasing to me.  I loaned this CD to one of our physicians at work.  He was not a fan - but that is because he is stuck in the 60s and 70s.  Even though I am older, Of Monsters and Men is one of my new favorite groups.  Listen to the tracks - enjoy!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a wonderful story, written with intelligence and emotion. Enzo is a believable character who kept me interested until the last page.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Although its not rock solid in its claim as a &#34;Stedicam&#34; (meaning that there are slight vibrations in the footage but hey, what do you expect for 20 bucks) it still does better that free hand filming. Check out the other reviews that have video examples posted and you'll see this works just fine for the money!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series, could actually happen, kinda, maybe, and of course it would be the government doing it,we need to prepare now.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is absolutely brilliant!  To have it on DVD to re-watch is fantastic, especially with having the bonus features.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend or I probably would never have run across it.  I thought it started a little slow but once it hooked me, I finished it quickly.  The ending surprised me, which doesn't happen very often.  I'm still trying to decide if I like the way it ended or not.  I'm not going to try to summarize the story here - that's been done by other reviewers, I'm sure.  I just want to share the fact that it is not a cookie-cutter plot.  The story stands on its own with a unique twist.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I don't understand why all the negative reviewers are so annoyed with this app, especially today when you can get it for free.  It is a delightful game and a lot of fun and very addictive.  It runs very smoothly on my motorola xoom and it's the kind of game that you could see yourself watching a little one on your lap play as you watch over their shoulder it's really that delightful and it's really worth a try.  If it's not for you that's fine but I would never discourage anyone from checking out this game it's really great and its not at all confusing to learn how to play. If you give it a try you'll  see what I mean.  The object is that you play as a moon going from one planet's orbit to another planet and you just tap to go from one planet to the other. There are  stars in orbit around each planet that you collect as you orbit the planet.  Within two taps you figure out the whole idea behind the game
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is very tTrue to the original game. Free. Offers other products, politely. The interface is simple, smooth and intuitive.
B00005JXY3|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and I love it even more now. This movie is yet another title that I put into my &#34;Watch it 1000 times at least&#34; catagory! In my opinion, this is better than the first movie and that's saying allot!

B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This movie was okay, the acting was amazing but the movie in and of itself was confusing on so many levels. I would recommend watching it just for the acting skills, but it definitely is just a rental.
B000006UNF|4.0|Overall, this is a pretty successful debut.  Though the execution is sometimes a little dicey (they really loved clumsy, repetitive start-stop sections, didn't they?) and some of the pieces run too long, the songwriting is at a high level and you can already hear the band moving away from the more prog-wannabe sound of \\"Grendel\\".  I'd say the second half of the album is probably stronger than the first (the title track is good and \\"He Knows You Known\\" is pretty insistent, but I've always thought \\"The Web\\" was pretty boring).  Special kudos go to the poignant \\"Chelsea Monday\\" and the grim \\"Forgotten Sons\\" (which echoes both Pink Floyd's \\"Sheep\\" and Genesis's \\"The Knife\\", but is still worthwhile).  And despite more of those incessant start-stop rhythms, \\"Garden Party\\" is fun.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|I am a huge Queen fan and have seen most of the documentaries on them and also on Freddie Mercury.  However, this one seemed more &#34;authentic.&#34;  The interviews were mostly of Brian and Roger and others that actually knew them all during that time.  Many documentaries, I wonder just how much some of the people knew them, or are of fans reactions to stuff.<br /><br />The part where Brian and Roger describe Freddie's illness and eventual demise were beyond touching.  Had me in tears.<br /><br />Of course my husband loved the footage of the Bicycle Race video shoot.  (eye roll)<br /><br />Highly recommend it
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I am usually attracted to the mysteries, but I really loved this game.  It worked well on my Kindle Fire.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I am sure the game is fine and the graphics is great, but there are way too many adds, after one game I deleted.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We have so enjoyed the period, the great characters (Maggie you rock!) and the sense of life and drama. Finally TV that is captivating and fun.
B00B0U2SEA|4.0|I love this movie and I have enjoyed seeing it again.  Fantastic work by all involved; actors, writers, producers and especially the director.  Just marvelous.
B000002J1O|4.0|For most people, this is the most obvious logical first step into the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis.  It's not necessarily the best album this lineup made, but it does show them at the peak of the powers, minus the rough edges of earlier albums or the Lamb's hit-and-occasional-miss experimentation.  Some of their most memorable music is here - the magnificent \\"Cinema Show\\" (probably Tony Banks's shining hour), the haunting a capella opening to \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\", and the instrumental portions of \\"Firth of Fifth\\".  \\"I Know What I Like\\" was a minor early hit, and its quirky catchiness holds up well, without the bloating of later live versions.<br /><br />That said, I don't think this album is flawless - the vocal sections of \\"Firth of Fifth\\" are mostly and unfortunately ponderous, and though \\"Battle of Epping Forest\\" is sometimes entertaining, it runs on way too long.  \\"More Fool Me\\" (an early lead vocal by an obscure drummer named Phil something) is actually charming and not bad by any means, but it's not a major highlight either.<br /><br />Still, unless you're a Zeppelin fan who wants something harder rocking (Nursery Cryme!), I think this is probably the place to start with PG-era Genesis.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Great storyline. If you love zombies this is a must have.  Quick page turner and always exciting for fans. Totally worth getting.
B001NIA27E|4.0|This is a decent fairly movie. The volcanic stuff is fairly accurate and the acting is decent. Not an epic by any means but a good movie for a rainy night.
B005LJITS0|4.0|loved it, it follows the comic book story line that was not quit gripping but will go into my video collection
B008XKSW7M|4.0|this movie was very true to life and funny...Cameron Diaz does an excellent job protraying an expectant mother to be.
B008YRTPKM|4.0|Protagonist with faults, pure protagonist, or the antagonist Denzel always proves he's got game.  Pull for him in this hoops tragedy.
B000002J1M|5.0|Nursery Cryme was one heck of a statement by a young band: \\"Check out what we can do!\\"  Foxtrot isn't necessarily a better album, but it takes the ideas from NC, refines them and pushes them a bit further.  \\"Supper's Ready\\" is Genesis's stab at a 20 minute prog epic.  I don't think all of it necessarily works, but the last 12 minutes or so are brilliant, among the band's finest moments on record.  Among the shorter tunes on the first half of the once-LP, \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" is probably the most memorable due to the spectacular mellotron opening and the rat-tat-tat bassline, but I actually think the biggest highlight is the frenetic \\"Can Utility and the Coastliners.\\"  Steve Hackett's uncredited \\"borrowing\\" of Bach's 1st cello suite, \\"Horizons\\", is also lovely.  Definitely worth hearing.
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|Its ok, but has a lot of annoying things, that I find myself just bringing up the mobile website as opposed to using this app.<br /><br />For example:<br />-no comments on half the products...or they are there, but I just can't access them, or....something?<br />-wish list - you can add something to your wishlist, but if you have more than one, it goes to the default and I don't see any option to choose the wish list...this gets very annoying, to the point that you just use the standard web site instead.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this book is really good and everyone should bye it its fun to play it on a car ride. get this game
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good read, will definitely reread, very suspenseful and keep my attentions  a hard time putting it down.  Great work by author
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|I most often choose to finish a book simply because I started it. In this case, I think my world will continue much more peacefully should I avoid the torment of further mediocrity. Cliche', slow, so conversationally colloquial I wonder if the author has ever even visited Ireland or has just researched stereotypes at the local library. That's harsh. Still, as it was difficult enough to believe two forty-year-old adults were in a stage of life in which all their college friends were just now engaged or getting married, I was insulted further by the obvious message regarding the author's own antipathy toward religion - regardless of denomination. Spare me the sermon about sermons. Seduce me with a few believable characters and I might be content. As is, I'm back to the classics and reminded why I spend so little time reading works by contemporary authors.
B0040I09RM|4.0|JAX struggles with his dark side.  But he plays with devil too often and the devil always wins in the end.
B001R4MEUM|4.0|The Lamb is a bit of an outlier in Genesis's catalogue.  It's the only double LP they recorded in the studio (unless you count We Can't Dance), it's the only full blown \\"concept album\\", and contains an experimental vibe that most of their other work avoided.  Unlike the \\"prettiness\\" of Selling England and A Trick of the Tail, the band's perfectly willing to sound \\"ugly\\" here, and it often works.  It's reminiscent of the (in my opinion underrated) Abacab in that respect.<br /><br />Like most rock double albums going all the way back to the White Album, the Lamb's 100 minutes contain a mix of classic music, good-but-not-great tunes, and stuff that is mere filler.  And like most concept albums, the story itself is not that interesting.  The title tune, \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", \\"In the Cage\\" and \\"Back in NYC\\" are awesome.  It's not surprising that Peter Gabriel continued to play some of them in his early solo career, or that they survived in Genesis's live performance deep into the Phil Collins era.  \\"Broadway Melody\\", \\"The Lamia\\", \\"Anyway\\", \\"Slippermen\\", and \\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\\" also stand out.  That said, the filler I mentioned starts cropping up more frequently as you move through the album, and pretty much takes over once you get past \\"Slippermen\\".  (OK, \\"The Scree\\" has a wild Tony Banks synthesizer solo that's absolutely worth hearing, but the song itself isn't that good.)<br /><br />I know this album has its diehard fans but the rest of us will be glad to own it and listen just to the best parts.
B006OUODZS|5.0|I am not all that young any more but, this is good music.  Definitely different than most rap with new sounds.  I played one of the songs on a juke box and, some girls got up and, started to dance!  I like Pink Floyd and, consider songs by PF to be in the five star category but, this is that good.  I didn't want to go back to four stars for this CD.  You should hear the title song played on the speakers at 'Thunder Over Louisville' (THE best pyrotechnic show in the US).  It just doesn't get any better than that.  ;-p  As a PS to this review, put 'Thunder' in your buck list.
B003U53GK8|5.0|The ending was perfect and completely a surprise. Our family was completely taken in by the entire series, terrific don't miss it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It Is Like My Best Past Timee :D<br />Itss Soo Good And The Graphics Evenn!!<br />Its Is Actually Awestruck :D
B00933JL0A|2.0|So i gave it 2 stars not because of quality but because i dont like this type of game,  it is of very nice quality especially for free, but not my type of game.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I couldn't believe that in had been 10 years. In some ways they kind of wrote themselves into a hole. On the other hand it was a great refresh of the series. I wish they had made more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I read a lot of Stephen King books and this one holds its own I my favorites.  The book is not horror based like some of his other novels.  This particular book is more of a mystery suspense.  The gore factor is minimal in this book.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a book that will keep you hooked.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Yes, I know it's cheesy but I think that's what makes it even more endearing after all these years. Where will you find more &#34;emotion&#34; then when Spock says, &#34;You are my superior officer. You are also my friend. I have been and always shall be yours.&#34;?
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Love this movie... Wonderful story line ... My child is hooked on it ... We missed it on big screen and glad we bought the bluray...
B004GJYR7I|5.0|my mother was very pleased with her gift she really like old movies she said it plays very well, okay
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|This game is a very fun game that you need brains to complete. There are three or four islands in which you have to connect bridges.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is by far the most user friendly , easily playable and trouble free solitaire app on the market and it is free .Just plain fun so enjoy the real deal!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great era show. The time has been captured by the scenery and attire. This is a drama that is addicting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I admit to watching very little television these days, but I confess to being addicted to &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34; Yes, it is soap opera, but done with beauty, sincerity and style. Check it out, even if you agree with me that the more channels that are added to cable the less there is to watch, I think you'll find &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; the exception.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wow, for a doctor and scientist to be so convinced of the proof of God through his NDE is one thing, but to be so passionate about the &#34;telling&#34; is powerful.  I was hanging on every word, and deeply moved by his pain.  This proves to me my theory that we will be judged by one question in the afterlife,&#34;did you love&#34;?  Eben  seemed up to the task and I'm grateful for his gift to us all.  I hope I can share my life as beautifully as he has.  God not only exists but loves us beyond our wildest imagination.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|it came on time nothing wrong with it my mother enjoyed this gift as well this is her favorite detective
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was dope and interesting. It explained through good detail. It had interesting take on the and good detail. I highly recommend if you're into zombie books or the zombie genre.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you liked The Hunger Games, you will love Wool! The book has strong characters (I especially loved Juliette)and it is so unpredictable. Just when you think you have it figured out, boy, will you be surprised! I hope for a sequel!!!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|I loved this book.  Well thought out and an enjoyable read; the first half.  My beef lies with the author's solutions.  Their solutions seem to digress into a conservative republican, business-man sort of double-speak.  First, the authors talk about increased entrepreneurship. Huh? So the masses of business majors are all going to start a website or write an app that performs some new inane butt-scratching task?  How many folks are going to succeed at that?  How many folks are going to be employed from said butt-scratching apps?  The authors also talk about reducing mortgage subsidies? Again, huh? Hasn't land ownership been a fundamental of free republican/democratic societies since the Greeks?  Give a man a place to call his own, a place to raise a family, no matter how tenuous that ownership is, makes a man feel like a man. The authors talk about overhauling the education system; although I won't go into depth, their solutions all sound straight out of business-school.  Students are resources.  Memorization and rote learning is out.  Critical thinking is in.  But I ask, please explain to me how one programs the robots if one doesn't know calculus and other mathematical concepts, all of which rely upon repetition and rote.  In the DC area I regularly attend a meetup group devoted to entrepreneurship, it is almost sad to see the number of folks that see technology as essentially being easy and nothing more than throwing up a new butt-scratching website or app. But it is not, *real* technology is dang hard.<br /><br />The author's then suggest increasing the H1B program.  Now that's a solution - not.  How about teaching America's youths math and science rather than teaching egoism and the belief that they can get a handle on technology or life in general without building a foundation. Again, it just isn't realistic.  I understand why y'all (business guys) needed the H1B program. Without it, you'd be paying me way more than I'm already making and you still wouldn't have enough programmers.  But what's the solution to that? Perhaps educate more United States citizens?  Maybe teach a little less businessy soft skills and more solid skills like math and science? Although I am not against immigration, it seems to me that all you are going to do with increased H1B is going to do is make it cheaper for the 1% to get the labor they need.<br /><br />So let's call a spade a spade. The authors are the intellectual arm of the 1%.  Their solutions will drive down the wages for the small group of middle-class that remains, such as myself.  The small group of United States citizens that still wish to pursue math and science will have their wages fall too, because the money will flow to the 1% instead of me and my ilk.<br /><br />And as for the business-entrepreneurs. Two-words: Starbucks Management.  How many entrepreneurs actually succeed?  The founders of Google are not products of \\"manager school;\\" they are products of a technical education grounded in math and science. The solutions posed by these authors will do nothing more than increase the number of disgruntled, unemployed business school graduates who are desperately trying to create their own job in an economy that no longer needs them.  Sure some will succeed, but most will not.<br /><br />Now, I'm no PhD in Economics, much less a PhD in Economics at MIT, but seems to me the problem is simple.  Technology has allowed us to capture/save energy expenditure at a phenomenal rate.  Suddenly, wealth at an unprecedented scale is being generated while at the same time the need for labor is decreasing.  Hmm....sounds like some republic that lapsed into tyranny awhile back. You know, the one we all read about in college back when we actually took courses in liberal arts, history, and classical civilization. The problem is how do we free up that tremendous wealth being generated so that American society as a whole can prosper. How about Al Gore's suggestions on increasing research, public works, and government sector employment?  The 1% is amassing incredible wealth, the masses are getting poorer and poorer, yet living in a consumer economy. Now, when they finally decide enough is enough, who's getting burned at the stake, only the 1%?  I'd suggest that MIT Economists and overpaid neck-beards like myself are going to be on the menu too.  Maybe not us, but then what about our kids?  Common sense tells us we need to do something now just to preserve our hides much less our liberty.<br /><br />This YouTube video showing an argument between Dr. Michio Kaku and some Harvard business school guy best illustrates the problem the USA has with technology. Just watch the body language and the disdain the business guy holds for the neck-beard. I'm not anti-management, I need a manager, they serve an important job; but they can't all be entrepreneurs and we need to stop this manager/technical divide. The only folks who are going to win by this divide are China, India, and the 1% in the USA. Business folks hold technical folks with disdain, and that is very unfortunate. I challenge you to go to the middle of this video and not recognize the disdain and disrespect shown to Dr. Kaku....<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So sure, if we continue in the path that we have \\"the managerial intellectual capital\\" that directs the technical capital (who increasingly are foreign born and require a lower wage), then we will continue to prosper, only the \\"we\\" becomes smaller and smaller. Those of us who still cling to a middle-class lifestyle start to feel the hurt in the future, but to a lesser extent than the vast majority of America.  Now, the accountants, junior lawyers and paralegals, and other knowledge workers....forget about it, increasingly they will join the ranks of the so-called welfare cheats.<br /><br />Here's a couple quotes from the book:<br /><br />Decouple benefits from jobs to increase flexibility and dynamism.<br /><br />Preserve the relative flexibility of American labor markets by resisting efforts to regulate firing and hiring.<br /><br />and one of the pernicious quotes:<br /><br />Eliminate or reduce the massive home mortgage subsidy...While home ownership has many laudable benefits, it likely reduces labor mobility and economic flexibility, which conflicts with the economy's increased need for flexibility.<br /><br />----<br /><br />But isn't there an alternative?  It sounds liberal, but it'll save our butt.  It'll save the 1% too!  We need to find a way to free up the wealth being generated.<br /><br />Problem 1: Those darn intellectuals<br /><br />We increase research in the liberal arts.  We make it so a PhD in Underwater Classical Roman Archaeology in the Black Sea from 100BC to 200BC can actually find a job generating yet more knowledge on that brief period.  We have the money - computers are making it so. We are in a period of unprecedented abundance. We can afford providing public funds for research in the liberal arts. So now the educated elite are busy studying things like Chinese Vases in the first century BCE, or the effects of climate change on cave men, or whether Neanderthals interbreed with humans, and other non-GDP raising activities.  Think about it, now they are too busy to write the next \\"Common Sense\\" or \\"Das Kapital.\\" Net benefit for society as a whole! No pesky feminist rabble- rousers stirring up trouble! They are too busy studying French Sexism in 20th century literature because they can find a job doing that! Society and knowledge continues to move forward.  And the managerial jobs required to regulate and manage all this research will increase, albeit at a slower rate than without computers.<br /><br />Problem 2: The Neck-Beards and Education<br /><br />We increase funding for math and science.  We fight the tendency of Google to lure students into thinking smarter than they really are.  We don't let students use calculators, Wolfram-Alpha, and other tools until they build their foundation through good ole fashion pencil and paper. We focus on creating scientists not entrepreneurs. We increase public funding of research institutes. Research institutes will lead to new breakthroughs, benefiting the 1% and society as a whole. Biology, Physics, and other sciences - both theoretical and applied - lead us to new heights in our society. But, we allow kids to pursue the arts if that is their leaning.  Remember, now that we've freed up some of the wealth being generated by the machines, and we have all this new wealth from math and science, we have even more money to focus on the arts, so now little suzy can get a job as an art historian.<br /><br />Problem 3: The Majority of College Educated<br /><br />Most just go to college to get a job. There is nothing wrong with this.  There is no higher calling than raising a family and being a productive citizen, particularly a citizen in a republic like the United States. Well, there should be more jobs for these folks too. If the wealth tied up by the 1% is being redistributed, and research, public works, and other activities increase - those folks need more stuff. So good old USA consumption should increase.  So jobs should increase for the rest of the population, albeit at a slower rate due to computers.  Also, the artists and neck-beards will be too busy doing what it is they do to want to manage the day to day paperwork.  Sure computers will still be doing most of it, but there will be some jobs needed for those tasks.  And increased demand for middle management might have to force Starbucks to pay more for lower managerial positions, where he/she might actually be able to afford a family.<br /><br />Problem 4: The Masses<br /><br />This is a sticky one.  Public works?  Creating jobs that benefit society as a whole?  We must figure something out, and fast.  History shows us over and over again what happens when the masses have too much time on their hands, and it ain't pretty.  All it takes is one demagogue and we can kiss our upper middle-class butt goodbye. And that goes for MIT college professors and the 1% too.  When the cork blows, it hurts us all.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />There is one problem: the wealth being generated from technology is increasingly being tied up by the 1%.  The solution is equally simple: free that wealth up to invest in society so that we all productively enjoy the benefits this technology is producing.<br /><br />The book, though well written, left me frustrated in the end.  Rather than tackling the problems rationally, using data, like the first half of the book, the authors take refuge in the conservative party line and take the easy way out through restating popular beliefs repeated in business-school as a mantra rather than sound research on the problems facing us. The simple reality is that there is less and less need for the 40 hour a week employee. The manager, semi-educated employee, and even the educated knowledge worker, are increasingly finding no place for themselves in this world. So we have a choice: leave em unemployed and let the 1% keep their savings and get richer, or free-up that 1% and reinvent work and society as a whole.<br /><br />IMHO this book didn't attempt to address the real issue and instead skirted it and lapsed into a \\"fox-news\\" style solution. Maybe my ideas in this diatribe are equally unrealistic, but gosh darn it, at least try addressing the issues head on. I'm willing to change my beliefs as a result of a good book's analysis. As Ross Perot once said, \\"I'm all ears.\\" We are on the verge of a either a new golden-age or a new dark-age in the United States, what path will we choose?labor markets by resisting efforts to regulate firing and hiring.<br /><br />and one of the pernicious quotes:<br /><br />Eliminate or reduce the massive home mortgage subsidy...While home ownership has many laudable benefits, it likely reduces labor mobility and economic flexibility, which conflicts with the economy's increased need for flexibility.<br /><br />----<br /><br />But isn't there an alternative?

B009K0P10K|4.0|Fun, crazy manipulative behavior that has consequences.  Fast paced and goal driven. A great watch to relax and be amazed at quirky behavior in family members.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|5 stars for keeping my attention for 18+ years. The author has done a great job bringing this tale to an end while retaining the integrity and detail in honor of the Jordon legacy.
B006WT2TZC|4.0|If your a huge scorpions fan i would say if their is any chance you might enjoy a track or 2 on here you might want to pick it up. Overall its impressive(for remake cd) i like a few of the remakes and redone songs alot certainly not all of them but enough to make me like it.  So if your a huge scorpions fan then id say this is a must have to complete your collection  if your not listen to the demos before purchasing is the best advice i can give.
B0010X745K|4.0|I usually donj't watch this sort of thing,  but decided to look in on the genre  with a dozen or two dozen films. So, I am not writing for the devotee.<br />My  main criticism was in the length. First, the key location is a supermarket in which numerous people were trapped by the monsters coming in with \\"The Mist\\" which blanketed their small town and its environs. Here the usual representative types try to understand what is going on, arrive at solutions, act on solutions, and manifest their fears in various ways. We have a good assortment of types necessary to play out the various responses that, with some variation in each case, are the staples of thrillers of this particular type. Without doubt the filmmakers had a number of points they wanted to make,  I just found  the talk too prolonged, although the main antagonist to whatever the creators thought was rational (The Voice of God Lady) made a substantial contribution to the drama,  it could have been less insistent and much briefer. I'm afraid that I wanted less talk and more action.<br />With that qualification, I thought the film a decent  rendering of the ancient plot, with the monsters being satisfactory, if not particularly awesome most of the time. Needless to say, there had to be a few types of attackers who were a bit disgusting to the average person.<br />No particular ending was forced by the logic of the plot which preceded it. The choice was a random one (if you take the attitude that a film is a film and a book is a book, faithfulness to which is not the mandate of a filmmaker). I saw no reason, save personal taste, to dictate the ending chosen. I didn't much like it, so, given the absence of a logical necessity for it, I  put in my own ending (in my mind, of course) as a substitute. You are perfectly free to do the same if you  prefer<br />All in all, for someone who customarily does not view such films, this falls into the decent category, suitable for recommending to the average viewer, but notwith the urgency of \\"don't miss it\\". If you miss it, many other movies could substitute adequately from an entertainment viewpoint.  I knew none of the actors so cannot comment on their performances here compared to elsewhere. Seems to me they did a good job playing the roles as assigned.
B008MM9630|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this game and would spend all day on it if I let her :) Highly recommended game for girls of all ages.. She loves the planting and her character.She said it reminds her a lot of Farmville but she likes it way better.Great game all around.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|This why Blu-ray rocks. I certainly can't imagine getting as excited as I did when I received this box set in the mall, say if I had just just downloaded.  The box set is beautifully presented, the book is gorgeous, soundtrack is fantastic with two bonus tracks. The transfer on Blu-ray is amazing, I recently saw it projected in 4K and I must say the Blu-ray holds up fantastically. The extras are fabulous including a full disc that didn't come with the DVD version. This  is something I will treasure, I am so happy that I didn't buy this movie as a digital download or version stored in the cloud, which at this time are far inferior. Physical media rocks as long as we look after it,  It will last a lifetime & mine and don't have rely on your Internet connection.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The story between the two lead actors are amazing and I enjoy so much thank for keeping me interested in the show every week.
B00A83075M|5.0|LOVE this movie!<br />great for families- kids and adults alike, great as a date night movie, just fun for all!<br />Very humorous and exciting
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's just like any other time game. In this one you are given quests by your friends (Merlin, dori, etc) to grow plants. Low levels plants take less time to grow and give less algae and coins while higher leveled plants it takes longer and you get more. Nothing really special besides the fact they aren't spamming you messages of &quot;great deals&quot; that will help you progress through the game. I might play it for a bit longer and then delete it.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Okay so this didn't really bring out any internal teenage girl, but it was free so I tried it. It was a lot less teen angst ish than I expected. I actually spent a great deal of time laughing. This is a funny show with some.
0553103547|1.0|These books are shamelessly derivative of every great fantasy series out there. Martin's sole originality is the degree of explicit depravity he will employ and seems to enjoy so much.  Seldom have I ever read a more self-indulgent author.  He does create some compelling characters, then he kills them.  Clearly besotted with his own prose, Martin will use a thousand words where a dozen well crafted words from a better writer would suffice.<br /><br />Reasons not to read these books -<br /><br />1) You don't enjoy sexually explicit and depraved scenes involving children.<br /><br />2) You don't want to have to skip over pages of pointless descriptions and digressions desperately trying to find some actual advancing of the plot line.<br /><br />3) You don't want to wait 7 chapters for the exciting bit of plot line you finally found to get picked up again.<br /><br />4) You do enjoy an author who doesn't seem to be getting paid by the page.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|would not buy the movie. Rental was just to take a look. Boarder line far-fetched. It is a typical QT film
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I have been watching this show from the beginning and it still kepts me on my toes every time. This is a show of mistery and creative thinking wondering what is going to happend next. Each charatcher is interesting in their own way. thank you for giving something to jump start me day.
B009R659L8|3.0|I have always loved Mary Higgins Clarks' books, but this one (for me) was confusing.  There were so many characters to keep track of.  Sometimes I would have to go back to see what specific character she was talking about.

B005H9B2CE|4.0|I liked it but it had too much hero whorship, It needed more kickass going on, but I still liked it.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|tows the line of conventional, feel-good Hollywood rom-com, albeit dressed up in just enough art-house quirk to make it feel like something slightly basic.

B00CLH1PHM|5.0|A two-bit actor, Terry Sparkes, settles down inside his shabby London flat to watch the Holywood Oscar ceremony live on cable TV. He's a born loser, a Walter Mitty type who both admires and resents the main Oscar nominee, Sir Michael Brookes, an internationally acclaimed film star he remembers meeting decades ago as an amateur actor. The story of the men's parallel, yet diverse lives is revealed in a series of flash-backs in which Sparkes is seen struggling to find his real self from behind a variety of roles, most of them dysfunctional.<br />Duncan Whitehead in his entertaining new short story, An Actor's Life, explores the fickle and shallow life of tinsel-town; the undignified jostling for public recognition amongst media mediocrities and the elusiveness of success in a world in which it is accepted that dog eats dog.<br />The lively pace of the story is achieved by the use of realistic detail, contrast (Sparkes sitting naked under his dressing-gown, avidly watching Sir Michael Brookes in full evening dress receiving his honours from Tom Cruise) and Duncan Whitehead's unique brand of humour, which allows him to include his own cameo appearance to promote his excellent debut novel 'The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club'.<br />Sparkes's journey towards final closure is both physical and moral and the story ends with a supreme irony. The reader is left with the impression that not only has Duncan Whitehead a wicked sense of fun, but that he also possesses a strong sense of justice and retribution.<br />A thought-provoking and satisfying read! I fully recommend it.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Doesn't follow the book.  However, both the book and the movie are good stories.  As is usually the case the book carries much more depth and emotion to the story.
B00AZRBLHO|2.0|The book has some good information. But the story is drawn out and way too slow. Good thing it was a free download.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|the movie was too nerdie, a brain drain. you need a rubber room to watch it from. Couldn't compete with the<br />flashing video.
B008Y73940|5.0|Loved this movie. Totally unexpected as I saw the title and expected it to be about Presidenr Lincoln.  Must watch great story.
B001NI24OI|3.0|I watched the movie after LOVING the FNL tv series, and I must say that I was underwhelmed by the characters in the movie after following the series. Be sure to watch the movie first, or else you run the risk of being disappointed.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|If I hadn't seen the movie - I would not have had a clue what this book was all about - the langauge of most of the characters is very phonetic - and atempts to mimic dialects of various periods - and as a result is very difficult to decipher. Also - there are only a few places where the book and movie coincide - and I can see why - most of the time the storyline of the book is totally lost - so they had to do something to make the movie interesting. The only reason I am still reading it and trying to figure it out is to gain some possible insights into the underlying story of the movie. This is one of the few cases where I can say that the movie was way better than the book - still haven't figured out how they got from point A to point B (from the book to the movie).
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|The action and minor plot twists would make this movie worthwhile. The cast and acting vest the viewer in the plot.  The underlying question is pretty disturbing, if you are dealing with a really ruthless bad guy who is willing to do pretty much anything to get ahead how do you stop him  We have all heard the story of a small town run my one &#34;relly bad guy&#34;, but this really happened in the small town of Los Angeles.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|What else can you say, It's David Bowie. I love David Bowie, album has some odd songs but some very catchy ones too. Have found myself listening to it a lot. He's still got it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found all three books very interesting. I have never read anything like them before. I would definitely recommend all of them to all my friends.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This series  started off pretty good, but got worse with every book and mocking jay was by far the worst. i might have liked it more if I was a 12 year old girl though...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'd say this book reminds me a lot of The Partner. The last few books I'd read from Grisham seemed long, slow and flat at the end. I hadn't read one of his books for a while, and saw this one. I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I loved The Partner so equating it with that is high praise!<br /><br />Kept me interested and enjoyed watching events unfold.
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|the story line is topical...the actors are believable; and the writing is superb;<br />I never tire of it and have several episodes that I have seen numerous times and still get something more from them.
B0035JLVWY|5.0|This movie was very suspenseful and full of twists, with the greatest ending ever!  The actors played their parts superbly.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! The locations and places are as if you were watching the whole thing unfold in front of you, extremely realistic!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The  advancement of Castle and Kate's  relationship has been a joy to watch.  Also seeing Castle's daughter mature before your very eyes has been an exciting journey.  The writer has done a great job!  Looking forward to Season 6!
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|After the release of my own book, &#34;A Personal Message From God,&#34; a friend recommended that I read this book as it has some similarities to my own experience. Betty was truly blessed by her experience, and I am grateful that she shared it with us. I recommend this book to anyone that has ever doubted the existence of God or heaven, but especially to those who believe because she gives us a comforting vision of heaven and our Heavenly Father.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I bought this because I love these bands and also because of the reviews this received. When we first played it (eight friends) we were all absolutely blown away. I've purchased many live DVD concerts from Amazon but this ranks as one of the best. You will not be dissappointed by this purchase - excellent musicians and a great concert!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I cant wait for the movie of book two to come out this year!! I think it's called Girl on Fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched all three seasons in one week. I fell in love with the family and staff. I loved the story the clothes it was great. the acting was very good as well.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I was so happy when this movie became available.  I had done a lot of research on the Holocaust (Shoah), and this time I really had a better understanding of what was happening.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|To keep one interested for 10 season is a tribute to the stars and writers of the series.  Having watched all of the CSI adventures prior to watching NCIS pilot, I approached it with great skepticisms, but the cast wrapped their personality around their character with great skill.  The tension between characters along with a strong line of humor has made this a weekly appearance at out home.  Looking forward to Season 11.

We also see James<br />Rhodes/Iron Patriot ( Don Cheadle) who helps Tony out in his time of<br />crises. Not only is Tony facing the anxiety of keeping Pepper<br />Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) safe, but also learns that it's the man that<br />makes the suit.<br /><br />I love the special effects in this flick. The suits get better and<br />better. The way they move, attach, fight and look is wonderful. Robert<br />Downey Jr. continues his character development as Tony Stark and I love<br />every minute he's on screen. Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic. She's not<br />just a damsel in distress. She saves Tony two different times and has a<br />likable, lovable personality. The story is very engaging and the dialog<br />is great. The one thing I don't like is the intellectual twist. I have<br />mixed feelings about the turn of events in this film. My inner die-<br />hard, comic book-loving side is disappointed, but my film critic side<br />sees it as genius.<br /><br />My favorite character is Harley (Ty Simpkins), a boy who befriends Tony<br />and helps repair the Iron Man suit. Harley is bright, independent and a<br />little too much like Tony. When you put the two together, you get<br />non-stop laughter.<br /><br />The moral of the story is: it's not the suit that makes the man, it's<br />the man that makes the suit. Tony can't sleep because he gets<br />nightmares, so he spends all his time at night making more suits to<br />protect himself and Pepper. The truth is, he saves Pepper without the<br />suit.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the final battle. The action is larger-than-life.<br />The different suits, the way they fight, make you want to cheer.

B0091UGEVY|4.0|I am not usually a Julia Roberts fan but this moive was not what I expected. She is funny all while playing the evil stepmother. There is loves of humor and action and we really ejoyed it as much as the kids did. It is not just another love story!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season is so much better than last.they are getting back to basics. But with attitude. I usually wait till it comes to video because I like being able to watch without commercials and don't like waiting a week for the next episode. This year sounded so good I couldn't wait. There is a lot of attitude from both Dean and Sam. I wish they could find a way to bring back Bobby and Ellen. It is definitely worth the extra money to no wait for video.

095719773X|5.0|YOU CAN BANK ON `BANKS ON SENTENCE'.<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're involved professionally in the UK's criminal justice system, whether judge or advocate, `Banks on Sentence' should be added to your professional library as a priority!  Certainly in our experience the vast majority of criminal barristers, solicitors and judges have been found to be in possession of it.<br /><br />Since the first edition appeared in 2003, `Banks on Sentence' has come to be regarded as the leading text on all matters connected with sentencing, quickly revealing its superiority over traditional texts which were often less than reliable and not entirely up to date.<br /><br />As the modern statement on this difficult subject, `Banks on Sentence' continues to make its appearance in any number of criminal courts; `a welcome feature on every Crown Court Bench,' as Rafferty LJ has said.  Writing in the `Views' section which prefaces the first volume HHJ Jeff Blackett refers to it as  `a simple guide to the most complicated areas of sentencing', well indexed and logically laid out.<br /><br />`One book,' he adds, `which I can always bank on.'  This of course is only one example of the kudos these volumes have deservedly received.<br /><br />As this book is updated annually, it's important that you acquire the new edition, particularly this one with its wealth of new material, and rigorous re-editing, re-organising and re-writing, particularly following the commencement of many of the provisions of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and  Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LAPSO).<br /><br />In addition to the new guidelines from the Sentencing Council, there are paragraphs detailing the position prior to and post-LAPSO where the changes are not yet in force.  Also note that the new edition contains a confiscation chapter about twice as long as that in the seventh edition.<br /><br />We should mention here that the author has suggested that if you have a copy of the old edition, you should retain it, as the new edition refers to old cases in previous editions.<br /><br />For those who prefer electronic media, `Banks' is now available as an eBook across a range of devices via the Thomson Reuters ProView platform and as such, completely replicates the print copy, with cross references and massive index of 6,500 entries.  Additionally, updates are frequently posted on the relevant website and there is a regular `sentencing alert' service on email.<br /><br />To facilitate your further research there are well over 130 pages of tables of cases and statutes in the print edition, followed by a table of rules, plus a detailed index at the back of each volume.<br /><br />In short, this is an authoritative work geared to easy navigation and quick reference - an enormous benefit to practitioners under pressure and, we would say, indispensable for those dealing with criminal justice.  The publication date of the two-volume work is 30 April 2013.thor has suggested that if you have a copy of the old edition, you should retain it, as the new edition refers to old cases in previous editions.<br /><br />For those who prefer electronic media, `Banks' is now available as an eBook across a range of devices via the Thomson Reuters ProView platform and as such, completely replicates the print copy, with cross references and massive index of 6,500 entries.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|After hugely enjoying book one I was very much looking forward to book two and was bitterly disappointed to find myself wondering if Mr Follet was being paid per thousand words and wanted to earn as much as he could and was making a determined bid for the worst fictional sex award.
0812993292|5.0|This book will stay with you long after you put it back on the shelf. It's a story about redemption, love, friendship, and a whole host of other things.

This book offers a genuine series of useful tips for paralegals and admin support which, for many at the start of their careers, will be the sort of advice which only really comes with maturity and experience so you are one ahead with this book.<br /><br />`Legal Gold' is structured in much the same way as some of the seminars we attended many years ago with plenty of lists of things to do and humorous vignettes of what we can encounter as lawyers in our professional lives ( a nice human touch throughout with the stories!).<br /><br />Of course, the suggestions are not for everyone What Caroline offers here is a straightforward set of common sense proposals which are well worth reading through and, in some cases, implementing for your own practice and career.<br /><br />There are quite a large number of books available for lawyers covering `life coaching' these days- a subject area which does interest some, and also worries others.  It's worth going into this area with an open mind because `Legal Gold' offers a different approach to the vexed question of how to succeed without really trying.... although the reality is you always have to try very hard, but make sure you think about what you are doing.<br /><br />Let's be clear that it is not about luck but about being organized and reflective that makes success for many people. Ability and connections help plus the usual marketing devices we use at the moment to seek and retain business as the Economy and IT practices change in this decade.<br /><br />It's an engaging book which tells some home truths and makes one aware, as a lawyer or support staff, of just how much progress has been made in recent years on the use of marketing tools.<br /><br />We suspect that many readers will find this book compliments and confirms much of what they think either consciously or sub-consciously about the direction their professional lives take.<br /><br />Thank you, Caroline, for confirming our suspicions about the difficulties of servicing the legal profession which you have made so much easier for us with your explanations and anecdotal tips: it's a book you should read from cover to cover to reinforce what you already know but have probably forgotten over the years.cess for many people.

0525478817|5.0|I wouldn't have chosen this YA book for myself but I read it for a book club. To a woman we all loved this novel and recommend it for all ages. The characters are smart and brave, the dialog is intelligent and real, and the story moves along and brings you with it. This book got quite a bit of hype and made many &#34;Best&#34; lists, and it lives up to the hype.
B003QSMC18|4.0|I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie but I was babysitting and my litte charge wanted to see it. I love animation but more of the Miyazaki type (e.g. Spirited Away).  Well, this was a very nice surprise. I enjoyed the twist from the original story, the music was excellent, and of course, being Disney the animation was also delightful. Enjoy!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|At times, I will watch a movie without any idea what it is, who is in it, or what it is about. I stumbled upon this movie and I am shocked at the depth and quality of the film. Wow...it is rare to find a good combination of actors, screenplay, direction and videography, and this movie had it all.  Give the movie time...it is worth the wait.
1577314808|5.0|Remarkably refreshing contemporary reading on presence, in mostly understandable (and his own) language that doesn't require much previous preparation in terms of familiarity with esoteric systems/teachings. With a heavy leaning towards and parallels with Bhuddism, usiing a lot of quotes from various teachings, Christian, Bhuddist, etc., the author manages mostly to point to the way to get in to the moment. He is particularly successful in describing the various ways our own thoughts, and ego block the very possibility to get  closer to inner self. It is self-help though as he is not proclaiming to be a teacher, and has no such organization/set up, although he is very popular, and offers products through his website. It is a start therefore, and for the reader who wants to seriously go further on this path, (re) orientation on the various paths and options given for those by groups, schools, institutes, etc., is a necessary but not an easy task.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|The syntax and language style of Robert Jordan was recreated in this final text, more like his earlier texts in this series.  Where as the latter text showed a slightly more mature approach.  Sanderson's style in his first text in the series (Book 12) was slightly clunky as he took up the challenge of completing Jordan's work, as he admitted in the forward - a difficult challenge.  The thirteenth book was an excellent read with the mature style of Jordan and the fresh approach of Sanderson.  However, the fourteenth book seems to be all (early) Jordan in style.<br />The thirteenth book has some distracting details which do not prepare the reader for the conclusion in this final book.  Thank goodness.  Congratulations to all involved and especially Brandon Sanderson.  The final book was well worth the wait.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|Great fun!  Some good plot twists, though the ending was a bit of a disappointment -- too much of a stretch.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A must see if you're a fan of Firefly, but it is also a stand-alone movie. The characters are so real, and flawed, and heroic, and sometimes just plain funny. I could watch this movie over and over again. Some scenes take my breath away. It's less sci-fi/fantasy and more a story of people set in another time.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This movie was just kind of adorable. Having played the original video games (Pong was a big deal back in the stone age) I could not resist checking this out and I wasn't disappointed with this homage to the old guys.

B008BU75IQ|1.0|This book has nothing to offer. The plot lines in this book have all been done before by Archer and are bland and predictable (like the whole book). This book reads like an infomercial for Archer, his life and his other books. Do we really have to hear about prison diaries again?
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I bought this movie because they sold it online before it was available in stores.the movie is quite good ad well.the combination of retro and modern game titles works for every generation.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I found Ms. Parker to be a writer that lays her life out in a most captivating and concise manner.  Even though she had a difficult life in regard to both parents, I found it amazing that she grew and flourished in spite of them.  Her mother is an amazing actress and it makes me sad that she prevented Sachi the opportunity to follow in her footsteps.  This book never dragged as some do but moved along quickly and kept your attention.  Now that Ms. Parker has completed a cleansing therapy in the writing of this book, she may really enjoy the rest of her life.  I say sell the diamond necklace when the price of diamonds are high, it is only a painful reminder of being pushed out of the nest in a cruel manner.
B0093X805W|5.0|We have an eight and five year old son and daughter. It was the highlight of every evening! Very enjoyable for Mom & Dad too.
0312944098|5.0|What a wonderful read. I second everything Tom S. wrote.  The story was great. I don't see where anything could have been improved....unless there was a wedding of Big Al to...... You will enjoy the read. I especially enjoyed the court battle.  I was thinking, how is Mr. Archer going to get this guy free?  Then I had a flash of Perry Mason(oldie but goodie) and I knew they would win.  Such a good read.  This is one I will read again and enjoy just as much.<br />  Thank you Mr. Archer.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|The movie was entertaining and everything one would expect from a tv to big screen production. Kudos Keep up the good work. Party on. Am I to twenty words yet?
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie is well worth your time.  The acting is excellent and although the story is  manipulated for drama it brings history alive.
B0013ND30M|5.0|My little one loves Princess Aurora!!! Great movie. You can never go wrong with a great Disney Classic. Beautifully remastered.
B00425S1H8|1.0|Works okay with a mac, but forget it if you want to run with W7 x64.  Says it has Prolific chip, but when you run the Prolific app to test which chipset it has, it says it doesn't see the chipset.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I'm stunned this show was cancelled. I happened upon it as I was grieving the loss of Downton Abbey until the next season. I love Downton Abbey and after watching 3 seasons so far of Lark Rise I can honestly say I love this series more. The acting is outstanding by ALL the characters. Hard to choose a favorite person. Downton's Mr. Bates plays the lead male role as the father of the main Lark Rise family. There are no words to describe the &#34;feel&#34; of this show. Its a more gentle loving feel than Downton yet the stories are engaging, interesting and have twists and turns you wouldn't expect. In all my 55 years of TV watching I can truly say this is my favorite show of all time. I cant understand for the life of me why this series would have been cancelled. Insane decision on somebodys part. I will be buying the entire series. There are life lessons in this work that should be kept in mind all our days.<br />wonderful show.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I absolutely love the Downton Abbey series. Season 2 was just as exciting as Season 1 and I watched each episode twice while waiting for Season 3 to arrive.  Don't hesitate to buy!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game little easier to play on my kindle then my iphone slides a litter more easy then on apple products
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|What can you say?  You are already hooked on the character and can't wait for more, right? , Here it is and boy is it evolving.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Love the fact that this is something I can put on and both me and my daughter enjoy listening to it in the car!
B009R659L8|5.0|Another hit from an author who never disappoints. I did not want to put this down. I love the way Higgins Clark tells her story : fast yet filled with plot twists, romantic yet tasteful and her characters can be quirky yet believable.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Is there a second game to this? The best game ever. I just like the way it was put together I guess. I am seven-years-old. From Cloey. Bye.
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|I'm not sure if it's as good as Part I  I need to listen to it more but I do like it and would suggest buying it if you have Part I
B002RI9HUM|1.0|Read about a quarter never seem to go anywhere.<br />Not interested in a book that spends time in a rehab centre.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|awesome awesome book!!!! the movie doesn't even come close to how great the book is!! Buy a copy and trust me you won't be able to put it down
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This film was like the old cliff hangers in the movies of past. Some parts got a little repetitious, but didn't detract from the overall excitement of the film. The filming in New Zealand was a great choice, as the scenery was awesome. The characters were all great!!
B004P12SSW|5.0|have watched this again and again! the music is great. daughter watched it at 32 years old and now she walks around the house singing and dancing.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game has a relaxed pace and a good twist on the standard match 3 concept. The game play is fluid and pleasant. Highly recommended!
B00BZODDYU|3.0|it  doesnt show enough of  the  actually  Mama ,Action parts got cut way to much and also boring !would not buy it again
0385349831|5.0|The subject matter are questions we have all thought at some point for most of us. Paulo Coelho answers the questions so eloquently and makes the dialogue so interesting while simple to follow.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a lot of fun.  Great graphics, interesting storyline.  There were a couple of areas where I had no idea where to go, so the hint button was handy.  The monkey is adorable.  :-)
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I like the shows where they use the tranpoline effects, and this was no exception.  Some of the stunts and water scenes were great. A fun show to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game for kids and adults.  Hours of fun and daily challenge s keep it interesting.  I also like the updates for changes in locale.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This variation of Star Trek was the best one since the original in the 1960's.  I think by the time that this series was on, people were saturated with Star Trek.  Otherwise, I feel that this series would have lasted longer than 4 seasons.  Anyway, I am thoroughly enjoying revisiting this series.  The acting is great and the cast works very well together.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This series is well written and very enjoyable. Definitely worth watching, especially if you love Sherlock Holmes.  Jonny Lee Miller is superb.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Classic movies...need I say more. If you love James Bond and SNL...and you wondered what would happen if the two of them made a baby...then check out these movies. Which if you haven't at this point you have been frozen for the better bit of a decade...which means you have something in common with the protagonist. So that being said I love gold, sharks with freaking laser beams attached to their heads, MOLE!, the wound smells like almonds, which is not good, and evacuation compete...if you don't get this then you soon will
B000ID3KU6|5.0|The movie was very good. Slow to start but got better in a while. I like to see Fonda has a bad guy.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|So this was partly my fault for not reading close enough, but I was just looking for information on the slow carb diet. Yes, this book has a chapter on the diet, but it's the same information I found just doing a google search. I'm sure there is other helpful information enclosed in this book, but if your looking for specific information pertaining to slow carb like I was - google it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|love to play but it doesn't let me create a new game or find a facebook friend to play with! I. play on kindle fire. I don't have options for categories of words which I'd love to have! how do I get that??
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game that can keep you interested with the changing boards and mini goals. My family competes across the board. It is great that you do not have to spend money to play.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Read this series with my reluctant reader, Andrew. He is 13 and doesn't like to read at all. I found these and made a race to see who could finish reading all 5 books faster. It worked!  These kept him reading and I enjoyed them, also.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Wasn't expecting this movie to be this good. It has an old man who lives in his old ways...with some racist slurs I never even heard before make a change. It is worth watching in a very very political correct but turned blind eye world
B005DJREJS|4.0|This show actually deals with some pretty heavy topics in the life of a high schooler in a not-too-serious so that kids won't mock the message as though it were an after school special.  As an adult who loved MTV's My So-Called Life in the 90's I gave this show a try via my Prime Instant Videos since it is another MTV scripted drama series told from the point of view of the main character who like Angela Chase (of M.S.C.L.) finds herself, the not popular girl, lusting after the popular guy.  While this show doesn't create the angst I experienced with the elusive Jordan Catalano it was enjoyable in a much more light-hearted sort of way.  After all Jenna, Awkward's heroine does love butterflies as opposed to Angela who like any respectable 90's alternative girl wore flannel and Docs and died her hair eggplant red, also Awkward's secondary characters are often made out to seem more like caricatures than actual people, hence the quirkiness.  I do love that both series are narrated throughout by the female leads.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books never disappoint. I just purchased the third book and i cant wait to get started. I love Christian grey
B00A85EMVK|5.0|This Movie is my all time favorite and it is just as awesome in 3d as it was every other time I have seen it. I have seen this movie on the bid screen and I own it on VHS, DVD, Blueray DVD and now in 3D, oh yeah and I own the Soundtrack.
B005DJREJS|3.0|I thought it was clever and funny. It was well written and kept my attention. I stopped watching it though after a fiew episodes because it was just too much about sex. The subject matter was always about sex over and over and over again. It got boring way too fast.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|This is my personal favorite of the entire Twilight series.  I am a big fan of these movies and I own all five.
1400052181|5.0|This was an excellent read for the book club that I'm in.  The pain and suffering that Henrietta experience in the name of science was mind boggling.  Medical ethics or the lack of has come into question to this day still.  I totally recommend this book to be read in high schools and colleges so that discussions can happen.  Rebecca Skloot did an &#34;excellent job&#34; in not only writing this book but also helping the family members try to understand exactly what happened to their family member.
0385535147|4.0|This one is not as spellbinding as several of the previous novels, but it was another good one! I'll be eagerly awaiting the next one.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|Great choice for movie night with my small grandsons!  I love the convenience and will use this system again. Thanks
B00BF123WG|4.0|Very Intense! A little slow at first but it was interesting to see how long it takes to get good intel.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love the fact it has different levels not just one.  ONCE I FINISH BEGINNERS LEVEL I can switch to a harder level.  This means more time to play. It is worth the money because I can play it more than once. I would buy another l I or this.  Good fun.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Tangled is another \\"feel good\\" animation that didn't disappoint me. I'm a sucker for a fairy tale and the chemistry between Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore was infectious. Lots of laughs and even a few tears. I will definitely watch again.
1452115567|5.0|What a great book! An amazing dog and beautiful photos. Theron Humphrey has created something very special here. I'm glad he decided to share it with the world. I hope he comes back to Atlanta some day so I can meet them both.
B003NB8KE6|4.0|I'm 5'7&#34; but with thicker legs, so the the medium is the right size and I'm pretty sure I should / could have gotten the medium short, but didn't.  The compression isn't as tight as it could be, but for overnight recovery after my long triathlon training days, these are great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I downloaded this game for my sons to play, and they love it! But I ended up playing it just as much as they do, and yelling out: \\"It's my turn!\\" just as loud.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was very useful. I found it easy to use and recommend it. It is the best. Love it, love it!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can try own a horse so this is great.  Even my kids love this game. They can help me take care of as horse now. How fun
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|this is a must it really good  love it watch it with my family  two times already  good buy it
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this game is loads of fun but it does get difficult if you don't buy credits but it is winnable
B0054SMID0|4.0|it always had me guessing what was going to happen next and was surprised with the ending results, that's all.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I don,t care what the critics say, I like the action, of course I am ex-military the Aliens were different, it was great, got my vote.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|this is a fantastic CD-every single song is a hit.<br />Better than I anticipated!! If you are looking for an upbeat great music, buy this CD
B004J4WLB4|3.0|An old fashioned novel that takes on large issues; abandonment of a child, learning trust and love when none is given and forgiving  yourself and others.  I found parts of it a little slow.  Although I  thought it was well written throughout, at times I felt Victoria was making a habit of getting in her own way and that was frustrating to me.  The message of the flowers was unique and interesting.  A worthwhile read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Can't stop playing. I love the strategy. Reminds me of the old school Sims before it got boring. I highly recommend this game.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I have not missed and episode of the this amazing show.  I have very little time to watch anything, but when I do get some time, I make sure to watch the latest episode of Arrow.  Great comic book fun, but gritty as well.  Do yourself a favor.  Watch the first episode and you will be hooked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great story, fast read, I flew through the entire trilogy, highly recommend all the books, great for ages 15-50, fun reads
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What can I say, This movie was great, the story line was great, the action was great, Christian Bale, I think is the best Batman ever.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|it a pretty nice little program. simple and easy to use. works well on my droid razr maxx. I would recommend this program for ease of use
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Each episode was like getting up in the morning at home....well....kind of!  Could not wait to see what the day would bring.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|I was perusing the new releases and found this-am I glad! I like intelligent music. It is a solid release by Elena Tonra, the impetus behind Daughter. I initially gave “If You Leave” 4 stars; but, it gets better every time I listen to it so 5 stars.<br />Daughter reminds me of The Cocteau Twins, M83, and Cat Power. Some people compare Tonra to Enya and Bjork. Even so, Daughter's sound has a feel of familiarity without being derivative.<br />The lyrics deal with misery but they are offset by the music. A few times the lyrics are saved by the music as in Youth.<br />Best songs – Winter, Smother, Human.<br />This is the kind of release which sounds fresh each time you listen.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Will watch it again for sure to see what I missed.  Absolutely loved this movie.  Ang Lee is a master.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the capitol is upset with Katniss's stunt to win Hunger Games with Peeta and they will do whatever it takes to bring her down
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|I thought it was very good, I am a fan of Russell Crowe and Nancy Liu and like marital art movies, The movie arrived in good condition, I was very pleased.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|This is an enjoyable series to watch. There's a new plot in each episode and the action moves quickly. Well acted, well written, and well directed.
B000PHNHMQ|3.0|I like Makita products but am slightly disappointed with this gun. It feels very solid and is quite heavy which I like.  Unfortunately, the depth control for the nail set sucks.  Even at full nail set, if nailing on curved moldings the nail often is not fully set which means I have to go back and punch them in.. Sigh.  I miss my old porter cable, but that company has even more gone down the tubes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows ever!  Very well written with great characters.  Can't wait for Season 4!  I love it!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This app is a vast improvement over stock keyboards. Split thumb setting is helpful and learning predictive text is niceas well.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Another great book by David Sedaris, full of fun and laughter, would recommend and will reread, short stories make it easy to come back to
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Game of Thrones is my favorite show on television, so I figured I'd buy the blu-ray. I'm incredibly impressed  with the quality. I could be imagining it, but it looks better than it did when I watched it live on HBO HD. The blu ray purchase came with Amazon streaming of it, which looks just as good as it does on HBO Go. I've also had less problems using Amazon streaming than HBO Go streaming. More consistent quality, less bufferin, etc.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie.  Manhattan, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Crimes and Misdemeanours...all Woody Allen classics.  But there was just something about this movie that stopped me from giving five stars.  Maybe the predictability of the script, the cliches, the fact that Woody Allen isn't it, the fact that it isn't filmed in Manhattan.
0345528581|5.0|I really like this book.  I have had it six months now with great results. I just turned 40 and had slowly been gaining weight for a couple of years.  Previously, I started doing some cardio training but was just maintaining my weight and getting very bored while doing cardio. Upon getting this book, and following the simple weight training type exercises, I have lost about 20 LBS and am feeling much more confident about my fitness. Some of the previous reviewers have complained about how up to date the nutrition section is. I think these complaints are trivial as it seems the science on nutrition changes on a year by year basis anyway. I have mildly taken heed of the nutritional advice and am very happy with the results.  There is a great phone app available for about $2 which compliments the workouts in the book immensely. This a a good and simple work out book which I highly recommend.
B007WPLZAK|2.0|I really, really wanted to love this as Eddie Redmayne is one of my favorite actors and I love period pieces. I found the story fell flat and couldn't wait for it to end.  Also, the PG rating is NOT accurate! My 13 year old daughter was watching it with me and what I thought was going to be a touching love scene quickly turned into a hurried attempt to cover her eyes lol.<br />I just think this movie could have been so much more and I quickly tired of seeing the main character cry.
B000C20VRS|5.0|Bought this on the 30th of last month. Watched it the other night. After it was over, I was speechless with a smile on my face. This movie is so awesome,  u'll wanna watch it again & again. Do I highly recommand this to those who's interested? YES!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|great ending to a great story, fast paced and action packed - Peter is rescued from the capitol, but he's dangerous
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author, like many scientists, was a skeptic, prior to his own personal experience with heaven.  It was an interesting read to see how he dealt with trying to rationalize what happened and also trying to convince those friends in his scientific community that he didn't just imagine something.<br /><br />For those of us who were taught to believe in God and to think rationally, this is a refreshing book that states you don't have to choose one or the other.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|I've been waiting years to watch this, and I was not disappointed even with such a long wait. I'm not much of a Nicolas Cage fan, but this movie is one of the best ever. I'm a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, since I've watched many of his movies and never been disappointed. It's not the best Angelina Jolie movie, but it's definitely one of the best action movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend to any who like action movies with story lines.
B002CIY8EM|4.0|I have found the ancient astronaut theory very intriguing, the Godfather of it all Erich von daniken had the courage to ask questions so long ago.  This book written nearly 50 years ago is a sort of history lesson, I found it fascinating as a father in my mid 30`s to read from the past perspective with the predictions of the future we are living today, and ponder the advance my 3 year old daughter and 8 day old son will get to be a part of.  This book will not give you the big reveal but it will leave you asking questions and it is easy to see why so many people credit von daniken for his courage to ask questions.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|re-watched the first and second iron man movies in preparation for the the new one. I was reminded how cool they are.  Tony Stark, is a unique character and played so well by Robery Downey Jr.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The writing in this book pretty bad. But I enjoyed this book, it was addictive and I couldn't put it down until a finished reading it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first before reading and i love the book more i cant wait to start on the next book
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A complex story about alcohol abuse intertwined with a man's dream occupation and how the two collide in an emergency.
B00519YRH2|4.0|I have no complaints. It was interesting and mostly clean. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good film for family movie night.
034580404X|5.0|I could not stop reading these books. Christian is the reason some women become submissive! Well written, and though at times the plot was a bit predictable, it was still hooked, and can only hope for more frmo Christian and Anna.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Nothing like a bunch of little people running thru your tv to make it a happy night. well besides Bridget the midget.Besides that it was whimsical and kept us laughing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is just soooooooooooooooooooooo fun I love Mr.Cuddles :) and the profit bird (ha ha) and I just bought a new suit!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|If this was required reading, sixth grade students wouldn't struggle so hard to get through the history of Greece and Rome.  This makes studying these empires so much more exciting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. My best friend showed me this recently and im so glad she did. I have been on it non stop since then. Also, I love competing with my brothers.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I was very entertained with the story. i think Disney did a great job brining the book to life. I only wish there was a sequel.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|I recommended this book to my book club.  It provides a lot of examples and is very interesting if you have kids who played sports, or if you played sports yourself.  When I can't hit the golf ball so it goes anywhere I think, I've only done this 7,200 times; I have 2800 to go before I can expect to be at all good.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|what more can I say, didnt make the big screan but did make it to my house, I was supposed to get a free movie from Amazon because of bad DL speeds on the last rental. didnt happen, keep this in mind when dealing with customer service.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun!!!!!!!!!! :) and it's so awesome when it updates to Tokyo!! and Sydney Australia!! and I really wanted Kim in the Australian special!!
030759565X|5.0|I follow her blog and this cookbook is everything I thought it would be! Colorful photos, easy instructions , Unique and delicious recipes.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Awesome game. Love how you run and use the at-at . Way better than the first one . And love how you have teammates.
0446343129|5.0|I READ THE ORIGINAL PRINTING OF THIS BOOK/AUTHOR YEARS AGO AND STILL REMEMBER BEING CAPTIVATED AND COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. HERE MANY YEARS LATER, I HAVE BEEN TELLING MY 44 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ABOUT THE BOOK AND FOUND THIS NEW EDITION WHICH I AM ORDERING FOR HER. EXCELLENT READING ......WELL WRITTEN.
0783226845|5.0|This movie is GREAT and RIVETING from beginning to end. Per casting and the characters are WONDERFUL!! One of Al Pacino's best! Speedy delivery.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I gave this very popular book four out of five stars. I read the first in the series after many friends raved about it, though initially, I did not want to read it. I thought it normalized, even glorified,  domestic abuse. This is my humble opinion of the series, and why I gave it four out of five. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  It was so different from the usual romance, it pulled me in and kept me spell bound. Admittedly the BSMD lifestyle was fascinating to read about. By the end of book one, I was so thoroughly captured by the characters, I immediately downloaded the next two books onto my Kindle. My complaints are these: Ms. James is English and this is clear in her voice. The vocabulary, diction, sentence structure, etc. of the conversations between Christian and Ana were not like two American twenty somethings. That was a minor issue for me. Second; though Christian was always telling Ana how contrary she was and how she stood up to him, I never saw it. Ana never struck me as a tough person. It kind of bothered me that she let him pretty much do what he wanted to her (all the while convincing her and the reader that she wanted it and she had the control) In the real world his actions were characteristic of a classic domestic controller/abuser. It kind of bugged me that Ana would find his controlling behavior amusing. But...didn't stop me from reading the series to the end. I did like how Christian changes, and comes to these changes on his own. Finally, I am waiting, impatiently, for Ms. James next novels!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I RECCOMEND THIS ANTHOLOGY SET TO anyone who ever liked the whole alien saga. blue ray is the way to go if you want the best of the best PICTURE AND SOUND. its well worth the money.  PLUS how the case is setup to hold your movies is really really cool and there is this little booklet in the back of your blue ray set.&#34; MU-TH-UR mode VIEWERS GUIDE &#34; this set is one of a kind you will not be disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|After clearing a lot of other apps off my kindle to load this the opening screen announced that to get the full benefits, I had to be a facebook user. NO THANKS!!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The new version of the app is AWESOME idea that you're not AWESOME for apps go go go go go and go!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This was an evening's pastime.  I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in a theatre, and I'm not sure what all the fuss was about this movie. There was nothing outstanding to recommend this film, neither acting nor filming.  I was disappointed.
B00A4A2N6K|4.0|Nice this one is going to be in heavy rotation. Keep up the good work Nicki. This is fun and rem. Of the crazy that is Ms Minaj.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The reason why I like Subway Surfers is because it is similar to Temple run 1 and 2! I really think it is a cool game! And I also like to play temple run mostly 2.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Tyler, the creator is just getting better at making music. I can't wait until he makes another great and interesting album.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|i like this game but i wish you could buy reveal letter cheaper. we pass this around at work. hope you get more version
B007IXWKUK|5.0|5 star all the way! The trilogy is at least 15 stars. A little humor.This author truly knows how to capture her audience.
B009GEDP26|5.0|They just keep getting better.  I usually get tired of a series by this time and of course not all of the episodes are jewels, but the bulk still holds up and they throw in a surprise that will make you say &#34;Didn't see that coming&#34;.  Truly this show is just fun to watch.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like the game, love the armor, but I wish it was an open environment game like the other gameloft superhero games.. but still very good!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not only is the story itself touching and beautiful beyond words, but the way this story is written makes me think it will be remember for many years to come. John Green does not just fill a blank sheet with words, but paints a frescoe of pain and beauty which makes my soul both dance and cry at the same time. This book stayed with me for a long time after I finished reading it. If you have not read it yet, what are you waiting for?
B002KT3XH6|5.0|This very well-written book keeps the reader turning those Kindle pages as one follows Henry's relationships. It is highly enjoyable reading for any English history buff.

0345349571|5.0|It once seemed like the tern \\"Popular History\\" was invented for the writings of Dr. Barbara Tuchman. It was always spoken by the `proper' academic historians with a sneer. Fully trained historians did not write readable history. Complex events required complex writing and making complex events live for a general reader involved too many compromises to give such a writer unqualified entrance into the Academy of Writers of History.  Given that Dr. Tuchman wrote in a time before the History Channel; before otherwise credible historians wrote themselves personally into events they were not there to witness; and in a time when there was a clear distinction between movies made to be historic documentaries and historic docudramas; one can only wonder if she is allowed posthumous entry into the aforesaid Academy.<br /><br />In A Distance Mirror, The Calamitous 14th Century, Dr. Tuchman wrote a readable history of the events from, roughly the Battle of Poitiers (1356) and ending almost abruptly with the Battle of Agincourt (1415). Roughly because there is a 120 odd page introduction to the author's take on the Middle Ages and to give you a background on Enguerrand VII, Sieur de Coucy.<br />Enguerrand would be sent to England as a hostage where he would marry (at Windsor castle) into King Edward III's family and add to his titles, 1st Earl of Bedford. By his death in 1390 he would serve in several military campaigns, diplomatic missions and otherwise be present for much of what Dr. Tuchman finds interesting in this period.  His life becomes the center of this book.<br /><br />As can be gathered by the title, Dr Tuchman's approaches the Middle Ages as a time of diseases (an entire chapter on the Black Death) and a generalized sense of stagnation. However notice her use of the term \\"Middle Ages\\" and not the term \\"Dark Ages\\". There is much in the way of violent political intrigue, arrange marriage and religious inspired violence. She does not stop at repeating what was by the time of this book becoming an outmoded view of the \\"Dark Ages\\" She goes beyond the stereotypes to identify as ongoing progress in education, technology and culture  Likewise she was early in recounting history as more than events as seen and lived in the castles. Her basic technique is to recount the people, places and events of his Lordship, then to leave him and his retinue while she describes these same people, places and events in a much larger context.<br /><br />A Distant Mirror is a history of its time. It is unfair to judge it in terms of latter scholarship. Dr. Tuchman has as her goal an introduction to a deeper appreciation of a historic period usually reduced to a few paragraphs in a History of the Western World classroom. Her targeted reader is not the student who needs the most exhaustive dissertation drawn from the most exhaustive analysis of up to date historiography. Rather she is writing for an otherwise general reader who wants to know more. Barbara Tuchman excels at achieving this goal. A Distant Mirror is a poor reference if your goal is to be a degreed Medievalist. It is history as a complex AND interesting topic.me of this book becoming an outmoded view of the \\"Dark Ages\\" She goes beyond the stereotypes to identify as ongoing progress in education, technology and culture  Likewise she was early in recounting history as more than events as seen and lived in the castles.

B005DOL0R0|4.0|A cheap and good Fire Cover on all accounts. No issues with it or the smell to be frank. It does a good job of covering up the Kindle and offers some protection with its inner-padding. Also offers good grip when you hold it, even with sweaty palms.<br /><br />The only thing I wish it did, was open all the way so I could read the Kindle while still having it mounted in the cover.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|After producing three albums consecutively which rank among the best ever made ('Rubber Soul', 'Revolver' and 'Sgt. Pepper'), something odd happened to The Beatles in the second half of 1967. Whether it was the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, a sense of their own infallibility, rather too many mind-altering substances or just a plain running out of gas, who knows? Anyway, they set about producing a film for TV based on an idea by Paul McCartney. It was called 'Magical Mystery Tour' and the idea was that The Beatles and a selection of actors, show-business personalities, friends and assorted others would drive around in a bus, doing a number of planned activities but without a script. Predictably, it was a mess that needed professional help (they didn't even realize that the purpose of the clapboard at the start of each take is to enable the sound and images to be synchronized) and even so was less than amazing.<br /><br />They came up with 6 songs for the 1-hour movie, 3 by Paul, one each by John and George and one credited to all 4 Beatles as it was an instrumental. That posed a problem as to what form the soundtrack release should take. In the UK they solved it by issuing it as a double EP, 3 songs on each of two 45rpm 7-inch discs. I bought it and found it hugely unsatisfying. For once, Capitol in the US had the better idea; perhaps inspired by the fact that 'I Am The Walrus' was not only on the soundtrack but was also the B-side to the Christmas single 'Hello Goodbye', they combined the MMT songs with the 1967 singles, A and B sides, to make an 11-track album. This quickly became the standard and was chosen as the vehicle for the CD release when it came. The result is an odd hybrid, the soundtrack meets the hits, joined together by 'I Am The Walrus'.<br /><br />The soundtrack songs, it has to be said, are not consistently brilliant in the way the 3 previous albums were. \\"Magical Mystery Tour' itself is a rousing opener and 'The Fool On The Hill' is a beautiful Paul ballad, often strangely overlooked in lists of his best songs (it was also one of the best sequences in the movie). However, 'Flying', although pleasant, is very bland and the two songs which follow, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'Your Mother Should Know', turn repetition into a fetish. It's left to the wild surrealism of 'I Am The Walrus' to close the soundtrack part of the album with a bang.<br /><br />The singles, on the other hand, are magnificent. 'Hello, Goodbye', based by McCartney on a little parlor game in which he and Alistair Taylor called out opposites of which the title was one, is musically interesting and uplifting, though lyrically pretty meaningless. That's followed by the two tracks making up what many consider to be the best double-sided single of all time, 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'Penny Lane'. These songs were originally intended to be on 'Sgt. Pepper' and their innovative and atmospheric structure (and one of McCartney's best lyrics) would have elevated that album to even greater heights. After that, the B-side 'Baby, You're A Rich Man', catchy and happy, leads into the sublime anthem 'All You Need Is Love', a deceptively simple song which gradually draws you in until by the end you get it and can't help joining in.<br /><br />MMT the album is uneven. It has two of my top ten Beatles' songs (SFF/PL) alongside two of my bottom ten (BJW/YMSK). Nevertheless, overall it works; you come away feeling you have listened to a great album.<br /><br />Such is the very real magic of The Beatles.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love it. Thank you Amazon. This product works great with the charger.The PowerFast  charger which is not included.So try it.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|One of my favorite movies. It follows the book nicely, a few minor details but over all great movie. Amazon needs faster servers .
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Rare nowadays that I find an album that I love every single song on it. Awesome work Lindsey! Keep up the music videos too!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Must read I could not put it down!! Loved that it left me wanting more!! You won't regret reading this one!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this poignant tale set in Ireland...couldn't put it down! Characters very well developed and dialect so real. Didn't see the ending coming, either! Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome all they could do more is change the setting to an actual subway because it it is a train and the could bring the world tour to Texas
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. Excellent graphics and challenging. It is unlike any game I have played. I was expecting a locked door mystery but it is much more. The goal is to open elaborate safes/devices in order to move to the next level. Very tough at times (although there are clues if you get stuck) and I was really happy to see much different puzzles than all the other adventure and locked door games I have played. Well worth the money and I hope to see more in the same vein from this developer!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|it could become very addictive but as of now I am able to put it down after a while.  I'd like to be able to free play more though.  I think it's a bit silly to have to pay for more &#34;lives&#34;
B005IQZB14|4.0|Well written but by the time I had finished the book I was exhausted from all her trials and tribulations. Hard to imagine a grown woman trying something like this with no planning etc
B004GXAZL6|5.0|A great story that keeps you entertained and guessing the plot only to discover you're way off beat again. Another Baldacci success.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Tears and smile were on my face seeing Muddy and the Stones together in a small club.  The locals blues artist were very good but should have known when it was time to leave the stage.
B001MSMULG|4.0|I enjoy action adventure with heroes and especially the works of new authors, new to ne, that is. This author was recommended by a doctor whose tastes were very similar to mind. The real kicker though was that my daughter and her husband had read a number of Mr Silva's books and they got me started with the earliest one and I hope started on buying more for my Kendal.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is fun for children and adults. My 2 year old and i play together. Her hand eye coordination is getting better every day.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book &#34;Ready player One&#34;, pretty close to a &#34;I Just Can't Put It Down &#34; read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for those that would love to own their own horse, but Don't really have the time or room.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Movie was funny, but not as good as all the hype!!! A little disappointed once i finally saw it. Not really that impressed with all the vocal performances either.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|At first I thought this game wuz boring but now its awesome. You're gonna loge it<br />I RECOMEND YOU TO DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it it is the best calculator in the world and it helps me with my math homework I would recommend it to my family and friends
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I love the paper artwork style and am having quite a bit of fun in this endless runner/level type of game.<br /><br />You are the moon. You followed a space butterfly away from Earth and awoke a space crab nebula thing. It's now chasing you all the way back to earth. You run into other planet and collect their stars to pay for upgrades all the while trying to stay ahead of the crab.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first downloaded this game, I didn't expect it to be this fun. Great game and overall very addicting!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Heartwarming, touching, brilliant, amazing, and just very good. Disney knows how to teach a valuable lesson while entertaining and giving you a visual delight. I can't say enough good things about a strong female led disney pixar animated feature with such rich culture and heart.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Ive played it 1 time and it shut down the second time! id highly recommend you DONT get it on the kindle but on the iphone ipod and Ilario it works perfectly fine
B000I3SYEI|5.0|2nd best sci fi movie there is. 2nd only to The Empire Strikes Back. And this is coming from a Scifi geek.
0316228532|4.0|Even though well written, the book starts slow. As others have indicated, initially there seems like too many characters and they are difficult to keep separated. But as the story develops the characters being to remind you of people you know and eventually I found myself caring about even some of the more despicable individuals in the book, and hoping thing will eventually turn out well for them. Rowlings is a great story teller and she has effectively proven she is not limited to just one genre.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good graphics and good fun... I usually do not play these types of games, but am glad I got this one! Try it! You will like it!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Really good album!  Pretty much every song on this album is good and memorable, not just the popular singles you hear commonly on the radio.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This calculator beats other calculator apps I've tried. An easy-to-use interface with lots of options/functions and types of calculators. Definitely recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game. So many options for so many different kinds of games. Easy to get through first few and unlock more.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoyed this game!  it was a lot harder than I expected and I went back after the first run and played until I got 3 stars.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I absolutly loved this album, although their last song on the album Don't Look Down was short. I 'm a big fan of Onerepublic. They write beautiful and unusal songs and they sing great. The thing about it is for me when I buy their albums I like all the songs that they've recorded. I have three albums of theirs, and so far Native is their best album yet in my opinion.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This is wonderful, I can just slip it in and it keeps my Kindle safe and clean. Check it out.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|An engaging thriller than I didn't want to put down. For expats, there are numerous moments of humor and frustration that will sound familiar (giant sets of ugly luggage, anyone?). An entertaining read.
B0081336FO|5.0|TV shows don't get much better than this. The quality of the acting and writing are just stellar! Love that we get 3 high quality episodes rather than 24 mediocre ones - TV networks take note.
1936719010|3.0|Do the Work was in my Amazon.com recommendations. I bought it on a whim without knowing much about the author based upon this, the first line from Amazon's description:<br /><br />\\"Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don't know where to start?\\"<br /><br />All of the above, yes, thank you!<br /><br />Author Steven Pressfield takes the reader on a journey -- an exploration of the inner sources of \\"Resistance\\" that keep us from awesomeness -- from getting off the couch to nurture and develop an idea, through design and production, to delivery. While short and easily read in one or two evenings, the sections of the book are broken down by the phases of resistance experienced (read: imposed upon oneself) by the creator over the life of a project. For that reason, Do the Work should be read once, quickly, then consumed again later by section, as needed to keep you confident, believing in yourself and your idea. The bestselling author writes from an expert perspective, and the text is very artfully constructed and engaging.<br /><br />The book is definitely geared toward true creatives -- artists, musicians, writers -- who tend to encounter as much (or more) resistance to their dreams than those of us in less-creative professions. The increasing tendency to look at technology work through a creative lens is compelling, but sometimes falls short for me personally; therefore, while Do the Work is a great kick in the rear to motivate oneself to take a chance and get something started, the book sometimes failed to resonate as fully with me as it would with someone whose work is at-the-core, fundamentally an act of creation. The broad concept of Resistance, and the ways it devilishly tries to block us from creating great things, can be appreciated by anyone and, if nothing else, opens a window into the inner struggles of even the most creative minds.<br /><br />Take-home messages:<br /><br />  - Just start working. Get something down and be willing to be wrong.<br />  - You will encounter resistance -- primarily from yourself. The bigger/bolder your idea/project, the greater the resistance. Accept that the people who have original and revolutionary ideas are no different that you.<br />  - If you make a mistake and everyone notices, you've arrived at a level of practice and performance where people care about and notice what you're doing.<br /><br />Pro's:<br /><br />  - Quick read; however, probably should be read once for familiarity, then read again in sections as they're relevant over the course of a project<br />  - Written in a conversational and artistic (but approachable) style<br />  - Written from an expert perspective; Pressfield has experienced -- and conquered -- everything he writes about Resistance<br />  - A window into the inner struggles -- often experienced in silent agony -- by creative people<br /><br />Con's:<br /><br />  - Definitely geared toward those in the most creative fields; however, it is applicable (with extrapolation and reflection) to anyone in any field who wants to nurture a big idea<br />  - Only limited narrative from the author, in which he relates the writing of a recent novel to the book's theme; as an outsider to the true Creative Process, more narrative would be helpful for me<br />  - Sometimes a little too fuzzy/metaphysical for my taste
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game is great and really well done graphics. The game play is phenomenal. The only thing I don't like about the game is that the character isn't customizable.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I am interested in the characters. The theory behind the Zombies, as a physician, doesn't make sense so far. They need to eat?, how does their blood circulate nutrition to the body without the need for a hear? Why am I thinking about this?<br /><br />I'm a little frustrated by the fact that they don't try to use/or fashion their own flame throwers, which seems like the most efficient way to get rid of the herds. Why don't the use Molotov cocktails? Why didn't the napalm work?<br /><br />In summery this show is entertaining; I have grown to like the characters, and enjoy the post apocalyptic world as  a theme.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As usual, season 3 did not disappoint. I won't elaborate, lest I spoil it for those who haven't seen it. The bonus features on this DVD set are nice; my entire family enjoyed them.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|David Weber builds a universe a credible caracters that interact and each has his/her personality which makes the book fun to read.  He is a little long winded in his descriptions so I skipped a lot the second time I read the series.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|The update ruined everything. You can't open the chat thing to see who's online. This is absolutely horrible. If I could I would put zero starts... but have to stick with one. It'll be easier just to use the internet than the app.. please fix.!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We purchased this as my Sister-in-Law saw this at the movies and thought we would get it for her birthday.
B005HSL626|5.0|My boyfriend and me can't stop playing its a fun game. works good on my kindle. We also love the fruits facts
B005I4JG80|4.0|As a foreigner living in the US for many years, and who had kids while in the US, I had no idea how much I was absorbed in the American way of bringing up kids until I read this book.  Sure, I did see differences in my children's behaviour compared to foreign countparts as we traveled abroad, but thought the differences were due to my children's &#34;personality&#34;.  While reading this book, I realized that many of the French culture of raising kids is similar to other countries in the world, and it really opened my eyes to look at better ways to raise happy and respectful children.  Great book!
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I heard about this book at my school, and i thought it would be fun to read with my 10 year old sister,and it was totally worth it. It's  funny, interesting and adorable. Or as my sister says, Epic! 5 stars. Read this book!

B004HX0P2Y|1.0|What they forget to tell you is that if you are purchasing a video and want to download it you will not be able to unless your device is compatible and the list of devices is short. Buyer beware! Check compatibility first. Otherwise you can only store it and watch it from the cloud. I like three movie but the service sucks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the concept it is easy to play yet tough and keeps you coming back for more.we have turned it into a family competition.

B009MYARIK|3.0|Good light hearted read. Storyline was just okay but we'll written and funny. Really like Kinsella's sense of humor.  Recommended.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|Problem One: The game is a mindless bunch of programming.<br />Problem Two: The developer has posted a bunch of fake reviews (a giant red flag).<br />Problem Three: In app purchasing for a paid app.<br />Finally: This app is a data-miner.<br />There is nothing good with this app.
B00A8QXSFA|5.0|I love this album. Bought it on vinyl and the feel is just right for the format. Groovy feel good music from a different area. Robben's vocals and guitar is stellar. No Dumble overdrive here, mostly clean sounds that fit the style. Buy it!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Adorable! I think this was our favourite of the series.  Great story line, super animation, laughs, giggles, inside jokes.  May be a little intese for the smallest viewers.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This is a realy good movie if you think surfing is cool, and even if you dont! I loved it the whole way thro, in fact I watched it twice already!!!There is a good amount of suspense to:) I would recommend this movie to anyone!

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very well put together.  So far, I've watched 2 episodes and seeing visually rendered the book series. Have some thoughts that casting might have been better with some other players but still well done. Hope the rest of the series matches up, at least......
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Ok family night film. Cute story, and clean computer animation.  Not hugely entertaining for the adult audience.  Fun for the preteens.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|This story takes place in the late 1850's in the American West and South, where the German Dentist Dr. Schultz has discovered that bounty hunting is much more lucrative than his initial profession.  Over the course of pursuing his new professional interests, Dr. Schultz comes upon the slave Django, who is able to identify three desperados with significant bounties on their heads--as Django had the misfortune to have been personally acquainted with these miscreants.  With the usefulness of Django's personal background in mind, Dr. Schultz makes those conveying Django an offer they cannot refuse (in the truest sense), so that Django now finds himself in the good doctor's employ.<br /><br />As Schultz inquires into his new employee's background, he discovers that poor Django has been separated from his beloved wife by the gross inequities of slavery.  As chance and coincidence would have it, Django's wife began her life as the personal servant of a German woman who saw fit to give her the name Brunhilda and teach her the German language.  Dr. Scultz finds this story of an African American woman with this German background very interesting, especially in that her name corresponds to that of a character enshrined in Teutonic music and myth.  Schultz goes on to tell Django the story of the courageous hero Siegfried who rescues his darling Brunhilda from an impregnable mountain guarded by a dragon.  I should note at this point that in such legends (including the Old English epic Beowulf) great treasures are often guarded by dragons.<br /><br />And so Django and Schultz set out on their laudable mission to rescue Brunhilda from horrors of slavery in the ante-bellum American South.  They hatch a clever scheme, which naturally runs into certain difficulties.  As in all such dramas, of course, chance plays a large role in allowing the hero to succeed in his quest.  For my taste, however, chance plays too large a role in the plot of this movie.  I also take exception to one singularly capricious decision by usually cool-headed Dr. Schultz that seemed completely of character!.  Despite these two misgivings, however, I still enjoyed this movie and found it interesting!gularly capricious decision by usually cool-headed Dr. Schultz that seemed completely of character!.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|Okay I just started playing but so far I'm loving the game. The game is intense and the eqiupment adds spice to it.
0142403873|4.0|It stirs a child's imagination. It uses slightly different logic from other tales, but the story line is wonderful and shows cleverness outshining other forces. Children & parents should enjoy it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a great story!  The characters were funny, but sensitive and endearing at the same time.  Their way of speaking reminded me of the movie \\"Waking Ned Devine,\\" which I loved.  I liked how the characters alternated telling their story and how more of Jamie's past was revealed in the beginning and more of Lydia' s toward the end.  I'm sorry that I've finished the book!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Tried this game because my grandson (5) wanted a &#34;spooky&#34; game.  It's a little too complicated for him right now because of all the reading involved with the clues.  But I think he'll like it better when he's a little older

B0070DOHQS|1.0|As many others, I gave JD a try.  I couldn't be happier, since everything worked as advertised the first day.  This morning I needed to access my computer from my Kindle Fire HD and I couldn't.  I know for a fact the problem doesn't reside on my tablet but on the application.  It keeps showing on my computer &quot;Problem with VNC server&quot; and it gives me a link to &quot;Fix It&quot;.  Have gone through every step (even re-installing it) with no luck.  Now I realize this app is not reliable and I would be afraid to depend on it while I'm away from the computer.<br />I would've given this app five stars if I had left my review the first time I tried it.  Now, after learning it's not reliable, I can't give it more than one.  Until they fix it, my review will remain as it is.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|this game is not at all what I thought it would be. I thought you could actually play as iron man, but all you get to do is dodge s*** and shoot poorly designed enemies. and I know that might sound good, but.... its not. if this was a decent game then it wouldn't be free... I'm dissapointed in you, Gameloft.  oh and it lags really bad too.
0679805273|5.0|I love it and so does my grandson.  Funny and positive a good read for any age.  Encouraging us to keep going and conquer the down times in life.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Love this movie...the songs are amazing ...Steve Martin kills it! Granddaughters love musicals and had never seen this one before and loved it too
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|this movie was a bit slow and disappointing. there was too much narration. the kids age 2 to 9 lost interest at varrying times in the movie.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I loved this book; it made me laugh and cry. Especially loved the scene that described his First Holy Communion.  You don't even have to be Catholic to appreciate that one.  I would recommend (and indeed, have) this book to anyone who enjoys reading.
0312576463|1.0|hated the book.  Had to read for book club.  Would not recommend to others.  Again don't know what else to say
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I am 25% of the way through the book and Different is the word that comes to mind. I understand that this is a different writer however Robert Jordan never went on for pages about how the wind blows (I also noticed this in the last book mostly in the prolog). I feel like the imagery is drawn out and other parts lack. I have waited years to get this book and I wouldn't say that I'm disappointed but its close.  Anyone who has read the books will buy this because we all way to see how it will end I hope the ending is as much as we all expected!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've been a fan of Sanderson for a while now, and I'd put off reading this book. I now wish I hadn't. Of anything he's written, this is the most intimidating, but the most rewarding. If you take everything that made Mistborn, Elantris, and Warbreaker amazing novels, turn up the intensity and add in a diegetical narrative that hints at Tolkien-level worldbuilding, you have an idea of what Way of Kings is.<br /><br />I honestly can't remember the last time I stayed up late to keep reading a book, but WoK made me. I had to get through, and I had to see what happened.  I cared about the characters and the world, and unlike most books of this length and structure, there wasn't a single PoV character that I despised. Usually, I hate at least one PoV character in this kind of book. But not here.<br /><br />If there was one complaint I have, it would be that the interludes are too few and far between. I love the alternative storylines that were explored through the interludes, but I think the novel could have done with another one or two because those narratives felt a little unfinished because of their scarcity. Though, doubtless, those are also threads that will be expanded once Words of Radiance (Book 2) is released later this year.<br /><br />All in all, I am glad I finally got through Way of Kings, and while I wouldn't suggest it to be the first Brandon Sanderson book someone reads, I do think that it should be intermixed earlier through his library than I have. Because now I have to wait to read more of his work, and after finishing a book as good as this, that's a pretty tall order.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Great action, good story line, would watch this again two or three times a day maybe more really like it
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I've been playing for the past few days (with breaks) and I've got to say, this game is way better than I thought it would be! You collect gems and fight off other people in suits and machinery. I don't like how you have to pay a great amount of gems, coins, or XP but other than that WOOHOO!!!
1439190275|5.0|Explained this style of eating very well.  The induction stage was rather difficult, however I started with phase 2 the started losing weight.
1451695195|5.0|I ordered this book because I lost my Daughter 15 months ago, and it has been a great impact on my life. I don't think I would of ever been the same if it wasn't for getting this book. I have so much great worries about there being no Heaven, and this book has finally made me see the light on everything, that made me have dough. I am so Grateful for my theorist recommending I get this book and get some answers, and that is exactly what it has done for me. When my only child was taken from me at the young age of 44 I was totally lost for words, and lost for everything that I once cared for. However since then I have come  long way, I have a  much longer way to go, but this book has told me a lot and I would recommend this Proof of Heaven to anyone that is in Great Denial. As I am /was to find your way. Wonderful Book and I also want to mention, it was here on my door step the day after I placed the order, in great surprise I thought to myself, Angels must of brought it to me because they knew how much I needed it. Thank you so much!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I liked everything about this book.  Pulls you in from the beginning so that you don't want to put it down. Very fast read and great mystery!
B0070DOHQS|1.0|I don't. Read the EULA. 1) they don't guarantee that your data transmission is secure (Windows client), and 2) it's network socket client software written by a hostile country on your confidential computer. Use splashtop or simular remote program. Not worth the risk, they built every disclaimer into the Eula and your recourse is through United Arab Emirates justice system quote unquote.
0060872675|4.0|A very fun children's picture book to go along with Terry Pratchett's Discworld series of novels. Those adults who have read other books in the series will understand and enjoy more of what is in &#34;Where's My Cow?&#34;, but it is enjoyable on its own also and should be fun for kids. It is mentioned in several of the novels but has special significance in the novel &#34;Thud&#34;. What is truly unique and imaginative is that it is a book about a book. There are several layers to it and yet it is still understandable to anyone.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|For me, this movie is just okay. I'm at the hour and ten minute mark and I'm done with it. It's just not good enough to keep me interested, which admittedly, isn't the easiest thing to do. Obviously, I am in the minority on this one!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Best and easiest vpn program I've ever used.  Love the use of Google id and password to set up the account.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book is truly a gift given to all who read it.  Thank you Mitch Albom for reminders of faith, humility, and goodness.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is. Challenging. You really need to concentrate to stay in the running to. Break even and really concentrate to win.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A new fan to this genre.  Enjoyed the rollercoaster of emotion and empathy, the conflicts were delicious.  My only real complaint was that the book ended!!<br />Got to find more silo books!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Have not read it yet but, I hope it is as good as the movie. I think I will like it.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Cried a lot watching the movie, it's one of those movies which make you think what if the story happens on me and my family. Love the boys' actings, really awesome.
B004GYY714|5.0|Been using this app. for about a week and it works great for mobile devices. Would recommend to music lovers.
B0070DOHQS|2.0|The info for installing and using this app is confusing and useless.  Ergo, the app, for me, is useless since I was unable to make a connection between my pc and my kindle..
B00002ZMNV|5.0|My boyfriend loves this band alot especially the one where they are with the symphony. When his old copy was having problems he bought another copy from here cheaper than the original he had bought elsewhere. Highly recommend this if you are a fan of metallica.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how there is many different themes every certain amount of time.  So to sum it up I LOVE IT!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|A fantastic mix of hidden object, adventure, and mystery. I know not everyone likes hidden object games. Don't let that stop you from buying this game! As I said above it is a mix and a perfect one at that. The mystery is the town, it's residents, and the missing girl(s). The adventure is finding the missing girl and getting out alive. The hidden object scenes are well placed and you need them to find a useful item to continue in your investigation. And there aren't to many of them. Buy this game you will not be disappointed!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I watched The Good Wife for the first time and it was good. The quality of the video and audio played on the kindle fire was great. I never seem to watch dramas the first season it was on so when I watched it I was not swayed by all the hype.
0770435726|2.0|Reading \\"The Expats\\" by Chris Pavone, I felt like I kept waiting for something really big to happen and my expectations were never met. The main character named Kate, is an ex CIA agent and throughout the story she seems unrealistic as being an ex CIA, story details that were meant to be slipped in the plot that you knew would be coming up later  were noticeable to me and you would think an ex CIA agent would notice the obvious signs. The details of the many places they traveled were in depth, yet also tended to be boring. The plot did jump around quite a bit and at times I had to pause to figure out when the scene was taking place. I enjoyed the character named Hayden, but he was not in the book a whole lot. I saw potential in this book, It just wasn't quite there for me though. On a side note the font of the book for me, was hard to read.
B009ZOCLD6|5.0|A very good interpretation of Brahms concert and hard to find an excellent version of Clara Schumann's romances. A great viol&iacute;n player, with another great player at the piano and an excellent orchestra.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. A very moving and touching story. I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. Watch it now.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Perhaps not the greatest movie app tie-in, but it's quite entertaining. You can have fun without needing to spend more bucks. It's a keeper.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|All you haters can hate all you want but this game has got swag yo if you don`t like it don't complain we really don't want to know
B0068PHS5Q|5.0|I really loved this book. It was hard to keep up with the characters a little bit bouncing from one era to another. Quite long but I could not put it down A great read.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great acting, interesting aliens!  I only saw episode one, am going to buy the entire season.  Probably season two also.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play this just before I go to bed, it's great to help me relax and wind down. It is definately one of the best versions that I have played. I highly recomend it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical of Vince Flynn's novels, this story grabs you immediately and pulls you into the intrigue and never lets you go.  You  become part of the action and don't want to put the book down  until you've read it cover to cover.  I can't wait to read Vince Flynn's next book.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Action packed :). I love westerns and Clinton Eastwood type movies, this was a great combo of both!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great movie. Loved the actors in it and the storyline between each character. could totally relate as a highschool student in the ever day struggle of growing up.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I will be able to give a better review after I finish reading it (I'm about halfway through), but will probably forget. That said, I've enjoyed what I've read so far, it continues the same tone of what has come before, and doesn't just conveniently wrap everything up, so there is always tension and &#34;What's going to happen now...?&#34; All in all, pretty good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|awesome book, loved it, couldn't put it down  have to read them all for sure<br />can't wait for more like
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun! Keeps me and my 3 year old occupied. We both love to play the Subway Surfer game. The End!
B00BESJYAY|4.0|acting could have been better, but it was a good watch for a saturday night with the family and friends.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down!  The characters were very well developed and you couldn't wait to find out their fate!
B0019NG73G|5.0|Great film, with good acting, excellent action, and insight into why this battle was as important as it was. Soundtrack very good, with grand, epic score that embellished the importance of some of the monumental achievements that occurred. Thanks to the numerous re-enactors, and the Parks to allow this to be filmed on location, created an eerie realism that one feels like they may have just witnessed a 3day event that happened 150 years ago. Hats off to all involved to a job well done!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|really enjoyed this album..love the fact that you can preview the songs before you buy and the fact that you can only buy ther ones you like singly is a plus..love amazon
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great app for all ages! Its challenging fun. My teen loves it and so do I. The graphics are so cool.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS AND IF YOU DID DELETE IT!!!!<br /><br />I am seriously beginning to wonder what is wrong with amazon they spend extra time to make sure apps are good yet they keep handing us this... This game not only reads everything on your device it sends it on to a marketing group that then uses the information to bombard you with adds! Yes this is what we need we need people in our computers/tablets/cellphones digging into our privacy and stealing our info so they can sell to another company so they can better sell us more stuff we don't want or need. This is marketing gone way overboard and is purely disgusting.<br /><br />Also writing reviews for your own game is just wrong.<br /><br />DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS AND IF YOU DID DELETE IT!!!!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I wasn't sure how I would take this movie but I loved it. I could not believe the similarities of my oldest son who also is named Andy. The character Andy even wore the same shirt and has the exact same \\"dry humor\\" as my oldest son who is an Attorney at the age of 24 with his JD ( so proud.) I loved how Barbara S. was so comfortable in her \\"ways\\" of being single and still calling herself mommy to her son. I admit, I do too. She eats her M&M's in bed and told Andy that she really didn't want to date because she wants to be able to eat her M&Ms in bed....there were so so many things in the movie that I had to laugh at because they were so \\"real\\" and sweet at the same time. I liked how at the end, when Andy actually took his moms advice on the product he was \\"touring\\" that it really worked and won over the company. We care so much as parents and we have made our children our lives. When we have to live without them because they have grown and left, we sometimes do not even know what to do with ourselves and feel a deep sadness...is this the \\"empty nest syndrome\\" many speak of? I have just experienced this and so the movie was perfect for me right now. It isn't perhaps for everyone, for for many of us we can appreciate it and even share it with our kids so they can see where we are coming from. I shared it with my Andy and he liked it. He laughed and gave me a hug at the end :) We are proud of each other and I learned in this movie that it is okay to take on a new life when our kids grow up and leave. It isn;t easy but we have to try and I see she did that at the very end. It inspired me a lot! Good movie. Enjoy :)
B000H4TX9I|5.0|LOVED this show.  I was heartbroken when the last episode was over.  I was especially sad that they never got to bring the relationship between Inara and Mal to a conclusion - it felt like stopping a book in the middle.
B0058YPL66|5.0|It's truly an amazing series that drawsyou into an enchanted world. It makes me wish magic exists. It's also an incredible way of turning our beloved fairytale characters into a modern TV series.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My kindle wouldn't charge. I called and the rep advised me. 2 days later, my part was delivered and I'm back to using my kindle fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian and Ana had me captivated from the beginning and I couldn't put this book do.  Only complaint is all of the \\"jeez\\"and \\"holy cow\\"  from Ana's inner monologue.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|The movie could be cut by 30 minutes if they were to speed up some scenes, but overall I liked it.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|I love Robert Redford but this film was not a great vehicle for his talent. He was not at all Gatsby-like, or at least what I thought Gatsby should be, and Mia Farrow was way too giddy and acted like she was almost mentally incapacitated. Bruce Dern did a good job as did Karen Black, but I thought the ending was rather incongruous.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Enjoy breeding and hatching different dragons and waiting to see what new ones are next. Some are easier to get than others but that is part of the fun,
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I have been using several other VNC clients on my Nexus 7 and none of them work as well as this one. Where the others barely got the job done this does it well. Easy to use. Double-clicks and right-clicks are easy and typing text is also easy. As an admin it has made my life much easier.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game fun to do the challenges.  Wish it didn't take quite as long to do the training, but it's okay.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Thought the surfing scenes were very realistic.  The blond haired surfer did a nice job. The power of the ocean was well shown.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Most Excellent Concert Experience<br />After buying the Blue Ray, which looks and sounds awesome<br />It did not come with a CD like DVD why not?<br />I bought the DVD just for the CD...either way money worth spending.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Helps me fall asleep. Have it on my kindle and phone. Great sounds that you can make your own. hay.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good graphics for a hidden puzzle game.I play theses all the time and this one is has a decent story line also .Most free games aren't as detailed as this one.The best thing is it was free.I did go for the extended version.
B001FZ0A7W|5.0|When asked to describe Dead Can Dance's sound I have trouble. I love that it's so different. You can either sit and chill sipping wine or go buckwild listening to this.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This book was easy to follow. I enjoyed reading about France and Atlanta.  I would like to read more stories by this author.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I did not realize Roosevelt was such a Whimp in Politacal matters as in dealing with congress and afraid to do anything regarding the the treatment of Jewish people in Germany he could of saved so many lives.It seems he really only cared about what people thought of him.  Linbergh he should of been shot for treason. It was a very interesting.In school in our history books they did not really tell the truth about the people running the country it was all fluff.
0061730335|5.0|Oh my.<br /><br />I was prepared to like the book because I had heard some bits and pieces of what this boy did.<br /><br />But then you find out what he really did, and where he did it, and how he did it. And it is overwhelming how smart and creative and giving he is.<br /><br />This boy (a man now) is a reminder of how good and creative humans can be, how much we can give to each other.<br /><br />Starting from just an innate curiosity and prompted by need, young William, a drop-out from middle school due to a near-catastrophic country-wide drought and famine, ends up reading one book after another on physics. He and his family struggle to survive on less and less food, and people are desperate for help--so he tries to figure out a way to help his family and his village acquire power and light and security. By watching others, by reading books, by doing a lot of thinking and experimentation on various fragments of technology along with his best friends, William gradually figures out the principles of generating electricity from a windmill, and then scrounges the countryside for various pieces to stick together into a Rube Goldberg-like windmill, constructed of poles and bamboo and rope and a broken bicycle, PVC pipes melted and flattened into blades, and other scraps from a junkyard. Finally the windmill is constructed, and begins turning--and electricity flows into his home and into his life and the lives of his family, giving them the beginnings of a life based on technology.<br /><br />The thing that got me wasn't so much that he is simply brilliant and creative, but that he is good and giving as well. There is a spirit within him of giving to his community, raising everyone up with hope and accomplishment. This man is transformative to the people he touches.<br /><br />I do not know the next chapters in his life, but this book is only the beginning for this wonderful journey.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Classic. Goonies never die. Or is it they never say die? Either way, I will love this movie forever. I can recite every line.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Different book, but you have to keep reading. It's really like a female version of Harry potter meets a nonvampire twlight family in a way. There are odd creatures with odd names which sometimes bore me. But the connection between the main character and the vampire hunter makes me stay with this book. The movie is coming out in August but it doesn't appear to follow the book exactly. I really don't know how else to say it. it's pretty PG too. probably made for teenagers.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Great writing. Real characters who play on your emotions. A little too violent for my taste but hasn't stopped me from watching.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS cast really works it has a great theme and the story always bonds the team together.  It is no wonder they have won so many awards and been the Number 1 Drama on T.V. for 10 years running
B00003CXB6|4.0|Okay, some things shouldn't be revisited.<br /><br />This movie was produced through the ever-popular art of cut and paste.  Scenes are slapped together willy-nilly, with little to no regard for logic.<br />We are painfully reintroduced to a different Jurassic Park (in the wilds so to speak) through another scene involving a child at risk (the outcome of said encounter isn't revealed until later, as an aside).  Jeff Goldblum's character is hauled out of mothballs to star in this ill-fated venture.  His character is publically disgraced, humiliated, then academically ruined by Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard).  John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is in no better shape, having been deposed as the leader of InGen.  And yet, the scheming old goat manages to persuade Dr. Malcolm into entering the fray one more time for old time's sake, that, and through extortion of a sort (he's already sent Malcolm's latest girlfriend to the island).  Here they manage to instantly turn a slightly irresponsible old fool into a conniving stinker, thus lessening his likability.<br />Once on the island things only get worse when we're introduced to Malcolm's poor choice of a girlfriend: Julianne Moore as a witless behavioral paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding.  This woman is generous when it comes to lecturing others on how to behave in the wild, rules she wantonly breaks at every turn, making her into one of the dumbest characters ever to disgrace an action flick.  Vanessa Lee Chester (Kelly Malcolm) is also along for the ride, another child in jeopardy, and as a plot point involving gymnastics (how convenient).  Vince Vaughn, toned down for a change, does a turn as Nick Van Owen, a documentarian and secret environmentalist (also convenient).  The one saving grace among the cast was Pete Postlethwaite as a big-game hunter intent on bagging a Tyrannosaurus (what he intended to do with it afterwards is anyone's guess).<br />Once the mayhem on the island abruptly concluded, plagiarism ensued, with a romp through San Diego by the angry Tyrannosaur they managed to kidnap from the island (I can count many previous films with similar sequences prompting the question, when does a homage end and plot stealing begin?).<br />This is lazy, shoddy work by Spielberg.  Still, I've watched it many times and will continue to do so far into the future.  But it's impossible to avoid knowing it's a lesser effort.rism ensued, with a romp through San Diego by the angry Tyrannosaur they managed to kidnap from the island (I can count many previous films with similar sequences prompting the question, when does a homage end and plot stealing begin?).<br />This is lazy, shoddy work by Spielberg.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I tried to read this book twice.  The first time I managed the first 20-odd pages, and decided I read for pleasure, and don't like struggling to read a book.<br />The second time was because two of my daughters caught me out! I was dumb enough to mention I didn't like it.  After some 'interrogation' from my girls, I was embarrassed to admit that I had only read the first 20 or so pages.  They both encouraged me to try again. I then managed a full 150, decided that I wasn't interested in that much agony, lent it to my 3rd girl and she caught her husband reading it on her iPad.  She didn't like the book, but he did.<br />The only good thing that came out of it was some quite interesting literary discussion at family bbqs (first time ever).  Now all 4 daughters, their husbands, 2 sons and their wives have read it, and the opinions are varied.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Jennifer deserves all the hype this movie is giving her. Great character development. The writers did a great job creating a real family with real problems and showing how love prevails
B00BESIKWM|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie because i absolutely loved the first Silent Hill movie ,but i was very disappointed. The whole thing looked and felt like it was written and filmed in a hurry. The acting was just strange seemed somewhat forced, rushed and was very cheesy and bad at some parts. I really wanted to like this movie. A lot of the CGI just looked horrible and the creatures/monsters or whatever you want to call them were more random stereotypical ideas of what should be scary but they were not. The movie was to damn short too any thing less then 2 hrs almost doesn't interest me as far as movies go. I have the blu ray copy of the first movie and i love it but i will NOT be adding this to my collection. Glad i rented before i decided to buy.<br />If your going in expecting this to be any thing like the first movie you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />The first movie is Great and is genuinely scary, serious, disturbing, dark and thrilling were as the second movie is almost the exact opposite.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is my go-to movie when I just want to watch some mindless adventure and, of course, some dinosaurs.  It is, like most of Spielberg's work, highly manipulative rather than artfully done.  Not necessarily a bad thing, it just lacks depth and finesse.  Spielberg loves to take shortcuts, hitting the obvious notes at the prescribed time.  He doesn't lead us through the story, he shoves us forward; like some obnoxious tour guide pointing out the sights.  He is a director from the sledgehammer school of film, continuously thumping you on the head until you get it.  Fortunately, because of the subject matter, most of his work is already done, who doesn't like dinosaurs?  They are the stars of this film.  They are the reason I've watched and enjoyed it many times.  I would place Jurassic Park near the top of my list of favorite films (but I loved the book more).<br /><br />Some of the characters/actors are more successful than others (my favorite is the ever snarky, and always right, Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm).  Richard Attenborough is charming as a slightly warped Santa Claus type, jovial but a definite menace with ideas that are best left to more responsible people.  The one sour note was the cartoon performance by Wayne Knight as a greedy disgruntled employee (perhaps someone should have informed him that this wasn't a sitcom accompanied by a laugh track).<br /><br />On the plus side, the plot tears along at a breakneck speed, keeping you from languishing over the ruts in the plot.  Most of the deaths are cowardly done off screen.  And then there's that one pesky problem of placing children in jeopardy for the sake of easily gained discomfort.  I've never appreciated that ploy; at best it's just a cheap shot and one of the easier tricks to educe apprehension in a viewer.  I'd have to say I suffer a love/hate admiration for this film.  And yet, I will keep watching it.  It's those dinosaurs..................
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I feel that everyone in the USA needs to watch this movie! Very well done and tasteful on both sides.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Although I had never watched any of the Lord of the Rings movies with my family in the past, I bought this movie to add to our 3D collection and thoroughly enjoyed both the story and the production.  Highly recommend it!
0679805273|5.0|When my children graduate from high school, this is one of the gifts they get.  This is a great book for people of all ages! Thank you Dr. Seuss!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Much more than I was expecting.  This is a must have afor any serious knife person.  Easy to hold, easy to use.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Everyone thought this movie was going to be hilarious. I found it to be slow and not worth my time.
B00B4804KS|3.0|We've bought a dozen 3D movies over the last few months and Jurassic Park proved to have the poorest quality 3D of them all.  Close-up 3D scenes usually resulted in very blurry picture, but thankfully there weren't enough of these close-ups to ruin the movie.  I rated it 3 stars for &#34;It's okay&#34; because the story is still good and because the quality was good in the non-3D portions of the movie, which is the majority of it.  I'd recommend buying the Blu-Ray disc rather than waste your money on the 3D version of this movie.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Awesome as usual. I've loved star trek since was a kid and it has never disappointed. Wish they would come out with a new series.
B00B6CVTBU|5.0|Incredible sound from both the blu-Ray and vynil record. Joe is constantly reinventing himself and pushing the limits, if there are any, of his talents to new heights.
B007HU4FZ2|4.0|Very real and well done. I found through out the movie, that I thought about what was being protrayed. The movie plays with your emotions.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Very much enjoyed seeing this old favorite in 3D.  The 3D quality was good, without the blurriness of some other 3D movies we've seen.  Glad we added this one to our 3D collection.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Really enjoy playing.  Like the adaptability.  Will continue to tell my friends and family members of this new game version.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Funny story, light hearted, made for an entertaining family movie night.  Not the best animated film ever but not bad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to finish Mockingjay now! A very good read. Couldn't put it down. No more words needed enough said.
098555780X|5.0|I watched a lot of his videos on YouTube and wanted to support him.<br /><br />I've done probably 8 knots already and am having fun.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|Lots of folks told me this movie was good so I put it on my watch list. If you like to see lots of computer generated animals dying then this is the movie for you. As for me, I wish I could erase it from memory banks and get my 2 hours back to watch a decent movie.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|The kids thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times.  The animation is great and it has a good story.
0307476073|5.0|So very interesting and Cheryl is a great writer and narrator ! I will definitely be reading her other books and I am recommending this to my booh group.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game with soft interesting graphics and the unlimited number of scenarios that appear on the screen. It's the other tomb run on the web.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I had just seen the documentary Searching for Sugar Man which prompted my purchase.  I'm happy with it.  Thank you.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's fun and fast, but you can get board with it quickly.  Other than that it's great.  Kids would like it.
044024613X|4.0|Good read, a bit predictable at times. Kept my interest while on vacation, moves along quickly. I would recommend it.
1421527618|4.0|It's pretty good but strongly reads like a sci-fi anime film as another reviewer stated. So if you want an anime film in novel form, this book is absolutely perfect, if not, it's still pretty decent and a very quick read and will not take too much out of your time to get through. Not much more to add other than that it's somewhat reminiscent of Starship Troopers in terms of the battle-suits and bugs (in this case &#34;mimics&#34;) and of Groundhogs Day in terms of a time loop and re-examination and is like a sci-fi anime film in pretty much everything else.  I'd recommend it.
1568363931|4.0|As the other review say I'll echo those. It's a good starter book but not much on the decorative aspects of a bento.
B001MLEW2S|2.0|I preferred the remake.  The villains were campy, the victims were stupid and the parents were too clueless. See the remake.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone was written by Ishmael Beah and is a first hand account of the horrible situations that he was forced to live out during the civil uprising in Sierra Leone. Over the years I have read numerous memoirs from individuals who have had to endure terrible situations that they could not escape. But the vivid accounts that Ishmael Beah expresses upon in his memoir brings a level of sadness that comes from only the saddest situations in the world. This young boy was thrust into a world that was filled with drugs and violence yet had no way to escape the violence that he was forced to inflict. Although this young boys journey brings countless examples of the horrific situations that numerous child soldier were force to endure, I found the most powerful aspect of his memoir coming from the fact that after all of the horrific things he has forced to endure he was able to find the courage and strength to tell his story in order to enlighten people of the horrible things taking place without notice around the globe. Overall I found Ismael Beah's memoir to be an inspirational story that brings a sense of enlightenment to the reality of the problems that people around the globe are forced to endure with very little outside aid being offered.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I liked the movie despite the awful southern accents.  Not everyone in the south sounds like a hick.  I like most movies about the supernatural and this was a good quality film.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|works great does what its supposed to and yeah it works fine on my kindle fire i prefer it over the amazon player and blaahhhhh

B0000CFW87|5.0|I love the CD.  Josh Groban does a really good job with each song.  All his CDs are good as far as I am concerned.
0385349947|4.0|Seriously I did buy this book because everyone was talking about how Sheryl puts women down, blah, blah, blah. Hate to blow the whistle but she actually doesn't. She really just tells the truth. She's also quite funny. Reading her book, I nodded my head several times agreeing with having had the same experiences. Before I received it in the mail, I mentioned having bought it to my boss (also female) and she thought it would be a waste of time. I believe her words were something like, &#34;...those are rich people's problems.&#34; Please note, we work for a non-profit where 96% of our clients live below the federal poverty line, so yes some of the things Sheryl writes about would never apply to them and probably not to me either. Of course, this didn't make the book any less entertaining. As I said she is funny. This also isn't to discount the good points she does make either. When it comes to her take on general interactions at work and just being independent as a female, you should take those words to heart. If you believe in the words spoken years ago by the amazing Gloria Steinem than you'll probably really enjoy Sheryl's book. What can I say, I LIKED her page after reading it.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Had to read this to see what Grisham did for kids.  This author is awesome.  Amazing how he can write for any age.  I even enjoyed the story.

B00ACBN9CI|3.0|This is a good way to take up time during my morning commute. It definitely needs some AAMRAM missles though.
1416972242|4.0|Oh, City of Ashes why do you do this to me?<br /><br />As far as plot goes, Cassandra Clare did an amazing job. City of Bones left me frustrated and...just completely in awe that Clare could do something so horrible to Jace and Clary. I spent most of City of Ashes just waiting for the situation to resolves itself. In this book, we see Clary and Simon as an item and kind of get a glimpse of what that might have been like but (thank goodness) this doesn't last long. But their relationship definitely added a lot more drama to an already very dramatic book. We see more of Valentine and learn more about Clary and Jace's pasts...I guess. A very entertaining and wonderfully gripping read for sure.<br /><br />Jace was so...I don't even know. He didn't bother me as much in this book like he did the first. But I think I was so frustrated with his and Clary's situation that I became frustrated with him.<br /><br />I really enjoy Clary's POV. I'm not quite sure what about it that draws me to it but I just find it to be very enjoyable and satisfying to follow throughout the story.<br /><br />Simon.... *sigh* Allow me to gripe for a moment. Every single time he almost died I was sitting there thinking, (SPOILER: \\"YES! YES, HE'S FINALLY DYING!\\" And at one point YES! HE'S DEAD! Then it was, \\"NO!!!! HE'S ALIVE!)SPOILER ENDED<br /><br />Sorry to all those who like him but I really despised his presence and meddling.<br /><br />We see more of Alec and Isabelle in this book which was nice. Alec is just a sweat heart and Isabelle is...yeah, I wouldn't want to get in her way.<br /><br />The writing was, of course, amazing. Clare somehow just pulls me into the characters' heads to the point where I sometimes forget the book is written in third person. The delivery of every single detail and revelation is spot on and expertly executed.<br /><br />You can find more of my reviews on my blog, Chasm of Books ([...]

B0084AZXKK|5.0|I really liked this book. It was easy not to lose track of who each character was because of their unique styles. Great!!!<br /><br />Btw, I hate writing long reviews so I will leave that for others, I just tell if and why I like the book.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|A surprisingly good novel and an excellent lesson on the Gods of old Egypt.  Although I am in my 60's I became captivated in what is a young persons novel.

B004QX07G4|1.0|I didn't think it was funny as Ellen could be.  I like her but this was not a good read.  I didn't even get past the 2nd chapter. Didn't hole my interest at all.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Rather than forking out money that I don't have right now for a camcorder, I am making do by running a webcam connected to this. I've actually hooked up another 16-foot repeater cable by a different brand and have noticed no issues whatsoever. To make the cord a bit easier to handle, I purchased a cord keeper at the hardware store for a couple of bucks. I'm very pleased with my setup right now and glad that there appears to be no decrease in video quality or speed from using the BlueRigger repeater cable.
B000GG4XD8|5.0|The keepers are an great and awesome albums in power metal history, highly recomended, the best era of helloween... HELLOWEEN UP!!!
B00AHSKRJ4|2.0|This movie was like watching paint dry. Doesn't come close to what I would expect from these two. Don't bother.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I do not want the series to end.  I just love the story line and the characters even the baddies
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|If you've actually read The Hobbit, you'll be disappointed with this dunderheaded and charmless interpretation.  I don't recall ever thinking that what The Hobbit needed was more big battle scenes, but that's exactly what Jackson must have thought.  Imagine reading the elegant and charming novel while playing Transformers Dark of the Moon in the background with the volume cranked and you'll get a pretty good idea of what this movie is like.  I liked Jackson's LOTR films but he obviously wanted to make The Hobbit into the prequel to HIS films, not Tolkien's story.  I doubt I'll waste my time on the remaining six hours (!!!) of Hobbit battles.  I think I could read the entire novel in the length of time it will take to watch this bloated trilogy.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I mean its fun but  on the kindle fire you can't say nothing for him to talk to you kind of boring just pressing his body and giving him milk this is because kindle fires the regular version doesn't have a camera so it doesn't have a speaker<br />Age 11
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love toca hair salon. But I really wish it would work because every time I click on it it just freezes.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie was absolutely brilliant and all the actors out did themselves.  Hugh Jackman gave such a brilliant performance and his voice was wonderful as was Anne Hathaway.  Helena Bonham Carter was a real scream in her role.  Loved them all.  I was spellbound the two times I saw it at the movies and enjoyed it again when I received my DVD
B005LAIH3G|5.0|For me, John Carter was magical. Real emotion. A love story. Good vs bad. Stunning photography, costumes, musical score that was incredible. 5 star movie with one of the worst marketing in history of Hollywood. I am not a sci fi person, but this movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice at the wedding, and had so many twists and turns was impossible to predict. Ending made me cry and want more. First time I have ever written and signed petition to movie studio to rethink the sequel non production. I saw it for first time on Starz channel...not knowing what it was about. After I saw it and realized this was one if not, the best movie I had ever seen, I believed the Disney studios have some real explaining to do on how a movie of this calibre is left to die with no marketing of any merit, and actors, director, composer, makeup artists, and producers not getting their recognition for creating an incredible FIRST installment of what should be at very least, a trilogy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is so fun I`m only eleven but I love history im such a nerd I also like pokemon too.GET THIS APP IT'S A NEED NOT A WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0316077046|4.0|Beautiful Darkness picks up where Beautiful Creatures left off. Lena is dealing with the grief of losing her Uncle Macon. Ethan is trying to figure out how to help her process it all, but everything he does seems to push her further away. There's something strange happening to Lena, and to him. And then he learns just how far she's gone, just how distant their relationship has become. True to his character, Ethan continues to pursue Lena, even after it seems that all hope is lost. The only question is, will his efforts be a waste or will he find a way to save the Caster girl he loves?<br /><br />I've got to be honest: I found myself just as intrigued by the story and its characters as I had been with book 1. I also found myself just as frustrated with the strange, awkward and confusing thought streams. But Beautiful Darkness came with its own unique set of frustrations, namely the unnecessary repetition. During the first half of the book, the authors repeatedly retold things we'd learned from book 1. For some of the minor things, like who Lucille Ball is, I can see reminding readers. But this reminding applied to even core concepts of the book - the difference between Dark and Light Casters, explanation of who main characters were from book 1, etc.<br /><br />Thankfully, by the time I'd reached the halfway point, all of the repetition had stopped. Or, at the very least, it had decreased enough that I no longer noticed it was happening. And, by that time, the story had picked up and I couldn't put it down. Like I said, pretty much most of the same - great story, amazing characters, but some mechanics that are downright frustrating. Hoping that book 3 will be better though because, as much as I love the story and the characters, I'm getting a little annoyed with some of the writing and it's starting to squash my desire to keep going. I'd hate for my annoyance to keep me from finishing the series because I really do care about what happens to the characters in the end.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|An interesting movie to watch from the perspective of the filming, and the story was somewehat engaging, and but abit mystical for me.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|My roommate introduced me to this group and I loved them automatically. One of the best Indie bands I've heard in a long while. I love their mixture of numerous music styles ( rap, rock, and sometimes a funky pop). It's a very unique style but it works incredibly well. I would defiantly recommend to anyone looking for something different.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love that I can work on puzzles and not worry about losing pieces or having somewhere to work on them or that the kiddos will take over lol.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I own both seasons on Blu-ray. This second season's highlight is the Irene Adler piece, A Scandal in Belgravia. This is actors and new writers interpreting Dolye's work at their best. The episode of The Hound disappointed but was an enjoyable interpreting of this well known story in the world of today. The Fall...I watched six times and slowed the action to see where the twist COULD appear. I could not find it. I look forward to Season 3 and more.the explanation of The Fall.
B005FFW46S|5.0|You can never go wrong reading a Discworld book. And Sam Vimes is one of my favorite characters. Go check it out!
B00122MWBK|5.0|Goo Goo Dolls have been one of my fav bands for a long time. This collection consists of some really really good songs that were their biggest singles. I do wish they had the song &#34;long way down&#34; but thats just my personal choice on a song that I like by them.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Love this program - a little lag time, but not as bad as some other programs I've tried.  You'll have to move and resize screens on your desktop when you return, but that's a small price to pay for access to info you need.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great free app sort of a combine of temple run and a little of skylanders too. My boys really enhljoy everything iron man and absolutely love this game and quite honestly I do too. There are plenty of armies Anne you either have to play quite a bit or pay to be able to get more. For 99 dollars yes 99 dollars you can get every option which is insane but the game is a great time though.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This read is a good read for all people who believe in Greek and roman mythology. In all I recommend reading this!
B006PAZMMK|3.0|I got this album mostly for the single, but ended up liking a few more songs. It's a album I mostly listen to while driving.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I've had two editions, first the LV, then the DVD. This Blu-ray is supposedly a further \\"restoration\\" of the film, and is magnificent. The non-desert sequences have a color richness (not just saturation) I've never seen. Sharpness and detail are exemplary. (Note the printing on Bentley's business card.) \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" actually /looks/ as if was shot on 65mm film.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some scenes show vertical yellow-green streaks. No explanation is given, but this is presumably damage caused by desert heat or lab errors. One wonders whether an attempt was made to reduce them to invisibility.<br /><br />Some people have complained about sound levels. The British typically mix for \\"natural\\" voice levels, rather than trying to maintain balance with the rest of the sounds. This can be highly annoying, especially on TV shows where it can be hard to understand what the actors are saying (qv, \\"Rumpole of the Bailey\\"). In \\"Lawrence\\", the difference between quiet voices and the loudest music is /so/ wide that you need speakers that can play at high volumes without sounding strained or distorted.<br /><br />\\"One of the greats\\" (and an obvious forerunner of another Oscar-winner about going native). An essential part of any movie library.<br /><br />PS: The young'uns might wonder why Feisel has such a familiar voice. Don't tell them.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|The four words that spring to mind are 'Lifetime Movies for Women'.  The plot was beyond predictable...a disappointment after reading all the reviews.  A run of the mill romance novel.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Lots of big name stars...but no compelling plot or acting.  The film version of Lincoln is far from what we know about him from letters and accounts of the time, and appears to have been re-invented to make him more...presidential?  Or perhaps just more box office worthy.  The plot is hardly riveting since it's based entirely around the passage of the 13th amendment and with so many fabrications and inaccuracies mixed in with historical events, it was hard to understand why they even bothered.  It's not as if it made it a better story.
B0055B0MIO|4.0|I have liked trivium a lot more in the recent years than when they first came out. This a really good album, showing their heavy side along with the song writing.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Brought back both the good and bad memories of high school. Well written and believable. I look forward to seeing the movie.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is the best book. The best story. Words fail me. You must read this  one for yourself! I have to admit I did skip some of the history.
B000HZGBLA|3.0|It was a fun movie made from a video game.  Pretty predictable.  Acting nothing too special.  The extras were interesting in that Angeline did her own stunts.

B0047E9TRA|5.0|This is one of Stephen King's old school best horrors!!!!! If you want to see good horror this is your movie. If you want to see a what if situation where your own prom had problems and you think &#34;what if?&#34; here you go!!! &#34;Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it. My prom didn't happen so what do you think cheered me up!! And no, I didn't need something that drastic then but it would have been nice to scare the crap out of people who really ticked me off.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I read \\"Why We Get Fat\\" last summer while on vacation on the advice of Instapundit blogmaster Glen Reynolds. I'm not much for reading non-fiction during vacations but this book was a great read and eye-opening. I'm 62 and my weight had crept up to 225, my blood pressure was way too high, cholesterol to match and I couldn't move like I used to. So I took the book's advice and went low carb. I did Atkins and lost almost 50 pounds. I don't want to say it was easy, it isn't. But I'm eating real food and feel better than I have since I was a kid. My doctor is amazed and so am I. I recommended the book to him. And I recommend this book to you too!

B0091W7K6K|5.0|Bullitt has been known for a long time for its car chase and for its noir and anti-hero script. I wondered how it held up after all these years; and it turned out that it is still iconic and just a first-rate film. Everything works perfectly, and even the sound during the chase scene adds to the thrills. Steve McQWueeen made his reputation in this, and I recommend it to all viewers.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I personally love Rio..the songs mainly my kids love it my son had it playing repeatedly to the point when I'm like ok kid pick another movie
0765325950|3.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />I really don't get the 5 star or the 1 star reviews. If you loved it, you don't know what constitutes good writing. If you hated it, how did you get through the first 13? It's not like this is any worse. In fact, it's better than most of the middle of the series, when the only disease Jordan seemed to be suffering from was diarrhea of the mouth. At least the last two books moved.  But man, what absolutely average writing. The part near the climax that actually mentioned writing about the last battle actually cracked me up, because it seemed like Sanderson was acknowledging that the whole series was overwrought.<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad it's over.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|What a great tribute to a great play. The actors are awesome. The music and sing gave me goose bumps. The ending was spectactular !!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this because my twin grandchildren had to read it for school and their reactions were so opposite and intense that I had to check it out. Wow! The book is set in a very evolved world where every aspect of life is controlled and regulated. Pain of any kind has been eliminated, or can be with a simple pill. Everyone has work, selected for them by the governing council, and there is no hunger and no poverty. Behavior is rigidly controlled. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy, 11 going on 12, which is the age when career assignments are given and they move from children to adults-in-training. This is a very profound book and I'm grateful that at least some schools are requiring kids to read it. At 12, the twins seem to be getting the implications of the book, so much so that one of the twins was totally upset by it. We had some great discussions about where that came from. It may have been written for kids but everyone should read this. It's a more modern 1984, and a interesting take on what the world could look like if we try to eliminate all risk and personal responsibility from our lives.<br /><br />My only negative is that I found the ending very unsatisfying...just hoping Ms. Lowry is going to do a sequel. Nevertheless, this book deserves its &#34;classic&#34; status. Now adults like me who were already adults when it was written need to read it, too.
0374533555|5.0|I first listened to this book via Audible.  The book is so rich with fact, ideas, and details, that I needed to get a physical copy of it so I could reference it again and again (and I do)!
B00BCX2F66|5.0|This case fits well. I don't have any issues like others. It looks very nice. All the openings are in the right places. It keeps the HTC One sleek.<br /><br />My only complaint: it's not as strong as the Otterbox case.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The data is presented in a slick and clean ui, it tailors your forecast to your locale which is great as I work and live on different sides of town and the weather can swing widely between them. It's a hefty app and loading times can be long but its well worth it.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is a very good read.  It's fast paced and gives you a  real incite into being a Seal.  It also answered a lot of questions about the actual mission to take down ben laddin.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Good drama, good acting.  i enjoyed watching this show because I like the interaction of the characters within it.Good shoe.
0811874192|1.0|I had enjoyed looking at it at a friend's home and decided I wanted to send it to someone who would enjoy it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a great telling of what it takes to become a SEAL and then a detailed presentation of the mission to get OBL
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game .very addicting.you can get this game for free.unless you don't get it on a free day.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Daughter, who is easily frustrated, enjoys this game.  As a non-player, I love watching the characters over her shoulder.  What a great idea!
B0000CGV00|3.0|Sound quality is bad. The volume either to faint that I have to manually turn it up, or too loud that I have to reach the volume control to turn it down. The voice and the piano match well.
1439190275|5.0|Excellent follow-up reading/guide to Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes.  These books will change your life!  My family is keeping our local tailor in business!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|At first I thought this was too much for my pea brain to handle. But since I have tenacity at least, I kept at it.  The hints are helpful (if you read them, which I didn't notice at first!)  Comments are humorous.  VERY addictive! I must not have a pea brain after all!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Kids are hard to impress but love this game.  They keep going back to this one.  I love the fact that it has 3 different corgis to be adopted.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I have always loved this movie and wondered why it took so long to migrate to blu ray.  This is the best this movie has ever looked or sounded.  If you are a Streisand fan buy it now.  The video quality is better than the audio, but when you consider how old this movie is, they did an amazing job on it.  No other release compares to this one.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Love the story, setting very unique, battles, excitement and the story often does not go into the expected story line.  Great crew, world and inner voicing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app was great. I defently reccomend buying it! It's just like the real Minecraft. (but without the sprint) They should add that. But overall awesome app! Well done Mojang.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game I just wish that the cutie mark crusaders were bought with bits not gems and they should add discord
B003XF1OK4|5.0|This book contains a quality of description that is almost overpowering at times. The subtle ways in which the interconnecting stories are woven together are wonderful. The internal observations of these characters will echo true with the thinking reader.<br />If your The Hours experience has only been the film, this book will provided added detail to each character. An excellent read.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I cannot stress enough on how much I love this movie! It is the best I have seen in 2012! I will purchase the DVD when it releases this month of May!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I heard everyone talking about Downton Abbey and decided to watch one weekend. I finished the whole season in one day!
0345803485|5.0|the story line is very captivating and very entertaining, the book held my attention through the whole book which for myself is hard to find a book this good
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book hooked me from the beginning...a must for me to keep reading.  The characters were complex and believable.  Anyone with, or having raised, a teenager will identify with the multitude of emotions by both parents and child in this book.  I really enjoyed this book altho it was somewhat disturbing.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This is the browser Amazon should have put into the Fire series of tablets.  Great response, it allows you to load Flash, you can store and organize bookmarks by the hundreds.  Along with ES File Explorer you have a set of tools to make Fire HD into a real research tool.  Wonderful app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the books that if you get the sample and read it, you will certainly end up purchasing it to find out what is going on.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Enjoy watching reruns whenever I want.  Actors are great--go Caskett!!  Lots of laughs, romantic looks, and a little drama thrown in
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love the modern sound paired with the throwback feel of 70's funk. Just makes you wanna get up and dance!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It speaks of the horrible evil that man can do to other human beings. And the hope of the human spirit in the midst of such suffering. And the truth that this life is not all there is to hope for.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so tired of the &#34;powers that be&#34; thinking that reality television is acceptable viewing for the individual with any sense of quality entertainment.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  It's interactive and keeps her attention.  I just wish it had a back button or you could forward it pass the screen you already completed.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|It is a great feature to be able to watch NCIS on Amazon (through the Wii) now, rather than linking up a computer to the TV and watching through the web browser.  For a while, I was getting the most recent episodes for free, but am now paying for them ($1.99 for the non-HD version).  I don't know if the episodes that were free were just an Amazon promotional deal, but $2 is not a bad price.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|there is too much in this movie that is not ok for kids to watch, don't waste your time or money on this movie.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I am constantly amazed at the angles this program has.  It truly keeps you interested without boring you, because even when you think you see what's coming next, chances are, you'll be wrong.  I will repeat:  Good Stuff!
8361421475|5.0|Lots of nice color artwork for modelers.Good close up detail shots. Has  restored aircraft at the end..Actually,would have liked a larger format but still not bad. .
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Was like revisiting an old friend - loved the series originally and was fun to &#34;go back in time&#34; and watch it again.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game alot...I spend a lot of time on my Kindle playing games...it relaxes me...when I am tired.. I also play the games a lot st school..
B003U4UNPK|5.0|... the writers of Lost throw in more turns and twists that keep you hooked!  LOVE this show and will be sorry when I've watched all episodes from all seasons.
B00BAVJW8Y|5.0|This is a brave attempt to summarize what is vaguely service design practices.<br /><br />The good thing is that, literally 100% of the stuff, theories, best practices, tools, etc., can be useful to all kinds of designers, because designing always demands a mind set that affords it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who consider himself/herself any kind of designer, or someone who has anything to do with design.<br /><br />Great reference for problem solving.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The only complaint that I have is that I get random disconnects usually within the first 15 minutes of using them. This makes it impossible to use with Google voice. When gaming I have to exit the game and wait for them to reconnect as the game will never recover from the dropped connection. I now use a cheap USB corded headset for when I have to remote into work while being on the phone in my basement (poor cell reception). I have tried all the tricks too, changing wifi channels on my APs, updating drivers, using different USB ports,etc. I would send them back for replacement but many people report having the same problems when they get it back.<br /><br />But when it works, it works great!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|An animated film about a misunderstood video game villain that will appeal to kids and adults alike. Geeks  will especially enjoy all of the classic video game characters and references.
B0086KFB3W|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time - assigned by the leader of my book club - read it twice, enjoyed it more the second time.  Loved every one of the characters - felt that we all became friends while reading the book  - will probably read it again - just to have these memorable folks back in my life. Also, learned a lot about what people suffered during WWII and the occupation by German soldiers.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I bought this for my Dad atfer we saw in the theater, & it a great movie! I did not watch it on Amizon.com. Could have, but was looking for a different move. I think anyone who is an Eastie would like it!
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen and the music is beautiful, it's the kind of movie you can watch over and over.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|This is the first really good gangster movie in a long time, and perhaps the best to channel 1940's Hollywood since LA Confidential.
B00683JLXA|5.0|My grandson loves the game, I am asking him so this review is from him. He said its kind of like angry birds to Him.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was a great quick read. it was good all the way through the last page.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|You don't need to be English to enjoy this very well written adventure a one man who believed he could make a difference in someones life.....it's the means to that end that make this such and enjoyable and reflective read.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|This movie really has it all, and it's one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended to anyone.
B009RH973I|4.0|My wife is very happy with her cover. The grandkids dropped her Kindle and no damage! She loves the bright pink as it Isis so much easier to see than her old black cover!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is a favorite author.  Each story has intrigue, realism and a gift of putting you in the place where it is happening.
B003EY62II|3.0|It was a fun family movie. Not something I would say you HAVE to see, but my kids found it entertaining. My youngest decided he likes the cartoon better though.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on one of the best gangster movies of all time, and one of the best performances of Al Pacino's career.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Very similar to the web twitter. I prefer uber social on my phone. THe notifications on the kindle are cool
B006KX3GXO|3.0|i like it but it has a lot of problems to make it so i cant get into the app fix this and it can be bumped up to five stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It has good graphics and its really addicting and fun. Everybody needs to get this game! The best part is that its free. So you get a great game for FREE!!!!!!! Isn't that just great?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I'll admit, Ben Affleck is not one of my favorite actors, but he really does an excellent job directing and starring in this film. It has a pace and style that keeps your attention from start to finish.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Awesome I liked the plot and detail. Very vivid details. I can't wait to read the second book. Oh yeah
0525953590|5.0|Extremely understandable explanation of modern physics even for a non physicist with a foreign mother tong!<br />As a supplement reading I  recommend: Lawrence M. Krauss, A Universe from Nothing
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I found this to be a gripping story located in a part of the world I knew little about even though 1/8 of my ancestors hailed from Ireland -- north, I think.  The poverty depicted in this book is mind boggling.  I have ministered to the poor in South America for 50 years, but I have never seen anything like this.  I believe the book to be true and biographical.  I give it 4 stars because it is a well-written, eye opening, gripping tale, but I took off one star because the ending is so horrible.  Frank, couldn't you have told us a little of your life in America after your first depressing night in your native land?  Did you ever help any of your relatives to get to the USA?  I see that you had a prosperous life with a marriage and children and grandchildren -- we would like to have heard something of this.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I just love this app...... puts a smile on your face because it is so crazy, my grandson just LOVES IT!!!!!
1936891026|5.0|A fellow coach of mine asked me to read \\"The War of Art\\" many years ago. So glad I did.<br /><br />Steven Pressfield wrote this for writers. Though he also talks about actors, and professionals, etc.<br /><br />The main focus of the book is Resistance. Pressfield gives Resistance a persona, a personality which makes the word come alive.<br /><br />Everyone should read this one, at least once. [[ASIN:1936891026 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]]
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is addictive but can suck you in to buying it diamonds. It also gives you a lot of what you don't need and not enough to advance you..
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This series is realistic and heartwarming at the same time sexy. Very entertaining to read I am enjoying all in this series
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|The characters in this book are well developed and very interesting.  I enjoy the unique perspective of this author, good book.
B00BNR6RCE|5.0|Bob Marley, is the greatest! Thank you Mrs. Marley, for waiting for the Children to become of the right age to treat the music of Bob with the respect it commands. And thank you GOD, for Bob Marley, he is truely a Great Gift, from the All Mighty, himself. Jesus, and Bob, are up there Jammin' and Dancing to Bob's Music and WORD's everyday, looking down upon us, with the Greatest Smiles. Amen! Sincerely, Jon Berry Linder, Photographic Artist.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This group is simply amazing!  The lead singer's voice is somewhere between Janis Joplin and Bessie Smith. Thank you Sherman Alexie for bringing them to my attention. They are definitely not mainstream play, but eat the music up with raw emotion and pure talent. They are real. Give them a try if you want to get out of a music rut.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and was very happy when this came out but it still needs more stuff but I am sure they'll. fix that in the future its worth $7 so everybody get it now!
B0058W74UY|2.0|It simply didn't do what I wanted it to do.  There are certain videos on the Internet that require Flash in order to play them.  I thought this App would accomplish it, but it didn't.
B008PZZD68|4.0|The book is amazing. The movie was done well.<br />I like the cast. Suspence, drama and action!<br />Thank you! Bill
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I own them all can't wait for each episode to come out. I watch each one over and over and they make me laugh.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|The movie is HORRIBLE. I could not even watch it more than 30 minutes I think. I stopped and went watch something else.
B00B1OEP32|3.0|I bought this album at a discounted price and it was totally worth it, music was what I was expecting, was amazing.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|You always need a dictionary.  This one is great, easy to use, and it is free.  You start typing the word and it will bring up several words until you find yours- great if you are not sure of spelling.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|These Dr. Panda Apps are so good for children.  My 4 year old grand-daughter loves this app.  Graphics are so cute and when they are playing they are learning.  There are shopping carts and the animals match what is on the board to what is on the shelf and put in their cart.  There is a cappuchino maker, there is a checkout and they can scan the items and match up money to put in the register.  There are so many different things in this app.  I highly recommend it.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Great CD from beginning to end. Catchy songs, great lyrics. Some slower songs and great fast songs as well. Strongly recommend.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|Varying tempos, styles and key signatures make this an album you can listen to without getting bored. This band is skilled enough to pull it all off without any strain or awkwardness.  This is a collection of songs that is fun  - and not wearying - to listen to straight through.<br /><br />If you only know of Walk Off the Earth from their famous &#34;five people playing one guitar&#34; cover of Gotye's Somebody That I Used To Know on Youtube, then you've only seen the tip of the iceberg. Their original music is every bit as clever and fresh.  Don't be afraid to pull the trigger on this album. You'll be glad you did.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good guessing game if a little mean spirited.  Certainly different reading for me but I guess there are people as calculating as that.  Can't wait for the sequel (Rosemary's Baby).
0385120508|5.0|I first read this book many years ago and really enjoyed it then so I decided to read it ago--enjoyed it probably more the second time around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. I am enjoying the series and cannot wait to see the movies. The book has a great sense of action and intrigue
B003PBB4ME|4.0|The only issue is the top Shoes feels a little cheap and comes off, but other then that, it's a great product!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I've been listening to is pretty non-stop in the car for the past 3 weeks.  Quality.  I thought the band had jumped the shark.  Apparently I was wrong.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This has got to be the absolute best Bond movie ever made.  This is even better than Connery which was hard to contemplate.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Excellent! Shakespeare's The Tempest meets 1950s sci-fi with a healthy amount of post WWII American culture. Beware of the id!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Great show great delivery, awesome to have it immediately. Really simple to find and order. If you need help they make it easy to ask
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It keeps us playing. My little girl lobes the game too.. its so much fun:)  download now!!! You'll play all day!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|One of the best ensemble casts on the Internet.  Almost as good as Firefly.  The dynamics between the characters makes them come alive in my mind.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was not expecting to like this book, from what I heard about sexual content.  That said, It was amazing.  Anna and Christian drew you in and you just couldn't put book down!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were both was terrific in this movie adaptation of Victor Hugo magnificent book .In fact all the cast were excellent
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Every episode grabs your attention from the start. Themes in both family and work hold the viewers attention, and even after four seasons, the show never becomes repetitive.
B009R659L8|3.0|Typical. Too long. Could have ended much sooner. Only one surprise. Too many characters to remember . Still like her novels but have become too predictable and formulaic
B000T06172|5.0|I bought this album in vinyl years ago and always loved it. It is my favorite Beach Boy album, but I haven't listened to anything on my old time stereo system in ages. When I found this in digital, I jumped on it and at a great price. I downloaded the songs and WOW, now I remember why I always thought this was the absolute BEST of the Beach Boys. This is just a very easy to listen to compilation of songs. I love it.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Ok, even I loved this one; of course, I watch every movie my kids watch anyway, but this one was really good.  Very colorful, loved the move &#34;Sugar Rush&#34;; I could not get that song out my head.  The plot, the whole movie flows very well.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have had the pleasure of the acquaintance of a number of dogs; my Jack Russell is napping in my chair. I related to the book in so many ways. I laughed and I cried. I almost didn't buy it because I knew it would be sad but I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Thank you Garth Stein
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I thought it would be very fun which it kinda was, I wouldn't waste $5 on it maybe $2 or $3 though
B005KTZ05G|3.0|My son loves assassins creed, he played with this toy until it was almost destroyed.  The action figure is very beautiful but it is not very durable. The hidden knifes broke in the first week and after some months it lost it's color.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|My kids have seen all of the Ice Age movies and love them, and this one was added to list.
6304698682|5.0|As a movie fan, and a great fan of Eastwood and an even greater fan of justice (sadly lacking these days!), if I could ride a horse and shoot a pistol, I'd be his sidekick in this movie.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This is a great read. It covers exactly what it said it would. On a bad note though all maps and figures are for some permission issues not displayed at all. It is a great handicap when reading this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Hubby and I play every day. Wish we could win the $$$ though.....still a good time. The thrill is fun
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|This was a good, funny movie.  I think some of the humor was over my 3 yr & 19mnth head, but they still enjoyed it!
0800141601|5.0|Without fine actors and actresses, a movie is just a movie. This film has 'em. Nice plot, too. Good scenes, lots of witty humor to soften the brutality. Excellent display of humans being humans, some good, some bad.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I'm echoing the message everybody with a kindle fire is saying... do not buy this if you own that device. You can only make it halfway through the game because you cannot click on one of the hidden objects you need since it is located behind the Fire menu tab.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|A classic.  I remember when this first came out.  An instant classic.  And it remains one of the best of all time.
B00AOOIIVA|3.0|I really didn't know how well the kids would like it.  I thought the movie was pretty good for it being &#34;black and white&#34;.  I gave it &#34;3 Stars&#34; because only 1 of my 3 kids liked the movie, my 6 yr old daughter.  Some kids might not be interested in it because it's black and white, but if they watch it long enough to see what's going on, they will see it's a pretty good movie!
0790729644|5.0|Now, we're all different with different tastes. Having said that, my movie taste buds come alive at the mere mention of Clint Eastwood. So, if you're thinking about buying this excellent movie (my opinion), get ready for some raw action. But I do think you should buy it, anyway.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is the best set of DVD / music that was ever done by The Eagles...Best money spent. Great to know all about how The Eagles were formed and how the songs were created. AGAIN &#34;BEST EVER&#34;
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A different approach for our hero. Combines with both good guys and bad guys. Lots of surprises thought the book. Keeps you guessing throughout.
