1608199096|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my father and boy has it paid off.  We have family dinners every week and lately we've been treated to some really tasty dishes from this wonderful book.  The pictures are beautiful, the content is great, but the food is just SO good.  If you are a foodie and/or love to cook creatively, if you love Italy, if you like to experiment--buy this book.
B002QYSZBO|4.0|one of my all time favorite moves. it is an interesting mystery with a bit of comedy and sharp dialogue.
B008KYWN2Q|5.0|They are so comfortable, it's like they take on the shape of your foot! My size is normally a 5-6 depending on shoe, and this 6 fits perfect.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|this is a great program for garbage collection.  I get less freeze ups and slow downs when I use it.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Very well done, by far underated. Stayed true to the story while still bringing it alive on screen. Much more so than Les Miserable a movie made from a play cut entirely from close ups! which is BULL! who wants to look at a head singing for 3 hours? This movie DOES EVERY EXCELLENT! and Gerard butler never even had singing experience
0345803485|5.0|Haha when I don't have a tie on I like putting it to my neck so I can feel like Christian Grey. It's about a CEO that can do whatever he wants and gets whatever he wants. It's sort of like twilight in a sense except theres nothing mythical. Man wants woman, woman wants man, big barrier, fights, contracts, whips, etc
144174424X|5.0|this is an absolute must in every conservative library. some of the examples are a bit dated but the principles are portrayed perfectly.
1451620829|5.0|Awesome book!! Been a KISS fan since I was a kid. Read the book within two days. Loved it! : )
B0097HSS4M|2.0|Not as Good as I thought it would be.  Not a flexible tool, awkward to use.  Not impressed with outcomes.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I spent some time playing with mine, and it took a long while to get set up. If you can go roku or Apple TV, do.
0060512806|3.0|Cryptonomicon is a difficult book for me to review. On the one hand the treatment of the World War II characters Waterhouse and Shaftoe is brilliant. On the other hand, I found the present-day characters and storyline rather boring. While trudging through the book I almost felt a little twinge of emotional pain when I knew a 2000s-era chapter was coming up. At times, those parts of the book were just plain dull, especially when sonorous email texts were presented. But the WWII-era narratives were absolutely golden. If you are a tech nerd who wants to understand in a humorous context the heritage of technology and warfare, Cryptonomicon is your book. Just watch out for about half of the text.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I love this movie, it arrived very fast. It is so funny and a must see for any new mom to be.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|Should be on everyone's to watch list, I would consider this one for my top 10 desert island picks, classic...,..,
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It is a great sequel to Beautiful Creatures....Introduced some new people that you learn to love through the series. Great Book.
B0000CBHOI|3.0|This was a heavily edited version from the original. The original was on ten DVDs and this is seven.  I thought it was condensed. Really disappointed.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I have reviewed the knots and the app set up and found it to be one of the best knots guide I have found to date. Having been in Search and Rescue for many years and also working with paracord as a hobby I have this very easy to use and understand. Anyone who needs a simplified way to work with knots is encouraged to check this app out. It is well worth the price.
1934030198|5.0|Perfect book!<br />Teaches you not only how to scheadule and plan your season, but also how to face you workouts.<br />Very compreehensive, detailed and dense.<br />Recomend to everybody. Everybody with no exception. For those who want to sefl-coach themselves, and for those who have coaches.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love scribblenauts and when I found the app I was so excited to get it! It is very fun and features challenges and free play, so you can do a puzzle or make it up your self!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My grandson loves it. He played it quite often while we were on vacation and still loves to play at home. the game keeps him occupied when his mother does her housework.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I love reading novel's. Reading about the different cultures give me an perspective of their live. It does have a very good story line. I will recommend this novel to everyone that I know.
1781162646|4.0|Oh that Stephen King. Is there anyone who still thinks of him as just another horror story writer? I read his first few books and then got overwhelmed by the pace at which they were published. I would pick one up now and again over the years, and I was never disappointed.<br /><br />It's still hard to keep up. He seems to be publishing more books than ever these days. I picked this one up because as someone who grew up in a coastal town with amusement parks, albeit a bigger town than Heaven's Bay, NC, with more parks, I thought the setting would be interesting. Was I ever right about that!<br /><br />I would have loved this story even without the mystery aspect. King makes all of the characters come alive and his description of carnival life is so vivid that you feel like you're walking on the midway. To be honest I would have given Joyland five stars but I realize that not everyone is as attracted by the beach town setting as I am.<br /><br />One more thing, and again, this has little to do with the mystery. There are scenes in this book that I found really moving. The difference between King and the other writers who ply this territory is the way he makes you care about his characters.
1878424319|3.0|So far so good, it makes you see things in a different light and gives a lot of good insights.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|I cannot get enough of Dexter. Simply love him! A spell binding Series. You wont regret your purchase. Take Care
B002KDSBGA|5.0|The best movie a real lassic. One can see why Gregory peck won academy award. Btw the author went to the university of Alabama. Roll Tide
B005D63ICI|5.0|I don't know what it is but I am totally hooked on this serial killer. I cannot wait to watch episode after episode. Is there Dexter Annonymous. Having a fetish for knives, I love his. I get off off  this type of genre. It is both suspense and drama.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just received it yesterday and hooked it up. Very easy to setup, you have 2 options for its power source. One through USB and the other through a power outlet (i like the USB because the HDMI and USB are right next to each other on my T.V.) Once you plug it in, you need to download the app on either your smart phone, tablet or laptop and it connects really easy, just follow the directions (it only took me about maybe 2 to 3 mins before i was using it) You also need WiFi for it to work. So far you can use it for Netflix, Youtube, Google Movie, and Google music. Hopefully later on there will be more apps that Chromecast will support. But for now it's great, i don't need to watch my netflix on a small screen anymore. I would recommend it.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Dexter sets the scene well. Good writers hold you to your seat watching a waiting. Great background sequence scene of the psychie of a serial killer.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a great beer and pretzels game.  Easy to learn, yet challenging.  Steve Jackson really knows how to design a game.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Movie story is both informative and entertaining. Actress and actors are exceptional. Mature subject and some nudity, but done in good taste.
0679428887|4.0|Robert Harris is a superb author.  The Roman books - especially the first about Cicero - are excellent, as is Fatherland.  This isn't quite up to that standard, but is very worthwhile.
1452101248|5.0|Great book. Recipes so far have been very good, looking forward to trying everything. Nice pictures as well. One Two
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This kiddie pool is great fun for my kids, 1 and 3, especially the sprayers on the sides and the included inflatable toys.  It tends to lose some air over the course of an afternoon, and I never have been able to completely inflate the palm tree, even when the rest of it seems to have plenty of pressure.  But, this isn't too big of a deal, especially at that price point.  We just pushed the tree over to one side and add a little bit of air when necessary.  We used a pump for an inflatable mattress.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I have Sirius on two cars. I couldn't find out easily if i would be charged extra for using the app on my kindle fire. I think I would as an internet option.
B00AYIJJEQ|2.0|Love the show and was happy to get this at first but I chose this set because of a Bonus Disk.  No Bonus Disk was included.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|*There may be slight spoilers, but nothing earth shattering*<br />Ok so halfway thru this book I had to stop and breathe for a few minutes. I was annoyed, exhilerated, excited, angry and hopeful all rolled into one. I was thinking \\"oh! They are great together\\" while also thinking \\"holy h3ll they are a disaster together\\". When I put it down my husband looks at me and I have this big sh1t eating grin on my face and he says \\"what?\\" and I just shake my head and say \\"I started this new book and... I don't know. I'm waiting for the shoe to drop. It's freaking crazy.\\" Abbey made Travis more human and able to feel again, while he opened her up so she could become the person she is, not the person she wanted to be. She had a bad past with her father and that was shadowing all her choices she was making. Bad juju there I tell you. They both needed to grow up some and learn what life is about. I thought Travis was... I don't want to say he was perfect because he really wasn't, but he was...amazing. He was doing his best to change for her. The alcohol and the girls? Not good in my book. I hated it when he started drinking when he was upset. That is when he hurt Abbey the most emotionally, but he wanted to be the person she could always rely on and protect her and provide for her always. So he started to change to become the man she needed in her life. Abbey on the other hand, she didn't know what she wanted. She kept making the wrong choices all the way thru and then got mad at him for choices he made when the split, but in the end she made the right one. They made each other fly with the clouds, but they also clipped each other's wings and spiraled down. I think that's what makes their relationship more real and true. When the bad times were bad, they still found a way to work thru them and forgive each other. There were a few times I thought they wouldn't work because a certain character was being super stubborn and I hated that! (That's a pet peeve of mine with authors. Some of their characters take their stubbornness to the max and then some when it does not have to be that way.) Plus, she didn't speak up at times when I thought she should (Thanksgiving!) Apart they were a disaster, but together they were a Beautiful Disaster and that's where their true love lies. Life is a test and if you find the one you want to ride with on this great journey, it will take heartache and pain and love and joy to get thru it and be better for it on the other side.of their characters take their stubbornness to the max and then some when it does not have to be that way.)

B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl did a great job on writing how women perceive themselves and women in the work force and life.  Simple and enjoyable.
B004RE2J7W|5.0|Absolutely hate it when all the different versions are tossed together.  Poor readers can't tell anything about production quality of the different editions... but so be it.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />THIS REVIEW is of the content itself.  I watched A HARD DAY'S NIGHT with my whole family.  My husband and loved the walk down memory lane, and the kids (tween and teen) liked it as well.  The music, you see, has broad appeal.  And the Beatles sweet and goofy humor appealed them as well.<br /><br />If you are old and stodgy then it's possible you won't care for the movie.  The humor borders on Slapstick at points, with lots of juvenile word play.<br /><br />I thought it was just delightful And the music is fantastic.  The WORST part was the frequency with which people lit up and stood around smoking.  Something parents of young children might want to know.<br /><br />Enjoy.
0765325950|4.0|We did it. We finished the series. I read every word of it out loud to my wife. We completed the journey.<br /><br />A Memory of Light was certainly one of the best volumes in the Wheel of Time series. Sanderson did a great job wrapping things up.<br /><br />However, I find myself asking the same question I asked at the end of the previous volume: Was it worth it? If I knew 15 years ago what I know now, would I have begun the series?<br /><br />Almost certainly not.<br /><br />The series should have been about a quarter the length. That, I would recommend. As it stands, I can no longer recommend it. If people ask for something really good, I give them Ender's Game.<br /><br />So, if you have read all but this final book in the Wheel of Time: You've gotta finish it. It's worth it.<br /><br />If you're in the middle of the series and you want inspiration to keep mucking through, I recommend cutting your losses and just moving on to something else.<br /><br />If you're looking for direction as to whether to begin this mammoth series: Stay away! Read plot summaries on dragonmount.com to see how clever the thing is. Then run for the hills.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|this was a thoroughly thoughtful read with all the necessary emotion for you to understand Ms. Strayed's heartbreaks but enough comic relief to keep you reading..I loved the scene as she get her backpack ready and attempts to wear it. Something I might do.
B00632HWOG|2.0|too many changes..few are intuitive..this survey is ridiculous..have to be flowery instead of succinct.<br />this makes me dislike it even more
B00013RC8O|3.0|Good chase scenes & acting for its time period. I can relate to the era, but seems a while ago!
0375850864|5.0|Great summer read for my soon to be 8th grader. She is really enjoying the story. It was her summer assigned reading .
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this movie is very well written & the actors are very good in it-all of them! From Walter White all the<br />way to the guys on the street, everyone does a GREAT job!!  Looking forward to season 2!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I love Backstreet Boys, and I have since the 90s! This cd is great just like the rest they have come up with
B000001GX8|5.0|The contents and presentation is excellent. This is a modern presentation of an old recording. So nice to listen to an &#34;original &#34; lp on a cd.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I GAVE IT TO MY BROTHER FOR HIS BIRTHDAY !! I'M SURE HE LIKED IT ! I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE , I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE BEGINNING , WITH THE THREE GUYS TALKING ABOUT LEAVING TOWN  AND HOW THE STRIP IS GOING DOWN HILL  ! AND THE WOLFMAN JACK PART  WHEN HE'S IN THE RADIO STATION !! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, GET IT !!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun. I play it a lot. I can't get enough. My horse is the best game ever. A GOOD GAME.
0060833459|5.0|Well reading this book made me change my approach to management - management of myself.  Especially around time management - which fairly half of this book is about.<br /><br />Well written - plenty of interesting examples.  Some examples are old but that only reinforced the timelessness of the material.<br /><br />If a measure of a book is how much it changes what you do every day then this book is massive.
B0077QS9C6|5.0|A must watch for any racing enthusiast. You will want to watch this movie more than one time that's for sure.
0345528581|5.0|This is not a polished book and the author is a bit of a jock - but the exercises are great.  So much stuff on own body weight exercise (I guess more Studio style than Gym style) which is hard to find these days when every one wants to use pin machines.  My PT liked it too.<br /><br />The section on set types (pyramid, ladders etc) could be clearer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book before the movie because I saw Hunger Games before I read it and I regretted it. If you plan on seeing the movie, read the book FIRST!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|It fits a certain mood so well. I like that they have captured a sound like no one else. The banjo is so....contemporary! haha I definitely enjoy the raw emotion from these fantastic musicians.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love  the game it just gets your brain thinking then when you get it right it makes you feel smart
B009CF7GRY|5.0|I love musicals and dance movies.<br />This has a good story line and all the action put together.<br />If you liked the original Footloose, you will love this one.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Witty, great performances by ALL, great sound track, and of course a silver lining at the end of the story!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm guilty of loving the billionaire romance novels that have us all swooning over Gavin Blake, Christian Grey and Gideon Cross. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE them... but it was so refreshing reading about a different kind of love story and in the end, I loved it just as much! Travis Maddox is hot in a different way than many of the other fictional men everyone's buzzing about. He's not some 20 something CEO with boatloads of money. He's a fighter, literally. He's a tattooed bad boy and while I loathe his usage of the word &#34;tats&#34; and how much he smokes, his character seems real. I read other reviews complaining about his craziness and violence. Well yeah, he's kind of violent... like I said, he's a fighter. But did I ever get the feeling that he was a domestic violence waiting to happen? No. He's a guy that lived his life the only way he knew how; &#34;bagging&#34; random girls... until he found the one thing he didn't know he was missing, Abby. I loved her character as much as I loved Travis! Sure she made a few decisions here or there that had me rolling my eyes or wishing she'd chosen differently, but she's an 18, 19 year old girl. There came a point where she did exactly what she had to do, self preservation, and while it was heartbreaking... I loved that she stood her ground. The secondary characters (America, Shepley and Finch) were really great too! I feel like the story was well written, things weren't rushed or drawn out. I started reading the book at 11:30pm and didn't put it down until I was well over halfway through at 5:30am! If that doesn't tell you how good this book is... believe me when I say you won't be disappointed. I was hooked, reeled in from the get go. I've moved on to Walking Disaster which is this story from Travis' point of view. It was amazing being inside Abby's head but being able to hear the other side of the story has me just as excited! If you're trying to decide whether or not to read this book. Stop, read it already!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  I saw the movie years ago when I was a teenager.  Always wanted to read the book but I never got around to it until this summer.  In short,  the book was awesome to the point it was hard to put it down. For anybody interested  in a riveting story, I thoroughly recommend \\"The Godfather\\" as a must read.
B008476HBM|5.0|Never did read this in high school, nor did I ever see a film of it. Thought I should read it before I die. Glad I did. Not sure why it's considered such a masterpiece, for I think of it as a rollicking good summer read. The writing is witty. I can \\"see the movie in my head\\" and that's a sign of good writing to me. I did gain insight into the way we sometimes mistakenly perceive the notion we have of ourselves. I did pause to consider how might I be like Elizabeth in my thinking how fair minded I am when, indeed, I may have a very wrong picture. I truly enjoyed this book and may try some more Austen when I get through a few other books that  require my time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well written. Great perspective on how it feels to be the person with the trauma or disease and how others relate to that person. Big step forward in personalizing the steps forward to a recovery and the problems getting there due to personal relations with family and friends. This insight is also instructive to those members of the family or friends of someone with mental issues.<br />The characters come alive in the story and we see also the progress made by those family and friends of the ill and how they change in relation to the ill person as time and contact increases with him.  Very worth while reading.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|seems simple enough until you get into the higher levels.  kids like it as well. Good for various age ranges
B00CATSONE|5.0|I never thought that I would learn so much from this book. It was enlightening to learn so much about Tesla and his inventions and also that he was the master mind behind a lot of I inventions. I would highly recommended this book if you  are interested in history and the theories behind the scientific mind.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game is a fast-paced, flashy throwback to the old-school SEGA days, and, in the same way, is a bunch of fun. There's a lot of upgrades to keep you playing, and the stylish, explode-in-your-face combos make it worth the trouble.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Really neat that you can choose number of pieces, rotate pieces set on or off, and pretty artwork.  Loving it!  Background music is nice as well :)
1781162646|3.0|King's JOYLAND is a coming of age, summer carnival, ghost story, mystery.  Devon Jones, with his 21 year old thoughts and feelings, fills the pages of this book with his broken heart, and his decision to befriend a very sick 10 year old boy and his beautiful Mom.  This story is populated with all those people and things you'd expect to see at any local carnival, plus a ghost of a murdered girl who sometimes shows herself to special people in the Funhouse.  The descriptions of feelings evoked at the carnie, the special carnie characters, the spunky little kid, and the love lorn heart of a college kid makes this book as much of a nostalgic trip down memory lane, as a thrilling mystery.  Then add in a couple of saved lives, a mysterious fortune teller, the haunting ghost who just wants to 'move on',  while throwing in a serial killer, and once again King has provided everyone with a great read!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Pretty boring read, there seemed to be no real plot?!?  Should have ended it with book 3.  Gideon and Eva are becoming a bore.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|This deluxe set is incredible.  First the re-mastered original is fantastic.  Throw in the jamming and alternate takes CD and it's getting to be must have then you get the smoking hot 1973 live show from Winterland and how could you go wrong.  Dickey Betts is the man and Brother Gregg sounds awesome!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|good price,very entertaining,teaches confidence and the bad guys never win, characters are greast attention getters for my grandson who love it.
B00DU16OJM|5.0|This is an amazing album. Guy is an awesome songwriter! Doesn't get much better than this..There's not a bad song on here.

B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Well written, well directed, perfect actors for the roles.  If you have never seen it before, than go pop some popcorn, get some candy and make yourself a nice drink.  Sit down, and start the movie and you will love it.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is not just another lawyer/legal show...but based on the multi-dimensional characters within a top NYC legal firm.  As such the fashion is stunning!  From the shoe colors with the tailored dresses to the masculine suits with stunning shirt and tie choices.  This show has brought my teenage son and I closer as every episode has a wonderfully integrated movie reference or quote.  The dialogue is well written and performed flawlessly.<br /><br />Parental note:  drug and alcohol use, sexual conversations and situations
B001NAT05W|4.0|Love this movie. It is great some parts were a little corny but this is my favorite female superhero movie!
B000U0F7RG|4.0|The show is fantastic, well worth the money. The packaging is a bit lacking. The Barbie case is really cool, but the DVDs are kept in cardboard folders, which can easily scratch them. I was lucky that none of my discs were scratched, and i keep them elsewhere now to prevent that from happening.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good application for keeping up with weather conditions in your area. I can pull up the weather conditions in a matter of seconds for any area I need. I would recommend this application for everyone.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I could not find this memory card in the stores.  So glad you had it. Now I can use my camera again.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great Book!  I would recommend it to everyone.  I have never read or seen a movie by Nicholas Sparks that was not excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it's fun entertaining and the most funniest game ever ,and that's why I like this game

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I'm addicted to this game, but on my Kindle Fire HD I can't update it...does anyone know how to fix this?
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I'm not a Jane Austen expert like so many of the reviewers, but if you read the book and enjoyed it at all, you are not likely to be disappointed by this movie.  Unlike the 2008 version which leaves out important aspects of the storyline and has a preposterous ending, this one rings true in almost every way.  One exception worth noting is that in the book the Admiral is completely likeable and also a bit goofy or silly.  In this movie, he's quite charming, and not particularly serious but not silly either. I loved the portrayal of Mary, whose obnoxiousness was exquisite and not overplayed. Finally, the absolute best thing about this movie: Ciaran Hinds. He is one of those actors you simply can't take your eyes off of when he is onscreen.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This is my favorite game. Bur I hate that you have to buy games all the time. If you wait you will have to wait 30 minutes just to be able to scratch and win some games. Very inconvenient! But I do love this game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Friends told me about Pinterest so glad that became a free app for my kindle. Lots of fun and interesting things on it. Good recipes, books and other things. Looking forward to trying the recipes that other folks post and seeing humor on the other post.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great acting, funny, love the characters and the plot.  Suitable for older kids/teenagers and adults.  Yes, I recommend watching this movie and be sure to watch it before you see Red 2.

B00DYEN5QU|2.0|Zack Snyder (300, Watchman) did an honest job in trying to reinvent the franchise, however he fell short in the most important area, the story.  Man of Steel had no real plot that develops. I don't mind adjusting the lore (SPOILER: Jonathan Kent dies in a twister?), but above all else you need a story that engages me into the characters.  David S. Goyer (Threshold, Flashforward) story that was penned by himself and Synder lacked any real depth or for that matter originality.<br /><br />I am a huge Superman fan (from Kirk Allen to Dean Cain), and I could even appreciate the better points of Superman Returns a few years back with Brandon Routh as the alien from Krypton which also had major issues, but this film had no \\"WOW\\" Superman moments. It was like watching 300 (nothing but fighting) meets Transformers (hard to follow who was hitting who) meets Cloverfield (the camera shook even on the most intimate close-ups) meets the remake of Godzilla (what's the point?).<br /><br />Now, the good things I saw were actually for once Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Les Miserables) was properly cast as the father of Kal El (Superman), Jor El. Although a short part, his pushy nature of guiding his son as well as the earthlings seem every sincere and more so on the scenes where he puts his baby son in the spaceship that takes him to a strange new world.<br /><br />Okay, Henry Cavill (The Immortals, Stardust) does an honest attempt at playing the American Icon even though he is British. He seems sincere in his convictions and honest to the character. Defiantly a good looking man, but again he as an actor and as a character had very little to stretch his acting muscles on.<br /><br />Amy Adams (Enchanted, Monster) as Lois Lane, although small in part is always a delight to watch. Once again, she didn't have a lot to work with, but what she did with what she had was good. Amy is a far more talented performer than what they gave her to do here in the movie. Another good, short but memorable performance came from Christopher Maloni (Oz, Law & Order) who plays a military sergeant who is the first one to believe and trust in Superman besides Lois of course, weirdly enough.<br /><br />Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves, The Untouchables) as Jonathan Kent and Diane Lane (Perfect Storm, Jumper) as Martha Kent were perfectly cast if not for the re-inventing of the famed Superman lore. Diane was amazing sincere and real while Costner was the most fatherly I have ever seen him perform.<br /><br />General Zod played like a punked up with steroids version of Adam Ant was performed by Michael Shannon (Take Shelter, The Iceman). Although he looked menacing and shouted well, he didn't have the gravitas as an actor to play the broadly proud and menacing personality that is the character. He just came off like a big bully with special powers. Weak of spirit of conviction  if strong in his efforts of pointless violence.<br /><br />The film is too dark to be a Superman film. It is not triumphant and proud and downplays the grandeur of what the American Icon has always represented. I hope Synder does not direct the sequel if there is one and coupled with the gloomy cinematography Amir Mokri (Pacific Heights, Queen's Logic), the not so interesting redesigning of the costumes by Michael Wilkinson (Sucker Punch, 300) and the bold and broad but un-heroic score of Hans Zimmer (The Lion king, Pirates of the Caribbean ), I really hope it doesn't destroy the DC Line of super heroes. Although The dark Knight series did okay (Heath Leadger in the second was my favorite even without Batman in it), I just wish that kids could walk out of Superhero movies these days feeling like a superhero themselves and having fun. Like the Avengers film! There were no claps, cheers, boos or applauds during this film. Superman Return's had that and I won't begin to mention the standing cheers of crowds at Christopher Reeve's Superman: The Movie directed by Richard Donner.  I was more than disappointed and I was really looking forward to this one! Go see Star Trek: Into Darkness - it is a far far far far better film (thick with story)!ted and I was really looking forward to this one!

B008JFUR10|1.0|I'm one of the few that couldn't handle the tediousness of this film.<br /><br />Brilliant director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) really missed this mark on this one big time. He co-wrote the script with Travis Beecham (Dog Days of Summer, Clash of the Titans re-make) from a story that Travis originated, but above all else they didn't come up with characters or people we, as an audience, really care about. There was an attempt at a faulty brother bonding, and another attempt at a somewhat over ambition cross-overs of ego inflated military types and an yet another attempt at a father-son, father daughter-relationship that just wasn't real or believable.<br /><br />Now this film is at least an hour too long as well because it literally runs over two and a half hours. The monster did things that defy their own logic. (Throw real physics out the window of course!) By the 47th building being collapsed, destroyed, knocked-down, I was bored. The sequences are really tied together strangely and the effects, although state of the art, have all been done before. The story is simple. Interdimensional beings have visited us in the past and now they want to take over the earth using a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Really? Yawn.<br /><br />For me, the best thing was this small, but powerful performance by a small Japanese actress played wonderfully by Mana Ashida (The Floating Castle, Beautiful Rain). Her performance was heartfelt, warm and although very short, it was very memorable. She didn't say much, but you knew exactly what was going on in her heart and head.<br /><br />Now they tried to sprinkle in `hip-hop' type humor with Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Beauty & The Beast) playing a Asian mob-gangster (who is somewhat interesting) and a fairly funny scientist/mathematician played by Burn Gorman (Torchwood, The Dark Knight Rises) who does a great job at frustration and being over-the-top controlling as well as an American nerd with the right ideas but the lack of common sense know-how played by Charlie Day (Horrible Bosses, Monster's University).<br /><br />The leads were, as always, pretty to look at but lacked any real depth in their characters. Charlie Hunnam (Children of Men, Sons of Anarchy), Diego Klattenhoff (After Earth, Mean Girls) play the separated brothers, Idris Elba (Thor, Promethius) plays the typical  military leader with issues and Rinko Kikuchi (The Brothers Bloom, Skycrawlers) plays the woman with a secret who's ambitions are subdued by her cultural beliefs.<br /><br />I was so bored with this movie. Please wait for it to come on network TV where they'll hopefully cut out an hour (or two) for commercials. It might be more enjoyable then!he lack of common sense know-how played by Charlie Day (Horrible Bosses, Monster's University).<br /><br />The leads were, as always, pretty to look at but lacked any real depth in their characters.

B0090SI582|3.0|Directed by James Mangold (Night and Day, 3:10 To Yuma), \\"The Wolverine\\" is the 6th installment in the Marvel X-Men series of motion pictures. From the beginning it was marvelously cast with the talents of Hugh Jackman (Les Miserable, The Prestige) who forever launched the Iconic Comic Book Super Hero who is the mutant known as The Wolverine! He always does an intense superb job in this role in every film so far.<br /><br />Written by Mark Bombeck (Unstoppable, Live Free Die Hard) and Scott Frank (Marley and Me, Out of Sight) the story continues from his origin film in the last movie and takes a hard look at how solitude and being anti-social has become a way of life for Logan (The Wolverine). Although not thick in depth of characters, it makes an honest attempt to appeal to the female audience with a hap-hazard love storyish thing. (Not quite as good as in the last film.)<br /><br />Tao Okomoto is introduced in this film as Mariko a woman who was sent on a mission to find the man who saved a Japanese military soldier during the Hiroshima attacks of WWII. Hal Yamanouchi (Push, The Wayback) plays the soldier who Logan saved over 60 years earlier by throwing him into a shelter seconds before the atomic bomb goes off. Logan only finds out the way he wants to `thank' Logan is to take away his powers of superheating and regeneration abilities in order to free him from his supposed `agony' of never dying.<br /><br />Now you have to have  your villains, with a fairly good cast of international Japanese actors like Rila Fukushima (Karma) playing Hal's daughter, the new head of state for a multi-billion dollar company that her father ran, Hiroyuki Sanada (Sunshine, Rush Hour 3), the wannabe billionaire and forced husband of Rila and Brian Tee (Goldmember, When We Were Soldiers) as the head of the empire security who is motivated by nothing more than money and ego. Surprise!<br /><br />Now throw in another mutant, Viper, played masterfully wicked by Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and you have a sci-fi, action adventure with some very good fighting sequences. It reminded me of the old Bruce Lee films or more modern Jackie Chan films were there are several large fight scenes with one man defeating dozens and very cleverly too! Viper is fun to watch once she gets into her `grove'.<br /><br />Of course there is a love story that actually slows the movie down a little and overall it does give the film a more dramatic feel to it. Too much however. I think the director was trying to make it more of a drama than an action adventure film. That's why it kind of doesn't work in parts.<br /><br />However if you are an X-Man movie fan, Wolverine fan or a Hugh Jackman fan, you will not be disappointed.  I think it will hold the interest of the action fans but not so appealing to everyone else for its lack of story and sappy love chimes. The finale fight sequence, although visually stunning, left me with a lot of questions however.<br /><br />SPOILERs: Do not leave at the credit role at the end of the film.....really. There is a short scene that was, quite honestly, better than the film itself - and it  had the audience lightly applauding when one face appeared and then roaring with cheers and applause when another cameo occurred in the same scene. I'll just say if you are a fan of Magneto and Professor X....you are going to love the credits!

B00E00P5JC|4.0|\\"Turbo\\" is another wonderful film for the entire family from Dreamworks Animation Studios. Directed by David Soren (Merry Madagascar) who also co-wrote this film with Darren Lemke (Jack The Giant Slayer, Shrek Foreverafter) and Robert D. Segal (The Wrestler, The Onion Movie). It starts and stay a ittle bit too long in first gear for the first 20 minutes, but then it picks up is pace and we'll have you laughing, cheering and sniffling a lot all the way to the end!<br /><br />With such a heartfelt well-rounded cast, it has Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) cast an over ambitious and extremely wishful snail wanting to be the fastest snail in the world. All he wants is to just enter, and  of course win, the Indy 500. (Yes, he's a snail. Shell and all!) Now of course all his fellow snail friends and co-workers  in the garden he works atand especially his brother Chet,  voiced brilliantly by Paul Giamotti (Sideways, The Illusionist), all have a poor and somewhat pathetic opinion of Turbo.<br /><br />By an act of nature (or chance) and the imaginary champion racer in his head Gay Gagne, voiced and performed artistically by Bill Hader (Suberbad, SNL), he is depressed and discouraged to the point where he teeters over an LA freeway in his rejection. Accidently falling and `fueling' his DNA up with some Turbo charged fluid after falling into a car he becomes FAST. Literally fast. Exceeding speeds of over 100 miles an hour! Now he Is kidnapped by a pair of Mexican brothers for `snail racing'.<br /><br />The story then moves in a parallel line with that of two Mexican brothers (Tito and Angelo) trying to keep a Taco business alive in Van Nuys, CA. The older brother is having a tough time making ends meet while the younger brother keeps coming up with crazy schemes that never quite hit the mark. Tito is voiced sincerely by Michael Pena (The Shooter) who finds and really believes in Turbo and Angelo is voiced by Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights) who is more than skeptical of everything his brother does.<br /><br />Enter literally a \\"gang\\" of snail that will not only encourage and motivate Turbo into pursuing and getting his dream of racing in the Indy 500, but then even help and push him into new heights of both latitude and of the heart. Samuel L. Jackson (Django, The Incredibles) leads the pack as pack with some hysterical sidekicks like Snoop Dog (Bruno), Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaid) as Burn, Ben Schwartz (House of Lies) as Skidmark, Richard Jenkins (Jack Reacher) as Bobby.<br /><br />The story, as you guessed it, allows turbo to enter the Indy 500 and the rest is fast paced, intrigue, drama, action and a lot of near misses because his hero Guy is not quite a man you want anyone to look up too. The real villain is having a low self-esteem in yourself will only hold you back, however when his idol turns out to be something a lot less than he expected, Turbo's heart and drive is literally broken!<br /><br />The movie is fun and it has a lot of California, specifically LA references that will crack you up! The racing sequences are amazing and the whole movie is very colorful just make sure you bring a tissue or two for the end. You'll probably want go and hug all your family members after the movie. This is for the family of all ages I loved this one!

B005LAIIN0|3.0|Paramount Pictures presents and Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland) directed \\"World War Z\\" with a lot of real compassion and interesting action that might make you jump once or twice. However, the story written from Max Brooks's novel and was developed into a screenplay by Mathew Michael Carnahan (Lions for Lambs, the Kingdom), Drew Goddard (Cabin In The Woods, Lost) and Damon Lindelof (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Prometheus) had very strong middle with interesting things being revealed slowly, but left too many questions as to what lead up to the this Zombie-making virus. Not to mention the end of the film which leaves you either to expect another sequel or you're asking yourself, \\"...exactly what the He%$ happened? That's it?\\"<br /><br />Now for the good stuff, Brad Pitt (Fight Club, Inglorious Bastards) is back and he does a fairly decent job playing a father who is only really passionate about his two kids and his wife played by Mereilla Enos (The Killing, Gangster Squad). They both are extremely believable in their somewhat heroic efforts to avoid Zombies, climb buildings and avoid the deadly bite of a new virus. And there way of communicating to each other throughout the movie is extremely poignant to the film.<br /><br />That's the other thing about the sci-fi element in this movie, there is no real explanation of what, where or how this virus develops and it's ultimately still kind of vague on what cure is or reason is for it existing even after the film is over. Also the onset of the virus only takes 10 seconds after you are bitten and then poof, you're a Zombie! Even the most viral viruses we know of on Earth can take as much as 12 to 24 hours to incubate. All that aside, the movie has some great dramatic moments of tension and some surprises that will literally make you jump once or twice right out of your seat. Nothing like a dead person jumping at you (in 3D if you see it that way) trying everything they can to take a bite out of you.<br /><br />The CG Zombies are pretty good and the amount of action from dead people making a \\"Zombie ladder\\" over a wall to an actual airplane crash (complete with an onboard Zombie attack) is all fairly well done. Coupled with an eerie and suspense building score of Marco Beltrami (Live Free and Die Hard, I, Robot), the movie was also slightly humorous.<br /><br />How you may ask? There is a really good scene where Brad has to deal with a Zombie and basically figure out how to get around him to get to a medicine cabinate. In that time the Zombies make this wonderful creepy yet strangely funny clicking noise with their jaws and teeth. It always seemed to get a laugh out of the audience - until they attack you and then bite of course.<br /><br />David Morse (The Green Mile, Contact) plays a creepy ex-CIA agent who basically gives Brad Pitt the reason and motivation of finding out what the source of these Zombies are and where the original virus may have originally come from.<br /><br />It does have quite the international cast like Ludi Boeken (Q, Deadlines) as an Israel official who decided to build a wall around Jerusalem just for this apocalyptic event. (How did he know?)  Daniella Kertesz (Loving Anna, Sceenz) plays an Israeli soldier who loses more than her pride when she is almost killed by the Zobies themselves. And even Fana Mokoena (Safe House, Hotel Rowanda) plays a US official and the only governing congress member on the off-shore government naval vessel who actually help Brad and his family, does a great job of suppressing his fears.<br /><br />Overall, minus some of the story holes and go-nowhere ending, it was an interesting film dealing with some action, suspense and creative make-up effects headed by make-up supervisor Karen Cohan (Captain America, Les Miserables). Although, not to gory, it's probably not for the really young or weak of heart and if you're a Zombie fan, you're gonna love it!><br />The CG Zombies are pretty good and the amount of action from dead people making a \\"Zombie ladder\\" over a wall to an actual airplane crash (complete with an onboard Zombie attack) is all fairly well done.

This<br />book was a fast read but how one becomes a millionaire, loses it all, becomes a millionaire again & again is a mystery but then again, some people choose to live life the hard way and after trial and error.  After considering the source who suggested this<br />book to me, have to say I don't get the high praise they gave of this book and its author.  Sorry.

B0064SHI9I|1.0|Version: MyBackup Pro 3.0.1<br /><br />Pros<br />For me? None.<br /><br />Cons<br />I was advised to do a 'factory reset' because my Samsung Stratosphere was not functioning smoothly (e.g., Messages weren't signaling their arrival either with icon or sound or vibration). Reset, tried to restore the phone through My Backup Pro, and 'FAIL'.<br /><br />From the Rerware help desk responding to my dismay: \\"If you did not receive a failed message then another app or the OS or the user killed our app while in the process of creating the backup file. This is the only time you do not receive our message is if the app got killed during execution.\\"<br /><br />As you can read from the help quote, you may not even receive notice that the backup didn't work! If using your internal SD card, as I did, I think you MUST manually use the My Files internal site on your smartphone(Droid Stratosphere, in my case), determine there is within the Backup Files an '.mbp' file, or you're as doomed as I am to slow rebuilding.<br /><br />Summary<br />I'm only one person, but I give it a hearty 'two thumbs down'. If you like increased heart rate & blood pressure, and, being extremely bored, enjoy spending free time rebuilding one program at a time, go for it!

B0047WJ12K|4.0|I think everyone has seen this movie. I rented this for 1.99 definitely worth renting. The special effects were wow. Very creative story.  I liked the concept of creating dreams versus dreaming about memories. Dream architect.  When you would visit memories people in the dream would look for the dreamer to kill him/her.  That reminded me of Body Snatchers.  It was cool to overlay dreams, you  can dream on top of a dream.

B004EPYZXU|4.0|Maybe my good impression of this movie comes from being a big space geek whose dad worked on the Apollo missions.  I was lucky enough to be able to watch a few of the Saturn Vs launch.  So, I like the kind of realistic minutiae that fill this movie.<br /><br />Out of the gate, the production design is amazing.  The costumes, the props, the lighting - everything is perfect.  The way they matched the new footage to the stock footage is so perfect you can't tell which is which.  \\"Apollo 18\\" was clearly a labor of love for a lot of people, and not a slapdash film.<br /><br />The \\"found footage\\" aspect works well, and I was even able to suspend a lot of disbelief.  I did find myself wondering, not how moon creatures could live in a vacuum, but what they would eat, and how our biochemistry could be even remotely compatible with theirs.  However, the story was interesting, the actors were excellent, and the movie kept me within the movie at most times.  It even delivered a few scary moments.<br /><br />Having said all that, I can see that this movie might be a little slow for people who aren't super into the details of the Apollo program.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's at least worth a rent.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Game installed with no problem. Was able to play it just ONCE with absolutely NO lag, no middle of the screen ads, etc. Since that first time playing, anytime that I attempt to open it to play it again it (1) Locks my entire phone down, thus forcing a battery pull and reboot, or (2) it Lags SO bad that I have to simply force-close it due to the nonstop and constant barrage of the middle of the screen ads that cannot simply be dismissed. Guess I'm going to have to uninstall it.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This is an extraordinary movie that will transport you back in time to December of 2004. The acting and overall ambience of the movie powerfully conveys a sense of presence, a sense of actually being there that makes it hard to believe you are just watching a movie performed by actors.<br /><br />The story follows the experiences of a family of five who are vacationing in a small resort facility on the coast of Thailand when the tsunami of December, 2004 strikes the coast where they are vacationing. Each of the five family members is brilliantly cast and turns in performances that surpass the word performance; you feel you are watching real people really living through a terrible tragedy that will change their lives forever.<br /><br />Each of the family members turns in totally convincing performances and are deserving of the highest praise. Henry, the father played by Ewan McGregor; Maria, the mother, played by Naomi Watts; Lucas, the oldest son, played by Tom Holland; Thomas, the middle son played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, the youngest son played by Oaklee Pendergast all turn in realistic portrayals that convince the viewer they are watching events unfold in real time.<br /><br />Equal praise is due to the director, J. A. Bayona, and the writers, Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez, and Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n. Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n Alv&aacute;rez, who is a Spanish physician, is the real Maria who actually lived the experience recorded by the movie. Maria and her husband Enrique and three sons Lucas, Sim&oacute;n, and Tom&aacute;s Bel&oacute;n are the ones portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Although this is a story of tragedy, it is also a story of love, devotion, and loyalty that is inspirational and positive. It does have some very intense moments and may be unsettling to more sensitive members of the family. It makes the viewer feel they are glimpsing into the humanity behind the headlines of a very terrifying event. The movie is rated PG-13.<br /><br />I give this movie the very highest recommendation.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Star Trek 2009 was glorious; an action-packed and well-thought-out science-fiction flick that breathed new life into an aging series.<br /><br />Into Darkness was illogical, brainless, boring, inconsequential, predictable, techno-babble crap. All the emotions were forced and failed to connect due to god-awful scripting and the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. The science fubars and bouncy, who-give-a-load plot pile more garbage on this mountain of theatrical feces. My hate for this film cannot be exaggerated, especially since Abram's first film was such a success and so connective.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Very informative if you are wanting or considering the Whole30 Challenge!!!! Great read...very easy to understand!!!! Like the lists and how blunt the authors are!!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I had heard an interview with Hosseini on NPR, and really looked forward to reading this novel, having thoroughly appreciated his earlier novels.  This one fell a little bit short of my expectation, although I'd still recommend it.  The continual use of present tense for extended parts of the book seemed awkward at times, and I seemed overly aware of the craft rather than the blending of the characters and their individual stories.  They didn't seem to fit together as seamlessly as they could have, and I never felt completely engulfed in the story the characters unravelled.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like to read books before I watch them on the big screen!!! Loved this book!!!! ahhhh it was amazing Nicholas Sparks didnt disappoint!!! ;)
1932100660|1.0|OK. It is a big fairly well written book, but it is not The China Study, which in no way proves the hypotheses put forward here; that eating only a small amount of animal products will greatly increase ones chance of getting degenerative diseases.<br />People have been eating more like this book propagates, but these diseases are getting worse throughout the world.<br />It is refined carbs that increase degenerative diseases which were never eaten in such abundance before the 1850s in USA and UK and spread to the rest of the world more and more to present. Saturated fat and cholesteral seems to protect people from the onset of these \\"western\\" diseases.<br />This book and governments that push the low fat, cholesteral/high carb myth are doing a great diservice to peoples long term health and are only too pleased to provide drugs and surgical help for the greatly increaseing victims of refined carb related illnesses.<br />Check out the online critiques of this book, which show clearly that the actual China Study has in no way proven the hypotheses put forward in this book.<br />Check out \\"The Diet Delusion\\" which traces the history of the tragic errors of modern government nutrition policies.<br />It was known in the 50s for example that dietery cholesteral had no bearing on blood cholesteral. Also that total blood cholesteral has no bearing on heart attack risk. It is more complicated than that.<br />Read if you like studying nutrition but it is no more scientific than Atkins or any other popular diet books.<br />Weston Price is way more convincing than this.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|now i need to re-watch the series!! Already  started the next book and am hooked again. Thanks George R R Martin !
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Jamie Foxx proves himself to be a serious actor. The movie has a good plot and good character developement. Beware of the violence, this movie is not for the faint of heart.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I love this movie!!  I even named my border collie &#34;Fly&#34;.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone!<br />It's old.
B007EDYN36|1.0|It is not all the trials and tribulations Peter went through that make this a pathetically sad tale, it is the fact that he seldom, if ever, accepts any responsibility for what he has gone through.  Constantly pointing a finger and assigning blame.  That is the saddest part of all.
B00884GR0W|3.0|This game really needs work. The textures are awful IMO. It says it supports controllers. However, when I try my 360 controller, it doesn't work right and eventually ends up crashing. I use a nexus 7, so not everyone may experience this. The quests in the game get really lame. Like kill twenty sharks. No quest markers. Recipes and item usage aren't well implemented. I found it best to dig bare handed. Ugh, there's potential here. Unfortunately, the roaming for quests makes settling down and building a waste.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|He states he has a PHD in the History of religion and the New Testament, that is a lie.  He is not a professor of religion,  no PHD in history.  He is an Associate Professor of creative writing at the Univ. of California. He is also a visiting professor at Drew University on tha art of protest by using art,music and literature.<br /><br />So much for truth telling.  If he can't get his own history right, please, how can he change the history of The Son of God. Save your money on this fraud.  He is being sponsored by Code Pink, Narritive Four, backed by The Tides Foundation and George Soros...enough said.  This is written by a man who said he rejects Jesus...but follows him! To people that don't agree with him on Twitter, he uses a lot of profanity. Stay away from this progressive extremist.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I had initially given this movie a lower rating.  I have to say that when I saw this film in the theatre, I was underwhelmed as compared to the previous LotR trilogy.  I felt Peter Jackson was over reaching in an attempt to make The Hobbit too much like the earlier movies, and I still maintain that it was an error to deviate so much so from the book.  It was just unnecessary to add a large, ogreish gray orc, Lurtz wannabe.  Having said that, I gave the movie a fresh look, knowing how much I was originally disappointed, and I have to say that it allowed me to appreciate its finer points to a far greater extent.  From the arrival of the dwarves and their mournful ode to the Misty Mountains, to the cave trolls, to the interplay between Bilbo and Gollum and their exchange of riddles, that each of them were truly masterful, and I have been finally wooed.  I now wait with anticipation for part II, and the extended version of an Unexpected Journey coming soon.  Many kind regards Peter Jackson,
B000SEI230|5.0|This book along with other Nicholas Sparks novels is well written and will tug at the strings of your heart.  Be sure to have tissues ready as you read.
B000SEI230|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks! Great book, just as good as the movie!<br />I recommend this to anyone that's watched the movie, or if you just enjoy a sweet story.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|I ordered 4 bulbs, one of them did not work at all, the other 3 flickers so badly it's unusable indoors.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Game is fun... story is great, but some puzzles are near impossible and more frustrating then they should be on a small phone screen. For example the robot puzzle, that requires quickly clicking microscopic floor tiles to direct the robot without crashing into the wall isnt happening on a droid x2 lol.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I had a hard time with this one, got confusing at times and not what I really expected out of it.
B005N7CA3A|5.0|At the time I bought Secret Codes and Battleships, I had been listening to almost nothing but Adam Lambert's new album for about 7 months.  This was the first thing that came along and really gave him a run for his money.  Darren is a fantastic songwriter, and I would reccommend this album to anyone with even a passing interest in pop music.  Fantastic.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|First time reading a book by David Baldacci and enjoyed it a lot, looking forward to getting another one of his books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for the whole family. I highly recommend this game for the entire family.  My 14 year-old son enjoys challenging me.  And my 5 loves watching both US play this game.<br /><br />.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I like the songs on the track. He definitely has his own beat in music. I enjoyed him on American Idol and glad that I purchased this.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I wish I would have seen it in the theatre for the 3D effects. I really like Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. This movie was interesting and funny.
B0026P7O6K|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Lizzy's voice and will be listening for as long as im around!! Love this band!!! Keep on bring us awesome music Halestorm.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best of the cop shows. This is all about the seedier side of police work. First and foremost the realistic aspect should not be mention considering that the show is based on The Rampart division and the police corruption from that division. I thought it would be just another cop drama just like every other one you see on TV I am very happy to say its nothing like the rest. The acting in the show is brilliant. The best part is I lived in Echo Park back in the early 80s till mid 90s and the show is right on the money. From the drugs to the gangs to  corrupt cops.<br />It's not always about good guys catching bad guys. In the real world, sometimes the bad guys win - and The Shield does a fabulous job of illustrating this fact. The show is award-winning, and deserves every accolade it receives. When it goes off the air, the void will be hard to fill. Simply put, this is one of the best cop shows I have seen.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|Having been to DG's concert in Seattle, I was looking forward to his recording of the songs Viva La Vida and Cry me a River.  The one disappointment was that Cry Me a River sounded better in concert with his band and the recordings version with orchestra is too refined in comparison.  I still give his \\"music\\" 5 stars!
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Just the right amount of chick-flickiness for me, and enough fast-paced action to satisfy the men in the house. Win-Win!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I did not like this!  It wanted me to link it to my Gmail account, and I already have a YouTube account!  It was almost like it wasn't the real YouTube App.  I didn't like the set up and honestly it was a little frightening walking through the process so I just cancelled it.  I will just use my other digital devices to view my YouTube videos.  I am not usually intimidated by technology but this was weird.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Such a great movie.  All the characters were done to perfection.  Better than all the superhero movies combined.  Cannot wait for the next one.  Who knew the Hulk could be so good after the terrible Hulk movies.  Hulk Smash!  Indeed.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the different clocks, and generally like this app. I wish you could get more sounds/music or use from your own library, but I still like it.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Henry Fonda as a really bad guy.<br />Charles Bronson in his best role.<br />Jason Robards as a bandit/guardian angel..<br />And Claudia, oh Claudia!<br />The best movie score ever too?<br />And a tribute to John Ford.<br />All shot by one of the greatest directors,<br />This is NOT an action shoot em up western.  This is like a symphony where all the parts and characters are fleshed out before their stories intertwine perfectly.  See it.  It is wonderful!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very happy with app so far. Keep it up! Sufficiently challenging. The music is a bit weird though. I guess the levels will become more complex.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun. My 5 year old loves cleaning the paddock and the barn lol. Also he loves giving her treats and petting her. We have her decked out in pink so far and are trying to work up to buying a white horse to go along with our brown Della Rose :)
B005QYKD4I|5.0|FULL OF ACTION .. WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN .. I HAVE SEEN ALL PARTS OF THE TRANSFORMERS MOVIES
B005QUQP76|2.0|From the time I started using this mouse I had minor issues. As minor as clicking the mouse resulting in a high pitched squeak. A couple months later, it completely stopped working. It was being used mostly as a workplace mouse because the macros came in handy for copying, pasting, and other things. However, the macros stopped working, then the adjustable dpi stopped working (putting the dpi at an unusable level) and reflashing the firmware did nothing. After, I contacted support where they had me pay shipping to replace my mouse, leaving me without a decent mouse for nearly a month while I waited for them to receive my old mouse and ship out a replacement. All in all, it would've been a great mouse had it done what it was supposed to have done.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a classy romance. The actors and actresses were properly hand picked for each character. I am not sure how many times I've viewed this in the past. But it is worth seeing this again and maybe again after that.The enchantment of the music and scenery has been the reason at times for me wanting to see it again just to relax with it on an overcast day.<br />I really did not like the more recent one nor did I `get' it. It was sort of a badly done caricature that was supposed to be Jane Austin's work which was hard to look at strait on. This one is longer but it is the one to watch!
B009EAO38C|5.0|Would recommend to any music lover. Nice way to introduce your youngsters to a combination of popular music with a classical flare.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is a cleverly done flashback  film. Bringing tears to the eyes it depicts the wonder of Divine Providence and the epidemic of the exploitation of the young, which is happening in many countries. The acting is great and the soundtrack is cool. This is quality drama, there's so much movement in the soul.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was challenging enough to keep me engaged yet easy enough to keep me from getting discouraged. I did not want to stop.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Subtle moments are carried by some very pretty pieces of music which build towards a romance developing in the midst of the main character's losses, sorrowful losses. The man who repulsed her, she grew to love which was unexpected to her (and to me) given his character was seemingly incapable of a respectful manhood.  *It's BBC without any inappropriate scenes.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|The Rock is one of my favorite actors, smooth, cool with a bad temper lurking just under the skin.  Great action movie!
1616615362|5.0|X-Wing is an addictive miniatures game.  Be sure to grab the expansions and core games when they are below full suggested retail price. And, have no fear because Fantasy Flight Games announced that it is reprinting the hard to find expansions which will bring down the cost of the A-wings and TIE Interceptors ([...]
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It just works. Easy to set up and works for all my Android devices and IOS devices. At $35, it is a steal.
B009LIQ5FQ|5.0|This is the best Pogues performance I have ever seen and I have been a fan since the beginning. Shane McGowan remembers all the lyrics and gets all his cues. The musicians are terrific. I have watched this DVD several times and enjoy it more every time
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Things I like about it:<br />1. You can make a lot of  Things<br />2. There are challenging levels to keep you entertained for a while<br />3.in some levels you have to use different adjectives to make it challenging<br />4. It's fun for all ages<br />5. You can ride animals etc.<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br />1. They need to add more things<br />2. Needs more backgrounds<br />3. Some levels are too hard<br /><br />Other than that, it's a very fun game!  I highly recommend it for everyone!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it it works and wakes me up in the morning. just don't forget to adjust the the volume before sleeping.
B000000WJ2|4.0|I chose four stars because although I love Keith Richards I would suggest he get a singer to convey his message . It is rock and roll and great guitar but ....
B0062O85IW|5.0|I have worked with other spreadsheets for 20 years<br />and have never used a book this easy to use<br />with so much information  The help is excellent also
145210655X|5.0|Star Wars fans must have. Very touching story of Lord Vader and a little boy who does what all little boys do.
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|Full of research-backed insight, case-studies and surprises about how we approach our careers, what works and what doesn't. It solidifies the concept that working with an altruistic approach to the workplace is beneficial to both the giver and the recipient, while highlighting the pitfalls of pure selflessness. Anyone looking for effective management techniques would find it practical, those with an interest in social dynamics would find it fascinating, and if you are looking for evidence that success doesn't demand selfishness, look no further.<br /><br />Full praise to Adam Grant.
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|This was not worthy in any shape or form of being included in the Evil Dead Series.<br />This was a standard souless horror film.  It was not a re-imagined attempt to update, it was just a cheap grab at the wallet.<br />It should be renamed so as not to confuse this with the original series.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I downloaded the game, but then it just kept telling me to update the game... I felt that since I just DL'ed the app I shouldn't have to, but it wouldn't work unless I did, so I removed it!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I loved it's quirky offbeat sensibility.  Very enjoyable.  It is clever and funny, violent in a way that fits the material, and a 'go for it' outlandish plot.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A great read that kept me deeply engaged throughout.  One can not recommend it too highly.<br />Give it a serious look.<br />Robert Salley
B0058W74UY|1.0|Did nothing but waste my time and jack up my kindle. Shouldn't there be some kind of rule that if you put an app out there that it should work?
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This app works great on my Samsung Note II. I have been using this app for years, Im glad Amazon offered this for a really great price. I couldn't turn this one down at all!!
0062255657|3.0|Well written and easy to read, but a very strange story. I'm not sure I understood the point of the story
B005MMYCY6|4.0|Joseph Gordon - Levitt does a great job acting. He plays a long-haired radical hippie type character that wreaks havoc on a family during a troubling time for them. I got a lot of laughs out of this movie! I thought the acting was good and I had no idea where the movie was going! Good Movie!
1419347004|4.0|I like Sophie Kinsella story about Becky in the &#34;Shopaholic&#34; saga. It is funny and you can't help it to like this spoiled beautiful but good intentioned  girl to find herself in the real world. Funny and entertaining!
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|This book is a really great read. The character development and the storyline is fantastic. I recommend it to any and everyone
1620904365|5.0|I like books where every page keeps me in suspense.  This is one of those books.  I could not put it down and never wanted it to end.  LOVED it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really enjoying this game. Not too difficult or too easy. Good quality graphics for a cell phone app. Highly recommend.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|In using this application,I can enjoy all my goodies, ie Android, Ipad and Laptop, it's wonderful! Love reading on my Kindle or any computer based product.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Love PP's sound! Home is especially my favorite track on the album. Man on the Moon is also very good. Can't wait to see what else he comes out with.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Age 57, same approach grandpa (born 1869) subscribed to as well as my parents (dad born 1888, mom 1921) and they lived long and full lives. It is common sense that we used to have before the super sized carb and sugar explosion
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is an awesome game!!!  I love playing it.  I play it on my kindle fire.  Every once in a while it will lag, but that could just be my kindle.  Other than that, I LOVE IT!
0920668372|5.0|This is such a sweet little book... the ending gets me every time!!!<br />Would recommend to any new parent out there!!
B002RSOTSM|5.0|If there's anything Hitchcock is exceptional at, it's keeping each and every viewer at the edge of their seat. Rear window embodies that Hitchcock trademark beautifully. James Stewart plays Jeff, a photographer confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. Thelma Ritter plays his wry, helpful nurse, Stella, and Grace Kelly is stunning as Jeff's sophisticated, intelligent, graceful girlfriend Lisa. Bored by being in his apartment all the time while recuperating, he passes time by watching his neighbors: a dancer, a lonely woman, a newly married couple...and a salesman with a nagging, bedridden wife. The salesman is Lars Thorwald, played by the lumbering Raymond Burr. When his wife disappears, Jeff is convinced that Lars had something to do with her disappearance, and is convinced she has been murdered. Jeff must depend on the help of Lisa and Stella to prove Thorwald guilty of the crime. This film left me speechless. I've always loved Hitchcock, but this is by far my favorite. The entire movie takes place in a small apartment, helping the viewer to feel the same claustrophobic desperation James Stewarts character feels throughout the entire film. This is a must see for any Hitchcock fan; the tense fear in the film is powerful, yet it is softened by the tender serene beauty of Grace Kelly. By the middle of the film, I was completely still until the very end. That's how effective Hitchcock is, and it is such a tense power that cannot be explained until you view this film yourself. Have fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun it almost the same thing as temple run which is also a fun game. It is challenging to get all the players but it is still very fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|On the screen it says the new one but when I go on it is the Paris subway surfer to upgrade it now
140006922X|5.0|Does anyone else here besides me find it perfectly ironic that some so-called Christians are reacting to Aslan's book with the same antagonistic, vitriolic, illogical, self-righteous silliness as Muslims do to almost ANY public or media criticism of Mohammed, the Koran, or Islam?  I wonder if they live in the same states with legislatures that have passed laws ensuring that Sharia law is never made into public policy in their state?  Ooooh!  Protect us from the scary Muslims!  Seriously, though, how very, very sad it is that people feel the need to comfort themselves by putting everyone and everything into neat and tidy little boxes and then throw away the keys so that they don't have to think for themselves.
B00280LYHS|4.0|AWESOME BOOK. So cool and fun to read. You have to read it. Probably the best book I've ever read.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|At first I wasn't impressed by the looks of the FAotD game. But within short period of trying it, I was really impressed. This game challenges your capability to figure out the order in which a white ball should be dropped into different colors of paint.There are props to partially cover the ball to keep the under colors. The trick is to get the ball to look like the one on the box. It's a very tricky and challenging brain game. Really unique and creative - I've not seen anything else like it.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see added is a cool sound when you get a box completed.
B0000039QA|5.0|I usually listen to music on my phone but I like having cd for my car. Have to get a classic like this no doubt.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I spent $31 on a sushi lunch the other day at work,not a regular thing but whatever.<br /><br />this thing is $35 and displays youtube effortlessly and correctly on my TV.<br /><br />how can it not get 5 stars on this alone?<br /><br />O and it will automatically power on, and if the TV is already on, auto change TV inputs on my Samsung TV when I cast to it...
B00005JPD0|5.0|Denzel is always good and I enjoyed the premise.  The whole thing was done well. You can hardly recognize Jim Caviezel as the bad guy.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Yes, this is a really fun game but if you have the Kindle Fire.....DO NOT uninstall it to install the newer version. I was happily playing this game since 2013 on my Kindle Fire. I uninstalled the version so I could install the updated one & guess what??  Not compatible!!!  This is a very rotten thing for the makers of this game to do!!  No warning, no nothing.....they just changed the game & the new version doesn't play on the Kindle Fire anymore.  Rotten!!<br /><br />Now this is a great game!!  It's fun, there's lots to it & those minions are so darn cute!!  The makers of this game put a lot into it & it really shows how great they are at their jobs!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Got this app for the child I care for and ended up playing with it myself. I haven't had any problems with it. It is very easy to lose several hours on though!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I liked how the story unfolded. The characters complimented each other. I will be looking for more books in the series.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Indestructible Uno cards.<br /><br />The carabiner thing it come with is junk, so use a rubber band, a baggie, or a different carabiner/ring.<br /><br />The lamination/plastic coating is so slick that the cards slide across the table when dealt.<br /><br />A little mesh bag would have been a better storage solution than the crappy carabiner, but this is a great set.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is fun and easy I love it is does not have to load so long it is so cool
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was a great value and it made me think. It reminded me a lot of the Must games.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Downloaded app and installed without any difficulty or glitches. Worked from the very first calculation. Big charactors and big ease of use.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A great writer at the top of his game, with a topic that is currently of much interest: whistle blowing as relates to  intelligence gathering.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This was originally bought for a school project but it has earned a spot in my DVD collection. The Criterion Collection met my expectations.
006224454X|4.0|Interesting concept. I had never thought about this type of situation before.  I am glad I read it  and I found that I think about the story even days after finishing the book.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love it and it was so fun! I just wish that it had more levels. I could play 40 more!
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I was expecting more!  Premise was  good, execution was sloppy.  Dr who character was snarly when it looked like he was trying for tongue in cheek
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Very convenient way to check out restaurants or other establishments you're not sure about. Comes in handy on vacation and looking for a place to eat.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Page turner! Lots of changes to keep you guessing what's next! Hope there is going to be more very soon!
B005KELR3A|3.0|I first ordered the Belkin open Verve Tab Folio for Kindle Paperwhite and never received it. I substituted the Belkin Grip Sleeve which was delivered within a couple days. I am satisfied but I think I would have preferred the Tab Folio more.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I play this game with my friends all the time. And I could play it anytime on my own with this app.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did not think this story was as gripping as The Kite Runner.  It was just another story about what happens in some places, sad but true.  Kind of unbelievable.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I always enjoyed Voyager. So I decided to watch it again and I'm not disappointed. I love being able to watch episodes consecutively.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I chose this book because of its author. I read a few books by Neil over the years and was always impressed by his ability to incorporate other-worldliness into his tales in an artfully seamless way. In Stardust Neil excelled even further at this craft. I thoroughly enjoyed the telling of Stardust and recommend it to any reader with a penchant for Fantasy.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game and keeps you on your toes.The only problem was it would pause on me and I don't know if it was the game or my Kindle or the internet. We don't have the high speed internet so that might have been why. The game is great though.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I downloaded this app and the download was fast and so was the conversion. I went to play the music offline and at the end of the song it would freeze my tablet. Other that that setback the sound quality is amazing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is even fun for adults and has lots of surprises.  Action packed for sure and It won't disappoint you and you'll have a lot of fun.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|This is one of my favorite games to play, even more so than diner dash. However I haven't been able to open the game for over a week. When I open it up it goes to an advertisement for dinner dash, but won't let me close it. Even when I hit her now it still doesn't do anything. Please fix so I can play my game!!!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a good game to make one think and figure out how to get the stars. lots of fun.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It has been 20 years since I have had my first introduction to the story \\"Les Miserables.\\"  I was in the 8th grade and we took a class trip to see the musical in Toronto.  It was only my second musical, the first being \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" While \\"Phantom\\" is and probably always will be my favorite,  \\"Les Mis\\" was still very impressive and I absolutely love the music!  The story is a bit tragic, but what do you expect for a musical centering around the French Revolution.  I have to admit that when I went to go see this movie rendition of the story,  it had some high standards to go up against. I know all of the songs and much of the dialog from the show.  While I was not blown away (hence 4 instead of 5 stars), I was fairly impressed by how closely the movie came to the musical. The actors did a phenomenal job of singing the songs with truly believable emotions and passion. There is a little bit of tweaking with the storyline, but not so much as to destroy the faithfulness to the musical. Songs were sung with excellent annunciation and clarity. I was able to make out more of the words of the songs in the movie than in any production or recording that I have ever heard/seen.  This was the first time I did not cringe while listening to\\"Castle on a Cloud. \\" That young lady did a phenomenal job and did not sound the least bit whiny. I have always wanted to read the book by Hugo on which they are both based, but have yet to do so and as such cannot compare either to that. I guess the loss of one star is mostly due to the slight plot changes.  You know expecting one thing but getting another. By the way, Hugh Jackman was absolutely amazing! I also loved the cameo by Colm Wilkinson, who played Jean Valjean in early productions of the musical.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I don't like the music it is very annoying . Glad you can turn it off. The pictures are beautiful.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think the game is really cool and really fun. Me and my friends are one this game all the time we always talk about it and we always recommend it to other people.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This is right up there with so many classic &#34;cult following&#34; movies. If you are a Johhny Depp fan this is a must have! And if you want to see Ricki Lake as a young actress that alone will blow you away. But most of all is the iconic beloved &#34;Hatchetface'!!
0062059963|5.0|Oh this great series of Books I have gotten from Amazon. The covers are beautiful and they are always in great shape and well packaged. I love getting my books from Amazon along with other things. Trust me Amazon is great.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Saw them at the Mann Center in Philly. Amazing concert .Had the new album first, then bought  this one. Love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this at the airport for a flight to Florida and it was great! I was instantly addicted I play this app almost everyday!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I really like this game except for it kicking me out and demanding money to continue play. I back out of the game and wait a few minutes log on and it will let me play for a while longer but it still keeps asking for money for more stars or bubbles or something. For a &#34;free&#34; game it is very frustrating. The concept of this game and the amount of plays is really fun but I do not get to play for very long (I keep losing bubbles and no stars) which I guess is a good thing as it is addicting.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I used to own a small project studio and I had SIX of these headphone sets at one time. I never should have let all SIX get away during liquidation. Someone once told me that I should never pay consumer prices for great audio. Once you own professional equipment, consumer audio never quite sounds the same for the price.<br /><br />Anyways, as you can tell I sold my equipment and the headphones with it. That was a mistake. These headphones were the main stay of my productions, and editing. I now had to settle for in-ear buds which never stay in for me. Or, I have the complimentary headphones one gets when buying popular language learning software. (Yikes!) But I persevered through that muck for about 5 years to purchase again these headphones. My ears are in a blissful state once more! Thank you Sony for never giving up on a good product!<br /><br />These headphones have a GREAT sound!!! I like the other brands, you know...Senn, AT, AKG, etc. but I LOVE these Sonys. They have a crisp, clean brilliance of sound while maintaining a full, rich bass presence. Nothing is muddied unless it's in the recording that way or your amps just won't reproduce the sound cleanly.<br /><br />I gave SIX pair of these phones away and I regretted every minute I went without them. I am fortunate to find them here for a VERY low price of $77.XX. I paid about $110.00 for each pair in my studio.<br /><br />I am SO glad to have these Sonys back! Each pair is almost identical to the next in the Sony MDR-7506 line. These sound pretty much the same as my 6 pair in my studio.<br /><br />As far as total transparency, these phones tend to accentuate the bass while leaving the mids and highs about level to a &#34;flat response&#34; EQ setting. The closed design does help reduce ambient noise considerably. In my estimation, these PROBABLY reduce ambient noise by about 15-22 dBs.<br /><br />The comfort of these headphones is amazing. The foam cushions keep the drivers from putting pressure against theears causing discomfort. They are not too tight in their fit as to cause headaches from wearing these phones for long periods of time such as in the back of the mini-van for 6 hours while watching the latest Scooby Doo episodes on DVD.<br /><br />One more thing...volume. These phones can take the volume without distorting on their own. Any distortion that comes through those drivers is most likely due to a bad recording or amps that cannot reproduce sound that well.<br /><br />You want some advice on what to purchase for headphones? Buy the Sony MDR-7506es. They are by FAR the best audio bang for the buck!<br /><br />Hope this helps!!!
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|Leon Fleisher is one of my favourite pianists. I've written a handful reviews on individual releases over the years, and do not plan to convince anyone of what I can only hope everyone knows already: that this is a must-have set if ever there was one. Suffice to say I ordered this set from France so I'd have it earlier (been perusing it for almost two months now). More to the point, anyone who doesn't yet own any or all of Fleisher's recordings, this box set plus the Vanguard discs, as Hank Drake notes (don't forget the earlier - that is, 1982 - recording of the Ravel Concerto for the Left Hand with Sergiu Comissiona, also on Vanguard, my favourite of all, but certainly along with the one with Ozawa included here, as well as Samson François/André Cluytens, Julius Katchen/István Kertész and Robert Casadesus/Eugene Ormandy) is the ideal place to start.  In which case I recommend you stop reading, click the &#34;buy&#34; botton, yes, just completely ignore the following - it is strictly for those who, like me, have owned the LPs and every digital incarnation of everything this box contains (with the exception of the Hindemith, which has either never been issued on CD, or that I've missed), and I mean everything from the LPs over Lani Spahr's private remasterings from open reel tapes to the French United Archive and Arkivmusic releases.  Now, weren't we all hoping this set would contain all-new DSD remasterings from the original analogue master tapes? Well, it sure doesn't say so anywhere on or in the box. In fact, it remains unclear which of these remasterings are new (production year as well as copyright is said to be 2013, not that one could deduce much from this), and where they're not, which have been used. The best I can offer are subjective comparisons I made on state-of-the-art equipment (trying to decide which versions to rip and include in my playlists to use at home).  On the whole, the remasterings in this box sound as good or better than prior releases.There are exceptions, however. Ironically, the 2008 Mozart Concerto recordings sound less spatious and realistic, even slightly dull compared to the regular CD - and I would be suprised if this title were remastered at all (more likely a straight digital copy, and indeed, the sonic difference dwindles some once one rips the content of both discs). All the other digital (DDD) recordings are, believe it or not, audibly improved over the original CDs (the left hand solo, chamber and concerto repertoire), something I really did not expect. Most likely thanks to improved noise-shaping software. The differences aren't always slight at all (fascinating, confusing, disturbing - you name it...). Most importantly, however, the Franz Schmidt Quintet now comes without those digital glitches that once almost killed an audiophile transport of mine - the disc quit playing, but wouldn't quit whirring, literally had to pull the plug (mind you, a CD of which I had several copies, all scratch-free, not one playing back properly to the end, got to keep them all for free, nice customer service on Amazon's part, but then, I had to wait until now to be able and listen to the Quintet to the very end...).  The great Grieg and Schumann Concerti, of which the DSD-remastered &#34;Great Performances&#34; CD sounds hard as nails in comparison (frankly, one of the most disappointing modern remasterings of anything), finally have some body and natural harmonics.  All the Beethoven Concerti are clearly remastered and sound better than ever. Having said that, the remasterings of the 3rd and 4th (included here twice) are not identical to the DSD remastering for the &#34;Great Performances&#34; CD, but since there are sonic plusses and minuses to either (there isn't merely greater low-level resolution to the &#34;Great Performances&#34; CD, but one can hear e.g. tape splices - as during, of all places, the first-movement candenza in the 4th - that have always made me wonder if the same analogue source tape was used as for all other releases. If I had to guess, I'd say it's the only release going back to the original analogue master, but that the original may be showing signs of deterioration, and that the others may be based on a production master copy), I'm undecided which remastering I like better, but believe most people will prefer the less revealing but &#34;cleaner&#34; remastering included in the box set here. All in all, the piano sounds so much more full-bodied in either, with much (!) more orchestral detail to be heard than in the cheapo releases and re-issues from the eighties and nineties - even compared to the original LPs (of which I still own a pretty run-down and a virtually pristine set) - that I feel like nit-picking. I mean, finally, they got the transfer of the &#34;Emperor&#34; Concerto right!  The to me all-important Brahms Concerti (how I love those!) sound different from the 1997 20-Bit-SBM remasterings (the Masterworks Heritage double-CD), less low-level resolution and all that comes with it (including less realistic phase response) - keep the old CDs if you own them (and/or audiophile equipement), otherwise nothing worth obsessing over. Ironically, the mono items contained therein (the Brahms Waltzes and Händel Variations) are sonically improved here (sometimes I wonder if there's some sort of troll working at Sony eternally trying to figure out how to sell us each and every scrap of music they've ever recorded or acquired as many times as is (in)humanly possible...).  The Mozart 25th Concerto sounds curiously different from all previous releases. I probably like the remastering included in the DSD-remastered Szell Mozart box set best (yeah, I know, wouldn't we all have bet they're using the same remastering, but no...), but the one included here reveals a Mozartian gracefulness that made me think, in passing, that I was hearing this recording for the first time (and that - probably because of that additional sense of spontaneity - reminded me that I had not listened to Szell's live in Tokyo in 1970 concert for a while).  I'd expected the 1954 Schubert to be the exact same remastering as the United Archives release, and maybe it is and the difference is due to the funny black disc the French use, be that as it may, the recording sounds better (less dry, more luminous, percussive in a more realistic way) here. The 1963 Schubert items sound so different from the earlier CD release, as well as the LP, it's frankly confusing. The A Major Sonata in particular sounds fuller-bodied if a bit wooden, less charming and graceful (Fleisher's take on it admittedly being gloomier than some, e.g. Solomon). I was unhappy with the earlier remastering, but don't find the new one so convincing either, and the sonic difference is such that one wonders what it sounded like in real. The LP probably comes closest to sounding realistic in this particular case (although I've always thought there's a lack of weight there, which they may have been trying to improve via equalization here). The interpretation, of course, is such a fine one.  To end this with, all the items thus far only included (in digital redbook format, that is) in the Philips &#34;Great Pianists of the 20th Century&#34; set or the half dozen Arkivmusic discs (from five years ago) sound better here than ever.  Quite good quality pressings, by the way. Having said that, I'll rip them all and have them read out and clocked by an external studio clock, trying to glean as much information and sonic integrity from these recordings as I can. Would be something to have all this on SACD or better yet, as high-resolution downloads tapped directly from the source. But then, how long have we been waiting for this complete album collection of all the Epic, Columbia and Sony releases? I'd frankly started wondering if I'd live to see/hear it...  Greetings from Switzerland, David.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a fun game! The Minions are adorable. The game is fast paced but still really enjoyable. Plus can't beat the price!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Way better then what I thought it was going to be!!! A must read. Very happy I chose this book :)
B00280LYIC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book! I love to read books and then compare them to their movies. This movie did not do the book justice. The book was so much better!
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|It was an okay movie, I would not purchase it, but my nephew who is grown really enjoyed it, and said he would watch it again.
B0097S0TM0|4.0|I loved Funhouse, but I feel like this album isn't as good.  It seems more brassy and harsh.  There are still songs I love on this album so I would still buy it again.  It seemed kind of like she couldn't make up her mind on how she wanted to sound. I am only keeping about half of the songs on my iPod, after listening to the whole album.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Once again I thought the movie was okay would not purchase it, but my grown nephew said he liked it and in fact he is coming for a visit and I might let him order this movie.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is the most intriguing book that have read in a long long time. It pulled me in from the first page, and i didn't want it to end. I have recommended this book to everyone! I am looking forward to Diane Setterfield's next book. How can it possibly be as good?
B003TQ50V6|3.0|The story was a bit confusing, but I love Kevin Kline and Kevin Costner and would watch them in any movie.
B009WUBERW|1.0|They should have stopped after the first movie. The characters were weak, the acting was predictibly bad, but when you spend the entire time blowing up stuff, shooting, stabbing and flying planes that do maneuvers that can't be done, I guess you don't have to act out a ridiculous plot.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I listened to Dire Straits in the 70's & 80's and really enjoyed them.  This CD is excellent if you like Dire Straits; it is a 2 CD set.  I listen to it often and love it
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I I am a big fan of match three games.  This game is challenging and fun to play.  It also can become quite addictive.
1594744769|5.0|I saw this book in Barnes and Nobles and read the prologue to get a feel for it. Normally, I hate prologues and I often skip them...but this is the only book I have read a prologue in, so I knew that it was special. I decided to buy it from online for a cheaper price, and I was just blown away by the book. It was hard for me to put it down. My favorite thing about this novel was the pictures that were included into the story to give it that extra push. I won't say much about the characters or the premise of the story, but if you can, definitely get your hands on this.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|A visually fresh view of a remarkable man who has spent his life in service to his one love--sushi.<br /><br />The editing is perfect. The music really drives the emotion here. An important story of the art of work.<br /><br />If you like people who take the time and energy to produce the best, you'll love learning about Jiro who truly is a national treasure of Japan. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy this game immensely, plus it was free from Amazon  random draw is my favorite<br />.Ads are annoying, but easy to delete.
B00499QUK2|4.0|It is still the same old Sherlock Holmes character on a contemporary environment. Despite the fact that there are pointless scenes sometimes, it keeps you wondering what'll happen next.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|When I got this movie, I thought it wouldn't be scary. I was completely wrong, its in fact very scary and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I find myself wondering how a life might be different every time I encounter someone with ability or passion that is untapped, if only they had been exposed to a wider range of opportunities.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I saw this at the movies and loved it. It'll keep you interested, and on the edge of your seat.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This comedy series is basically about a group of intelligent geek friends who struggle with social graces that come easily to most people. The geeks get a little help navigating socially from  the girl across the hall who was popular in her small town high school.<br /><br />This comedy series is intelligent humor well done. It has a great ensemble cast. In season 3 the series has smoothed out some its rough edges and is firing on all cylinders. The actors have mastered and fine tuned the subtle nuances of their respective characters.<br /><br />I started watching the series due to Fox showing reruns of the series nightly at 7:30 in my area. I enjoyed the series so much from watching the reruns that I began watching the series on CBS at its regular time slot on Thursdays. I have also bought seasons 3, 4 and 5 on dvd.<br /><br />I love great comedy and this is a series that is very well done. It has become one of my favorite series to watch on network television. I highly recommend watching the series from season 3 up to season 6 which is soon to be released on dvd  and Blu-ray.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the ending. I am sad to see this series end tho. I always knew Sam and sookie would end up together.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|This album is such a nice balance of selections.  My piano lessons while growing up never materialized into this!  The arrangements on movie themes is fun.  These guys make good music.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's fun and entertaining. The graphics look really good on the kindle. I wish it was a little bit longer but it's worth the money for the game.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling brings a refreshing breeze to violin music!  She has great style in musical arrangements and costumes and burns plenty of calories dancing around on stage while performing.  She's amazing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It sounds trite, but this book is an instant classic!<br /><br />It's YA lit in the tradition of Madeline L'Engle's 'A Wrinkle in Time'. I predict that 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' will one day make it's way onto summer reading lists everywhere.<br /><br />It examines the links between childhood and adulthood, things forgotten and things returned. Lots of good stuff.<br /><br />Read it. Now.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this os one pf the easiest apps that ive downloaded and have used on a regular basis.  ive really enjoyed it
B0082XJGRK|5.0|This is a good edition of a classic text. Aurelius' stoicism is appealingly thought out and written. Give it a try!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. :)
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Quiet is a study if introverts & extroverts. Cain delves into a lot of interesting studies about how personality drives the world around us and how the two personalities can better relate. However, you must navigate around quite a bit of superfluous material to get to the good stuff. For example, she goes into great detail about how she paid $800+ to attend über extrovert Tony Robbin's seminar while the true Tony fans spent $2,000+ to get near the front. And because it also had nothing to so with the price of tea in China, she describes how cold the room is, presumably to accommodate for Tony's high metabolism.
B006RXQ800|5.0|There was so much action in this film. So many twists and people moving from side to side and that made it so suspenseful.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner and this one definitely did not disappoint.<br />I found it compelling and hard to put down.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really liked the book. I felt most of the storytelling was consistent, and you quickly get sucked into it. Ended is a character that is attractive for both being extraordinary AND ordinary. I hope the next book is equally great!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought the first season was excellent and this second season continues in excellence.  Very entertaining and the characters are quite engaging.  I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is now upgraded and the characters are more expensive. I like how they have the boardwalk thing and the grinding stuff...I actually make a pretty higher score because it gets u to play it
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|This was a good movie the things these guys go through to get what rightfully belongs to them,  it's good cause they get the bad guy.  watch it, it's good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. I like  keeping it on th  home page and just listening to the minions talk. I do like gues evil  lare over the residential neighborhood.  All together lots of family fun
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was truly an amazing story.  I read it all in one day and couldn't put it down. Very inspiring
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the best novel that I have ever read. There is no other way to describe it, but awesome

B0000A02TZ|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who was as unfortunate as myself to not pick up a copy when they saw it in the store.  I saw a copy five years ago and said to myself not today it will be here later.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Five years later I broke down and bought it on Amazon, inexpensive and play great.  I don't truly recommend all the bonus material, but the movie is great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am a fanaddic. I love romance suspension and action. The first book was awesome the second not their best but mockingjay was vary surprising. Not everything went like I wanted it to spacificly who katniss ends up and how the war ends but other than that extraordinary!!!!
B007SOQBCM|4.0|I love twitch, don't get me wrong, I watch everything, but one problem for the update on kindle fire is, you can log in and all that, but you can't chat or follow, please fix this twitch, I know you're better than this!
B005T87QCI|3.0|This game takes forever to get out of. Also it needs more features. And it is just stupid that you need to pay for robots and the build your own robot and the gallery. Why do we have to pay for more robots. You start with the most suckiest robots. Why cant we just earn or unlock things instead of having to pay 1.00 for one robot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a very fun and addictive game to play.I love playing this game, one thing i loke about the game os the themes or cities of different countries it takes you.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an interesting and entertaining way to learn about autism. I've watched Temple Grandin interviews on YouTube, and Claire Danes does an excellent acting jog of portraying her. I also learned a lot about.... cows! Everyone I spoke to who has seen this movie says they loved it. So did I.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|First of all it is an amazing book and its condition when receiving the book was phenomenal. No bends or rips nothing, brand spanking new !!
B009HEISJU|3.0|This movie had lots of potential and some great actors. It was very predictable for the most part.  It did have a couple of I didn't see that coming moments.<br /><br />Entertaining but glad I didn't go to the theaters to see it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a very good book.I had a Hard time putting it down. Can't wait to read the last one.

B0041KBWM0|4.0|Excellent adaptation of one of Jane Austen's best.  I have read the book many times so some of the characters didn't look as I had imagined them.
1932735410|5.0|I recently passed the PMP certification exam and this RMC book was my primary study material (along with real-world experience). The PMP exam is highly detailed and tests you at an expert level with logical, quantitative, and situational (multiple correct answer) questions. This book teaches everything you need to know, so take it seriously. Do ALL the exercises, and answer ALL the end-of-chapter sample questions. Keep a notebook. When Rita says &#34;memorize this&#34;, take her at her word.<br /><br />Even though Rita Mulcahy passed away in 2010, the way the book is written I felt like she was right there pushing me along to understand (not just learn) this material. It reads exceptionally well and has lots of charts and diagrams to help describe what is really happening. There is lots of discussion on situational priorities and details that will help add context to some exam questions where there otherwise is none.<br /><br />In summary - if you are preparing for the PMP exam, you would be remiss not to read this book 2 or 3 times.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|I loved the look of it.  The movie kept me watching throughout.  In retrospect, the underlying story is not so original but I still liked it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have gotten very &#34;attached&#34; to all of the characters. I am saddened to hear that Season 4 will be the last. More, more, more.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Love this show just because Noah Wylie is in it.  I would love to see this show continue through many seasons.
B000002LAC|5.0|I came across this CD in 1991 . . . and recently thought I would revisit the past. It is still amazing.
B00DU6UD0I|1.0|Not worth the film it was printed on.  I had really hoped it would have been a funny movie -
1451697686|5.0|This book has many useful ideas. Every household could benefit from the information in this book. I am glad I purchased this book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Maybe my favorite tv show ever.  If you liked x-files, you'll DEFINITELY like Fringe.  Of the seasons, season 3 is a pretty fulfilling one which progresses the overall storyline in big ways.
B000002GW5|5.0|Great CD, happy amazon still had it in stock. Wasn't able to find it locally or download the song I was looking for.
0374214913|4.0|I loved this book, plain and simple.  The moment Clay climbs the ladder, his arm outstretched, looking for the  for the right book, I was hooked.  This is a story that talks about the smell of books, the bound versus the electronic, the way the right book can hook you and never let you go- for Clay it was the  The Dragon Song Chronicles.  Clay is on a quest to discover the secrets of Mr. Penumbra's bookstore.  Why do odd people come in at all hours of the night?  Why is there a special section of encoded books?  Why don't they stock normal books-no Harry Potters in sight?!?  What Clay discovers sends him on a mission that leads him into the true meaning of what books are really about.  This is a book lover's book.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie is Good for the kids and also for the adults.<br />My family enjoyed it especially my grandson. I recommend to the family collection.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|ok, there are so many cheap music downloaders that &quot;work&quot; but this one is seriously the BEST. you can find your fav music and listen to it not having to use wifi! so trust me, you should get it
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I am not an ardent fan of Tom Cruise; but he played the part well.<br />The story line is a little different; nonetheless I found it entertaining.<br />Most of my family members enjoyed it, not so much my oldest daughter; but she sat through it.<br />I recommend it to the action movie buff.<br />It is worth the purchase.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It works really well. I love tweeting, and easy to use. My favorite app, just don't load too many apps with it cause then it gets really slow. Which makes sense
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Worth the &quot;wasted&quot; time...it's an entertaining game. Haven't bought anything yet and still enjoying the challenges presented. Offers some twists on traditional &quot;golf solitaire&quot;.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|A friend loaned me &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and I found &#34;World without End&#34; a fabulous follow up. I highly recommend both books.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|The recipient loved it!  It was a gift for someone who requested it and met with their 100% approval.  Highly recommend for all &#34;Doctor Who&#34; fans.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm slightly disappointed that this \\"trilogy\\" has turned into a series with 5 or more books. Mainly because I have to WAIT for the next book! I loved all three books so far, but thought this third one was the best so far. It is definitely not a stand-alone book. You need to read the other two first. That being said, the author should do a little less back-story telling because if you've read the first two books, you already know what happened in the first two books. Looking forward to the next one! Thanks, Sylvia, for a great, juicy storyline!
B003QTSMXE|3.0|We love this movie we just did not like all the freezing & waiting to load to watch this movie!

B000RF7XYO|5.0|We saw this movie AFTER viewing Elizabeth, the Golden Age.  Probably not the right order, but we did thoroughly enjoy both of these movies.  Excellent cinematography, acting, costumes, etc.  Highly recommended if you appreciate British history.
030758836X|4.0|this is a good and entertaining book. I got through it quick and enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />spoiler alert:<br /><br />story line did not exactly stick together towards the end for me and left me slightly unsatisfied but overall, entertaining and enjoyable
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|Since I've used ADP for several years on my Windows machines, I saw this and thought I'd give it a try on my Android tablet.  This has blocked the adds on almost all of the free apps I've used.
0307476073|3.0|the book was good and the story unique and interesting. not a character I can relate to so I did not get the &#34;can't put it down&#34; obsession that I often do when reading a book. Just could not relate to the story. However, the description of life on the Pacific Crest Trail was very interesting to me.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Excellent choice for checking your eBay account.  Easy to search for items, add items to your watch list, and also place bids.  I feel this app actually works better than going to their website on my computer.,
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I can't wait till 4 comes out. They were great books. At first seemed like a rewrite of 50 shades, then story kinda changed and I couldn't stop reading them.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well it is pretty cool once you get it it is amazing! But it would be nice if it made it easier to get to the neather.I would like for them to allow you to break Redstone and get Redstone. I would recommend this game.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Enjoyed what I've missed...was curious about Glee after the recent passing of main character. If you haven't seen watched yet, it is definitely worth watching this first pilot episode.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the challenges.  I would of like to have been able to save the game before I go. However I did tell friends about the game.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book!! Recommended to me by two people; thoroughly enjoyed reading the story through a dog's point of view. As a dog lover it brought tears to my eyes.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Long time since I have seen this.  Watching it after so long has been very enjoyable.  Very entertaining and had forgotten how good of a show this was.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I just love this show.  The dialog is snappy, engaging and filled with wit.  The characters are a bit over the top, but HEY this is television.

B001HIJYR4|4.0|this movie is action all the way. I think Morgan is one of todays top stars as well as Anjelina Jolie. Great...
B003PVPXOE|4.0|Sunset Blvd was a great film<br />A true classic. Gloria Swanson was fabulous in the role of Norma Desmond. Saw the play - musical a few days later.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I LOVE Bruce Willis in this series so Im always glad to get a new one in the collection although friends are like...don't do it...on this one, they were dead wrong.....I loved it and want another where they bring Bonnie and him back together...see thinking ahead to another sequel....but Ill enjoy this one til that happens :)
B005VSRFEA|3.0|The author try to simplified the system approach as well as giving a lot of examples.<br />However sometimes the explanation is too details until we overwhelm with the content.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I do love Dexter....but I was disappointed in this series ending as I guessed it....I have yet to do that in any Dexter seasons....maybe that's why I didn't love it as I usually do.....anyhow it is a good season and Im sad to hear only more is coming but til that time....
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A wonderful read! Such a great story, should be turned into a movie! I read through it within a couple days. It was really hard to put it down.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I wish I didn't solve the puzzles so fast! Great game for all ages! Graphics and story line made the game very interesting!
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Received the item and charged it up. I then inserted an SD card loaded w/images and a 64GB Flash Drive.following the instructions I was able to transfer images from SD to Flash fast. I was able to set up 5+ folders on the Flash Drive .I also up/down load images to and from Camera Roll. All in All a SUPER DEVICE. Every one with a Tablet should get one. Did I say that it is FAST!
B00633W614|4.0|A nice way to spent a few hours. The author keeps the story line moving while mixing in some history.<br />The characters are well developed. I'm on book two and will definitely finish the chronicles to the end.
B005BCE7II|5.0|Funny movie, liked the 3D.  Plus comes with a regular Blue Ray and a regular DVD! four more words required :)
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this text.  It was a recommendation that did not disappoint.  There were such powerful and practical pieces of information shared in this text.  The simplicity of the writing lent itself to making an even bigger impact.  The text was insightful and useful for personal development and enlightenment.  Great read!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A fun read.  No educational value but very entertaining.<br />Very &#34;outside the box&#34;.  Not one of those mystery books<br />that I could second guess.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|My husband and I are 38 -- and laughed quite a bit because it's spot-on if you're near 40.  I would imagine that it would not be as funny if it wasn't your personal experience at the present moment, but we thought it was funny and got a lot of laughs out of it!
B009JCPM5S|4.0|I've been wanting to see this movie for the longest time. And now that I have seen it, now I know why the movie was called a classic. 1. The movie remade in high definition was great. 2. It gave a perspective of what will happen if children took over and be govern by 1 boy. Now, it may sound &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34;, but it's kind of not. There is killing in the movie, but nothing gorey or graphic. I suggest this movie for tens and up though for some of the content wouldn't make sense to youngsters.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|When I say this one was free and a couple others didn't know it wasn't the full game.  It only lets you go so far and then you have to purchase the actually game to continue.  I play to many free games to pay for these journey type games.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|It was what you can expect from another marvel movie that has not one hero in it but several.  Because there were multiple heroes the action scenes had a lot of maneuverability and fighting sequences were interesting.  The movie pits the heroes against each other enough to make the ego filled characters believable without going over the top with it to take away from the story line.  The writers did a good job of pulling in significant details from each of the heroes separate story lines making them all significant parts of this shared plot.  Not a deeply philosophical movie or a particularly moving drama but as an action superhero movie I really enjoyed it.  I like the guy who played the hulk or Dr Banner rather but still would have loved loved to see Edward Norton fill the role again.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is FUN...me and my little cousin play together all the time and he's great at all the angry bird games.
B00364K6YW|5.0|It was on one of the cable stations a few months ago and I enjoyed it so much that I ordered a copy.  It is such a wonderful storyline and so well acted.  Highly recommended.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|What can I say it coincides with everything else in my life and social media.  Works well with the tablet and responses are immediate.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|The second GI Joe movie almost seems to be a reboot from the first with new characters and a change from the first being a bit cheesy to this one being more action popcorn flick oriented.<br /><br />As an action flick, this is an average one and is ok to watch as it has plenty of action and decent special effects.  As a GI Joe movie, it is not so much.  No character development or poor development that is off based from the comics which this is supposed to originate from,  the plot is a bit all over and Cobra seems to be weak as fruit punch.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had high expectations for both the GI Joe movies and have been disappointed both times as far as a movie that accurately brings the comics to life without being too cheesy or too flat and one dimensional.<br /><br />As an action movie, I was entertained, but I kind of had to forget it was suppose to be GI Joe.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Its an okay game it could be better.  I will stick with just playing candy crush, don't have time for this.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Haven't gotten too much of a chance to use this but on one small 3&#34; blade that i have, seraded/flat. worked well on both, seems a little flimsy but I'm not worried about breaking it. def would recommend more for pocket knives and such as advertised. Wouldn't recommened for a hunting knife or anything large. Seems good though.
B00A7W29BE|2.0|With the reviews I thought that this would have been better, but didn't care for it.  Hopefully I will find one that I like.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Purchased for my wife for her birthday. Package in perfect condition. Watched all in a row over weekend. No problems.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I downloaded this thinking it was the game, but even the notes, clues, or hints do not help....well it didn't help me!!!
B007VYDFMS|4.0|If you are Bob Marley fan or don't know much about this musician, then this is the movie for you.  It's informative, shows the musician in a way that makes him relatable to everyone and allows you to understand the fuel behind Marley's musical lyrics.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|This was not the drivel of the last album. It is a full on assault of the mind and auditory. I had almost lost faith in him, but this proves he is still a viable artist.
B000I9X7M6|5.0|If your students are not comfortable with Shakespearian language, then this film draws their attention, holds it and they won't stop talking about the film.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The game is awesome and good graphics this game is hard at first but once you got it you got it and it is more fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If Sylvia decided to do a movie here I think I would much rather prefer this over 50 Shades.  So excited that she is going to continue the story.  Was completely wrapped up in the story and can't wait to see whats next.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Love Disney Pixar. Pixar always does a great job. Love that I can watch the movie on my Kindle or computer
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is amazing fun and great for your mind!<br />kids and adults can play this wherever and whenever they want!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me minion rush is a great game it is almost like subway surfers with lots of stuff to doge
B0084HJE0S|5.0|I teach Intro to IT as well as Web Design classes and this book has some very good exercises for the students to follow.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Would forward comments on this one to all of my friend.  I am sure they would be will to try this one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is good and fun to play with the kids. We only wish you got to start with a few more hints. I think it is good for the kids to have to think so much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the beat running game I've ever played! It's simple controls make it addicting for anyone who wants to pass time or have fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching this series through Amazon Prime this summer, and love it. Can't wait until season four begins in January.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game and easy to understand. I liked it so much when I got to the end restarted it.
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|The story was constructed and written very professionally, also the actors fit and played their parts well. Not till half way through the video did you find out the Hero was a hit man for the CIA and his daughter was first scared, then mad then supportive. She vaccinated through these mood several times during the movie. I feel the Violence was limited to only 4 or 5 short scenes. It has the quaint essential car chase scenes, and fights with the \\"bad guys\\" at the end. The movie had two GREAT ending scenes so your were first sad about the ending then very happy when a surprise ending scene turns thing around. Great movie, I rented the video and plan to buy it on Amazon soon.
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|The movie was pretty good..it's kind of slow but nevertheless interesting. It's a true story so there is limited room for how the story is told. Streaming it through Amazon was great though--no problems at all with that. The price is a bit high considering RedBox...but overall 4 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the graphics. and its enough fun where I got it on my Kindle Fire and my I phone...Love this game
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Loved it the only problems I had is that none of the characters mouths moved and after 1 mission it would kick me out to main menu on Kindle. Other than that it was great.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|the part that I cant under stand is wen it tells me to us my device to turn it wont let me play any more also it takes FOREVER to load.
B00CCCF4NW|5.0|Stellar arrangements. Floats seamlessly. Can't begin to describe it adequately. Reaches the creativity level by unmeasurable comparison. Would purchase more without hesitation.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Ppl r missing the point even if the game was on the kindle the app itself still sud a$$ :p. It only offers a limited number of level tutorials. I feel like I made it pretty far without even thinking about an app like this but now when I'm really stuck they don't even have the level I need. I get that there's a lot of levels but what's the point of an incomplete guide?
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|The best game ever. I want to be a doctor and I have learn many things from this game. My cousin loves this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is lots fun and make you think. I like it because It really reached my expectations for the game.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khalid latest book is outstanding.  He always seems capture the lessons of life.  It's a beautiful collection of words that don't leave your heart, soul or mind for long stretches of time.
B00406UK7S|5.0|battle scenes were great. good story line natuire scene great.all uniforms were rightn on.i in joy watching it again any time
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|What can I say, it's Adobe Reader. Works well enough on my Kindle to read every PDF I have needed to. It does what I need it to do so I give it 4 stars.
B0047YIHN2|1.0|The company that sent me this DVD is in Italy. Amazon did not mention that the movie was in Italian, & it does not play in 99% of the DVD players in the USA. The company that sent me the DVD says I was mistaken about it not playing in my DVD player because they mentioned it in the add. They said it will play in a computer by changing the settings. They were right about that, but failed to say it would be in Italian! They said they would refund my money, if I would, at MY expense, buy a package, go to a post office, & pay the postage to Italy. When I asked for a post paid return package to send it back, they would not respond to my request! I asked them 3 times, with 3 separate emails. Still they would not say anything, but to mail it back to them. I do not have time to run to a post office, so am stuck with it. I since have found the DVD on Ebay at half the cost, ordered it, and received it 3 days, later, & it was in English.
B000683VI4|1.0|I didn t manage to watch it because it asked me to put the zone number and , when i did, i coudn t hear the sound. Extremelly disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before this game got up-graded it was not the best but sense it was upgraded it is awesome it was totally worth the money I spent, But I would still recommend getting the computer version.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I don't like a lot of games but I do enjoy the fun in this one, especially puzzle games,but this one keeps you wanting to play more. Worth getting.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Very fun and cool. Nice to play if your computer is down. Worth 5 bucks more than this price. Buy it now before it becomes more money. (It will).
B00AHHODH2|5.0|with a setting in Savannah, Ga. the reader expects tense and gets it along with irony, satire and a diverse group of characters.  Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Intense! Book 2 just as interesting as book 1, can't wait to start the last book. Sad that it is almost over, I want more gray
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always, this author not only tells a good story, and develops interesting characters. His intelligent perspective of life in Afghanistan is both informative and pertinent to modern social issues.  It is easy to feel deeply for the characters and their personal journeys. I had a hard time putting this book down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What I think that it is a fun game it so cool game like real talk and you can get it on IPhones
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Supper fun for all ages u will LOVE it. When I got it I could not look away so u should get it. omg u have to Download it
B005K17RU0|5.0|A very good presentation of current and future weather.  Easy to use with good graphics and concise comment.  A very good find.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love legal and police type programs, especially if some medical stuff is thrown in. Hence I really love this program!
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Very bold and truthful perspective on the gas/oil industry conglomerates! Well done, Mr. Fox. Nice touch of humor when appropriate, as well... though, this topic is anything but funny.
B008XGW1CI|3.0|J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults is a far cry from Harry Potter.  At times, it felt almost like she was trying to prove that she could write for adults.  There are graphic scenes of drug use, violence, and sex.  It reads almost like Trainspotting at times.<br /><br />The story is centered a seemingly ideal town in rural England, and focuses on everyone's issues and problems.  For me, that was one of the biggest flaws with the book.  Rather than pick a single character- Rowling insists on telling EVERYONE's story- pretty much simultaneously.  I don't mind multiple viewpoint novels (George R.R. Martin comes to mind), but Rowling's use of it in Casual Vacancy is haphazard.  She jumps points of view dozens of times within each chapter- sometimes switching in the middle of a paragraph.  On top of that, there is absolutely no one to identify with.  By the end of the book there were some characters I pitied, or hoped turned out ok- but even then there weren't many  characters that I actually liked.  Wading through a 500 page book that's switching rapidly between fairly awful people was tough at times.  In all honesty, if this had been written by anyone else, I probably would have stopped reading halfway through.<br /><br />Despite all of that, I still give it three stars.  Her portrayal of the town had a realism to it that was good, and the very end tied all of the strings together in a fairly clever way.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I chose this game because I love mysteries.  This game provides excitement as you go room to room uncovering information.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show just gets better as it goes, I'd suggest it for any USA shows fan and law-based show fans as well!!
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|fun to use, but recommend for children.  educational app to explain anatomy and physiology in appropriate ways to a child.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|This DVD arrived new and packaged, exactly what I hoped to get.  The movie itself is a best seller, a required viewing for serious movie buffs.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game, and I love completing the different levels. I like wiping that grin off the pigs faces!! Cute and fun game!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, Paige. She not only liked it, the rest of her family enjoys it very much!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's like subway surfers but without your data being deleted. But getting tokens is hard to do and annoying. You have to pay to get more tokens.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I got it as a free app but I would have paid for it, it's so entertaining. Few apps I've played through on my tablet but this is one of those.
B00A6SZS2Q|4.0|Happily, BVB have left the screamo influences behind--I've never understood the appeal of throat-shredding roars/growls. The band's strengths play to heavy/melodic instrumentation and clean vocals. The music is intriguingly listenable. In content, the two words that describe this album best for me are &#34;idealistic&#34; and &#34;young&#34;--probably showing my age, but the idea of a charismatic rebel inspiring alienated youth to rise up against Orwellian oppressors primarily on the basis of their teenage angst makes me smile. If you've got a fondness for youthful idealism and heavy melody, or just want a soundtrack for your dreams of mascara-and-leather heroism, this fits the bill.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app. But they just had a new update on android and it hasn't came on kindle fire hd yet. So now when ppl send me videos on there I can't see it.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Toca boca is much more butter this game is not good I suggest toca Boca it is fun game and all the characters are unlock I hate this game don't buy ps bad graphics y'all didn't take y'all time marking in it and this coming from a kid this game is sad
B00ADS98FC|2.0|The music, songs, and singing were great, but all the bad language was unnecessary. It ruined the movie for me. I won't be rewatching it.
0385523912|5.0|this was a shocking revelation---north koreans live in real bondage---i could not put this book down<br />and-i was amazed that in America we do not know what is going on in other countries
B00CLMA3HK|4.0|There were a lot of things I enjoyed in this book, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. To be honest, I didn't care for the extent of the main character's abilities, though. It felt like they were a crutch, in places, to move the plot along, rather than allowing the characters to grow into it organically. The characters engaged me less because of it, although I did enjoy the overall story and settings. The setting was fun, mixing elements of steampunk, classic fantasy, and high science fiction. It was pretty well written, although as I mentioned, the plot didn't feel entirely organic to the characters, in some places. Still, I enjoyed it, and will be keeping an eye on the rest of the series' (I hate reading series' that haven't been completely written, and waiting for the next book to come out.)
B005LAIIHG|5.0|i was amazed at how this DVD was so realistic---how it was created is part of the DVD---<br />it called me to read the book again
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This is a very good quality case and it fits perfectly.  I like how it pulls together around the edge of the tablet to protect it from touching the zipper.  Excellent product.  FYI: also fits Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7\\").
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Super fun and challenging.  I played it every chance I got and finished in under a day.  Only thing left to say is...I want more!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Why in the world would you waste time adding something like this that would mar face of the Oz universe? Shallow, underdeveloped characters, predictable, uninteresting plot, stupid & annoying monkey companion (ala Jar Jar Binks style).<br /><br />If you enjoy the original Oz books or any of the Wicked series, please don't make the mistake of thinking this is anything that could hold its own among the greatness of those. Save yourself some time and money.

B009NLC1D6|5.0|After a recent trip to India where I spent some time studying Gandhi's life, I decided to watch the film again.  With more background--and a little more maturity--the movie was better now than when it first came out.
0071762345|5.0|As someone who works for a Social Media Management Team and Business, this book is a great tool and asset to any company. Not only will you get a better understanding of the work that goes into creating a great social media strategy, but real examples from pros who were just learning the skills too. Everyone starts from scratch on social media, but Dave really supports you throughout your entire process!<br /><br />For example, I even tweeted him while reading this book and he tweeted right back! I have no problem recommending his book to people looking for any type of Social Media advice because he seems to cover it all in his book. From connecting to your audience to engaging them honestly, he talks about real issues in social media and how everyone can overcome them!<br /><br />This was a fantastic read and I would suggest it to anyone who claims to be a social media guru, specialist, or even a community manager!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it has awesome features and a lot of people to choose from this game is also cool because you change cites SO you go all around the world.
B00AEFYW64|5.0|This movie is set in San Francisco and the story line is just great.  Connery and Harmon just seem to bounce off each other.  It is worth the money
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Maybe this movie is more enjoyable for teenagers. I found the plot quite boring and the movie was dragged out.
0143038583|5.0|Pollan seemlessly weaves together an analysis of the food industry, a primer in the ecology of farming and an eater's personal, sensual account of his experience.
B00CSFXR6E|4.0|The music is amazing.  We can get that out of the way because this review is for the Music On Vinyl reissue.  I also have the translucent purple original pressing, so I am fortunate enough to have a comparison.<br /><br />ARTWORK:<br />The jacket artwork on the reissue is very blurry like the CD cover was blown up whereas the original pressing is very sharp and high resolution.  The insert in the reissue is identical to the original, except that it is now 2 pages folded and there is additional artwork of the original master tapes. Very cool!  MOV has confirmed that the record was actually cut from 192kHz/24bit digital archives of the master tapes, however, and you can actually see the stickers on the master tape boxes indicating that they were digitally archived.<br /><br />VINYL QUALITY:<br />I have the purple Purple vinyl and the pressing itself is on-center and dead quiet.  I'd like to say that's normal for MOV, but it's been a bit hit or miss for this audiophile geared reissue company.  For comparison, my lightly used original pressing  is way off center on side B, and the vinyl is extremely noisy, so this is a breath of fresh air in that regard.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY:<br />The sound is quite distinctively and unusually different from the CD and original pressing.  \\"Unusually\\" because for most vinyl pressings, you have to really think about the sound improvements vs the digital equivalent, but that is certainly not the case for this copy.  While the original pressing is obviously cut from the CD master leaving any sound differences up to your equipment, this reissue is an entirely different beast.  Where the original mastering sounds V shaped (boosted bass, lowered mid, boosted treble), this sounds completely opposite (A shaped?), and is also a bit more centered which is becoming the norm for MOV (I like a wide soundstage, but I guess they don't).  It's hard to explain, but it sounds awesome until you compare it to the CD.  Basically if you drop the needle and sit back and listen, it sounds wonderful.  But, if you then decide to cue up the CD to the same spot and flip over to it, it's a total shock how different it sounds, and it's kind of like \\"Oh yeah, that's how I remember it sounding, but now it doesn't sound very good, it's too thin and harsh\\".  So then you switch it back to the vinyl and now all the sudden it sounds really weird because there's a ton of mid and no bass or sparkle in the treble, so now that doesn't sound good anymore either.  Basically- pop on the vinyl and enjoy it, and don't give in to the urge to compare or else you'll be disappointed all around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it!  It is such a great game.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  They did a good job making this game.
B0000669JL|5.0|What else can anybody say about this CLASSIC CD. I've bought this CD 3 times now in my Life. Once stolen Once old and scratched as a Youth in my younger days. Got it AGAIN. And if something happens to this one. Ill get it AGAIN! lol
B000FA675C|4.0|I must admit that I liked the beginning better than the end. At a certain point, some of the circumstances and details stretched the believability that had been established in the beginning. That being said, it was a fun read.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|First saw this movie on television when it was released.. The sets for this movie are spectacular, the acting is superb, especially the part of Caesar Nero. Life during this period of history is very accurately depicted, and the persecution of Christians during this time is very realistically portrayed. The story will hold your interest !
B008AWBQGM|2.0|The biggest problem I have with this album is that the first ten songs sound like one long song that has a few changes but basically sounds the same or are so unremarkable that you just don't care to listen to them.  There are no Skynyrd hooks like the old days which is sad since they still have enough tradition here to carry on at least in some Skynyrd vein.  Seriously, hang it up if you're just going to recycle the same old crap you've been recycling the last ten years.  Just because you have some heavy guitars doesn't mean you have a good song and these songs really are nothing that I'll remember.<br /><br />What made Skynyrd so popular and so long-lasting is that they were FUN!  None of the songs coming out of this band are fun, they're drudgery in some cases. The closest they come is \\"Do It Up Right\\".  Now THIS is a Skynyrd song.  Unfortunately, there are no where near enough of them to save this album from obscurity.  There was also one other thing that made Ronnie such a genius.  His songs were cross-overs.  Country, Southern Rock and Pop--anyone liking these primary music genres could buy into LS but this album cannot really even be categorized.  It's sad actually.  I still await a real Skynyrd album and haven't seen one since Street Survivors.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked the pace and intrigue of City of Bones. This was my first book that I have read by Cassandra Clare. I look forward to reading more of them.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|I think I recall hearing about it at some point but never saw it. Very clever and provocative about the extent the TV networks will go to see advertising. I loved the scene where Truman is freaking out and the actress pretending ot be Trumans wife turns to the camera and does a commercial... to much. Jim Carrey as usual (you will recognize some of his trademark expressions) is great and well suited to playing Truman.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game, very addictive. It is one of the few free games that you don't really need to spend money on.
B009WUBERW|1.0|I watched this on a whim but it was way over the top of anything I would ever want to watch. I turned it off after just a few minutes.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Easy purchase for me due to being into the whole blue-ray thing. There is some clarity difference for sure from dvd to the blue-ray. Don't forget to update your Blue-ray players.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I have loved this album since it came out. John was taken from us shortly after recording it. Yoko did the stripped down version and it is great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app but is expensive. I really like the white horse . She is pretty . Deducted right upgrade Yves high civic.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The game is fun and the graphics are good. I wish I could see my inventory at all times, it would make it easier to navigate.
B005OP28XS|5.0|yep addicted...totally amazing and have already re-watched.  Uh it says that I need more words, but seriously this series is just hilarious and awesome.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|It's not as good as the first one.  But perhaps I was expecting too much.  I would not recommend it.
B00701QRB8|5.0|This CD rocks! sounds like good hard 60's rock, not that overplayed flower power stuff.<br />Captain Beefheart is awesome on the harmonica and Ry Cooder, need I say more.<br />This is a re release from !999 and also has 6 bonus tracks.  it's my latest favorite CD
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a great app for the Kindle Fire. Optional clocks, and the alarm works well. Easy to set and convenient  because it is always around. I really like the ability to change clock styles and alarm sounds.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing zombie movie; my absolute all time favorite!! Now if only they made a movie or series from the book series The Forest of Hands and Teeth!

I ended up with this.after it was installed something else popped up on the screen and said now that I've done this the can share my information with other sites etc.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies.  We watch it over and over.  Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman did an amazing job in this show.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minion Rush is a really addictive game that is great for all ages. But it does freeze a little bit. It also has a lot of different challenges included in each round. It was kind of confusing at first but u will get a hang of it.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|When bands change their lead singers, there's always a worry that their sound will change to a point where it no longer sounds like the same band.  A perfect example of this was the the 1994 Motley Crue album with John Corabi. It was a fine album, but didn't sound like the Crue.  Well, here we have the 2013 album from the Queensryche featuring a new band member on the lead vocals, and as expected, the band's sound has changed...  it changed from their sound of the past decade back to the glory days of Queensryche when dueling guitar leads drew you into the music, and the soaring lead vocals kept you hooked.  Seriously folks, this album sounds as if you took Rage for Order, Mindcrime, Empire, and Promised Land, put them in a blender, and set it on high. After a thorough blending, you pour yourself a delicious shake that is the new eponymous Queensryche album.  All the classic elements are here.  Parker Lundgren's guitar dueling gels with Michael Wilton's to the point where you might start to think that Chris has returned to the band.  Ed and Scott provide their signature rhythm section and then there's Todd La Torre, who's voice bares such uncanny resemblance to a younger Geoff Tate that a casual fan probably couldn't tell that this is a different lead vocalist than the one featured on those aforementioned classic albums.  Please note that I am comparing him to a younger Geoff, because at this point in time, Todd La Torre actually sounds better than the present day Geoff Tate.  All this bodes well for the album's sound, but that wouldn't be enough if the songs themselves were not up to the standard, as was increasingly the case on the last few Queensryche albums.  Fortunately, even here the band gets back on the right track with stellar song writing with contributions from all band members.  There really isn't any filler material here, as the whole album is great from start to finish. For me, the standout tracks are Where Dreams Go Die, Redemption, Don't Look Back, and Fallout, but as I said, there are no weak tracks and it's fantastic from start to finish.  If I had to come up with a complaint, it would probably be that the band should have put at least 2 more tracks on the album, because once you listen to it from start to finish, it leaves you wanting even more of this classic 'Ryche goodness.  Over all, this is a stellar return to form from the Seattle quintet and deserves to be in every fan's collection. Highly recommended!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I already owned Above but over the years it has worn from play so this was a great chance to get some extras while replacing my copy.  I certainly wasn't disappointed.  Getting the Live at the Moore audio disk was a bonus, but the videos from two Mad Season shows was really what I enjoyed.  Just a great band with great music.

Some critics may say there are parallels and similarities to other movies, but I didn't feel that and I have seen most the SciFi movies out there from the last sixty years.  Whether you are a fan of Cruise or Morgan or not, it doesn't matter.  The story is compelling enough to satisfy most SciFi fans.  I went into this with no more than a few glimpses of preview scenes and no idea of the ending at all.  Although had I known it would have detracted some from the experience, it still wouldn't take away from the overall story, acting, scenery, and special effects.  My step-daughter begged me to pause it whenever she left the room, and my wife was upset when she came downstairs and realized we were watching it without her.  I had bought this so my wife need not worry about viewing it, but my point is the ladies will enjoy this one too so be sure they are present.<br /><br />A man and woman are left to finish mining the oceans before joining the rest of mankind on Jupiter's moon Titan.

0425263924|1.0|If I could give this book zero stars I would. I enjoyed the 1st book. Tolerated the 2nd. Felt obligated to finish the series, so tried to read the third. This book is hideous. The characters have no substence, the plot is so thin. All it is is raunchy sex scene after sex scene, with nothing much else going on.  I was bored to tears and couldn't even finish the book... which is a first for me! I borrowed all the books from a girlfriend, so I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this garbage. Also there are apparently two more books to come! Can't believe the author could drag this smut out that far but I definetly won't be reading. If you enjoy reading sex scene after sex scene with no charachter or plot development, this book is for you. For everyone else, I say PASS.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|The Conjuring, was more than I expected. In the last few years, horror movies released were flops, not scary or full of a good story. The Conjuring is the best by far, a classic Family in Peril story, with a good amount of emotional characters, and very good developement of said characters. The scares are effective, but their mostly creep outs, which really works, there are a good amount of spooky noises, and even a few laughs. All in all, The Conjuring is an effective horror/thriller with a good story, believeable characters, with great creepiness throughout.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I find it hard to aim those birds. I got the game because my grandsons love the game and I get great pleasure just listening to them laugh as they have fun with the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love playing this game. My kids really enjoy playing and watching each other. I have never had any problems with this app

1400067820|5.0|Antifragile is his latest tour de force and it is his finest work yet and the logical culmination of what I would like to call the Randomness trilogy. In fooled by randomness Taleb talked about assigning causes where none exist and how to take advantage in day to day life. In The Black Swan he spoke of events that while improbable had great impact and in Antifragile he talks about how to maximize the upside of random events while minimizing the harm.<br /><br />Antifragile is well written as always with Taleb's personality jumping off the pages. His insights are particularly engaging and there are numerous talks on youtube in which he talk about Antifragility. The thesis as with all great works is remarkably simple and seems obvious and intuitive once you get it.<br /><br />He essentially defines Antifragile as not fragile. Fragility is defined as breaking under volatility and stress say the way a porcelain cup breaks when let go. So anything Antifragile by definition prospers and thrives when there is volatility and randomness.<br /><br />He talks about how the systems built by humans and nature differ in the fact that human systems are more fragile and brittle. He gives numerous examples, the most common one being that the body always overcompensates for the stress it goes through but we continue to prepare for the mistakes that have already been made rather than preparing for new ones.<br /><br />He talks about several logical fallacies that humans make by mistaking absence of evidence for evidence of absence. He shows that whenever some new fangled food to consume is created by humans the burden of proof to show the benefits is upto us. He talks about how no one could prove that smoking was bad for us for a long time and this led people to believe that smoking was NOT bad because of absence of evidence. He talks about the arrogance of humans in believing that in a short duration they could come up with a better substitute for mother's milk.<br /><br />He talks about how the nation state is fragile and how any centralized system will eventually be fragile. He talks about the wisdom of the ancients and the way they carried on about adding elements of randomness to their lives. He talks about Seneca's wealth at length going to show how he tried to get in situations where his upside was maximized and downside minimized which he then states to be the true goal of stoicism.<br /><br />I liked the way he spoke of the human body liking randomness and appreciating it. Our health does not appreciate regular nutrition and rather than doing something everyday activites, food should  be consumed in bursts rather than at fixed intervals for that is the way we have evolved.<br /><br />The section I liked best though was the one on medicine and doctors where he spoke of the benefit of doing nothing a lot of the time because in a lot of the cases the body takes care of itself and anything that delays treatment is a plus. Medicine's first prerogative should be to do no harm. A lot of harm comes from what Taleb calls interventionism (which as you can guess is the tendency of doctors to do something rather than nothing).<br /><br />He talks about another sort of antifragility as well which is an upside by passing the risks onto someone else. One particularly illuminating passage mentions that fact that in ancient times the builder would be responsible for the building and if anything were to happen to the building the builder's head would be chopped off. He calls this having Skin in the game and points out that where banking and academia is concerned no one really has their skin in the game. When the going is good they get bonuses, when the going is bad there is no downside.<br /><br />What I also  liked about the book is that never once does he ask you to do something but mentions what he does instead.<br /><br />I think I have made the whole book sound much drier and much more academic than it really is but it is truly<br />a wonderful readfrom start to finish imbued with personality, opinion and a lot of anecdotes.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is the classic solitaire so, if you want to play that one from 1995, thats it. The only thing that it looked to me is that it was too squared... i don't know how to explain it but when you'll get it you'll understand. Anyway, good game.

B000TERLEK|5.0|When this album came out I was relatively new to the Coldplay scene.  This was one of the first albums in years where I could just listen to the whole thing, on repeat.  I love every song.  After this album I have been on a mission to buy every Coldplay album.  But that was set in motion by this album.  It is worth revisiting, even if you have listened to it before.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its great can get very addictive at times and can't believe how fun it is. Download now!!!!! Best game ever
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|5 stars to everything in this magnificently crafted &#34;masterpiece.&#34;<br /><br />If you enjoyed &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs,&#34; this production easily surpasses it. I am most impressed by the incredible attention to detail: clothing, vehicles, property of all kinds point to a production staff who know their business.  And, of course, the casting is superb. Each member of this outstanding cast from Mr. Bonneville on down carries their part with aplomb.<br /><br />Mr. Fellowes is to be congratulated for this wonderful series. His writing is faultless in creating this revealing picture of British life of this period.

0394818237|5.0|This book is a must for a child who loves Richard Scarry books. It is huge in size, and each page is so filled with little characters and things, that a small child could look at the wonderful illustrations on just one or two pages for a long time.

I love all kinds of music, so to hear a wide selection, and all done so well --- WOW!  Some artists have the same \\"sound\\" on every song and every album, and some people have a preference for only one type of music.......for those people I'd say that perhaps they should just download the MP3 for the songs that fit their taste.

B00CTJ7KKS|5.0|This show was absolutely amazing. Not only were the characters real, but they were believable in the way they acted. The humanity displayed with this show was amazing, and even though a majority of the main characters were billionaires, they were relatable through the way they acted and their emotions. I would recommend this show to anyone, as it is amazing and I don't know if I can wait until the second season comes out October 9th. The episodes were woven together beautifully, and the season finale leaves you on a cliff hanger that I wasn't even sure if I could handle. I highly recommend this show to anyone, and hope people enjoy it jsut as much as I did.

0061353248|3.0|The book is thorough in its coverage of the factors that affect human irrationality and makes valid although somewhat obvious observations of human behavior. Ariely does support all his theories with his own experiments, thoroughly explaining connections between our irrationality and the standard process by which we all justify it. As a book, Predictably Irrational is an interesting read with a variety of odd and sometimes surprisingly simple experiments that give insight into the thought process that affects our rationality. But don't expect to leave with much new found knowledge. The book is however enjoyable, and anyone who is fond of psychology and the human mind would at the very least enjoy it.

1612191290|4.0|David Graeber's Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a broad and sometimes tedious stroll through human history with a focus on personal economic relationships, exchange and indebtedness. Basically, it's less about currency and more about anthropology. Graeber's premise is a startling one: Contrary to the simplistic view of economic history--one that says before there was money there was bartering and that was all--humans always have and still to this day use debt as a means to interact with one another. Insights like this and numerous historical examples populate the book, but be forewarned that the majority of the timeline covers the ancient and pre-Renaissance periods. If early history is your thing, then maybe you'll have a better go of it than me.<br /><br />My favorite takeaway is a quote that isn't even attributed to Graeber. It appears early on in order to foreshadow that the history of debt has more causes and effects than any one answer can provide. I'm adopting it as my new mantra, and I suspect it will be even more relevant as I get older and try to make sense of our multifaceted world.<br /><br />\\"For every subtle and complicated question, there is a perfectly simple and straightforward answer, which is wrong.\\" --H.L.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|We have 3 boys, and we all watch this. Great family movie! You may find something out about yourself also... There a twists, drama, action. Not a boring movie by any stretch! Watch preview-If you think it looks good-do it! You won't be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kids and I absolutely love playing this game together. My little girl loves My Little Ponies, so I knew she would love this.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Wife and I enjoyed. Humor and drama. Good acting as well. Refreshing, as I liked more than I thought I would (not just another chick flick).
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like this app it is just like looking at ebay on a computer but on your kindle fire instead
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This was a great movie for the family. My wife, kids, and myself all rated it 4.5 or higher! Watch the preview-if you liked that, don't second guess it!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|The first 2 seasons of The Walking Dead were absolutely fantastic, but didn't like season 3 much at all.  I was actually sorry they killed off Lori - I really liked this character.  But I was very happy when Andrea was killed off - couldn't stand her.  I don't understand who this person was supposed to be - the writers made her into a selfish, mean (but didn't want people to get killed), intelligent, stupid woman.  She was horribly mean to Dale, a fatherly friend who truly cared about her, and left Beth who was suicidal and did indeed attempt suicide in her absence.  And this intelligent woman then has a relationship with a cult leader, all the while entirely stupid about it.  Writers, please get your stuff together and don't ever do this again with a character.  And why did you have to kill off Dale, the conscience of the group and a truly loveable character?<br /><br />I've rewatched seasons 1 and 2, but can't stand rewatching season 3.  The whole story line about the town and its \\"Governor\\" just made me feel uncomfortable, I think partially because of Andrea being in the middle of it.  They didn't need this story line - focusing on the core group of people and their dynamics is much more interesting than adding a bad guy to create new conflict.  And yet, I can actually see this sort of thing happening if there really was a zombie problem.  A safe place is what people would desperately want, and a cult leader would be a real possibility.  But I don't find this interesting.  The stereotypical crazed leader with zombie heads in tanks and a zombie daughter coupled with a relationship with a woman who is all over the map just wasn't interesting to me.  Also, I am puzzled as to the reason the \\"Governor\\" was compelled to find the prison and make them leave - he clearly said he had no interest in the prison for his people.  Nothing about this made sense.<br /><br />I am looking forward to season 4, and hope it is really good again.  This is one of the best series I've seen in a long time, despite my complaints about season 3.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Brilliant actors who gave life to a marvelous story that unfolds deep concepts such as time, afterlife, karma, and the recognition of interconnectedness of all of us  through the amazing power of love and forgiveness.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Graphics are amazing, minions are adorable like in the movies..<br />You'll be addicted within a short period of time.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is such a well written show, we love it and are sad to hear this is the last season!
B002MFULQO|5.0|I love this movie. It's very well put together and the acting is amazing. There is a lot of interesting facts that I'm sure most didn't know about the assassination of JFK! It's a must see!
B006GH6IWU|5.0|best documentary i've seen on queen it concentrated on the band's history, only discussing freddie personal life when it had to be discussed briefly. And then it was handled in a most tactful and dignified way. i didn't want to know the sorted details. I wanted to know about the band and freddie's professional career. great job
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The familiar Daniel Craig; exotic locations; and intriguing stunts; lure you into watching a terrible script; written by the mind of a disturbed second-grader.<br /><br />Throughout the film the script conveniently skips obstacles. For instance an unarmed Bond is shown chasing a professional assassin armed with a machine gun across open ground; next frame; suddenly Bond is wrestling with the guy.<br /><br />The bad guy hatches an intricate plan, (we are told years in the making), for MI6 to unwittingly bring him to London and close to \\"M\\"; when the guy could accomplish the same thing by buying a plane ticket to London and driving to the Capitol building.<br /><br />The gist of the story is a bad guy out to kill \\"M\\". Yet, when we hear \\"M's\\" side of the story; \\"M\\" is admittedly in the wrong, and the bad guy has good reason for revenge.<br /><br />The insertion of a homosexual bad guy and Bond seeming to enjoy the homosexual flirting; reveals this Bond film script was given to the homosexual lobby for political motive, and the script-writer was chosen by politics rather than by merit.<br /><br />The script is so bad; it has ruined the credibility of the Bond franchise. I want a refund. I will wait for any future Bond films to come to TV.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is the second installment in the Fifty Shades series and you need to read the first one before you even consider this one....it's imperative. I really enjoyed the trilogy and yes the steamy scenes are scalding(sometimes it seemed like to many steamy scenes) but its dynamic of Christian and Ana's relationship that kept me interested. This book is pivotal in the series all the important secrets come out finally giving readers a better understanding of the inner workings of Christian Grey. Ana is not a push over which makes the book because its her strength of character(even though she would dismiss that idea)that saves Christian. Really good! Hope you enjoy it!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|So fun I can't stop playing. My kids love playing it too. We argue over who is going to play next.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Very disappointing. Both other books by this author are much better. This book has too many people in it<br />and after so much time has passed the reader no longer cares what happens to these folks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm hooked.  I used to play this game with cards, but now I can play anywhere.  I can't believe I waited so long to go digital.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Picked up for free on some promotion Amazon had. I wanted a calculator that would do fractions.  The price was right. It does what I want. It is only four stars because of little piddly things such as entering decimals can be problematic and to be honest I wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't free one day.  It does suit it's purpose more than adequately.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I enjoy playing this game and trying to beet other friends and family scores. Which is shown in game. Its fun.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|it's nice to have this app to see how much time you have left especially while playing a game on the kindle fire
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Really liked this book. It bounces back and forth a tad which some may not like but I followed it pretty easily. Hate the fact the next book comes out 2014. Write faster man!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|ok I started to play it the then I couldn't do anything but turn it on and it did it again but it couldn't tire it on so I let it die and delete it and then it was fine my kindle.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have chosen 5 star because it is indeed a 5 star. I have been using this app for one month now and it allows me to save my music either video of Mp3 mode (Audio). The down side is that I cant seem to save the same music both video and audio. Any way I still like this app.. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to download anything from YouTube.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|If you like sound tracks that have emotion and a deep sound that you can listen to over and over, this is one to buy.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I chose this rating because it keeps my information in good order and it has a password protection that works fine. If I lend my Kindle to a friend I don't have to worry about him/her getting access to my information. I like this very much.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This movie is so full of holes. I didn't buy into the premise from the start, which maybe the problem.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charges both my Galaxy s4 and asus transformer at ac speed at the same time. I love it. Awesome if you have a friend in the car so you can both charge your phones as well.
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|Amaranthe's genre and sound is one of a kind, in which I saw them perform here in Las Vegas earlier this week, and their live performance was amazing. With that, after their show, they hung out with the fans at the Merch booth, took pictures and signed autographs. These guys are one of a kind and I am currently addicted to them.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Good for smaller children and familiies, high on action, not much plot or character development...kind of like watching Arnold in &#34;Commando&#34; but for kids.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Amazing graphics, the controls take a little while to get used to, AMAZING story line, only thing it needs is the ability to choose if you want rock with the baddies or roll with the heroes. This is I half to say hands down the most amazing game I have seen on the Amazon game store. If you want a Sci-Fi fps then check out the NOVA series. If your still reading this you deserve a fricking medal. Also if the developers of this game you should make it on a game console I.E. Xbox 360, Xbox one, PlayStation 3&amp;4
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Nice for the kids, a little short on character or plot development, and also thin in terms of relevance to the Holiday, however not a bad movie...
B000LTAY1U|1.0|have to wear watch 24 hours to keep correct time, take it off for a few hours and it loses time, hate to return anything , but i'll have to make an exception, this is not new technolegy, expected better from seiko
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Dare I say it, a terrific offering from Disney.  In coming up with a new way to market the Disney properties, this mish mash of popular fairy tales along with other Disney properties advances what was once the Sunday night ritual of watching the old Disney series on network TV to a must see, cliffhanger fantasy series.  That said, I sometimes find the attempts at contemporary political commentary via scripting to be a bit manipulative and therefore I watch with a cautious eye.
B00886184A|5.0|I was prepared to be a little disappointed with Free Hand and not with the others in this boxed set. Let's start with the 'others;' brilliantly remastered and fresh, even when compared to the 35th anniversary issues!! Now, Free Hand; I'm not sure what one reviewer was talking about when he mentioned not being happy with the compression, but if he was talking about what would be the equivalent of LP speed I can understand a little. It sounded like it was ever-so-slightly slower (therefore lower in pitch) than other versions. I do have the LP, so I could go back and forth between original release and this one, but why bother; it sounds great to me this way. I also loved the out-takes and extra tracks on disc one. Another thing people should be aware of is the fact that four discs does not equate to four albums. This package has all of the releases from Free Hand to Civilian. One disc for Free Hand and extras, one for Interview and The Missing Piece, one for Play the Fool, and one for Giant for a Day and Civilian. Odd ... I never liked Giant for a Day before. For some reason this remaster (and some time away from it) got me actually to like it. Yes, I liked it ... completely ... on it's own merits. CIVILIAN has always been a favorite of mine and it sounded better in countless ways. I was amazed!<br />BUY THIS BOXED SET!!!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Growing up in the early 80's this was a cinematic staple.  Objectively rating this is too difficult for me to quanitfy, the movie simply captures so much of what it feels like to be 14 and trying to figure out what it all means in 9th grade.  Seems to be as relevant to my 13 year old today as it was for a 15 year old boy 28 years ago...
0446310786|1.0|With so much good American literature around, I really can't understand how someone can call this a classic. The book is pure cliché and melodrama, from beginning to end. Characters are more like shallow caricatures: there are the good guys, the bad guys, and nothing in-between. Nine-year-olds' conversations and thoughts are annoyingly unrealistic and the plot is absolutely predictable. Remembers me a piece of propaganda; maybe with a good purpose, but propaganda anyway. Looking for Southern fiction? Stick to Faulkner!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Language and content certainly acceptable for any pre-teen, cute story, with a dash of retro music.  Very much like Glee but with better talen, scripting and execution.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like it. It is a good app. Little freezing and stalling tomorrow an optimum performance on Twitter. Very good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this version.  I had it on iPad but it's actually just as easy to use...maybe better...on kindle fire HD.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Great book, Harry Bosch series is a good series. I look forward to the next book in the series. You feel like you are part of his life.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This movie was so powerful I showed it to two groups and have joined organizations, done research and am committed to stopping this travesty. See this and share it!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Never saw season 1 until Cory' s death. He was the heart of the show. The casting is brilliant, but he  was the &#34;raw&#34; talent of the show  and amazingly believable. Will be interesting to see how his death is handled. Am sure it will be as moving and sensitive as the other issues that the show has addressed. Unfortunately Cory' s issues are a reality for many , too. Can't help thinking about Lea......and &#34;A Star Is Born.&#34; What a shame.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I did like this version of Angry Birds - however, about halfway through levels, IT WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD ANYMORE!  Made me one Angry Bird!  &#62;: #  That's the reason I only gave it 2 stars.<br /><br />If it works for you, you'd like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesomely fun game! I DEFINITELY recommend this for fans of Temple Run games and also Subway Surfers. I have watched both of the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; movies so I love all the minions on this game and I also love how you can get a &quot;despicable bonus&quot; on here. I recommend this game for any age. Hope you get it!!!<br />  ENJOY!!!!!!!!  : ) : ) : ) : ) : )
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I did not like this version of Angry Birds.  I found it too complicated to be any fun for me.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Loved this book. Read this on recc from another person.  Did find it a little heavy in some areas so have decided to have a break before reading the others in the series but cant wait to read them.  What started out as one book turned into a completely different book and was disappointed it finished.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Review number 83. Gig took place and recorded live on April 22, 2012 at the Performing Arts Center in San Luis Obispo, California. Although I haven't seen Crosby, Stills & Nash perform live yet - I've always appreciated their work since I was like maybe in the sixth grade. With this 2-CD / DVD release of their 2012 tour - I was thoroughly convinced that these veterans (for the most part) still have it. Tunes that managed to bring back to mind some precious memories include \\"Carry On / Questions\\", \\"Long Time Gone\\" (used to love hearing this on our classic rock radio station), \\"Southern Cross\\", \\"Deja Vu\\", the beautiful \\"Wooden Ships\\", \\"Teach Your Children\\" and \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\". Then there are the two Buffalo Springfield songs \\"Bluebird\\" and the must-hear \\"For What's It's Worth\\". Plus, I didn't mind taking in their new material like \\"Almost Gone\\", the somewhat inspiring \\"Radio\\" and \\"As I Come Of Age\\". Heard that '2012' has been shown on the Palladia Channel with limited commercial interruptions. Highly recommended.
B00280LYIM|2.0|Almost like your typical Disney movie, no one dies except for minor characters that you don't care about and that you don't have enough time to build any connection with also for Jackson's age he is quite immature and kind of dumb.
140006922X|1.0|Author is anti Christian. Don't waste your money on this book if you are looking for truth. He has stated that he has a PHD in the history of religions, which he doesn't (not that you need one to know who Jesus is) The PHD he has is in Sociology. This book is clearly just one man's beliefs. It is sad that he will make a lot of money with this book of lies.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|iPod version is easier to use. you can message and chat much easier on the iPod. all I have to say.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|i really had low expectations of this movie but it was actually pretty good and was an easy watch. done
B008OOYALE|1.0|you run out of gold. it gives you quests requiring obscene amounts of gold. uninstalled. just charge for the app and give us quests that I don't have to buy gold for.
B003G93ZCM|5.0|I watched every second of this stuff as a kid! You couldn't pull me away from the TV. The astronauts of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs are the stuff of legend. Captain (Ret.) Gene Cernan tells it like it was and doesn't hold back. It's an easy read and was hard to put down.
074401493X|5.0|Its very nice, nice keychain. Something i will hold on to during my training in bootcamp to remind me of survival of the fittest
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I am a big fan of the Jack Reacher series. That being said this is not one of the better books. Anyone reading this series should not start with this book. I got the feeling that content was lacking so Lee Childs filled the pages with a lot of detail that just made the boom drag on.
B005LAII44|1.0|I really enjoyed the first movie, ***SPOILER ALERT***but Retaliation just left me wondering where all the original cast went to.  I looked forward to this movie because I really liked the part Channing Tatum played, but he got killed off right away in this movie.  I like Dwayne Johnson, but he just doesn't belong in every movie.  The omission of Dennis Quaid as Gen Hawk and also the omission of Marlon Wayans and the rest of the original Joes left this episode wanting from the very beginning.  Yes, it was a good action movie, but too many originals either died or were just left out.  The reason for a sequel is because the first worked so well.  This one didn't work at all
B00760BPOC|4.0|I really love this series but it is starting to seem (in this book and the previous one) a bit Robert-Jordan-like in that the introduction of new characters and storylines suggests that it may be hard to tie things up with only two more books to go. In saying that I am just disappointed that I have to wait for the next book in the series to be released<br /><br />I love that you never know who will prevail!! Makes the story so much more exciting. Hate that I have to wait for the next book in the series  to be published in 2014.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Lots of life's lessons learned by James. He does a good job conveying the experiences, in enough detail to make the point but not too much personal dirt. I like this depth, because I don't need to hear the gory details of people's failures. Skimming and eluding to them is enough.<br />I definitely have started to choose myself, now it's up to me to follow through and see where it takes me!<br />James is definitely worth following on Twitter and his blog carries a lot of what is in the book and MORE!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The action in this book kept me from wanting to put it down! Perfect ending to a phenomenal series...May the odds be ever in your favor :)
1608871827|5.0|Everything that I expected. Full of great images, the posters are great, lots of concepts... just beware that if you have not watched the movie yet, there's some big spoilers in there.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I love the characters and I enjoy the story line! The brokenness the characters reveal toward each other sent me on an emotional Roller coaster! I can't wait for book 4!
1433537419|5.0|Good size, not too big but still containing a lot of notes breaking down the verses. Small font but still easy to read.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I love the characters and I enjoy the story line! The brokenness the characters reveal toward each other sent me on an emotional Roller coaster!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Picture and sound is so amazing.  For any hard core Star Wars fan!!!<br />Many deleted clips you have never seen before...
B001EBWINQ|5.0|The movie industry will never make a film like this again. It is truly one of the greats. It is outstanding.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its great and it barely gets old the thing I would change is to make more places to go to
B007DIQC90|5.0|It was playing on XM, so I decided to get it. Love the fact they are from Ice Land. Nice to hear groups from other countries that are good. I am a &#34;alt&#34; music fan. Amazon is a good place to find my music, they have everything
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|THIS SHOW IS AMAZING.  FROM BEGINNING TO END.  IT IS A JOURNEY FROM LIGHTS OUT TO LIGHTS ON.  YOU CAN SAY WAHT YOU WANT ABOUT MADONNA BUT THE WOMAN CANPUT ON A SHOW.  I WISH I COULD DO WHAT SHE DOES IN 2 HOURS INUST 15 MINS.  EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH THIS SHOW AT LEAST ONCE.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|I expected this movie to be exciting but it was boring and didn't seem to have a decent story line.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|I ordered and paid for a blu ray Iron Lady. What was sent to me was a regular dvd.Misleading description of the item. I am dissatisfied. I felt gypped.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|A well crafted film that shows why so many other countries understand how to make a move that is sweet, touching, but with a serious edge...  I wish Hollywood would learn how to make a movie this good...
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Boy movie all the way. According to my husband this is a great movie and realty worth watching.  Any fan of the Marvel's will enjoy
1455576387|4.0|If you are a fan of the TV series, you will enjoy this book.  It describes how King and Maxwell met, and explores the mysteries concerning how they lost their government jobs.  What I enjoyed most were the twists and turns in this novel.  Many things and people are not what they seem.  The reader does not find out the true identities and motivations until the very end of the story.  While not a great piece of literature, this story certainly held my interest.  I recommend it to anyone interested in a good story.  I can see this novel being made into a TV movie.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've never played the game anywhere else before, I made a few game searches, found this and decided to try it. Man was I blown away. Ever wanna be like Yugi in Yugi-Oh? Or be like Harry Potter and do magic? Or play the real Dungeons and Dragons and do battle with magical and mythical creatures? Yeah, this game was all of that and more! With great graphics and interesting storyline and addictive game play, its got everything to keep me happy! I loved it so much I actually went on and bought the premium pack, and now I love it even more and I can't put it down. It's brain stimulating fun, and will definitely satisfy the nerd in you.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I have not yet purchased this...but as a true fan...I would like to inform you, the date is incorrect.<br /><br />That is all.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|GREAT movie!!  Very pleased.  I'd watch it again.  Easy to rent and view.  Thanks, Amazon.  Enjoyed the second one too!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Two brothers and their angel battle the apocalypse. They find archangels and a terrible future and find each other in tearing up the script and writing their destiny themselves.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This Kindle sleeve is attractive and multi-purpose. I use it as a handbag when my wallet is too small and my purse too large... I also use it for my Kindle ;-)
B0058ZPNOK|4.0|Seriously I have a friend that looks and acts just like him.  Was a cute movie I thought.  You will either love him or hate him.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fast action.  Love the graphics and how fast you can go through the levels. To sit and relax in the evenings,and watch tv is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely loved this game. It's very fun and addicting. Really makes you think and I just love a good challenge.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved it. It has great graphics. You must get it. The videos are great. The story is shocking and great.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Pretty fun game with lots of interesting gadgets and challenges to do during the game play. Would like to not have to buy coins for costumes and stuff
B005K17RU0|4.0|Before the last update it was horrible so I started using the Weather Channel app. One day when I was updating my apps I saw they had one. I was like might as well check it out. So I did and it was great.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think it's a great app just the cost for characters and their respective powers are a little high to really enjoy the game completely
B0097C8XL0|1.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot but lately this game has been stopping a lot. I haven't played in two months because  everytime I put it it stop. ;/
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever! Some people may not realize that this game works out your reflexes. I love this game and i think the whole would too. My favorite thing about this game is the world tour places that they put us in,i think it's amazing that they even came up with that. IT'S GENIOUS. Great job subway surfers crew!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like this game an  I play it a lot but the only problem I  have is that it's too slow!!!!! It takes a while too load and you start getting frustrated and it sometimes lags....but otherwise it's addicting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a amazing calculator i recommend that you get it it is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend that you get it
B002RI9SC4|5.0|In this fabulous read I saw every ones perspective :  Bella Jacob Edward Rose Emmet all of there coven/family if you read the others try there are some of the most wonderful exiting characters in any book ever<br /><br />JJJJJJJJUUUUUUUSSSSSSSTTTTTTT  RRRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAAAAADDDDDDD
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Not as good as the first two.  Tied up the storyline story but was disappointed in the overall theme and ending.  Was left wanting more.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I play with my son, my daughter-in-law and the Secretary in the office....we are having such a good time drawing the words and talking about our silly pics the next day!
140053271X|5.0|Ordered this product for a family memeber . Excellent service from Barnes and Noble on set up and operation. I would highly reocommend this product for anyone who likes to read
1439153663|5.0|This is a great book told from a different perspective, but about a different time.  The characters are well drawn -- all flawed, even the ones you like, but understandable.  Too many people compare it to The Help, but I think that sells it short.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show with characters that you'll instantly love & hate.  If you're not a fan of lawyers, you'll like this group
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It's a good game but it almost bored me to sleep ,so add some fun games blah blah blah blah blah
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is about dying children. But what are we, all of us, but those about to die? This book will open your eyes to what it means to be alive, and what it costs. Doesn't matter if you're not a child and are not yet overtly dying. If you are human, you are dying. And you are alive. All at once. If you're in a moment in time where these thoughts make you cringe and want to shriek, read this book. If you're not in such a moment, read this book.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Love that I can watch this series on amazon instant video while i'm on myntreadmill.  I hated to miss out on Dexter.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the kind of game that sucks you in. Very disappointed that the end came to soon. Please please please continue with more mind teasing rooms!
0374275637|5.0|I ordered this book on the recommendation of Fareed ZaKaria, as listed in The Week magazine.<br /><br />The edition I received looked brand new, as if it had never been opened.  I definitely would order from these people again.
0553801503|4.0|The binding was broken on the book.  But otherwise enjoyed the book.  As a son of a librarian, opening a new book is done in a certain way.  Most people don't know how to this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game spend hours playing it especially it's great that you can compete against your friends on Facebook love it.
B00DVW908C|5.0|This book was absolutely gorgeous!! It has all the suspense and thrill of a normal Dr Who episode, and also has that sweet Ten/Rose relationship aspect too:) 5 stars!!!!!
4789009637|5.0|Everything is great. The book is everything that I thought and needed it to be.I highly recommend this to Japanese students.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|Wong Kar Wai blew up the art house scene and the Chinese cinema world when this was released. Like always Criterion puts together its own work of art in this edition.

B008BUK0XI|3.0|Movie was ok, DVD quality was not so good...Skipped & froze quite a bit. Oh well, you get what you pay for!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This movie charmed me the first time I saw it in a movie theater, and I couldn't wait to own the DVD. I love just about anything Maggie Smith appears in. Something about this story really touched me, probably because of my advancing age; however I've talked to young friends who absolutely adored the movie too. I love the humor, the romance, and of course, the heavenly music!  This is one I will enjoy watching again and again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very erotic! My friends told me, &#34;it's like porn in a book.&#34; Love it!! I recommend this book to erotica & romance lovers!!
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Then I did not get Borat either... If you enjoy it you have more tolerance for it than I do...
B00A4B9A1U|2.0|I have waited for the Oliver Stone work to become available. That  it is was offered on Kindle at a reasonable price so much the better. Wrong- to fully appreciate the book you need the hard copy.<br />References and footnotes are important to any historical presentation. I knew that. The first three chapters went smoothly then the footnotes and references appeared.  Often jamming my Kindle to turn the pages to chapter four I have yet to reach it. I am sure a great book but not for Kindle.<br /> Can I get a refund?
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Some nice raw music from the vaults, don't think twice, just buy it.  Some great liner notes as well, this album is in heavy rotation on my music list.  For you guitar players out there, its nice to hear some less-processed Hendrix and his technique is very clear.  Get it!
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew McConaughey was excellent in this movie, part well played!  I enjoyed the movie, good entertainment.  I would say, if you are thinking about watching it.... do it.  You'll enjoy it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|What I like best is the ability to bring up a post and be taken back to where you were when you exit, vs. the mobile web version that scrolled back to the top of your newsfeed.

0811877485|3.0|These decals look fantastic!  Put them in my Kindergarten classroom, and they really liven up the space.  Unfortunately, the material they're made from is really thin compared to other decals, and the adhesive is nowhere near good quality.  The larger pieces arrived folded with a fairly sharp crease; the crease won't allow it to stay flat on the wall.  Decals should be rolled, not folded.  Planning to laminate the larger pieces and use tape to keep them up.

B00BNWWVFG|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Steven Soderbergh's \\"Side Effects\\" is like a smooth-running train that suddenly derails halfway to its destination. What starts off as a compelling social drama about depression, the pharmaceutical industry and medical ethics suddenly becomes a Hitchcockian brew of false accusations, deception and retribution. It's not that the second half is bad per se - the movie is compulsively watchable from first minute to last - but one feels cheated by the loss of so much potential and promise.<br /><br />Rooney Mara plays a young woman whose husband (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison for insider trading. Emily has long been the victim of depression and, when she attempts suicide, she comes under the care of a seemingly ethical psychiatrist (Jude Law) who prescribes an experimental drug for her. After a tragedy brought on by the medication, the two are suddenly plunged into a crisis that could mean jail time for Mara and the loss of both license and practice for Law.<br /><br />So far so good, as the screenplay by Scott Z. Burns examines the many thorny ethical issues surrounding the over-medicating of patients, the impersonal nature of Big Pharma, the prevalence of medical malpractice and the legal complications that often result when mental illness and prescription drugs are crucial factors in a crime. Burns has created a cast of characters who are believable and empathic, individuals we can clearly identify with because they are caught in a tragedy not necessarily of their own making. But then the writer throws it all away by turning the whole thing into a thriller made up of secret alliances, double and triple crosses, and craftily executed revenge. As stated earlier, Soderbergh pulls it off like a master, but one regrets that the movie turns what could have been an insightful and profound look into a serious social issue into just another melodramatic whodunit.<br /><br />The acting is excellent throughout, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ann Dowd rounding out the ensemble.<br /><br />You won't be able to turn it off, but you also might feel a bit cheated in the end.Ann Dowd rounding out the ensemble.<br /><br />You won't be able to turn it off, but you also might feel a bit cheated in the end.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|Love this movie.  I really love the independent type.  You have to love the characters and story pulling at them all.  This is one I will have to watch periodically.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Being a fan of sushi, I loved this movie.  It was enjoyable, educational, and uplifting.  The only thing that make me sad after watching it was knowing that that quality of sushi is probably ONLY found at Jiro's place, hence I'll never eat it ;)
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Such a good album and it is is clear to the ear unlike vapor trails (although as I write this the remixed version of VP is due out Oct 1!!) This is for me the best album since Signals. Just for the killer instrumentals alone this album is worth picking up. I think it has a leg up on Clockwork Angles, but both are stellar. I am surprised at the 4 star average, as its classic Rush.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Even though the movie was sad, I'm amazed that this was based on real events. I can't even imagine having to go through what this family went through. I'm glad there was a happy outcome in the end. Strongly tugs at your heart strings!

B0090SI582|5.0|My honest thoughts on<br />The Wolverine<br /><br />Despite the edits & cuts made to the theatrical cut...<br />This is hands down one of the best Marvel Adaptations ever<br /><br />The scene with Logan and The Bear jockeying for position of the woods is brilliant<br />The detail in everything Japanese is stunning!<br />The fact a Huge American Film Studio was allowed to film in Japan the way they did and really Captured the \\"Real\\" modern Japan is just so cool<br />The setting of Japan is it's own Characters<br />The cast is perfect<br />Hugh Jackman was born to be Wolverine<br />I wish they didn't cut his hair I always loved Logan with longer hair (he just looks so much cooler IMO)<br />Tao Okamoto as Mariko great casting she looks just like Mariko in the comic books... You can see so much looking into her eyes<br />Rila Fukushima as Yukio is a amazing discovery  (She steels every scene she is in.... her future in acting looks to be limitless) Hopefully she is brought into future X-Men films<br />'Cause she is awesome<br />The story is very close to a Frank Miller Story very dark and extremely deep<br />The Bullet train scene is stunning and just perfect to the smallest detail (maybe one of the best looking 3D Scenes cause it flows and pops)<br />IMO Disney should've just did the right thing and released it in both PG-13 and the hard 'R' Cut<br />it meant to be extremely dark and raw. And to be cut so much to get a family friendly PG-13 was a epic fail since it didn't do very good.....<br />The Easter egg ending is just awesome (A very small glimpse into X-Men Days of Future Past)<br /><br />Which brings me to the movie going public<br />What a bunch of sheep jerk-offs<br />this film is a must see in 3D and at the cinema but, yet it bombed<br />why is that really???<br />Iron Man 3 was like having chemo done so bloody bad<br />and people flocked like gang-busters<br />but, a film like Wolverine is passed really why?<br />Cause it has a extremely smart story that doesn't need things blowing up every 3min. to mask what a piece of trash it is!<br />Go out and see this film Support this film<br />Cause it's a future classic  10/10<br />Hopefully at some point there will be a Director's Cut released of this Filmesn't need things blowing up every 3min. to mask what a piece of trash it is!<br />Go out and see this film Support this film<br />Cause it's a future classic  10/10<br />Hopefully at some point there will be a Director's Cut released of this Film

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I got this app as the FAOTD and was so glad I did! It is one of the best games I have played in quite a long time. I couldn't put the it down until I conquered every level. I have never written a review on games until now because I usually just don't have the time. This one...I made sure I made time to give the developer props...way to go :) and thanks for the entertainment. Hope there is more to come. Also would like to add that if it wasn't the FAOTD it is well worth the .99 if not more!

B00C8YOIR2|4.0|Dead Medium is an engaging and funny tale of life after death that is likely to appeal to a wider audience than the usual paranormal genre readers.<br /><br />For me, the power of this story lies in the simplicity of its telling. These are very ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances, and many comic moments ensue.<br /><br />The unmistakably British humour reminded me a little of the Ealing Comedy re-runs I watched as a child.<br /><br />May Trump is very nicely characterised as the fiercely independent, crotchety old cat lady. Her cynical witticisms, suffer-no-fools approach to life, and her stiff upper-lip make her very likeable and identifiable. I have known many such stoical, self-sufficient characters in real life.<br /><br />A couple of things prevented me from giving this book a higher rating.<br /><br />I hate to nit-pick, but the book is littered with typos, incorrect word usage and minor punctuation errors. It could really benefit from the fine-tooth comb of editing to give it that final polish, as it is a great story at its heart.<br /><br />The first third of the book really worked for me. It was simple, character-driven storytelling at its best. I had laugh out loud moments and quite snickers and I really engaged with May's character and her journey to adjust to the afterlife.<br /><br />Where the novel fell down for me was when it began to lose sight of that simplicity. The middle section felt like a bit of a spare tyre, veering into (in my opinion) some unnecessary and occasionally repetitive scenes. The surreal 'Wild West' parts meandered and the plot and humour seemed to lose their way for a time.<br /><br />I can see how Edwardian ghost George's dialogue might be a sticking point for some readers. It felt forced at times, overly complicated and there were times I was picturing Yoda in plus-fours. (Perhaps that was intentional?)<br /><br />Towards the end the pacing and the humour picked up again and the finish was both unexpected and satisfying.<br /><br />Favourite quotes<br /><br />After May discovers she has died: &#34;There were so many things left undone, there was washing up in the sink for a start.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;She was a harlot in surgical stockings, but she had a fire inside not unlike her own.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks to the Lovers of Paranormal group on Goodreads for introducing me to this book and to author, Peter John, for the opportunity to read your wonderful story.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased my own copy of the book from Amazon

B000002J6F|5.0|This album is great from beginning to end, but \\"The Treasure\\" is so good, it swallows up the rest of the album and you forget just how good the rest of it us. Doubly amazing is that most people have never heard this song, and will be hooked on first listen.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is exciting to play and is a real adrenalin rush! Highly recommend to others looking for a clean, enjoyable gaming experience.
0062255657|4.0|I like Neil Gaiman's writing so I picked this one up.  It is a short novel but I don't agree with those reviewers who claim that the ending was predictable and pat.  On the contrary, it didn't end the way I anticipated it would.  I love the veil that Gaiman draws up to allow the mythic and the mysterious into the everyday life of a child.  Makes you remember what it was like to believe that the world is a magical place with unseen forces moving behind the curtain--back when innocence was the norm and a calm acceptance of the balance of the universe was what framed each day.  If you enjoyed American Gods and Anansi Boys, this will also find a favored spot next to those on your shelf.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Kids love this! I love it because it encourages them to be creative and it's unlike the typical games. They also like to watch  Minecraft videos on youtube. Unfortunately a lot of them are too violent and contain offensive language. Too bad because the kids can really learn useful tips and get more use out of the game, but it requires close supervision. We also recently purchased the Skins Studio for Android and are experiencing difficulty uploading the created skins into the game ;-(
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Good acting, great special effects, visually stunning and very entertaining. It is not an all-time great but I liked the movie. Some people on here fancy themselves real critics. You're not.

147674355X|5.0|My Take on this Journey:<br /><br />My heart is torn in so many directions right now.  I think everyone can relate in one way or another with Colleen Hoover's books.  This one is no different.  Sky and Holder are two phenomenal characters filled with angst, torment, guilt, and anger.  Sky and Holder meet randomly at a grocery store.  Sky notices this gorgeous looking guy with big dimples when he smiles, and she wants to melt.  She is in quite a state of intrigue, wondering how she has any kind of reaction to this guy at all.  She doesn't understand since she's never had any feelings towards any boys she's ever been with.  Sky and her friend Six, another girl who goes against the grain, act as if they are two of a kind.  In actuality, though they have bedroom windows across from each other, and share the deed of letting boys in and out of their windows at night, Six actually follows through with the acts she is damned for, while Sky does not.  Sky can't reach her inner self.  She can't show emotion, she doesn't feel, she won't allow herself any attachments, and she never really knows why she is the way she is.<br /><br />Holder sees Sky in the grocery store and thinks he recognizes her.  He approaches her, and becomes very upset when he realizes she isn't who he thinks she is. Holder has his own emotional baggage, and guilt for things that he has had no control over, but can't come to terms with in his own life.  Together these two lock horns over and over again, while they are falling in love with each other without realizing what is happening.<br /><br />Hopeless poses a lot of moral questions, with a lot of twists and turns.  This book will have you smiling one minute, laughing another minute, and sobbing with the heart wrenching content.  By the time you finish this story, you will feel like you lived this life through these two characters.  Ms. Hoover will show you the horrifying time line of events, through the characters eyes, and you will be completely devastated for these two young adults, and never forget them.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book, and it left an ache in my heart.  I give this book 5 heart wrenching stars.
B009CPGHDI|4.0|Her music is catchy and her personal perseverance is admirable to learn about. The messages within some (I said some) of her songs I suppose is subject to personal opinion but I guess that's what makes her so interesting. A worthy glimpse into this current pop star's life back in 2011 for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very cool and great for children like 7 and up but I had to sync the app just update it.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because of all the rant and rave about 50 shades of grey. My seven year old could have done a better job with creative writing and imagination. I am so upset I cant even finish the book for how poorly written it is. I cant understand why all these English writers have the same one track mind. An unimpressionist VIRGIN girl meets a wealthy Knight in Shining Armour Prince and they ride off into the sunset.  Pure f--kery. No research, purely written no thing. How the hell Christian Grey becomes a billionaire at age 26 an adopted son of a Therapist and forgot what his father does. And she being a virgin so willing to have all these haneous things done to her in a flip. Poorly and dumbly written.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|What's not to love?  Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart.  Just a fun, lighthearted movie and much better than the remake.  The audio and video on this movie were good and I enjoyed every minute of it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I agree with review saying The Room has a MYST-like quality. Aid to use the hints a tiny or two-hour it's all right there. Observe, observe, observe. Anxiously await next game. Well worth the price.

193700788X|2.0|If I could sum up this book, it would be a resounding meh. I tried. I really did. I just wanted it to end. the writing was not horrible, but there was no more feeling, no more oomph. It was a slow, drawn out wrapping up with all the characters and simply slamming the door on the world of Sookie for good. We have seen similar books in the series - you know the ones - it takes forever to finish, or you are tempted to sling the book against the wall because you want something, anything to happen. I was hoping for more in this last installment, but no.<br />Perhaps the series should have ended sooner so that we could have had more twists and turns. This may have simply been a victim of its own success.<br />This book starts out not in Sookie's point of view, but the point of view of a few shady characters. It was as if we were being set up in a grand theatrical version of the very last of Sookie. It was different, and I rolled with it, knowing this was probably something done deliberately to set the mood.<br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />So, everyone has been complaining about who Sookie finally ends up with. Really? you mean you missed the weak plot? the fifteen steps back Sookie takes, giving a whole new meaning to dumb blond? The way all the characters are all nice and neatly swept away for good or bad? So I've read a lot of 'hairier' stuff and was hoping for a little more craziness, but I know Charlaine Harris' style is not that. But unfortunately, it didn't seem she gave us too much in Dead Ever After.<br />I knew the relationship with Eric was never going to work, and I had speculated that he would die the great death in this last novel. Nope, he hooks up with a queen to better himself. But on the bright side, Pam does get the Sheriff's job and that in itself could be a phenomenal spin off series.<br />A lot of characters were brought in - so much that I was reminded of the finale of Seinfeld. I though to myself, what other characters is she going to dig up and bring forward to fill up the story?<br />Amelia was weak and one dimensional - more should have been put into her character.<br />Berry the Bellboy - oh how I wanted to know more about him. He takes a pretty huge role in this book, yet we still hardly know a damned thing about him! Physically, all we know now is he's filled out a bit.<br />Alcide and Quen make a short appearance, making sure we all know that they are now wonderfully happy with their newest girls.<br />Bill is still hanging around like a nervous teenage horn dog hoping to hook up with another vampire or even a short fling with Sookie.<br />So, I've complained. A lot. But there is some good stuff in there as well.<br />I loved the fact Arlene bit the big one. She had it coming. How it was executed (no pun intended) not so much.<br />And the last and final part - who Sookie finally finds happiness with. Well, it has always been my suspicion.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I listen to it when I want to feel happy! I love Pharrell and his MJ inspired disco sounds. Love it!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It is a very fitting albeit, sad ending. Doesn't wrap up every question from the previous books but it gives you the feeling that it doesn't have to. Makes it feel very natural, you don't have all the answers in life either.
B000002KHH|5.0|The masters of reality,  love, love, really love.  Everything about this product is great, especially the content.  Great vendor, good work.  I will use you again.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|They don't bother telling you this, but you can't set up a Chromecast if your router isn't uPnP-cabable. Unfortunately, AT&T U-Verse's 2WIRE gateways are not. I'm extremely disappointed that they don't care enough to inform customers about obstacles that render their device completely useless.
6305754969|4.0|Remake of Rio Bravo with a different supporting cast, but still a good John Wayne movie. Bla, Bla, Bla, Bla.

B00005V9IL|5.0|This is one of my favorite newer movies.  As a person who usually buys movies of the 40's and 50's,  I love this for my collection.
B005LAII80|5.0|I've never read any of the Judge Dredd comics and I know very little about Judge Dredd, but this has become one of my favorite action movies! It has a 80's action movie feel to it and in a good way. My only regret about this film is I didn't see it while it was still in theaters.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Product was delivered a day rly and undamaged.<br />The quality of this 3D, CD, is as good as seen in the theater theater .
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Action packed and hilarious! One of the best DC comic based movies I've ever seem. You will not be disappointed by this film. Looking forward to the sequel.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Although I truly enjoyed the book and learned some things about Mr. Tesla, I was hoping for more information on him. The ebook was 30% complete before it ever got to him. I still appreciate his genious but want to learn more about Mr. Tesla.
6304493681|3.0|I was underwhelmed by every aspect of this animated feature.  The plot held very little intrigue (when it could be understood).  Cybernetic cops are after an unseen villain called The Puppet Master.  Several dubious agencies on the fringe are also involved.  But not much in the way of suspense is maintained.  Everything is handled on an apathetic level.  All the characters are uniformly flat (in more ways than one).  One character does more than just bare her soul (Major Motoko Kusanagi), at the most bizarre moments she suddenly strips naked and carries on with her duties that apparently just involve a lot of shooting, running, and dodging bullets, when she's not standing stock still and carrying on internal conversations.  Half of this film is stationary.  Just when you think you're dealing with a glitch in your DVD player, something moves.  For an animated film, very little of it is actually animated/active.  The backgrounds are fixed, there's little action to be had until a scene shifts to a shootout.  It's all rather blas&eacute;.  To make matters worse, there are two extended, as in very long, musical interludes (one's a song, the other's just noise passing for music; both are arbitrary to the plot).  I know this is supposed to be a hallmark Anime film but I've seen (and kept for future viewing) better examples.  This film doesn't nearly provide as much adventure and excitement as it claims on the DVD cover.  But Siskel & Ebert did give it \\"two thumbs up!\\"  And there is a legion of fans.  I'm just not one of them.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game keeps itself interesting and that is half the battle with my short attention span! the variety of gamelets is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game even though it's frustrating sometimes. It keeps you thinking searching, it's like playing detective. I liked it so much I finished it in one day, couldn't put it down
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|is awesome game you have to play it and get it to don't think it's a stupid game just buy it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great running game! Has missions and I don't think you'll have to spend too much to get extra stuff, if anything at all.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This guy is a zealot,fraud.He says he has a PHd in history...Not! I looked this guy up. He is a Muslim that has one goal<br />and that is to bash Jesus, the son of God. Why does he hate us so much.Many facts are nothing but lies. If you like<br />fiction you will not mind all the none truths he has in this book. Enjoy the read if that is the case.
B00BDSRBXM|5.0|After Depeche Mode, OMD is a favorite band of mine. The music is really good but I first got hooked on the early stuff (Enola Gay ect...), with that being said the older stuff by OMD is better. I am not saying the new CD is bad or anything because it is not, just that I prefer the older music.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If I could give 4.5 stars I would. Tina Fey is an excellent story teller - I laughed out loud throughout.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|So far I have watched 5 and 1/2 seasons of Dexter over the course of 2 months and the Third season was my favorite.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I like the game.  Designed for android.  However, there is no skip option unless you've earned a skip.  I was doing okay until I timed out then it took me back to the beginning of that section.  So I had to start the puzzles over.  Now I'm stuck in the robot puzzle and can't play the game.  So not much fun...more frustrating.  Glad it was free or I'd be asking for a refund.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark does it again... you can't put the book down til you know&#34;who done it&#34;!  i would recommend this book to any mystery lover.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|How do you play this game? Any suggestions? Unfortunately for me I don't know how to play any of the games on my kindle.....I'm sad because of this. No game playing for me just all reading... enjoy.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|One of the best games out there , runs smooth, New tracks &amp; vehicles periodically with updates. Lots of tracks and as far as vehicles go there's a variety form an ATV, snowmobile, to an 18 wheeler big rig .  It's a blast to play.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Half the movie is like a music video (I mean that in the best way possible), Tron Director Joseph Kosinski recruited M83 to do the soundtrack for this film, just as he got Daft Punk to 'score' Tron Legacy. The music goes together so well with the absolutely incredible cinematography, and to top it all off, the visuals are so good, you will actually feel like you have escaped to another world. As for the story and acting, both good, but the visuals are infatuating enough, they alone are worth the price of admission.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I like this app because it is so much easier to go on Youtube and you don't have to search the web for the Youtube website.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The writers and producers, actors, have really gone out of there way to make a quality show.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B009JBWOU0|3.0|not so much but its oky .it doesnt work on my laptop but other than that i like to much
B005MMYBXI|5.0|One of the best series I've seen.  Effects and Graphics are superb.  Story line was excellent.  Looking forward to purchasing next set.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a simple calculator, this rates among  the best. For what it is (not a scientific calculator)  it is a great calculator that is very user friendly. A great app for whatever you need it for! !!
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game is very time consuming you would have to play game every day at least every 2 hours. this game is really great though don't  get me wrong its too time consuming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I've always wanted my own horse, and playing this game really makes me feel like I'm taking care of my own. I would definitely recommend this game!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Totally addicted! I am a bingoahlic, LOL. First place I go to when I pick up my kindle. I have told my friends and family about this great game.
B005LAII80|5.0|Note: This is NOT the Sylvester Stallone film.  Please, for everyone's sake, just pretend that the Stallone film never existed.  Wipe it from your memory and watch this as a completely unrelated film.  Which it is.  Stallone is to Judge Dredd what Adam West is to Christopher Nolan's Batman.  Same character, different worlds.<br /><br />As everyone knows, Dredd flopped miserably at the box office.  Which is deeply unfortunate, because immediately after watching this, I found myself intensely craving a sequel and mourning that such a well-made, entertaining, highly watchable film (with visual flair to burn) failed to find a broad audience.  I did an online rental of this, and immediately after watching it, I watched it again.  I never do that.  And having watched it twice in a row, I now want to purchase it.<br /><br />This is not pretty Hollywood action porn.  This is gloss-free, gritty, intense, and unrelenting, reminiscent in both tone and quality of Mad Max and The Road Warrior (which were, not coincidentally, action films made outside the usual Hollywood bubble, at modest budgets).<br />A dirty, dangerous world punctuated by the occasional burst of high-technology (the \\"Lawgiver\\" pistol).  Well-executed dystopic vision of the near-future.  Different, but all too believable.<br /><br />It is a little sad to me that Zach Snyder's uber-noisy, somewhat repetitive and disappointing Man of Steel gets to make money hand over fist, while Dredd languishes (perhaps thanks to guilt by association with the Sylvester Stallone abomination that preceded it).<br />Anyway, even if Dredd didn't make a lot of money, at least we can honor deserving films here on Amazon by taking the time to write positive reviews :-)
B00CWVFVUE|4.0|Not great but definitely good.  Glad to know amazon has such a selection. Another good movie that defines how far hollywood can go.  At least it's not another remake!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I had just read the book and was browsing Amazon when I saw that I was eligible for Amazon Prime and could watch this movie for free.  I have watched it, my wife has watched it and I have seen it twice more since the first time last May.  I can't wait for a similar film or a sequel to this one!<br /><br />Tom H.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love it. Very addicting! Must watch in order. Meghan Markle is beautiful. Harvey is a great character. The show has multiple story lines going on which is nice. Keeps it from being too predictable.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Nanny McPhee returns to provide some country and uppity kids 5 lessons.  Plus, Aggie is all grown up but - SPOILER ALERT - Maggie Smith is wonderful especially when she sits on a fresh cow pie!  If you enjoyed the first Nanny McPhee you'll like this one, too.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this game for my child, but ended up playing it myself. Not only do my children and I love this game but I've caught my husband playing this a few times as well.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I was given Bared to You by a friend and fell in love with Crossfire! Gideon and Ava are two people who are so alike yet different that they shouldn't fall in love; but as the reader you are always fighting for them in you own right. This series has had me laughing, crying, screaming, etc. I absolutely love Sylvia's writing!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The cheat is if you lose then go to home screen on your device and turn it off (works on kindle fire)
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Ok, maybe it was actually a mini-series.  The point is, if you don't own a copy, you're a doofus.  It doesn't get any better...
B0063GORYU|4.0|... from playing so much Spider! What a great game! It's so darn addictive that time slips away while I play ..
B00957T6X6|4.0|George R. R. Martin writes explicit details, makes you &#34;see&#34; the images clearly. The details do make up a great deal of what I've read so far.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|only bought because we missed season 4 love the sons they are awesome if you like drama and motor cycles you will love this
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is written like a diary.  The book has many twists and turns it's one that you can't put down it's really good.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|After a first season that was good overall but also a little inconsistent, the second season of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is an improvement over the first one. Here, the writing is significantly sharper. The plots are also less outlandish (which is good for a sitcom about theoretical physicists), and the characterization is stronger (especially for Sheldon).<br /><br />While season one had occasional great episodes in a bunch of episodes that were mostly just good, this season is more consistent in terms of quality. Interestingly, the episodes with the most unfunny-sounding plots ended up being the best ones. \\"The Terminator Decoupling\\" is a great example of this. It takes place almost entirely on a train, and has only one real plot. It's a standout episode of the entire series, mainly for its smart writing and unique structure. Another one is \\"The Monopolar Expedition,\\" in which the physicists go to the Arctic and find the place they're staying at to be strangely familiar. Included in this one are also some fan favorites: \\"The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,\\" named by TV Guide as the 60th best television show episode of all time, even though there are better ones in my opinion. \\"The Euclid Alternative,\\" with everybody's attempts to get Sheldon to learn how to drive.<br /><br />This DVD set has a little more than season one when it comes to DVD extras. At least there's a gag reel (which pretty much every DVD set should have, come on), although some fans may be a little irritated that the cuss words in it are censored.<br /><br />Best episodes: \\"The Lizard-Spock Expansion\\" and \\"The Terminator Decoupling\\"<br /><br />Season grade: B+
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Expect to be entertained  This movie was enjoyable and just fun to watch  You know there will be a sequel.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I absolute love this series.  Lena Headly is fantastic and makes an outstanding Sara Conner....Summer Glau is a Great Terminator.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|This is a must read for anyone interested in delivering top performance. Magnificently written with stories that jump off the page. The author connects  disparate  activities to demonstrate how the lowly checklist can dramatically improve results.
B0052GACNM|5.0|We saw the special on tv and decided to purchase the CD. It's a really interesting music format with performers stepping out of their &#34;usual&#34; musical roles. We enjoy the CD a lot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought there was an excellent effort made creating the right atmosphere, appearance and sound in the game.  While it may be an &quot;expensive&quot; game, I thought there was plenty delivered for the money spent.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Very good movie, wish that more info was giving on the well been of the family now. Also wanted to know if she lost her leg or not.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love this book--and especially the epilogue...how LM shows us glimpses of what could have been in the lives of her characters.  It is one of those books that live on in your heart--and will be in my favorites collection, pages worn from constant reading (or, it would be if it weren't only on my digital library--damn, gonna have to get a paper copy too).
B0095P33IW|4.0|Love this because it provides so much background for thor, hulk and ironman. Plus the WWII setting/era is a feel that adds challenges to the techy nature of superhero films. One of my faves.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I'm a light casual user, so I don't have some of the  issues more hard core players do.  Overall I really like it.
140006922X|5.0|This book is excellent!!! I think I've found my new canon on Jesus of Nazareth. Most accurate telling to date.
B009G41CG2|4.0|When I run out of possible moves and I'm right down to the end of matching the tiles It Ticks Me Off!!  I go right back and try again.  And again.  And again!  Frustrating yes, but you think next time I'll beat it.  What's great about this game is it gives you different configurations, so it's not the standard pyramid.  You can select any style puzzle and try to beat it.  It's not time so no pressure, it's not tiny so you can't see the tiles, and it's addictive.  I've won several different configurations but there are 2 of them I JUST CAN'T BEAT!!  Excuse me.  This Mahjong game gets a thumbs up.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I am sooooo in love with this app but oh no!! I'm stuck!!! How in the world do you get passed Level 37???!!!<br /><br />This app is so creative and mind jolting - I am a lover of puzzles so to get to use paint/colors is a bonus!!!!<br />If you're questioning whether or not you should try this app; YES!!!!! It is totally worth it!!! GO FOR IT!!!!!!
1416972242|5.0|Great sequel, very exciting! Fun to read. If you liked City of Bones, this book won't dissappoint! It continues the story with more of Clair's stylish imagination and some good plot twists.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A friend said this was her favorite book ever & now it is mine. Finished it in 2 days. The characters are very real, the info about the flowers interesting. It's the kind of book that can't easily be put down.
B00001OH7T|5.0|It was an album that I had years ago but with better sound.  If you liked David Bowie you will love the album.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I bought it for my wife and ended up liking the movie. I never read the books, never was a big fan of the franchise. I did like the LotR series and this fit in very nicely tying the movies together well. I will watch any more that they make. I was entertained.
0345803485|2.0|It was a bit too raunchy for my taste and it demeans women.  It showed women in a very bad light.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I really liked Dave Grohl's eye for film making. I think he has transitioned from &#34;Justa drummer&#34; to a real artist who can do anything he sets his talents to. The movie seems to be really two movies in one. The first part was this amazing history of Sound City. I know someone who was a regular there during its apex and he told me that the description of the place was spot on. &#34;If you could add smell-o-vision all you needed was stale coffee, old socks and stale carpet to have a full understanding of the place.&#34; The second part was documenting the recording of a lot of famous people and Dave. Little name dropping but I am OK with that. Dave has paid his dues a thousand times over and given more in a year than most musicians give in a career. I was entertained. I felt like I got my monies worth and I enjoy watching it over and over.
140006922X|1.0|Regardless if you are a liberal or conservative, there are some obvious inaccuracies in this book.<br /><br />There are 2 main branches of Christian theology - liberal and conservative.  Liberal theology teaches that the Bible has flaws and contradictions, and they generally do not believe in miracles.  Conservative theology teaches that the Bible is God's word, without flaws or contradictions, and the miracles described in the Bible did occur.<br /><br />This book falls in the category of liberal theology and should not be taken as the definitive work.  The liberal view can be seen in its statement that \\"the Bible is replete with the most blatant and obvious errors and omissions\\".  Another quote clearly indicates what the author thinks about the Bible, \\"The readers of Luke's gospel, like most people in the ancient world, did not make a sharp distinction between myth and reality\\".  So the author picks and chooses what Bible passages he believes.  And from that, you can derive any interpretation you want.  And that is his right.<br /><br />Conservatives will believe there are significant errors in the author's analysis and in this book.  For example, liberals believe the gospels were written after Rome destroyed in 70AD, in part, because the gospel of Matthew contains Jesus' prophecy of it destruction.  Since they do not believe in prophecy, they believe this was an embellishment.  However, whenever Matthew describes prophecies that were fulfilled, he always adds phrases like, `that it might be fulfilled by...'.  But in the prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction, these words are not present, implying that it was written before 70AD.  Conservative scholars believe that 3 of the gospels were written between 37AD and 60AD.<br /><br />Another flawed conclusion in the book is that Jesus was born in Nazareth.  The gospels state in several places that Jesus was born in Bethlehem and later the family moved to Nazareth where he grew up.  However, the author points to John chapter 7 as the reason he believes Jesus was born in Nazareth.  The author states, \\"Some kind of creative solution was required to push back against this criticism, some means to get Jesus's parents to Bethlehem so that he could be born in the same city as David\\".  However, if you read John chapter 7 (which you can read at biblegateway for free), it does not state Jesus agreed He was born in Nazareth.  There are other possible interpretations why He did not directly answer where He was born.  One interpretation is that He was from Nazareth, although born in Bethlehem, and that is what He meant.  This is similar to us today who state where we currently live when asked, not where we were born.  Another interpretation is that Jesus was replying to some people who knew the details of where He is from, not those with limited knowledge.  Another interpretation is that Jesus was being coy because He knew some wanted Him dead.<br /><br />But did you notice in John chapter 7 verse 27, the people said they knew when the Messiah would be there?!?!  Do you know why they believed he would be there at that time?!?!  It is because the prophet Daniel gave the exact year in which the Messiah would die.  And that happens to be the year Jesus died.  (For more info, you may want to read Dr. J. Vernon McGee's Bible Commentary, book 3 about Daniel's prophecy of the 70 \\"weeks\\".  He explains how the \\"weeks\\" are counted based on historical events.)<br /><br />Another obvious flaw is when the book states, \\"There is, however, one thing about which all prophecies seem to agree: the messiah is a human being, not divine\\".  However, this totally ignores the prophecy in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6, \\"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\\".  From this passage, we know the messiah would be born as a male child, and he would be divine.<br /><br />And another flaw is when the book states, \\"Matthew has Jesus flee to Egypt to escape Herod's massacre not because it happened, but because it fulfills the words of the prophet Hosea\\".  But the book's passage does not include any evidence that it did not happen.  The author simply states it as fact.  Some other scholars question the story of a massacre because it is not mentioned in any other historical documents.  However, Bethlehem was a small town and the incident may not be noteworthy enough for historians - just like some of America's massacres are not mentioned in history books.<br /><br />Another flaw is the book's statement that, \\"Whatever languages Jesus may have spoken, there is no reason to think he could read or write in any of them\\".  However, this contradicts Luke chapter 4 verses 16-20, \\"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.\\".  The point is that there is reason to believe Jesus could read.<br /><br />And this is just in the first 35 pages of the book.  Actually, I could have listed more items from these 35 pages.  But this sampling should be enough to make my point.<br /><br />The point is, if you believe liberal theology is correct, you will probably love this book.  If you believe conservative theology is correct, then this book is heresy.<br /><br/>For interested readers, you may want to view the 2001 video \\"Who is this Jesus, Examining the Truth About Jesus\\" by Dr. D. James Kennedy.  And you may be interested in reading volume 4 of Dr. J. Vernon McGee's Bible Commentary, for which there is also an audio version.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I loved this series. I've watched Star Trek since I was a kid and this is by far my favorite.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Clifton Chronicles are light, easy reading - I was disappointed the story didn't have more depth and that the characters weren't better developed. The third book finishes with an obvious sequel in mind but I am not enthralled enough to read the next one whenever it comes out....
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|Does there really need to be a metacritic rating on this Metal Gear Solid collection? This kinda bums me out a bit. Also, the original playstation Metal Gear Solid and the VR missions are only digital download based. This is kinda inconvenient. Wish they were on the discs.
B005QYKE2Y|3.0|The story line was okay. However, action with an okay plot, to me, is worth three stars. That's my two cents.
B009O2XY12|5.0|It's fun, and colourful, with cute characters, it's very challenging. The only drawback is running out of lives so quickly.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved Seasons 1 and 2, and Season 3 didn't disappoint!  The writer creates a setting that's historically accurate with great attention to detail, while wrapping the audience into the lives of the characters.  Can't wait for Season 4!!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Oops, I meant epic fail of an app! Now that The Weather Channel is upgraded it sucks! With the older version I was able to look at the weather without waiting 5 hours for a page to load and it didn't suck out all my battery. Sure, it's more colorful and has more detailed features but people didn't get the app because they wanted to look at differents shades of blue and sunsets they got it becase they wanted to check the weather! STUPID!!!

B0064X7FVE|2.0|Enjoyed using this app when I first got it and then it was &quot;updated&quot;.  Can't quite figure out how to use it.  Rather than having actual words on tabs to navigate, it has symbols that I'm apparently supposed to understand.  Now I can barely figure out how to use the thing when I used to use it daily.  I would prefer the old set up and am now looking for a different app to replace what it used to be. When I can actually get it to give me the forecast I'm looking for, it has been pretty good.
B005LAII44|3.0|I am frustrated at how disappointed I was when I finally got to see this movie, especially since it seemed that the movie execs at least tried to get back to the actual feel of GI Joe.<br />For instance:<br />1. The team was an elite AMERICAN military team that was, essentially, using standard military equipment.<br />2. the uniforms and costumes are a vast emprovement.<br />3. those idiotic \\"accelerator suits\\" were nowhere to be seen<br /><br />I think what bothered me was that the actors did not sell the story. For instance, in the first, despite the liberties, I could except that Duke was Duke, Scarlett was Scarlett, the Baroness was the Baroness, etc. In this one, I didn't see \\"Roadblock\\", I saw Dawne the Rock Johnson. I didn't see Flint, I saw some expendable background character.<br /><br />Snake-eyes at least had a better uniform that lacked the lips of the first movie. Even so, Ray Park did a better job channeling Snake-Eye's character in the first, despite the ridiculous costume.<br /><br />And Blind Master was just awful. He did not mesh well into the film at all. They should have had Snake-Eyes and Jinx going after Stormshadow on their own initiative, and not had their old ninja clan involved at all.<br /><br />Still, not a total waste and I would not mind a third, as long as they take the good from both (characters that can sell the story from the first, and the more realistic costumes/equipment from the second).

140006922X|5.0|The bedrock of evangelical Christianity is the unconditional belief that every word of the Bible is true and literal. Author Aslan is a Harvard-trained UC Riverside professor who is also a Muslim with four degrees (including one in the New Testament), a scholar of religions, and fluency in biblical Greek who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades. He contends this is irrefutably false because the Bible is replete with blatant and obvious errors and contradictions - just as one would expect from a document written by hundreds over thousands of years. His subsequent two decades of rigorous academic research has made him a more genuinely committed disciple of Jesus of Nazareth than he ever was of Jesus Christ. 'Zealot' relies primarily on the gospel of Mark (written about four decades after Jesus's death) and materials unique to Matthew and Luke (written two decades after Mark, working independently of each other, with Mark's manuscript as a template) because they are the earliest and most reliable sources. While Paul's epistles can be dated between to some two decades after Jesus's death, he only mentions three scenes from Jesus's life and thus is a poor source. Aslan also contends that outside of the NT, there is almost no trace of Jesus - the earliest and most reliable non-biblical reference comes from the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus; unfortunately it is also fleeting, at best.<br /><br />Aslan tells us that the first century was full of countless prophets, preachers, and messiahs delivering messages of God's imminent judgment. There are only two hard historical facts that we can confidently rely on - that Jesus was a Jew who led a popular movement in Palestine, and that Rome crucified him for doing so. (Aslan also points out that crucifixion at that time was reserved for those fomenting insurrection, and that the two crucified with him were seen similarly guilty - the term 'bandit' was the most common term for such.) However, when combined with what we know about that era (thanks to the Romans) we see Jesus as an illiterate peasant with great charisma who became a zealous revolutionary swept up in the political/religious turmoil of the time, with little resemblance to the gentle shepherd image cultivated by the early Christian community. His most pivotal moment was the cleansing of the Temple, an event that led to his arrest and execution. He and his followers break open cages holding animals, kick over the tables of the moneylenders and money changers, and makes a whip out of cords and starts beating people. Why did the gospels seek to transform Jesus from a revolutionary into a peaceful spiritual leader with no interest in any earthly matter? Almost every gospel story about Jesus was composed after the Jewish rebellion against Rome and the subsequent slaughtering of tens of thousands in retaliation. This more peaceful version was a Jesus the Romans could accept, and they did so three centuries later.<br /><br />Ancient Nazareth in lower Galilee had less than 100 Jewish families, no roads, no synagogues, no public buildings, and a single well. Homes consisted of a single windowless room divided in two - one side for the family, the other for livestock. Its flat roof was used for praying, and sleeping during the hot summer. Every Nazarean was a farmer. This is likely where Jesus was born and raised, and he was know throughout life simply as 'the Nazarean.' Only Matthew and Luke claim Jesus was born in Bethlehem, yet they too repeatedly refer to him as 'the Nazarean.' Mark mentions nothing about either Jesus' birth or resurrection. Stories about his birth and childhood are conspicuously absent from the earliest written documents. As interest in Jesus increased after his death, an urgent need arose among some early Christians to address his birth in Nazareth. The reason - Jewish detractors used that to prove Jesus could not have been the messiah as the prophecies required he'd be bornin the same city as David. For Luke, the answer came via a census. However, the sole purpose of a census was taxation based on property in the place of residence, not one's birthplace. Matthew's account of Jesus' flight into Egypt to escape Herod's massacre of all the sons born in/around Bethlehem is not corroborated by any of the many history sources of the time - Jewish, Christian, or Roman. Matthew needed Jesus to come out of Egypt for the same reason he needed him to be born in Bethlehem - to fulfill the prophesies and place Jesus in the footsteps of the kings and prophets before him (Hosea 11:1). This was important because Jesus had failed to fulfill the most important of the messianic prophecies - the restoration of Israel, yet still had to be recognized as the 'anointed one.'<br /><br />Nazareth had no schools, and an estimated 97% of the Jewish peasants could neither read nor write, having only a rudimentary grasp of Hebrew. Whatever languages Jesus may have spoken, there is no reason to think he could read/write any of them - hence, Luke's account of Jesus at the (nonexistent) synagogue in Nazareth reading from Isaiah, or the 12-year-old Jesus debating fine points of Hebrew scriptures are more concoctions.<br /><br />Despite Catholic doctrine of Jesus' mother perpetual virginity, both the gospels and letters of Paul reference his having at least four brothers, as did the historian Josephus. Jesus also had an unknown number of sisters, also mentioned in the gospels, but not named. Neither John nor Paul even hint at a  virgin birth - only Matthew and Luke, leading to speculation he was illegitimate. This is fueled by a neighbor asking (Mark 6:3) 'Is this not Mary's son?,' contrary to tradition of linking an individual to his father. Aslan contends it is unlikely that Jesus and his brothers would have worked as carpenters in small, mud-hut dominated Nazareth - instead, he contends it more likely that they'd gone to Sepphoris, a day's walk away, and worked to restore that larger and richer city after the Roman's had leveled it in retribution for prior rebellious acts.<br /><br />The gospels portray Pontius Pilate, Roman-appointed governor of Jerusalem as a righteous, weak-willed man overcome with doubt about putting Jesus of Nazareth to death and eventually pushed to do so by local Jews. Fiction, says Aslan - Pilate was best known for extreme depravity and total disregard for Jewish law and tradition. During his tenure he eagerly and without trial sent thousands of Jews to the cross - so many that the people lodged a formal complaint with the Roman emperor in Rome. Jesus was crucified because his messianic aspirations threatened Rome's occupation of Palestine and his zealotry endangered Temple authorizes.<br /><br />Without the resurrection (not documented within the chronicles of the time), Jesus' claim to be the messiah collapses. By the time such stories were written, six decades had passed, the evangelists had heard most every conceivable objection to the claim, and were able to counter them in their writings.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Aslan's Jesus is an essentially political figure, a revolutionary killed because he challenged Roman rule, who was then mysticized by his disciples and divinized by Paul of Tarsus.in the same city as David. For Luke, the answer came via a census. However, the sole purpose of a census was taxation based on property in the place of residence, not one's birthplace.

0812993845|4.0|I've read a number of Kinsella books and they are all pretty hairbrained, but fun when you're in that sort of a mood. But I find I enjoy them best as audio books.<br /><br />What may come across as an annoying time waster in a sit down read session can be a lot of silly fun when I am listening to it while I do my housework. The narrators on these last few Kinsella novels have been EXCELLANT! And that does add to the experience.<br /><br />I would have been a lot less pleased had I spent the hours reading 500 pages of madcap, but as an accompaniment to household chores this silly adventure was just the ticket.<br /><br />I found the lead female characters interesting and some real thought provoking themes running through it. There are a lot of times I would have liked to slap these people...but that's a given with a Kinsella novel. The end was rather \\"convenient\\" but I suppose there was no where else to do with it.<br /><br />I would actually love a sequel where we see Lottie planning her wedding!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Very fun. Would give a 5 if you didn't have to replay levels if time runs out.<br />Overall a good puzzler.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|First off, I am not into a lot of tween/teen movies based on books. I never read or saw Twilight, and only saw the first 2 Harry Potter movies.  My 11yr old daughter read the hunger games books and I was the only one in the family willing to go see this with her.  It was a good movie.  If you know anything about the story, it is certainly a weird one, but it translated into a movie well enough.  Some of the themes are a little mature for kids, (teens hunting and killing kids as entertainment), but it was not a graphic movie at all.  The violence was kept off screen for the most part.  As for the DVD, it was high quality, worked and had a fair amount of features.  I look forward to seeing the sequal to the movie with my daughter.  I will probably bring my 10yr old daughter also.

B005LAII08|5.0|I bought this for my 2 daughters and they love it.  I love that it showed an empowered female who didn't need a man to save her from a dragon or bear or whatever.  Otherwise, the quality is up to disney standards. Lots of bonus features, bells and whistles.  Great for kids, worth watching for adults.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|Got this for my husband who is an avid Sudoku fan. Plays this constantly on the tablet. He really likes it. It shows up big (great for us over 50 people) and easy on the eyes. It gives you clues if you want it, makes very easy, easy, hard, and very difficult (my terminology, not theirs.) I don't play, so only going by watching my husband and asking him about it. But, he is always playing it, so It's a 5 star for him!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it. It is likeable.  Like is something this is.  To like something is to have liked this.  Enjoy the difficulty of the likeness.

B007R21JJK|4.0|It didn't even reached the bios, so I thought it was an installation error and remove the whole pc and started all over again, getting the same result. I've been looking for solutions online and found that this motherboard has already thrown the same error to several people and the final solution with Gigabyte tech support is to change it because the card is defective. The Amazon return policies indicate that devolution or refund applies within the next 30 days after purchase, so I can not return the product and it either works well! I am very disappointed with this brand.

If you liked lemmings, you will like this.  However, there seems to be a bug.  I can no longer get into the game...a pop-up keeps telling me that the program has stopped working.  This would be a 5 star game, but you have to be able to play it to rate it that.  So, until this is fixed, I salute have to give it a bad rating.
1419705644|4.0|I was very excited when I first heard this book was being made. I've been a huge AT fan since the show began and was hoping the book would be more like an actual encyclopedia of the Land of Ooo. I didn't get what I wanted but it's still pretty math!<br /><br />I think I would have much preferred the book be written by a scholar/historian living in Ooo. At times Abadeer's personal point of view gets boring and repetitive. This is especially evident in the A-Z mini-bio section where some characters are described simply by how useless Abadeer thinks they are and not giving any useful info about them. Also, his choice of vocabulary will have many kids frequently running to their parents to find out what his words mean. That can also be a plus for teaching new words, though.<br /><br />The sections I enjoyed most were the ones not written by Abadeer or sections where he isn't talking about the characters. BMO's manual is weird, but just the right amount. Ice King's hand drawn fan fiction and character cards are spot on. Abadeer's Novelty Spells and Curses is reminiscent of the ads you'd find in old comic books. Also, having Finn, Jake and Marceline's comments in the margins is pretty funny.<br /><br />The truth is, if you're an AT fan you've probably already bought this book. While I would have liked a more comprehensive guide book to Ooo with more detail, I think this book would be especially great for kids (as long as you don't mind helping them with the ten cent words) and fans that came to the show later who might not know as much about the setting.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This long epic adventure tale brings the families into focus.  Interplay among the families is very important to the plot.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|No directions on how to play the game, what is the goal, etc. I want my money back; but, it was probably free. I want someone to remove it so I don't have to look at it!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie is good, but a bit confusing if you don't know about the characters and have not seen the films leading up to this one. It's a fun movie.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|The Hard Way was typical Reacher and that's a good thing.  I like the fact that Jack Reacher fails a few times in this story and almost one time too many.  He seemed to be playing &#34;catch up&#34; right up to the end.  Lee Child has done, his typically great job, in developing not only a plausible and believable plot but some neat characters along the way.  I learn something about the rough and rugged world each time I read a Lee Child book and this was no exception.  I also deeply appreciate the effort to keep his books readable by all audiences while at the same time not giving up one iota of realism.  Another &#34;homer&#34; Lee, keep up the &#34;hard hitting&#34; reaching for the bleachers every time.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Matilda is a family favorite. Mara Wilson is convincing in her role and the supporting cast is perfect. It's enjoyable for all ages.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show!  We highly recommend getting out the popcorn and settling in for a good show.  The characters are really well developed and the plot is always interesting.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This movie ties in nicely with the original Wizard of Oz. There are no glaring conflicts, so it enhances the experience of both movies. James Franco is good in this role. The monkey steals the show and James Franco interacts hilariously with him. On a down note, the witches' varying accents takes away from the plausibility of their characters, especially of the evil sisters. Kids probably won't notice, though. I especially liked the Kitschiness of the scenes. It was reminiscent of the original Wizard of Oz. The scenes were fantastical and cheesy and very entertaining. The story followed the principles of the original film and offered nice, but not overtly, modern elements.<br />I can't give it 5 stars because it wasn't the blockbuster I wanted it to be, but it was still a worthy and satisfying prequel.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Awesome show. Great characters/actors. Some of the best funny moments during the best times. Give it a try today! Awesome!
B000FC1LOC|1.0|admittedly, this is a troubling subject - would really hate to be in that family's shoes - definitely, not a happy ending - could not relate
B0053O89XI|5.0|This show is amazing.  Everyone needs to watch it! So many hilarious moments and the actors are perfect! Awesome show!
B002O1XIN4|3.0|Not bad first 2 alblums.  Metal play works for them well but music written is mediocre at best and they have 12 year kids playing their songs on youtube.  Test of time will tell if they have it and I hope they step up their game on new alblum to be released in august.<br />I'm a classical guitarist and haven't listened to metal sice 90s but they definitely caught my ear.
B00DU73T08|4.0|I read this book when it was first released, so I'm not sure if the movie was exactly the same as the book.  I enjoyed the both book and the movie because of the character development.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|For some reason this did not completely download and now it says I have the game but cannot play it, delete it or anything, I can't even reinstall it....any idea what I should do??
B00DM0YE9S|3.0|This movie had a good story line, which was based on a true story.  There were some flash-back scenes that were a little confusing at first, but could easily be realized as the movie progressed.  There was some action, but since it took place on a submarine there is only so much you can do.<br /><br />In general, it was an &#34;okay&#34; movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was awesome and I loved it you should totally buy this app. It I..so realistic. Really fun do not hesitate to  buy this app
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|loved every season, did not like having Matthew die at the end.  Can't wait for Season 4. Also love Anna and Mr. Bates.
B00457X7IQ|5.0|I chose this rating because it is written beautifully. It is full of suspense and romantic.<br />I really liked how it was written, I loved everything about it. I loved the love, the fights, the secrets and the truth.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|Great movie I've seen it several times....and just wanted to revisit it again. Nice to see Jim carrey  in a serious role.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was kinda hard but still a good game if you don't want boring then get this game it will be good
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Love Morgan Freeman, not a big Tom Cruise fan at all, but he did a really good job in this.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Takes way too long to do some of the puzzles. I don't want to spend hours trying to solve them. I' have a life. I don't want to spend it on one game.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Fascinating read given that he wrote it in 1964.  Basically predicted the internet, ipad, and a host of other advancements in technology.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie reminds me of the Dirty Dozen. Take a bunch of washed up Hollywood action film actors, put them in an action film and show them doing what they built their careers doing- an action film!!! Throw in some inside jokes, mix it up with some silly repartee and blow up as many things as possible- without our heroes very getting hurt!!! Some of these actors just need to retire.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|Absolutely in love with this cd. It took me a long time to buy it, despite having heard all of the songs a long time ago. It was nice to buy online because for some reason, this cd has not been anystore that i've went to including Walmart, FYE, Target, etc.. Cd has some scratches on it and the case was roguhed up a little bit. CD 5/5
B005TBN3EU|2.0|The guys that made the first film in this franchise didn't put any effort into making this sequel. This is a lazy film- period. Shame on the guys who made this film, they basically took the original story changed the location and made minor modifications to the characters. This is why people stay away from the movie houses. Viewers should be refunded for this travesty.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It had much more detail than the movie. Also, I liked all the depth of the characters.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Nothing bad to say about this movie. It was gripping and engaging. Standard revenge type movie with requisite action in the form of explosions, fights and scowling bad guys. Not to mention great scenery, it was good vacuous entertainment.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This is another Cruise vehicle, but one that is very entertaining. I know nothing about the character and the book it is based on. However the movie is a good introduction to the story of Jack Reacher. The film gets a bit tiresome, but all in all winds up being a decent film.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Wow, ACTION,ACTION,and more ACTION, this movie was like Transformers on steroids.My 13 year old son who lives Transformers and Godziila absolutely loved this movie and asked to get it when it comes out on Bluray-don't be swayed by these negative reviews.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the modern day Bond- no if and buts about this notion. This was a fun movie with all the bells and whistles of the Bond franchise- I was not disappointed. I watch Bond films to be entertained, enjoy a far fetched but decent story and experience the best action sequences a movie can buy. Yet experiencing all of what I said without being insulted, please suspend by disbelief intelligently. I am not looking for Shakespeare in this franchise, but smart fun and I am so happy the makers do not disappoint.

B000OMD4BG|5.0|Looking back at the life of Elliott Smith is very much like remembering the similar existences of Nick Drake or Kurt Cobain. Intensely creative singer/songwriters who prolifically sputtered out great music like roman candles shooting  bright colored balls of light into the sky that fill you with emotion and then unexpectedly die out leaving you amazed that a  roll of burnt cardboard created such visual delight. To this day there is still an element of disbelief  I carry  inside when I think especially of Cobain or Smith. As if their horribly violent deaths were somehow a staged hoax and they are hiding out somewhere, still  waiting for the winds of inspiration to blow so they may write their next song. The thread that bound these artists together, that led to their untimely deaths was not only their shared drug and alcohol abuse but also their intense dissatisfaction with life, their struggles with depression and social anxiety. However one cannot imagine the works of either of these artists devoid of the pain, sadness and darkness that permeated their songs . Elliott Smith's music and his tortured heart and soul  were  intricately interwoven and inseparable from one another. I can still see the sad image in my head of Elliott  Smith in his ill fitted white suit  playing  &#34;Miss Misery&#34;  at the 1998  Academy Awards  in front of an audience that stood for everything he hated. He  meekly whispered out his powerful song to the self consumed audience that hung on him , like visitors at the zoo hoping an exotic bird  will make some strange sound, and in that setting  his  song became meaningless. His personal agony was never meant to be cause for celebration even if it made it onto a popular soundtrack for a  big money movie. For that very reason the strength in the music of Elliott Smith lies less in the genius of his musical arrangements and compositions and far more in his ability to touch all of us who share a similar emotional response to being human. I couldexpound for hours about why New Moon is Better than Roman Candle is better than XO  ad infinitum,  but what would be the point? The songs are all cut from the same emotional cloth and  we as outsiders attaching various values to them are nothing but a great disservice to his creation. So a kind word of advice to those of you curious enough to explore the dark but so very human world created in the songs of Elliott Smith would be to be ready to receive and not take, leave your ego, expectations and pre existing musical preferences at the door and enter open hearted. &#34;Sometimes I feel like only a cold still life<br />Only a frozen still life that fell down here to lay beside you.&#34;

B005IU1OMA|5.0|I have watched practically all the snowboarding movies out there and in my personal opinion this is by far the best snowboarding movie to date!!! PERIOD<br /><br />It was a enjoyable experience to watch it on Blu Ray!! Very nice pictures and great scenes of nature topped with great snowboarders doing their tricks!! Travis is particular is an amazing dude to watch!!!<br /><br />I think if you want to watch a snowboarding movie!!1 Start right here and never look back!!<br /><br />The best part I liked about the movie is that unlike some movies I have watched were the preference is to the snowboarders (who are in the movie) personal habits, feelings etc. Not this one. This movie is about snowboarding with a few inputs here and there from the athletes. In reality its hard to make a movie without the athlete comments but this one just laid it out perfect!
B003L77GH4|5.0|I really love it because i love vampire diaries.<br />Photos inside was really good.<br />And I loved how it showed what that episode was about. The inner part was better than season 1
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|This is a cute little game.  It makes you think, but once you get the hang of it, it isn't very difficult.  I actually thought it got a little tedious toward the end, but I enjoyed it for the most part.<br /><br />The one thing I really didn't like was that if you quit the game, it won't remember your sound preferences the next time.  So don't start it in public without headphones.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Great movie and the quality was great too!  I really like being able to rent movies from Amazon.  Quick and easy ! +
0812982622|4.0|This author has a remarkably interesting way of telling a very harsh story in a way that makes the characters and how they survive believable yet unfathomable. The story moves quickly and portrays the recent Kim Jong-il era in its most frightening and suppressive domination over everyday life imaginable.  Seeing the main character Jun Do accept his fate becoming a master at several inhumane professions makes this book a page turner and head shaker at the same time.
1781162646|5.0|Much more of an amazing coming of age story than the supernatural crime story it's marketed as. King has something of a history of writing about adolescents that are forced to grow up by facing their fears (It, Stand by Me, many more) changes it up a bit here. He used the voice of a sixty-something facing retirement who is looking back on the extraordinary year that influenced the man he is more than any other. It's a year of loss, lifelong friendships, fear, love, and lessons never to be forgotten. The story is so richly detailed and full of real characters that it's hard to believe that Joyland and its inhabitants are a total work of fiction. Only a writer of King's experience and talent could make such a book feel so alive.

B0092EE5HY|5.0|GRRM is a good writer. Period. Science fiction or fantasy - his skill at telling a story is always shining. Tuf Voyaging is a 'fixup', taking short stories and lumping them into a book. It works here. Big time.<br />His descriptions are just detailed enough to tweak your imagination to fill in the picture. He doesn't have to break the story line for the reader to see the scene. Yet, they are detailed enough so the scene in your mind's eye to be consistent and developed throughout the book.<br />Good story, fun characters and good technicals<br />I would really like to read some more non-fantasy from him

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very similar to temple run but the creatures added a very good twist. This game is about people who do street art getting caught by the police. I personally like this because in temple run you die every time you lose the game on subway surfers you only get caught by the police. Also this game lets you do your own thing more you can change track almost any time you want. But throughout this whole thing my favorites part of the is the missions. Missions are were you do certain thing or collect certain forms to move on to the next level. Subway surfers is a fun game that most everyone will enjoy.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book does a great job of checking all of the boxes necessary for an inspirational athletic narrative, but it's also so much more. McDougall finds a way to showcase the joy that running gives so many people and inspires the reader to find it as well.

0446572985|5.0|NOTE:  I received a free Advanced Reader's Copy of this book from the publisher.<br /><br />This is the first novel I've ever read by author David Baldacci, as I don't typically gravitate towards books about assassins and the like.  And in fact, the first several chapters of THE INNOCENT did not particular grab me.  The reader meets Will Robie, who we quickly understand to be a trained killer for the US government.  In these early pages, we follow Will on several missions and also catch glimpse's of Will's spartan home life.  Again, the beginning of the book neither engaged me in the story nor endeared me to the main character, but it WAS important, as 1) it explained much about Will as a person, and 2) it provided several clues which would be key much later in the novel.<br /><br />Will is surprised when his next mission is actually close to home, right within DC, and when he goes to make the hit, he is even more surprised to discover that his target is a government agent--something that had NOT been part of his advance intelligence.  The hit goes wrong, and when Will puts his escape plan into motion, his path crosses with that of Julie, a 14-year old girl also on the run, as her parents have just been murdered.  The bus that Will and Julie are on blows up, moments after they exit--but which one of them was the target?  Will is assigned to work with the FBI in an attempt to begin to unravel the growing mystery surround him and Julie.<br /><br />The plot definitely gets a bit complicated as the mystery deepens.  The whole thing also felt somewhat James Bond-ish, from Will's premier skills to his extravagant escapes to his supervisor, known only as the \\"Blue Man.\\"  Still, once Will and Julie met up, I was thoroughly engaged in the story, and was definitely invested in what happened to them both.  Plus, I felt that the confusion nicely wrapped up the major plot points--perhaps a bit implausibly, but this is fiction, after all.  In the end, because I found this book entertaining and mostly enjoyable to read, I would give it 4 1/2 stars.tertaining and mostly enjoyable to read, I would give it 4 1/2 stars.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Horror movies are a dime a dozen and rarely rise above mediocre. \\"The Conjuring\\" not only rises above the fray, it places itself amongst the best horror films ever made.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. The Perron Family moves to a new house in rural Rhode Island. They have five daughters and are on a budget. Small, odd things begin to happen in the house. They grow in size and frequency to the point the family knows something is seriously wrong. Much of the odd occurrences seem to center around their daughter Christine. They contact Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) to come and help them out. The Warrens show up, investigate and recommend to the Vatican to do an exorcism. But before that can happen things get so out of hand the warrens must perform the exorcism themselves.<br /><br />This is one scary movie. The structure is classic. Things start slow. All is well as the family tries to reorient themselves with their new surroundings. Small stuff happens and is shrugged off. Said stuff escalates to the point it can no longer be ignored. Now things reach a fever pitch and all hell breaks loose. There are a few things that work here. First is the script. The family is at the center. You meet them. You like them. So when the doo-doo hits the fan you feel for them. You want them to make it out of this in one piece. Then there's the acting. The adults are all veterans and do outstanding jobs in their roles. It's nice seeing Lili Taylor in a high profile role. She's been more of a cult actress over the years. The kids also do a swell job. They feel like family but each has their own face so there is no confusing them. Then there's the direction. I saw James Wan's \\"Saw\\" and liked it well enough, but that didn't dig nearly as deep as this. He's really honing his craft. There are a few things that succumb to cliche and others that could easily be considered overwrought. There are also a few jumps scares, but they're magnificent jump scares. Overall thoughhe's outdone himself.<br /><br />My guess is (my hope is) this goes down as one of the all time great horror classics.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who liked Khaled Hosseini's works.  He has proven to be is a great writer.  There was just a bit of confusion in the writing as it jumped back and forth in time, but read carefully, you get it.  Liked The Book Thief Better, but this is quality literature.  A great read.  I read it with a girlfriend at the beach and the two of us had a constant book club discussion as we read it.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have used my new Google Chromecast HDMI streaming media player with excellent results on my Kindle Fire HD streaming Netflix to my TV. The best part of this is that for streaming the Netflix app it does not actually stream from the Fire HD using battery life, etc. Once the connection is made to the TV on the Chromecast device the Chromecast itself goes out the the Netflix site to stream the movie and the Fire HD has only a a small connection to the Google device to control volume, pause or stop.<br />At $35 this is a great deal if you have the Fire HD and want to watch Netflix videos, or YouTube, on a bedroom, den or guest room TV that has an available HDMI port and good WiFi connection.

0760336954|1.0|I bought this book because I am designing a car from the ground up, a serious project. This book should be titled \\"How to STYLE cars like a Pro\\".  It is about styling ONLY.  There is no useful info on engineering, dimensions, passenger packaging, power and speed, structures, or any of the other things needed for a car to work. Near zero engineering, and plenty of the author's opinions that I often do not agree with.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and some of his favorite cars are far from mine.<br /><br />This book is ONLY about looks, and is directed to STYLISTS only.  It is written from the viewpoint of someone who is well paid to draw impractical cars that will most likely never be built. If that is your goal in life, get it. But the job opportunites in that field are limited. While it is certainly useful as a history of automobile styling,and has lots of \\"pretty pictures\\", it touches on only ONE aspect of car design.<br /><br />I bought this because I got it cheap.  Looking through other Amazon reviews and previews, my money would have been VERY much better spent getting the book \\"H-point\\", which I will do shortly.

B000FC130E|4.0|I've read a number of excellent Neil Gaiman novels previously (e.g., \\"Anansi Boys\\", American Gods\\" ) and most recently a YA novel assigned to my son for a summer course called \\"Heroes and Villains\\".  Since the other assigned reading for the course was \\"The Odyssey\\", I thought I ought to give \\"The Graveyard Book\\" a look.  It too, was great, so I started looking for some older Gaiman.<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is Gaiman's first full-length solo novel, published in 1996. It was a novelization of a BBC series that he wrote, and published concomitantly with the TV broadcast.  Neverwhere describes the adventures of Richard Mayhew, an everyman Londoner with a normal everyday life that one day encounters an injured girl named Door on the street.  After he takes her home to mend, everything changes.  Door disappears, and Richard finds that he is no longer recognized by his fianc&eacute;, acquaintances or coworkers, he returns to his apartment to find it rented by another couple, and discovers that he has become a denizen of \\"London Below\\", a magical, phantasmagorical parallel universe to the London Above that he used to live in. He goes in search of Door to find out what has happened and how he can return his life to normal.<br /><br />Neverwhere is a kind of Alice in Wonderland modern fantasy or fairy tale. There are some very dark elements (a couple of seriously deranged and sadistic assassins, a fallen Angel, some heat and soul-sucking vampires) as well as some (sort of ) nice guy allies looking out for Door, Richard and friends as they make their way through London Below.<br /><br />I'm not sure that this is suitable for very young readers, but for adults and tween- or teenagers, it is a modern fantasy with great elements of good and bad, as well as some lessons on morality, reality and identity and individuality.  It may not be as polished as some of Gaiman's later works, but it clearly shows the great potential he had as a novelist, even 17 years ago.<br /><br />I am told that there are several versions of Neverwhere around. I'm not sure which one I got from Amazon, but I recommend it nonetheless.<br /><br />J.M. Tepperd that there are several versions of Neverwhere around.

B005HEVIJQ|4.0|The last season of Voyager was very good but I feel like they rushed the ending.  They did a decent job of preparing you for it but it just seemed the last couple of episodes were just not quite right.

B006OCM0G0|3.0|I have really enjoyed this app. However, the app limits you to the size of your restaurant because it does not allow you to enlarge your restaurant beyond a certain point without having &#34;neighbors&#34; which you apparently can only get if you log on to Facebook. However, if you do not want to do that, and I choose not to, you cannot expand the size. Therefore, you quickly run out of room and cannot purchase all the fun goodies to decorate your restaurant because of this limitation no matter how many coins you earn. I believe that I am currently over $500,000 but it really does me no good as I have no more room and therefore will probably delete this app before long.

B00CSCJ09K|2.0|My first exposure to David Garrett was his album \\"Classical\\", which I enjoyed immensely. With \\"Rock Symphonies\\" I noted the beginnings of the shift from talented, serious violinist to a proto-rock star, which continues in this latest album \\"Music\\". It seems that he has become a carefully, visually packaged \\"product\\", and his music is no longer unique or even particularly skillfully executed. I do not expect to play this CD often in the future, and when I do I will be playing only a few select tracks. Being an optimist I often buy new releases by artists who might be evolving in a direction that does not interest me. Sometimes the new direction clicks with my tastes and all is well. Other times, as is the case with \\"Music\\", the content pretty well ends my interest in the artist/performer, and I no longer pay any attention to future releases.

B00ATP24SW|5.0|It is not very often that when a band on the level of Stratovarius switches a lead guitarist that their sound ever remains true to the spirit of the original group. And while I normally make it a point not to review something so subjective as music, I am happy to report my apprehensions about the change in lineup proved entirely unfounded. Am I convinced this was their best? No, but Nemesis does deserve credit for being one of the better overall albums, and tracks such as 'The Story Is Over', 'One Must Fall', 'Out of the Fog', and 'Castles In The Air' certainly deserve consideration for being grouped with their other superlative songs.<br /><br />From someone who did not think the title track of Elysium could ever be outdone, this entire album proved me wrong. Even considering the faults, it was truly a musical experience. More progressive, cleaner yet somehow still reminiscent of old school metal than anything I've heard in quite some time. Although if I am to look at this album in a critical regard, lyrically, I cannot rate this as highly as past efforts, but that is not to suggest any and all substance has been lost. On the contrary, the mood remained highly evocative of Teutonic lore and the lyrics went no little way in achieving that effect.<br /><br />On tracks such as 'Halcyon Days' and 'Dragons', there is the slightest amalgamation of what I would swear to be techno metal/dubstep (the same difference, really?) which worked shockigly well, though admittedly was not my favorite aspect of their updated sound. 'Abandon' and 'Fantasy' were in my estimation the weakest of the lot, as I thought they took the progressive elements too far while not achieving the same standard of vocals I expect from Timo Kotipelto.<br /><br />Despite the minor flaws, they remain incomparable to most in the power metal genre. Consider starting with 'If The Story Is Over' or 'Out of the Fog' if you are previously unaware of the band's music or prefer to begin by hearing their more traditional sounding tracks.<br /><br />If you want insipid and catchy, turn on the radio. For the rest of us who have the least bit of discernment in their musical tastes, we always have Stratovarius.itional sounding tracks.<br /><br />If you want insipid and catchy, turn on the radio.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I just finished book one in the Mortal Instruments series, \\"City of Bones\\" by Cassandra Clare. I have to admit that it was the covers of these books that grabbed my attention in the beginning. That was months and months ago. I have had them on my wish list on Amazon a long time. Finally, I acquired the first three. I read it in two days. Very well written, loved the characters. Clary, the main female character finds out that her whole life has been a lie. She meets Jace and her whole life changes. The twists and turns keep your nose in the book! Demons, Downworlders, Shadowhunters, Warlocks and otherworldly beings, you'll find them all in this volume. This is what I loved the most, the book, though filled with fighting and violence is free from perverse language and sexual content. I loved this book as an adult and am thrilled that it is \\"clean\\" enough for teens. Still this is a gritty, gutty book. I can't wait until I can start book two. I give this book a solid 5 stars.
B005LN5UOC|3.0|Charges pretty fast, it also works fine with my phone, my pc, my ps3.  I mostly got it for my ps3 for online gaming.<br /><br />I compared this to my current wireless headset, and the wireless one murders it for comfortability, mic quality, and speaker clarity.<br />[[ASIN:B005GTO07O B005GTO07O]]<br /><br />if want it for pc get a wireless one or a different set, for the phone or ps3 its passable, but still suggest u try another
B001DJ7PNW|1.0|I'll steer away from the style of the actual movie, except to say it's typical Oliver Stone. You either love his style or you don't.<br /><br />But the content, the MESSAGE of this film is atrocious. I understand that most people reading this review are already convinced there was a conspiracy to kill JFK, and I can't change that. But maybe I can convince one or two people.<br /><br />Stone isn't conducting an investigation, and he's not going for accuracy. He's making as dramatic and exciting a motion picture as he can, to sell more tickets and generate the maximum amount of publicity for the film. That was his entire intent.<br /><br />Since the movie came out there have been so many detailed examinations of the physical and photographic evidence of the assassination, this movie is almost completely obsolete even for those who disbelieve the Warren Commission's \\"lone gunman\\" explanation. For instance, the movie's discussion of the \\"magic bullet\\" (with two large adults sitting in straight-backed chairs on a flat courtroom floor) doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to how Kennedy and Connolly were actually seated in the limousine when the shot was fired. Once you factor in the exact 3-dimensional positions of the men, the \\"magic bullet\\" theory isn't magic anymore, it's just the simplest explanation that fits all the evidence.<br /><br />This whole movie is full of things like that. It's exciting and compelling film, yes. But it's nowhere close to TRUTH.

So interesting on several levels--how the main character dealt with the obstacles in her way--how adversity shapes a person--it was amazing what our past history tells us about human nature.  A good book!

B003JQLHY0|2.0|I purchased this divers watch through Amazon, via Jomashop, Everything was going well with delivery. But the only problem was the watch I ordered is not the watch I got in the box. It was the wrong watch. Also the battery died after a week,<br />By the time I pay the shipping company to ship and receive I might as well live with it and get the right band and<br />the battery replaced , if that's the problem.<br />I will never make another purchase from Jomashop again.

1607066017|3.0|I like Vol. 1, but I find the dialogue juvenile and the pace too fast for believable character development. I was expecting a bit more given the reviews here and elsewhere, but I think it's a pretty good read.
193700788X|3.0|It seems like everyone who reads genre fiction has read at least one Sookie Stackhouse book. For me, Sookie was my introduction into urban fantasy and genre.  This series was something I had never encountered before. Having now read my way through a library of urban fantasy and paranormal fiction series I know that Sookie isn't unique and wasnt even innovative. But I still appreciate the introduction into adult urban fantasy. So thank you Charlaine Harris, thank you for that.<br /><br />Bill, Quinn, Eric, Sam, Alcide, and Hunter's dad (whatever his name is, sorry I started not caring enough to pay attention). I am guessing any reader of this series knows what that list represents. Sookie's hopefuls, Sookie's possible mates - and various fans' favorites for Sookie.  So this book - Dead Ever After - is the book to supposedly end the series and wrap up Sookie's story (except now there is another book coming out this fall??).  What happened to the fun storyline of Sookie Stackhouse?  Why are so many readers looking forward to the end? Somewhere along the line the world Sookie was in and the supe wars she fought it (too many to count, too many to remember) became less important compared with who would Sookie end up with.<br /><br />What did I like about Sookie?  Why was a I reading her for so many years?  To be honest, I liked the routine. We all love to make fun of how Sookie cleans, runs errands and cookies. But the truth for me is that I enjoy reading that stuff. Harris has her own tone and I do like it. I liked the world.  I loved how evenly and interestingly Harris blended her supe world with small town Louisiana. What I don't like about how Harris writes is how she is not loyal to the characters she creates or the world she builds.  And that is what destroyed this series for me.<br /><br />Look I don't care who Sookie ends up with and chances are if you a reading this review you know who she chose. But, my take on the ending is that doesn't really choose anyone. Mytake is that she moved on. She chose her life. She realized she had a business she wanted to invest time in and friends and community that loved her and supported her. Sookie chose herself. I think that is great and maybe that storyline could have been great. But the way it was written wasn't great, it was only mediocre. Why? Well let me tell you!<br /><br />Inconsistent world building (I thought the blood bond was supposedly unbreakable - poof turns out it can be broken by an inexperienced witch. I thought vamps never got divorced - poof turns out they can! All the fairies are gone - poof they aren't, okay now they are realy gone andddddd now they aren't gone again - oh and they are back again.) Character destruction Amelia, Quinn, Bill, Eric, and Alcide. Each of these characters started out with one personality and ended up with another personality. The worst sex scenes ever. Reading a Harris sex scene is like having my grandma describe an amorous scene. Awkward!<br /><br />The wishy washy manner of telling the story is what really got me.  I feel as if Harris did not have a story arc in mind, she did not know where she was going, never planned on a 13 book series and would change characters (and critical world building \\"facts\\")to accomplish something in one book.  But by doing this, Harris damaged the world she had created. I am not criticizing an author's prerogative to write the story she wants.  What I am criticizing is an author who writes one story and tramples all over it in subsequent books.  I did not need Sookie to end with anyone in particular.  It is not the romance that disappointed me, it is the story arc.<br /><br />Dead Ever After was not bad.  It was just okay.  I believe I may have rated it higher (3 stars) because of how disappointed I was by the last 3-4 books in this series.  Harris told this story as if she was explaining to her readers why Quinn didn't work out, why Hunter's dad wouldn't work out, why Eric could never work out, why Alcide wasn't a choice.  It was a check list style of telling a story (who didn't appear in Dead Ever After?? Characters who are dead - and even those were mentioned or played a part.)<br /><br />In the end, I am glad I read it.  I won't read the whatever the update is that is coming out in the fall.  This was enough for me.  If you are at all interested, then I would suggest checking it out from the library or listening to the audio.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A fun and entertaining game.  Lots of fun and easy, but who likes to lose all the time.  Hours of good times.

She has always been a big fan of books in this vein of work.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, or any of R.A. Salvatore works, then this is a set that you should appreciate.<br /><br />SR
B000W8HC8I|2.0|Was eager to read this, especially with the movie coming out soon. The author at times rambled on and on and was in need of an editor. I found it hard to believe that this author experienced the extremes portrayed especially when it came to his drug and sexual escapades.  Its also became very tedious to read. I had recommended this book to several people after it was highly recommended to me, but have since told them not to bother.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|There is very beautiful scenery. I've enjoyed watching each of the discs. It came in excellent condition. These discs show the beauty of earths' wonders around the world.
B000TERG6S|5.0|This is my first buy for Jesse Cook.  I have enjoyed his releases on the radio for years and - for some unexplained reason, I've never invested in his music.  This was the ideal first buy for me.  The entire release is exquisite.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fascinating. I believed before and this supports the idea that the soul is independent of the human brain's activity. His beliefs are amazing and I also believe that the soul is able to travel to other dimensions and back.
B000069HZP|5.0|It's hard to review David Fincher's psychological thriller The Game without running the risk of giving away the twists and turns in this tense thriller. Let's backtrack a moment and consider Fincher's previous film, the harrowing Se7en. Though he had directed Alien 3 in 1992, 1995's Se7en upped the ante in the dread department. Though a great film in its own right, Se7en was, in a certain sense, a working out of ideas that came to fruition in The Game. And though Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman acquitted themselves very well in Se7en, Michael Douglas delivers a tour de force performance in The Game. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine anyone else soaking that character with as much self-loathing, guilt, arrogance and hostility. Douglas had already demonstrated his acting chops with Wall Street and Falling Down, so it's no great surprise that he was able to stand his ground against Fincher's twisting and shocking plot turns. And this plot sneaks up on you, subtle in the beginning then delivering massive blows to your emotions and sense of equilibrium. It's a testament to Douglas and Sean Penn's acting chops that they make this wild ride not only seem plausible but suffocatingly real. The first time I watched the film I remember grabbing my chair, all white knuckles at more than one point, gripped by Douglas' hallucinogenic ride. When a friend asked me what other films I'd seen that reminded me of this I couldn't honestly say. This was simply a brilliant one-off by Fincher and Douglas and a film that surprisingly, given that it relies on plot twists the viewer can't see coming, reveals subtle pleasures in repeat viewings.

B009ZQC7MY|3.0|There are several subject the series has addressed that are certainly presented with a more modern view than would have been true for then.
1439152810|1.0|I can't believe I read the whole thing. I found the story preposterous, with all sorts of ridiculous twists and turns.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:<br />Preposterous. Two people, Jimmy and Vivian, are thought dead but are actually alive. And all along Vivian couldn't have children, so how did she, reinvented as Dorothy, manage to birth Rose, Lauren and Jerry?. And how did she manage  to leave her money to Jimmy's Dad ? Even if her husband didn't get the money, I'm flummoxed how she had time to write a will naming Jimmy's Dad the heir. And Dorothy was a head case.

B00005JMEW|5.0|One of Quentin Tarintinos best works! This film is what made me fall in love with Tarantinos style of film making. Tarrantino is one of the greatest directors of out time
0143117564|2.0|I expected something different.  Perhaps this is more of a guy book.  The more I think about it I suspect  women may just not relate to the material as well.  Being a child of the 60's I really wanted to like the book but found I could not finish it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun Cuz you get a horse and you take care of it so yea play it because it is fun
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|The game is good but since it's only a demo you can only play for a certain amount of time (5 minutes).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great Nicholas Sparks book! Suspenseful and enticing! Great romance story. I absolutely LOVED IT! Recommend to everyone and anyone!
B00CCX9DUG|4.0|I have been waiting a long time for this book and it did not disappoint. The White Princess was an engaging read and Elizabeth of York a great heroine. The Cousins War series has improved with each book and I'm hoping that this is not the last book in the series (though I'm not sure who else there is to write a story about now that we have entered the Tudor period of which is the focus of many books by this author).<br /><br />The plot follows Elizabeth of York from post Bosworth (and the death of her uncle and lover King Richard III) through to the later years of her marriage to the enemy King Henry VII. The relationship and eventual affection between Elizabeth and Henry (particularly in the beginning) is a bit hard to stomach in this book, you'll need to read the book to know what I mean. The reign of Henry VII was tormented by pretenders to the throne and Gregory successfully spins a story about the conflict Elizabeth feels choosing between her husband and a boy that maybe her lost brother.<br /><br />Ultimately this is a good light read. Don't expect fact from this book, it's all fiction, just as it should be.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I've had this app on my kindle for a while. But this upgraded version is too hard to use. Not intuitive at all.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellently written due the research into all the lives of the rival  men and their wives.  Amazing letters that came to light to put this book together.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|I honestly loved this game, I really did. Then came the phantom update that can never be be downloaded. From what I'm reading online, this isn't the first time this has happened t o kindle users and most likely won't be the last. Kanye said it best &quot; gameloft don't care about kindle owners&quot;.
B00DU74U74|2.0|I'm not a Stephanie Meyer fan by any means, but I really wanted to like the story behind this. One of the great things about science fiction is the way it can often grapple with loaded philosophical questions in a way that's engaging and exciting. The plot of The Host offered a great opportunity for dealing with themes surrounding identity in a way similar to Joss Whedon's \\"Dollhouse.\\"<br /><br />The problem? Stephanie Meyer simply isn't up to the task of handling those themes. All the potential meaty bits of this story took a backseat to 2 contrived romances which were, frankly, unconvincing and unengaging. There was also little to no characterization to speak of, which made it difficult to even care about key plot points. Jamie is such a flat character that his grave illness carries no emotional import whatsoever. The audience is really given little reason to care whether he lives or dies.<br /><br />I would have loved to see an author or director with more skill try to tell this story, but this falls flat.
B005H29GSI|3.0|Due to the complicated nature of the pieces and cards some kids might lose interest after a few minutes. The quality of the material is very nice and adults seem to like it more than kids.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This book gave me an insight into the trauma of families separated by conflict. A must read for understanding the plight of refugees.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I began reading this book because of all the hype and I was instantly hooked. This woman can write! I stayed up all night reading about Amy and her husband Nick who is the prime suspect in her disappearance. I gave it four stars for the beginning and middle of the book. The ending was disappointing. &#34;That was it!&#34; I thought. I kept scrolling to see if there were pages missing. I had many scenarios envisioned for how this book would end and normally I like it when the author comes up with something unimaginable but this just seemed like she settled. I didn't predict the ending cause it was so blah. I didn't feel like the one star reviewers as if I wasted my time because of the ending. The book is very entertaining and worth checking out from the library, overdrive, or kindle. It's not the kind of book I'd read over and over again (I tend to do that with my faves) but its still worth a read.
B0080BFWAE|1.0|First let me say that this review is NOT about the movie itself.  This review is about the \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" Blu-ray of the movie.  The movie is a classic.  I've owned it on DVD for several years and have gotten much use out of it.  I was excited to see it was released on Blu-ray, and since I recently upgraded to an HDTV, I was excited to see how it looked on the \\"big screen.\\"<br /><br />I'll save you the time of having to read my entire review.  In a word, do NOT buy the Blu-ray of this movie.  You'll be better off getting the DVD version and having it upscaled by your player for your HDTV.<br /><br />I don't know WHAT they did to it, but it is a HORRIBLE transfer.  The only one that is worse than this from what I have seen in my experience, is the original 1970's Gone in 60 Seconds movie.  On that one, I expected very little in the way of a remastered transfer due to it being an old movie produced by a self-funded studio, and that's exactly what I got.  I was happy with it, because I wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />However, for this \\"Anniversary Edition\\" (and I lade that phrase with as much sarcasm and disappointment as this keyboard will allow me to slather over those words), I expected something that had been crafted with love and attention.  You know, something that would merit the phrase \\"Anniversary Edition.\\"  But no.  Instead they decide to bilk us out of more money (see \\"double-dipping\\"), and present us with this steaming pile of donkey dung pressed into disc form.  I am a fan of non-DNR'd transfers.  I don't think that the original film grain should be destroyed.  However, whatever they did to this tranfer, they not only kept the grain but ENHANCED it tenfold!  I couldn't even finish the movie.  I got about 5 minutes in and had to turn it off.  I guess their idea of a transfer is to update the fonts on the titles to make the vectors match HD standards.  That was about the only thing that I saw that benefitted from the upscaling.<br /><br />Saveyour money and buy a DVD version instead.  You'll be better off, and will appreciate the movie more.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love solitaire & golf so I get the best of each of them!! This is so much fun & addicting!! It took me a minute or two to figure out how you play, but once I did it's a breeze!! You either click on a card that is either a number above or below the card you're playing. If you have a 5, then you choose either a 4 or 6 to play on it. I will be playing this everyday!!! Download it & you won't be disappointed!!! Hurry......go get it!!!!!
B00DU73T08|5.0|This movie was reccomended by my daughter - tried it and LOVED it  Will be buying it for our home theater.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I downloaded this as the Kindle free app of the day. I like it, although most of the puzzles are a little easy (hence only 4 stars). However, it's nice that my 10 yo daughter can play with me, and the puzzles are fun, but still challenging for her.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been using this for 4 weeks and have lost 2 pounds. I am doing 4-5 days per week and I am seeing fat leaving my arms, abs, legs and hips. Just a little dissappointed that I have not lost more body weight, but I will keep at it until I do. This workout is awesome, I never sweated so much doing cardio ever! This really makes you work for your results. I highly recommend this video for any age (I'm 42 and 150 lbs.), it is great for people with busy schedules. If you can dedicate 20 minutes out of your day, it is worth it.

B002FHJ4B2|2.0|OH! I so enjoyed this when it first came out when I was a teen.....now, I find myself asking, &#34;how did I sit there so long through the mindless dialogue?&#34; ..........clearly, it was great in the 80's, not so much now!<br />YAWN!
B004SUDPWI|4.0|This movie manages to be light-hearted and serious-minded in about an as perfect manner as i have ever witnessed in the movies. Whilst dealing with the gruesome backdrop of life in a japanese internment camp during world war 2 it manages to both portray the horrors and create a feeling of jovial fun to be had. This is kind of weird, but works quite well.<br /><br />Basically, the set up is a variant on the theme of necessary order, and how to maintain it in an adverse environment. The movie gets this point across quite well, whilst it also makes what this order is focused on something that is genuinely bad for the people the constructors purport to represent.<br />This juxtaposition is well thought out, and the hopelessness in the choice between staunch opposition and collaboration is handled seriously, yet with a light and humorous hand. Never is there a scene that is too serious for an off hand humorous remark, and the movie is made much better by it. If this theme were to be presented without the humour, the movie would have been a bleak, bleak show.
